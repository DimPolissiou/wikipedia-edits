Which tunnel this accident occurred in is unknown, as multiple news sources were inconsistent when reporting the location of his demise.\n\nA local paper, the Illawarra Mercury wrote of the trial surrounding the death in its June 15, 1895 article;\n\n\u201cThe jury returned the following verdict \u2013 \u2018That deceased came to his death by injuries accidentally received on the 13th of May through being run over by a passing train \u2013 No.67 \u2013 in No. 2 tunnel on the Illawarra line.\u201d<ref name=\"auto6\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132301619 |title=A FATAL ACCIDENT. |newspaper=[[Illawarra Mercury]] |volume=XL |issue=109 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 June 1895 |accessdate=17 May 2019 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, the extended Helensburgh rail area had 8 tunnels in total. The No. 2 tunnel was also known as the Cawley tunnel and is located to the north of the old Helensburgh station.\n\n\u201cHe had stayed rather late in the township and on going home had to pass through the tunnel where the accident occurred.\u201d <ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nThe Cawley township was in the opposite direction of Hailes\u2019 home in the suburb of Clifton. At the time, Cawley railway station was being used to receive goods for work on the railway, and to deliver supplies to the colliery. The township of Cawley had begun to disappear in 1888 when the Cawley post office had closed down.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  The reason for its closure was a lack of business; 7 years had passed since work had finished on that section of the line and workers had moved further down to work on the Otford and Clifton sections of the line. Although it is possible he was visiting a friend who remained in the township, there is speculation that Robert having died in the Cawley tunnel is incorrect.<ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite web |url=https://www.helensburgh.com.au/death-in-the-railway-tunnel/ |title=Death in the Railway Tunnel |last=Piggott |first=Ian |website=Helensburgh |access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere is reason to suggest that he may have travelled through either of the two Lilyvale tunnels, or the Metropolitan or Helensburgh tunnel. West Helensburgh had started to become a developed town and could have been a reason for him to go through the Metropolitan and Helensburgh tunnels. It is also argued that like many residents at the time, he may have used either of the two lilyvale tunnels which lead to the neighbouring suburb of Bulgo. An article from the Australian Star, published on June 14, 1895 gives an alternate view of events to its Illawarra Mercury counterpart.\n\n\u201cA wire from Wollongong says: \u2014 News is just to hand of a train fatality which occurred in the first tunnel this side of Helensburgh this morning\u2026\u201d<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article227115580 |title=RAILWAY FATALITY. |newspaper=[[The Australian Star]] |issue=2295 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=14 June 1895 |accessdate=17 May 2019 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAs this news came from Wollongong, then \u201cthis side of Helensburgh\u201d would refer only to tunnels south of Helensburgh; which would discount the Cawley tunnel. Interpretations of this may mean any of the 4 tunnels aforementioned.\n\nAnother article by the South Australian Chronicle, published on June 15, 1895 stated\n\n\u201cHe had apparently gone to sleep on the line in a short tunnel as he was returning home late last night from work.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93979481 |title=INTERCOLONIAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[South Australian Chronicle]] |volume=XXXVII |issue=1,921 |location=South Australia |date=15 June 1895 |accessdate=17 May 2019 |page=21 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nLocal historians believe \u2018short tunnel\u2019 would imply that he either met his death in the Lilyvale tunnel or the Helensburgh tunnel, which are both 80 metres in length.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> However, \u2018short\u2019 is relative and it remains a mystery as to the true location of Hailes deathplace.\n\nAnd yet out of these conflicting reports, a local legend that one can hear the footsteps of Robert Hailes trying to outrun the trains was conceived. The main Metropolitan tunnel and its companion the Helensburgh tunnel have since become a great source for ghost-tour operators in the south coast.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Glow worms==\nAfter the Metropolitan tunnel was restored, a colony of glow worms began to inhabit the inner part of the 24 metres stretch of excavated tunnel. These glow worms, also known as [[Fungus gnat|Fungus Gnats]] are famous for their bioluminescence.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/science-environment/2016/06/lighting-the-night-glow-worms-around-australia/ |title=Lighting the night: glow worms around Australia |website=Australian Geographic |access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref> It is the blue-green light that the worms emit, that attracts many visitors to the tunnel.

The tunnel now comes under the NSW Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901, which makes trespassers liable to prosecution.\n\nAs of publishing, the tunnel is closed due to flooding and to let the glow worm population recover.\n\n==External links==\n{{Navbox\n | name  = Navbox/doc\n | title = [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]]\n | listclass = hlist\n\n | group1 = Location\n | list1  =\n * [[Helensburgh, New South Wales]]\n\n | group2 = Wikivoyage\n | list2  =\n * [https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Helensburgh_(New_South_Wales) Helensburgh (New South Wales)]\n\n | group3 = Major landmarks\n | list3  =\n * [[Symbio Wildlife Park]]\n\n[[Bald Hill (Australia)]]\n\n[[Helensburgh railway station]]\n\nHelensburgh Glow Worm Tunnel\n\n[https://www.svtsydney.org Sri Venkateswara Temple]\n }}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|New South Wales}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Railway tunnels in New South Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{Hatnote|For the current Helensburgh station, see [[Helensburgh railway station]]}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=June 2019}}\n{{underlinked|date=June 2019}}\n}}\nThe '''Helensburgh Glow Worm tunnel''' is a disused train tunnel in [[Helensburgh, New South Wales]] that has become a popular tourist attraction due to its heritage status,<ref name=\"auto\"/> haunted history<ref name=\"auto1\"/> and most notably, its [[glow worm]] population.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>[[File:Helensburgh Tunnel (227543415).jpeg|thumb|Helensburgh Tunnel (227543415)]] It is owned by Crown Lands and taken care of by a community group called Helensburgh Landcare, who in early 2019 restricted access to the tunnel for the conservation of the glow worm colony.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite news |last=Pearson |first=Andrew |date=3 July 2018 |title=Authorities confirm why Helensburgh glow worm tunnel was fenced off |url=https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/5500746/authorities-confirm-why-helensburgh-glow-worm-tunnel-was-fenced-off/ |newspaper=[[Illawarra Mercury]]|access-date=13 May 2019 }}</ref> Because of flooding and to help the glow worm population recover, as of February 9 2020, the tunnel has been CLOSED for an indefinite period.\n\n==History==\nThe Helensburgh Glow Worm tunnel was opened on January 1, 1889 and formed part of the town's [[Helensburgh railway station|first railway station]].

Which tunnel this accident occurred in is unknown, as multiple news sources were inconsistent when reporting the location of his demise.\n\nA local paper, the Illawarra Mercury wrote of the trial surrounding the death in its June 15, 1895 article;\n\n\u201cThe jury returned the following verdict \u2013 \u2018That deceased came to his death by injuries accidentally received on the 13th of May through being run over by a passing train \u2013 No.67 \u2013 in No. 2 tunnel on the Illawarra line.\u201d<ref name=\"auto6\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132301619 |title=A FATAL ACCIDENT. |newspaper=[[Illawarra Mercury]] |volume=XL |issue=109 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 June 1895 |accessdate=17 May 2019 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, the extended Helensburgh rail area had 8 tunnels in total. The No. 2 tunnel was also known as the Cawley tunnel and is located to the north of the old Helensburgh station.\n\n\u201cHe had stayed rather late in the township and on going home had to pass through the tunnel where the accident occurred.\u201d <ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nThe Cawley township was in the opposite direction of Hailes\u2019 home in the suburb of Clifton. At the time, Cawley railway station was being used to receive goods for work on the railway, and to deliver supplies to the colliery. The township of Cawley had begun to disappear in 1888 when the Cawley post office had closed down.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  The reason for its closure was a lack of business; 7 years had passed since work had finished on that section of the line and workers had moved further down to work on the Otford and Clifton sections of the line. Although it is possible he was visiting a friend who remained in the township, there is speculation that Robert having died in the Cawley tunnel is incorrect.<ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite web |url=https://www.helensburgh.com.au/death-in-the-railway-tunnel/ |title=Death in the Railway Tunnel |last=Piggott |first=Ian |website=Helensburgh |access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere is reason to suggest that he may have travelled through either of the two Lilyvale tunnels, or the Metropolitan or Helensburgh tunnel. West Helensburgh had started to become a developed town and could have been a reason for him to go through the Metropolitan and Helensburgh tunnels. It is also argued that like many residents at the time, he may have used either of the two lilyvale tunnels which lead to the neighbouring suburb of Bulgo. An article from the Australian Star, published on June 14, 1895 gives an alternate view of events to its Illawarra Mercury counterpart.\n\n\u201cA wire from Wollongong says: \u2014 News is just to hand of a train fatality which occurred in the first tunnel this side of Helensburgh this morning\u2026\u201d<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article227115580 |title=RAILWAY FATALITY. |newspaper=[[The Australian Star]] |issue=2295 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=14 June 1895 |accessdate=17 May 2019 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAs this news came from Wollongong, then \u201cthis side of Helensburgh\u201d would refer only to tunnels south of Helensburgh; which would discount the Cawley tunnel. Interpretations of this may mean any of the 4 tunnels aforementioned.\n\nAnother article by the South Australian Chronicle, published on June 15, 1895 stated\n\n\u201cHe had apparently gone to sleep on the line in a short tunnel as he was returning home late last night from work.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93979481 |title=INTERCOLONIAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[South Australian Chronicle]] |volume=XXXVII |issue=1,921 |location=South Australia |date=15 June 1895 |accessdate=17 May 2019 |page=21 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nLocal historians believe \u2018short tunnel\u2019 would imply that he either met his death in the Lilyvale tunnel or the Helensburgh tunnel, which are both 80 metres in length.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> However, \u2018short\u2019 is relative and it remains a mystery as to the true location of Hailes deathplace.\n\nAnd yet out of these conflicting reports, a local legend that one can hear the footsteps of Robert Hailes trying to outrun the trains was conceived. The main Metropolitan tunnel and its companion the Helensburgh tunnel have since become a great source for ghost-tour operators in the south coast.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Glow worms==\nAfter the Metropolitan tunnel was restored, a colony of glow worms began to inhabit the inner part of the 24 metres stretch of excavated tunnel. These glow worms, also known as [[Fungus gnat|Fungus Gnats]] are famous for their bioluminescence.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/science-environment/2016/06/lighting-the-night-glow-worms-around-australia/ |title=Lighting the night: glow worms around Australia |website=Australian Geographic |access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref> It is the blue-green light that the worms emit, that attracts many visitors to the tunnel. It is also this light that lures the glow worm's prey \u2013 small invertebrate, for example mosquitoes.\n\nIn June 2018 a fence was constructed at the base of the entrance to the old station after\n\n\u201cThe [NSW department of Industry] received reports of damage to heritage items on the platform, and there are concerns about the impact of light, noise and pollution on the glow worms in the tunnel,\u201d.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nThe glow worm populations have been reduced<ref name=\"auto3\"/> in recent years by spectators to the tunnel interrupting the worms feeding processes by visitors\u2019 beaming flash lights onto the roof of the tunnel, sending up flares and firecrackers for photography purposes, and graffitiing the inner tunnel wall.\n\nToday, access to the tunnels is at the discretion of the Helensburgh Landcare group.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The group blocked entrance to the tunnel for 4 weeks in January 2019<ref name=\"auto4\"/> during breeding season in an effort to allow the glow worm population to recover from years of poor treatment.\n\nWhen the gate is locked, visitors are prohibited by law from entering the tunnel. The tunnel now comes under the NSW Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901, which makes trespassers liable to prosecution.\n\nAs of publishing, the tunnel is closed due to flooding and to let the glow worm population recover.\n\n==External links==\n{{Navbox\n | name  = Navbox/doc\n | title = [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]]\n | listclass = hlist\n\n | group1 = Location\n | list1  =\n * [[Helensburgh, New South Wales]]\n\n | group2 = Wikivoyage\n | list2  =\n * [https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Helensburgh_(New_South_Wales) Helensburgh (New South Wales)]\n\n | group3 = Major landmarks\n | list3  =\n * [[Symbio Wildlife Park]]\n\n[[Bald Hill (Australia)]]\n\n[[Helensburgh railway station]]\n\nHelensburgh Glow Worm Tunnel\n\n[https://www.svtsydney.org Sri Venkateswara Temple]\n }}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|New South Wales}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Railway tunnels in New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Astdb", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helensburgh_Glow_Worm_Tunnel"}

The pageant was founded as Miss Albania in 2002, until rebranding as Miss Universe Albania in 2006. Since 2006, winners of the competition have competed internationally in [[Miss Universe]], while some runners-up have competed in [[Miss World]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lola2.jpeg|thumb|230px|[[Floriana Garo]] represented Albania in the Miss World 2012 beauty pageant.]]\nAlbania debuted at Miss Universe in 2002 with the Miss Albania organization as the official franchise holder. The organization held national pageant yearly up into 2006. Beginning in 2007, the franchise license was given to the then official photographer of Miss Universe, Fadil Berisha who happened to be from Albania. At this point Fadil created the \"Miss Universe Albania\" organization and would held occasional yearly national pageant or in some cases, designate a participant to represent Albania at Miss Universe. Fadil would continue to be the national director until 2013.\n\nIn 2014 Eduart Deda acquired the Miss Universe franchise license in Albania and consequently also the [[Miss World]] franchise license. The company would held yearly national pageants where two winners were crowned to compete at Miss Universe and Miss World. The company would held the license of Miss World until 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the Miss World license was given to Vera Grabocka who was previously the national director of Miss World in Albania between 2006-2013,  while Eduart Deda only held the Miss Universe license.\n\n==Implementation and complaints==\nThe beauty contests are carried out by two different organizers: Vera Grabocka has been competing in the Miss Albania competition since 1991, and Petri Bozo and his Deliart Club have held the Miss Shqiperia elections important. Politically, Petri Bozo is associated with the Socialist Party, Vera Grabocka with the Democratic Party. The finalists take part in the election for Miss Europe, since 2002 also for Miss World and Miss Universe.\n\n[[Albanians]] from [[Kosovo]] can also be eliminated at the Miss Albania competition: Venera Mustafa became Miss Kosovo and Miss Albania in 1999.

The pageant was founded as Miss Albania in 2002, until rebranding as Miss Universe Albania in 2006. Since 2006, winners of the competition have competed internationally in [[Miss Universe]], while some runners-up have competed in [[Miss World]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lola2.jpeg|thumb|230px|[[Floriana Garo]] represented Albania in the Miss World 2012 beauty pageant.]]\nAlbania debuted at Miss Universe in 2002 with the Miss Albania organization as the official franchise holder. The organization held national pageant yearly up into 2006. Beginning in 2007, the franchise license was given to the then official photographer of Miss Universe, Fadil Berisha who happened to be from Albania. At this point Fadil created the \"Miss Universe Albania\" organization and would held occasional yearly national pageant or in some cases, designate a participant to represent Albania at Miss Universe. Fadil would continue to be the national director until 2013.\n\nIn 2014 Eduart Deda acquired the Miss Universe franchise license in Albania and consequently also the [[Miss World]] franchise license. The company would held yearly national pageants where two winners were crowned to compete at Miss Universe and Miss World. The company would held the license of Miss World until 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the Miss World license was given to Vera Grabocka who was previously the national director of Miss World in Albania between 2006-2013,  while Eduart Deda only held the Miss Universe license.\n\n==Implementation and complaints==\nThe beauty contests are carried out by two different organizers: Vera Grabocka has been competing in the Miss Albania competition since 1991, and Petri Bozo and his Deliart Club have held the Miss Shqiperia elections important. Politically, Petri Bozo is associated with the Socialist Party, Vera Grabocka with the Democratic Party. The finalists take part in the election for Miss Europe, since 2002 also for Miss World and Miss Universe.\n\n[[Albanians]] from [[Kosovo]] can also be eliminated at the Miss Albania competition: Venera Mustafa became Miss Kosovo and Miss Albania in 1999. In the same year she participated for Albania and the Miss Europe election. [[Agnesa Vuthaj]] was a member of the Miss Kosovo in 2003, a member of the Miss Albania in 2004 and a candidate as a member of the Miss World in 2004 and the Miss Universe in 2005.\n\nMiss Universe Albania was launched in 2002 to become a participant in the Miss Universe international competition.\n\nEnkeleid Omi and his agency Alba-Media have been leading the competition for Miss Earth Albania, its winners and Miss Earth since 2005.

Lewisite immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and is a strong [[irritant]] and [[blistering agent]]. Due to its arsenic center, lewisite may also cause problems similar to arsenic poisonings like stomach ailments and low blood pressure.\n===Inhalation===\nInhalation, the most common route of exposure, causes a burning pain and irritation throughout the respiratory tract, [[nosebleed]] (epistaxis), [[laryngitis]], [[Sneeze|sneezing]], [[cough]]ing, [[vomiting]], difficult breathing ([[dyspnea]]). From one acute exposure, someone who has inhaled lewisite can develop [[chronic respiratory disease]].<ref name=\":0\"/> In severe cases of exposure, can cause fatal [[pulmonary edema]], [[pneumonitis]], or [[respiratory failure]]. \n===Ingestion===\nIngestion results in severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and tissue damage.<ref name=\":0\"/> Those exposed to lewisite can develop refractory [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) known as Lewisite shock, as well as some features of arsenic toxicity.<ref>Chauhan, S.; Chauhan, S.; D\u2019Cruz, R.; Faruqi, S.; Singh, K. K.; Varma, S.; Singh, M.; Karthik, V. Chemical warfare agents. Environ. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2008, 26, 113-122</ref> Lewisite causes physical damage to [[Capillary|capillaries]], which then become leaky, meaning that there is not enough blood volume to maintain blood pressure, a condition called [[hypovolemia]]. When the blood pressure is low, the kidneys may not receive enough oxygen and can be [[Kidney damage|damaged]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Eye Exposure===\nThe results of eye exposure can range from stinging, burning pain and strong irritation to [[blister]]ing and [[Keratitis|scarring of the cornea]], along with [[blepharospasm]], [[lacrimation]], and [[Periorbital edema|edema of the eyelids and periorbital area]]. Eye exposure to lewisite can cause permanent visual impairment or blindness.<ref name=\":0\"/> The eyes can swell shut, which can keep the eyes safe from further exposure. The most severe consequences of eye exposure to lewisite are [[Globe rupture|globe perforation]] and [[Visual impairment|blindness]].<ref name=\":0\"/> Generalised symptoms also include restlessness, weakness, hypothermia and low blood pressure.\n===Chronic Exposure===\nChronic exposure to lewisite can cause [[arsenic poisoning]] and development of a lewisite [[allergy]]. It can also cause various long-term illnesses or permanent damage to organs, depending on where the exposure has occurred, including [[conjunctivitis]], aversion to light ([[photophobia]]), visual impairment, double vision ([[diplopia]]), tearing ([[Tears|lacrimation]]), dry mucous membranes, [[garlic breath]], burning pain in the nose and mouth, [[toxic encephalopathy]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[bronchitis]], [[dermatitis]], [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin ulcers]], [[Basal-cell carcinoma|basal cell carcinoma]], and [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nBasic first aid for lewisite exposure is [[decontamination]] and [[irrigation]] of any areas that have been exposed, and when necesssary [[airway management]], [[Mechanical ventilation|assisted ventilation]], and [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring of vital signs]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n[[Dimercaprol|British anti-lewisite]], also called [[dimercaprol]], is the antidote for lewisite.

Lewisite immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and is a strong [[irritant]] and [[blistering agent]]. Due to its arsenic center, lewisite may also cause problems similar to arsenic poisonings like stomach ailments and low blood pressure.\n===Inhalation===\nInhalation, the most common route of exposure, causes a burning pain and irritation throughout the respiratory tract, [[nosebleed]] (epistaxis), [[laryngitis]], [[Sneeze|sneezing]], [[cough]]ing, [[vomiting]], difficult breathing ([[dyspnea]]). From one acute exposure, someone who has inhaled lewisite can develop [[chronic respiratory disease]].<ref name=\":0\"/> In severe cases of exposure, can cause fatal [[pulmonary edema]], [[pneumonitis]], or [[respiratory failure]]. \n===Ingestion===\nIngestion results in severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and tissue damage.<ref name=\":0\"/> Those exposed to lewisite can develop refractory [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) known as Lewisite shock, as well as some features of arsenic toxicity.<ref>Chauhan, S.; Chauhan, S.; D\u2019Cruz, R.; Faruqi, S.; Singh, K. K.; Varma, S.; Singh, M.; Karthik, V. Chemical warfare agents. Environ. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2008, 26, 113-122</ref> Lewisite causes physical damage to [[Capillary|capillaries]], which then become leaky, meaning that there is not enough blood volume to maintain blood pressure, a condition called [[hypovolemia]]. When the blood pressure is low, the kidneys may not receive enough oxygen and can be [[Kidney damage|damaged]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Eye Exposure===\nThe results of eye exposure can range from stinging, burning pain and strong irritation to [[blister]]ing and [[Keratitis|scarring of the cornea]], along with [[blepharospasm]], [[lacrimation]], and [[Periorbital edema|edema of the eyelids and periorbital area]]. Eye exposure to lewisite can cause permanent visual impairment or blindness.<ref name=\":0\"/> The eyes can swell shut, which can keep the eyes safe from further exposure. The most severe consequences of eye exposure to lewisite are [[Globe rupture|globe perforation]] and [[Visual impairment|blindness]].<ref name=\":0\"/> Generalised symptoms also include restlessness, weakness, hypothermia and low blood pressure.\n===Chronic Exposure===\nChronic exposure to lewisite can cause [[arsenic poisoning]] and development of a lewisite [[allergy]]. It can also cause various long-term illnesses or permanent damage to organs, depending on where the exposure has occurred, including [[conjunctivitis]], aversion to light ([[photophobia]]), visual impairment, double vision ([[diplopia]]), tearing ([[Tears|lacrimation]]), dry mucous membranes, [[garlic breath]], burning pain in the nose and mouth, [[toxic encephalopathy]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[bronchitis]], [[dermatitis]], [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin ulcers]], [[Basal-cell carcinoma|basal cell carcinoma]], and [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nBasic first aid for lewisite exposure is [[decontamination]] and [[irrigation]] of any areas that have been exposed, and when necesssary [[airway management]], [[Mechanical ventilation|assisted ventilation]], and [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring of vital signs]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n[[Dimercaprol|British anti-lewisite]], also called [[dimercaprol]], is the antidote for lewisite.

People who were involved in the religious movement used the word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}). For further details, see the section below. Gradually, ''protestant'' became a general term, meaning any adherent of the Reformation in the German-speaking area. It was ultimately somewhat taken up by [[Lutherans]], even though [[Martin Luther]] himself insisted on ''Christian'' or ''evangelical'' as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ. [[Huguenots|French]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Protestants instead preferred the word ''reformed'' ({{lang-fr|r\u00e9form\u00e9}}), which became a popular, neutral, and alternative name for [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Evangelical===\n[[File:evangelischeVielfalt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Direction sign]]s showing ways to two different Protestant [[Church (building)|churches]] in the German city of [[Wiesbaden]].]]\nThe word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}), which refers to [[the gospel]], was widely used for those involved in the religious movement in the German-speaking area beginning in 1517.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |title=The Reformation: A History |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=2003 |author-link=Diarmaid MacCulloch |page=xx|title-link=The Reformation: A History }}</ref> Nowadays, ''evangelical'' is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations in the Lutheran, Calvinist, and United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed) traditions in Europe, and those with strong ties to them (e.g. [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]). Above all the term is used by Protestant bodies in the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking area]], such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. In continental Europe, an ''Evangelical'' is either a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or a United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed). The [[German language|German]] word ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' means Protestant, and is different from the German ''{{lang|de|evangelikal}}'', which refers to churches shaped by [[Evangelicalism]]. The English word ''evangelical'' usually refers to [[evangelical Protestant]] churches, and therefore to a certain part of Protestantism rather than to Protestantism as a whole. The English word traces its roots back to the [[Puritans]] in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.\n\nMartin Luther always disliked the term ''Lutheran'', preferring the term ''evangelical'', which was derived from ''euangelion'', a Greek word meaning \"good news\", i.e. \"[[The Gospel|gospel]]\".<ref name=OOE796>Esp\u00edn, Orlando O. and Nickoloff, James B. ''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies''. Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press, p. 796.</ref> The followers of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and other theologians linked to the [[Reformed tradition]] also began to use that term. To distinguish the two evangelical groups, others began to refer to the two groups as ''Evangelical Lutheran'' and ''Evangelical Reformed''. Nowadays, the word also pertains in the same way to some other mainline groups, for example ''Evangelical Methodist''. As time passed by, the word ''evangelical'' was dropped. Lutherans themselves began to use the term ''Lutheran'' in the middle of the 16th century, in order to distinguish themselves from other groups such as the [[Philippists]] and [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Reformational===\nThe German word ''{{lang|de|reformatorisch}}'', which roughly translates to English as \"reformational\" or \"reforming\", is used as an alternative for ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' in German, and is different from English ''reformed'' ({{lang-de|reformiert}}), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and other Reformed theologians. Being derived from the word \"Reformation\", the term emerged around the same time as ''evangelical'' (1517) and ''protestant'' (1529).\n\n==Theology==\n\n===Main principles===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|image1=Mikolow protestant church pulpit.jpg\n|caption1=Key figures of the Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther and John Calvin depicted on a church [[pulpit]].

A common consensus approved by most of them is that if a Christian denomination is to be considered Protestant, it must acknowledge the following three fundamental principles of Protestantism.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" />\n\n;Scripture alone:\n{{main|Sola Scriptura}}\nThe belief, emphasized by Luther, in the Bible as the [[Sola scriptura|highest source of authority]] for the church. The early churches of the Reformation believed in a critical, yet serious, reading of scripture and holding the Bible as a source of authority higher than that of [[Sacred Tradition|church tradition]]. The many abuses that had occurred in the Western Church before the Protestant Reformation led the Reformers to reject much of its tradition, though some{{who|date= November 2018}} would maintain tradition has been maintained and reorganized in the liturgy and in the confessions of the Protestant churches of the Reformation. In the early 20th century, a less critical reading of the Bible developed in the United States, leading to a \"fundamentalist\" reading of Scripture. Christian fundamentalists read the Bible as the \"inerrant, infallible\" Word of God, as do the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran churches, but interpret it in a literalist fashion without using the historical critical method.\n\n\"Biblical Christianity\" focused on a deep study of the Bible is characteristic of most Protestants as opposed to \"Church Christianity\", focused on performing rituals and good works, represented by Catholic and Orthodox traditions. However Quakers and Pentecostalists, emphasize the Holy Spirit and personal closeness to God.<ref>Woodhead, Linda.

This often serves as a reason for exclusion of the [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] and other movements from Protestantism by various observers. Unitarianism continues to have a presence mainly in Transylvania, England and the United States, as well as elsewhere.\n\n===Five solae===\n{{Main|Five solae}}\n{{Five solae}}\n\nThe Five ''{{lang|la|solae}}'' are five [[Latin]] phrases (or slogans) that emerged during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and summarize the reformers' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] of the day. The Latin word ''{{lang|la|sola}}'' means \"alone\", \"only\", or \"single\".\n\nThe use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation, based on the overarching principle of ''{{lang|la|[[sola scriptura]]}}'' (by scripture alone). This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible: that its teaching is needed for salvation (necessity); that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone (sufficiency); that everything taught in the Bible is correct (inerrancy); and that, by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin, believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself, though understanding is difficult, so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church (clarity).\n\nThe necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text.\n\nThe second main principle, ''{{lang|la|[[sola fide]]}}'' (by faith alone), states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation. Though argued from scripture, and hence logically consequent to ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'', this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers. Because ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'' placed the Bible as the only source of teaching, ''{{lang|la|sola fide}}'' epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to, namely the direct, close, personal connection between Christ and the believer, hence the reformers' contention that their work was Christocentric.\n\nThe other solas, as statements, emerged later, but the thinking they represent was also part of the early Reformation.\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Solus Christus]]}}'': ''Christ alone''\n: The Protestants characterize the dogma concerning the Pope as Christ's representative head of the Church on earth, the concept of works made meritorious by Christ, and the Catholic idea of a treasury of the merits of Christ and his saints, as a denial that Christ is the ''only'' mediator between [[God]] and man. Catholics, on the other hand, maintained the traditional understanding of Judaism on these questions, and appealed to the universal consensus of Christian tradition.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Matt.|16:18}}, {{Bibleref2|1Cor.|3:11||1 Cor. 3:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph.|2:20}}, {{Bibleref2|1Pet.|2:5\u20136||1 Pet. 2:5\u20136}}, {{Bibleref2|Rev.|21:14}}</ref>\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Sola Gratia]]}}'': ''Grace alone''\n: Protestants perceived Roman Catholic salvation to be dependent upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God on account of the change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one ''deserves'' salvation.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|7:21}}\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Soli Deo Gloria]]}}'': ''Glory to God alone''\n: All glory is due to God alone since salvation is accomplished solely through his will and action\u2014not only the gift of the all-sufficient [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus]] on [[Christian cross|the cross]] but also the gift of faith in that atonement, created in the heart of the believer by the [[Holy Spirit]]. The reformers believed that human beings\u2014even saints [[canonization|canonized]] by the Catholic Church, the popes, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy\u2014are not worthy of the glory.\n\n===Christ's presence in the Eucharist===\n{{Main|Eucharistic theology}}\n\n[[File:Abendmahl-1547-LC.jpg|thumb|A Lutheran depiction of the [[Last Supper]] by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1547.]]\nThe Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century. One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the [[Eucharist]]. Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic [[dogma]] of [[transubstantiation]], which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion.\n* Lutherans hold that within the [[Lord's Supper]] the consecrated elements of bread and wine are the true body and blood of Christ \"in, with, and under the form\" of bread and wine for all those who eat and drink it,{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:16|47}} {{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|11:20,27|47}}<ref>Engelder, T.E.W., [https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 ''Popular Symbolics''].

Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the [[sacrament]] but instead affirm that Christ is united to the believer through faith\u2014toward which the supper is an outward and visible aid. This is often referred to as ''dynamic presence''.\n* Anglicans and Methodists refuse to define the Presence, preferring to leave it a mystery.<ref name=\"Neal2014\">{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Gregory S.|title=Sacramental Theology and the Christian Life|date=19 December 2014|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781490860077|page=111|quote=For Anglicans and Methodists the reality of the presence of Jesus as received through the sacramental elements is not in question. Real presence is simply accepted as being true, its mysterious nature being affirmed and even lauded in official statements like ''This Holy Mystery: A United Methodist Understanding of Holy Communion.}}</ref> The Prayer Books describe the bread and wine as outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace which is the Body and Blood of Christ. However, the words of their liturgies suggest that one can hold to a belief in the Real Presence and Spiritual and Sacramental Present at the same time. For example, \"... and you have fed us with the spiritual food in the Sacrament of his body and Blood;\" \"...the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, and for assuring us in these holy mysteries...\" American Book of Common Prayer, 1977, pp.&nbsp;365\u2013366. Perhaps the best way to see it is that the Anglican view incorporates all three of the above positions and the Roman and Orthodox. The classic Anglican and Methodist view is that the bread and wine are instruments of God's Grace. Perhaps the closest that one can get to pinning down an Anglican view (they are notorious for refusing to so) are the words of St. John of Damascus, \"the bread and wine are visible symbols of a spiritual reality.\" The symbol is not empty but the visible to another reality present.\n* Anabaptists hold a popular simplification of the [[Theology of Huldrych Zwingli|Zwinglian view]], without concern for theological intricacies as hinted at above, may see the Lord's Supper merely as a symbol of the shared faith of the participants, a commemoration of the facts of the crucifixion, and a reminder of their standing together as the body of Christ (a view referred to as ''memorialism'').<ref name=\"Balmer2002\">{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall Herbert|last2=Winner|first2=Lauren F.|title=Protestantism in America|url=https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=9780231111300|page=[https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593/page/n42 26]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Protestantism}}\n\n===Pre-Reformation===\n{{See also|Proto-Protestantism|Girolamo Savonarola}}\n[[File:Muttich, Kamil Vladislav - Mistr Jan Hus na hranici v Kostnici 1415.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of [[Jan Hus]] in 1415.]]\n[[File:lollardmap.jpg|thumb|right|Spread of [[Lollardy]] in [[medieval England]] and [[medieval Scotland]].]]\n\nIn the late 1130s, [[Arnold of Brescia]], an Italian [[canon regular]] became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church. After his death, his teachings on [[apostolic poverty]] gained currency among [[Arnoldists]], and later more widely among [[Waldensians]] and the [[Spiritual Franciscans]], though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. In the early 1170s, [[Peter Waldo]] founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution. Despite that, the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy, as [[Waldensian Evangelical Church|a part of the wider Reformed tradition]].\n\nIn the 1370s, [[John Wycliffe]]\u2014later dubbed the \"Morning Star of Reformation\"\u2014started his activity as an English reformer. He rejected papal authority over secular power, [[Wycliffe's Bible|translated the Bible]] into [[vernacular]] [[English language|English]], and preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms.\n\nBeginning in the first decade of the 15th century, [[Jan Hus]]\u2014a Roman Catholic priest, Czech reformist and professor\u2014influenced by John Wycliffe's writings, founded the [[Hussite]] movement. He strongly advocated his reformist [[Bohemian]] religious denomination. He was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] and [[burned at the stake]] in [[Constance]], [[Bishopric of Constance]] in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy. After his execution, a revolt erupted. Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the [[Pope]].\n\nLater on, theological disputes caused a split within the Hussite movement. [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] maintained that both the bread and the wine should be administered to the people during the Eucharist. Another major faction were the [[Taborites]], who opposed the Utraquists in the [[Battle of Lipany]] during the [[Hussite Wars]]. There were two separate parties among the Hussites: moderate and radical movements. Other smaller regional Hussite branches in [[Bohemia]] included [[Adamites]], [[Orebites]], [[Sirotci|Orphans]] and Praguers.\n\nThe Hussite Wars concluded with the victory of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], his Catholic allies and moderate Hussites and the defeat of the radical Hussites. Tensions arose as the [[Thirty Years' War]] reached Bohemia in 1620. Both moderate and radical Hussitism was increasingly persecuted by Catholics and Holy Roman Emperor's armies.\n\nStarting in 1475, an Italian Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]] was calling for a Christian renewal. Later on, Martin Luther himself read some of the friar's writings and praised him as a martyr and forerunner whose ideas on faith and grace anticipated Luther's own doctrine of justification by faith alone.\n\nSome of Hus' followers founded the [[Unitas Fratrum]]\u2014\"Unity of the Brethren\"\u2014which was renewed under the leadership of [[Zinzendorf|Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf]] in [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]] in 1722 after its almost total destruction in the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]]. Today, it is usually referred to in English as the [[Moravian Church]] and in German as the [[Moravian Church|Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine]].\n\n===Reformation proper===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Distribution of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in [[Central Europe]] on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618).]]\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=vertical\n|width=200\n|image1=1491 Henry VIII.jpg\n|caption1=[[Henry VIII of England]], known for his role in the [[English Reformation|separation]] of the [[Church of England]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n|image2=JohnKnox.jpg\n|caption2=John Knox, who led the [[Reformation in Scotland]], founding [[Presbyterianism]].}}\n{{Reformation}}\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] began as an attempt to reform the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nOn 31 October 1517 ([[Halloween|All Hallows' Eve]]) [[Martin Luther]] allegedly nailed his [[Ninety-five Theses]] (Disputation on the Power of Indulgences) on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]] in [[Wittenberg]], Germany, detailing doctrinal and practical abuses of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], especially the selling of [[indulgence]]s. The theses debated and criticized many aspects of the Church and the papacy, including the practice of [[Purgatory#Protestantism|purgatory]], [[Particular judgment#Reformation concepts|particular judgment]], and the authority of the pope. Luther would later write works against the Catholic devotion to [[Virgin Mary]], the intercession of and devotion to the saints, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, good works, and the sacraments.<ref name=Schofield122>Schofield ''Martin Luther'' p. 122</ref>\n\nThe [[Reformation]] was a triumph of literacy and the new [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].<ref name=Cameron>Cameron ''European Reformation''{{page needed|date=March 2015}}</ref>{{efn|In the end, while the Reformation emphasis on Protestants reading the Scriptures was one factor in the development of literacy, the impact of printing itself, the wider availability of printed works at a cheaper price, and the increasing focus on education and learning as key factors in obtaining a lucrative post, were also significant contributory factors.<ref name=Pettegree543>Pettegree ''Reformation World'' p. 543</ref>}}  Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets.

After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the [[Bern]] reformer [[William Farel]], Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the city of [[Geneva]]. His ''Ordinances of 1541'' involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563.\n\nProtestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed [[Huguenots]]. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of [[Henry II of France]] in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when [[Henry IV of France]] issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official [[state religion]], and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV's]] [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg]] declared the [[Edict of Potsdam]], giving free passage to Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the [[C\u00e9vennes]] region.\n\nParallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the [[Swiss Confederation]] led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince [[Philip of Hesse]] saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the [[Colloquy of Marburg]], which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.\n\nIn 1534, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] put an end to all papal jurisdiction in [[England]], after the Pope failed to [[annul]] his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]];<ref>William P. Haugaard \"The History of Anglicanism I\" in ''The Study of Anglicanism'' Stephen Sykes and John Booty (eds) (SPCK 1987) pp. 6\u20137</ref> this opened the door to reformational ideas. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (''{{lang|la|via media}}'') between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the [[English Reformation]] came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as ''the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England''. Between 1535 and 1540, under [[Thomas Cromwell]], the policy known as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]. The [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.\n\nThe success of the [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritans|Puritan party]] dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the [[Elizabethan Age]]. The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The later Puritan movement, often referred to as [[dissenters]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations.\n\nThe [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560 decisively shaped the [[Church of Scotland]].<ref>Article 1, of the [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish Reformation'.</ref> The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation. The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament]] of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the [[Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560]], forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith. It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent [[Mary of Guise]], who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent [[Mary, Queen of Scots|daughter]].\n\nSome of the most important activists of the Protestant Reformation included [[Jacobus Arminius]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[Andreas von Carlstadt]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[William Farel]], [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]], [[Laurentius Petri]], [[Olaus Petri]], [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Menno Simons]], [[Louis de Berquin]], [[Primo\u017e Trubar]] and [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]].\n\nIn the course of this religious upheaval, the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524\u201325 swept through the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Thuringia]]n and [[Swabia]]n principalities. After the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the [[Low Countries]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]], the confessional division of the [[states of the Holy Roman Empire]] eventually erupted in the [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648. It devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25% and 40% of its population.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe \u2013 Demographics]\".

(the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'')\n* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.\n* The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power. [[Pope Innocent X]] declared the treaty \"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times\" in his bull ''{{lang|la|Zelo Domus Dei}}''.

It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism and hierarchy, it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality.<ref>Thomas S.

It gained momentum by 1800. After 1820, membership rose rapidly among [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1840s. It has been described as a reaction against skepticism, [[deism]], and [[rationalism]], although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood.<ref>[[Nancy Cott]], \"Young Women in the Great Awakening in New England,\" Feminist Studies 3, no. 1/2 (Autumn 1975): 15.</ref> It enrolled millions of new members in existing [[evangelical]] denominations and led to the formation of new denominations.\n\nThe [[Third Great Awakening]] refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in [[American history]] and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century.<ref>William G. McLoughlin, ''Revivals Awakenings and Reform'' (1980)</ref> It affected [[pietistic]] Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism.<ref>[[Mark A. Noll]], ''A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada'' (1992) pp. 286\u2013310</ref> It gathered strength from the [[postmillennial]] belief that the [[Second Coming]] of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth. It was affiliated with the [[Social Gospel]] Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]], [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]], and [[Christian Science]] movements.<ref name=Fogel>Robert William Fogel, ''The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe [[Fourth Great Awakening]] was a Christian religious awakening that some scholars\u2014most notably, [[Robert Fogel]]\u2014say took place in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while others look at the era following [[World War II]]. The terminology is controversial. Thus, the idea of a Fourth Great Awakening itself has not been generally accepted.<ref>Robert William Fogel (2000), ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism''; see the review by Randall Balmer, ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 2002 33(2): 322\u2013325</ref>\n\nIn 1814, [[R\u00e9veil|Le R\u00e9veil]] swept through Calvinist regions in Switzerland and France.\n\nIn 1904, a [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival|Protestant revival in Wales]] had tremendous impact on the local population. A part of British modernization, it drew many people to churches, especially Methodist and Baptist ones.\n\nA noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal movement]]. Sprung from Methodist and [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] roots, it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on [[Azusa Street]] in Los Angeles. From there it spread around the world, carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there. These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history, such as seen in the two Great Awakenings. Pentecostalism, which in turn birthed the [[Charismatic movement]] within already established denominations, continues to be an important force in [[Western Christianity]].\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere in the world, there has been a marked rise in the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical wing]] of Protestant denominations, especially those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream liberal churches]]. In the post\u2013[[World War I]] era, [[Liberal Christianity]] was on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the post\u2013[[World War II]] era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures.\n\nIn Europe, there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards [[secularism]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is largely responsible for the spread of secularism. Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism, attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant-majority countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2012/03/has-lutheranism-caused-secularism/|title=Has Lutheranism caused secularism?|last=Cranach|date=22 March 2012}}</ref> In North America, South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe. United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other [[developed countries]]. South America, historically Roman Catholic, has experienced a large [[Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n==Radical Reformation==\n{{Main|Radical Reformation}}\n[[File:T\u00e4uferdisputation 1525.jpg|thumb|Dissatisfaction with the outcome of a disputation in 1525 prompted [[Swiss Brethren]] to part ways with [[Huldrych Zwingli]].]]\n\nUnlike mainstream [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinist]] and Zwinglian movements, the [[Radical Reformation]], which had no state sponsorship, generally abandoned the idea of the \"Church visible\" as distinct from the \"Church invisible\". It was a rational extension of the state-approved Protestant dissent, which took the value of independence from constituted authority a step further, arguing the same for the civic realm. The Radical Reformation was non-mainstream, though in parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, a majority would sympathize with the Radical Reformation despite the intense persecution it faced from both Roman Catholics and Magisterial Protestants.<ref name=horsch>{{cite book|last=Horsch|first=John|authorlink=John Horsch|title=Mennonites in Europe|date=1995|publisher=Herald Press|isbn=978-0836113952|page=299}}</ref>\n\nThe early [[Anabaptists]] believed that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gonzalez, ''A History of Christian Thought'', 88.</ref> Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor by the use of the sword; [[Christianity]] was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Protestant ecclesial leaders such as [[Balthasar Hubmaier|Hubmaier]] and [[Melchior Hoffman|Hofmann]] preached the invalidity of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion ([[Believers baptism|\"believer's baptism\"]]) instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the [[Catharism|Albigenses]] in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] was involved in the [[German Peasants' War]]. [[Andreas Karlstadt]] disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers.<ref name=GAMEO-Karlstadt>{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Gerhard|title=Karlstadt, Andreas Rudolff-Bodenstein von (1486\u20131541)|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Karlstadt,_Andreas_Rudolff-Bodenstein_von_(1486-1541)|website=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> [[Kaspar Schwenkfeld]] and [[Sebastian Franck]] were influenced by [[German mysticism]] and [[spiritualism]].\n\nIn the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation, the [[Magisterial Reformation]] had not gone far enough. Radical Reformer, [[Andreas Karlstadt|Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt]], for example, referred to the Lutheran theologians at [[Wittenberg]] as the \"new papists\".<ref>[http://www.reformationhappens.com/movements/magisterial/ The Magisterial Reformation].</ref> Since the term \"magister\" also means \"teacher\", the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher. This is made evident in the prominence of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry. Because of their authority, they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes. A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of [[Hans Hut]], although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism.\n\nAnabaptism in shape of its various diversification such as the [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]] came out of the Radical Reformation. Later in history, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], and the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] would emerge in Anabaptist circles.\n\n==Denominations==\n{{See also|List of Christian denominations#Protestant|List of the largest Protestant churches}}\n[[File:Map of state religions (detailed).svg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Protestantism as [[state religion]]:\n{{legend|#062A87|[[Lutheranism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF2400|[[Anglicanism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF7F00|[[Calvinism]]}}\n{{legend|#FC0FC0|[[Methodism]]}}]]\n\nProtestants refer to specific groupings of congregations or churches that share in common foundational doctrines and the name of their groups as [[List of Christian Denominations#Protestant|denominations]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkhVtAEwZckC&pg=PA135|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 1996\u20131997|date=1996|publisher=Diane Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780788129056}}</ref> The term denomination (national body) is to be distinguished from branch (denominational family; tradition), communion (international body) and congregation (church).

As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia 1809\u20131917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and a state church separate from Sweden, later named the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], was established. It was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity when the new church law came to force in 1869. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919 and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922. Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland lost its position as a state church but gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], whose position, however, is not codified in the constitution.}} Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state, it is not described as a [[state religion]] in the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish Constitution]] or other laws passed by the [[Finnish Parliament]].<ref name=FinlandConstitution>[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html Finland \u2013 Constitution], Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html.</ref> In 2000, Sweden was the second Nordic country to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf|title=Maarit J\u00e4nter\u00e4-Jareborg: Religion and the Secular State in Sweden}}</ref>\n\n===United and uniting churches===\n{{Main|United and uniting churches}}\n{{See also|Continuing churches}}\n[[File:Union luthercalvin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Glass window in the town church of [[Wiesloch]] (''Stadtkirche [[Wiesloch]]'') with [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] commemorating the 1821 union of Lutheran and Reformed churches in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].]]\nUnited and uniting churches are churches formed from the merger or other form of union of two or more different Protestant denominations.\n\nHistorically, unions of Protestant churches were enforced by the state, usually in order to have a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern [[Christian ecumenism]] progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the [[United Protestant Church of France]] (2013) and the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] due to the rise of [[secularism]], [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among [[evangelical]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] and [[charismatic]] churches as new ones arise and plenty of them remain independent of each other.\n\nPerhaps the oldest official united church is found in [[Germany]], where the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] is a federation of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], United ([[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]]) and [[Reformed churches]], a union dating back to 1817. The first of the series of unions was at a synod in [[Idstein]] to form the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]] in August 1817, commemorated in naming the church of Idstein [[Unionskirche, Idstein|Unionskirche]] one hundred years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-jb-kirche.htm |title=Staatlicher Dirigismus und neue Gl\u00e4ubigkeit (Die Kirche im Herzogtum Nassau) |publisher= Nassau-info.de |language=German}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, each united or uniting church comprises a different mix of predecessor Protestant denominations. Trends are visible, however, as most united and uniting churches have one or more predecessors with heritage in the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]] and many are members of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].\n\n==Major branches==\nProtestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation, today regarded as branches. Some of these movements have a common lineage, sometimes directly spawning individual denominations. Due to the earlier stated multitude of [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]], this section discusses only the largest denominational families, or branches, widely considered to be a part of Protestantism. These are, in alphabetical order: [[Adventism|Adventist]], [[Anglican]], [[Baptist]], [[Calvinism|Calvinist (Reformed)]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Pentecostal]]. A small but historically significant [[Anabaptist]] branch is also discussed.\n\nThe chart below shows the mutual relations and historical origins of the main Protestant denominational families, or their parts. Due to factors such as [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]] and the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'', many people lived as [[Nicodemite]]s, where their professed religious affiliations were more or less at odds with the movement they sympathized with. As a result, the boundaries between the denominations do not separate as cleanly as this chart indicates. When a population was suppressed or persecuted into feigning an adherence to the dominant faith, over the generations they continued to influence the church they outwardly adhered to.\n\nBecause Calvinism was not specifically recognized in the Holy Roman Empire until the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, many Calvinists lived as [[Crypto-Calvinists]]. Due to Counter-Reformation related suppressions in Catholic lands during the 16th through 19th centuries, many Protestants lived as [[crypto-protestantism|Crypto-Protestants]]. Meanwhile, in Protestant areas, Catholics sometimes lived as [[crypto-papist]]s, although in continental Europe emigration was more feasible so this was less common.\n\n[[File:Protestant branches.svg|thumb|upright=2.95|center|Historical chart of the main Protestant branches.]]\n\n===Adventism===\n{{Main|Adventism}}\nAdventism began in the 19th century in the context of the [[Second Great Awakening]] revival in the [[United States]].

[[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as [[Millerism|Millerites]].\n\nAlthough the Adventist churches hold much in common, their [[Christian theology|theologies]] differ on whether the [[intermediate state]] is [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is [[annihilationism|annihilation]] or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of {{bibleverse ||Daniel|8|NKJV}} refers to the one in [[heavenly sanctuary|heaven]] or one on earth.<ref name=\"Handbook\">{{Citation | section = Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches | pages = 256\u2013276 | first1 = Frank S | last1 = Mead | first2 = Samuel S | last2 = Hill | first3 = Craig D | last3 = Atwood | title = Handbook of Denominations in the United States | edition = 12th | place = Nashville | publisher = Abingdon Press}}</ref> The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole [[Bible]], leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]].

From the perspective of their persecutors, the \"Baptizers\" baptized for the second time those \"who as infants had already been baptized\". Since the denigrative term ''Anabaptist'' signifies ''re-baptizing'', it is considered a polemic term and therefore has been dropped from use in modern German.

Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the [[five points of Calvinism]], though these points identify the Calvinist view on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things\u2014in salvation but also in all of life.

The term ''Pentecostal'' is derived from [[Pentecost]], the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the Jewish [[Feast of Weeks]]. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] upon the followers of [[Jesus Christ]], as described in the [[Second Chapter of Acts|second chapter]] of the [[Book of Acts]].\n\nThis branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit\u2013filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of [[spiritual gift]]s such as [[speaking in tongues]] and [[divine healing]]\u2014two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the [[Apostolic Age]] of the [[early church]]. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term ''Apostolic'' or ''[[Full Gospel]]'' to describe their movement.\n\nPentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations, including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ, both in the United States and elsewhere. There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide, and the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the [[global South]]. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches through the [[Charismatic Movement]].

There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach. [[Richard A.

A small Remonstrant community remains in the Netherlands.]]\nArminianism is based on [[Christian theology|theological]] ideas of the [[Dutch Reformed]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609) and his historic supporters known as [[Remonstrants]]. His teachings held to the [[five solae]] of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and other [[Protestant Reformers]]. Jacobus Arminius was a student of [[Theodore Beza]] at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a [[soteriological]] diversification of [[Calvinism]].<ref>\"Chambers Biographical Dictionary,\" ed. Magnus Magnusson (Chambers: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 62.</ref> However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.<ref>Kenneth D. Keathley, \"The Work of God: Salvation,\" in ''A Theology for the Church'', ed. Daniel L. Akin (Nashville: B&H Academic, 2007), 703.</ref> Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the [[Baptists]] in the 16th century,<ref>Robert G. Torbet, ''A History of the Baptists'', third edition</ref> the [[Methodists]] in the 18th century and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in the 19th century.\n\nThe original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself are commonly defined as Arminianism, but more broadly, the term may embrace the teachings of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]], and others as well. [[Arminianism#Classical Arminianism|Classical Arminianism]] and [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]] are the two main schools of thought. Wesleyan Arminianism is often identical with Methodism. The two systems of Calvinism and Arminianism share both history and many doctrines, and the [[History of Christianity|history of Christian theology]]. However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine [[predestination]] and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. In short, the difference can be seen ultimately by whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion.  Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.<ref>Gonzalez, Justo L.

While declining as an identifiable Lutheran group, some of its theological tenets influenced Protestantism generally, inspiring the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest [[John Wesley]] to begin the [[Methodism|Methodist]] movement and [[Alexander Mack]] to begin the [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]] movement among [[Anabaptists]].\n\nThough Pietism shares an emphasis on personal behavior with the [[Puritan]] movement, and the two are often confused, there are important differences, particularly in the concept of the role of religion in government.<ref>Calvinist Puritans believed that government was ordained by God to enforce Christian behavior upon the world; pietists see the government as a part of the world, and believers were called to voluntarily live faithful lives independent of government.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Philipp Jakob Spener.jpg|[[Philipp Jakob Spener]], German pioneer and founder of Pietism.\nFile:Pietism.JPG|Pietism has been a strong cultural influence in Scandinavia.\nFile:Der breite und der schmale Weg 2008.jpg|''The Broad and the Narrow Way'', a popular German Pietist painting, 1866.\n</gallery>\n\n===Puritanism, English dissenters and nonconformists===\n{{Main|Puritanism|English Dissenters|Independent (religion)|Nonconformist (Protestantism){{!}}Nonconformism|English Presbyterianism|Ecclesiastical separatism|17th-century denominations in England}}\n\nThe Puritans were a group of English Protestants in the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th]] and [[Christianity in the 17th century|17th centuries]], which sought to purify the [[Church of England]] of what they considered to be [[Roman Catholic]] practices, maintaining that the church was only partially reformed. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some of the returning [[Marian exiles|clergy exiled under Mary I]] shortly after the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1558, as an activist movement within the [[Church of England]].\n\nPuritans were blocked from changing the established church from within, and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands (and later to New England), and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later into Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the [[Synod of Dort]] they were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted [[Puritan Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarianism]] in the 17th century, and were influenced by [[millennialism]].\n\nThey formed, and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of [[worship]] and [[doctrine]], as well as personal and group [[pietism|piety]]. Puritans adopted a [[Reformed theology]], but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva. In church polity, some advocated for separation from all other Christians, in favor of autonomous [[gathered church]]es. These separatist and [[independent (religion)|independent]] strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a [[Presbyterian polity]] in the [[Westminster Assembly]] were unable to forge a new English national church.\n\nNonconforming Protestants along with the Protestant refugees from continental Europe were the primary founders of the United States of America.\n<gallery>\nFile:John.Cotton.cropped.jpg|[[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]], who sparked the [[Antinomian Controversy]] with his [[free grace theology]].\nFile:Landing-Bacon.PNG|[[Pilgrim Fathers]] landing at [[Plymouth Rock]] in 1620.\nFile:OldShipEntrance.jpg|Built in 1681, the [[Old Ship Church]] in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] is the oldest church in America in continuous ecclesiastical use.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Butterfield | first = Fox | title = The Perfect New England Town | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/14/travel/the-perfect-new-england-village.html?sec=&spon= | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 14 May 1989 | accessdate = 30 May 2010}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-orthodoxy and paleo-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Neo-orthodoxy|Paleo-orthodoxy}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-1283-23A, Wuppertal, Evangelische Gesellschaft, Jahrestagung.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Karl Barth]], often regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian of the twentieth century<ref name = \"McGrath2011\">{{citation| first = Alister E | last = McGrath| title= Christian Theology: An Introduction |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bus5TyjTfxYC&pg=PA76 | date= 14 January 2011| publisher= John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9770-3 |page = 76}}</ref><ref name = \"BrownCollinson2012\">{{citation | first1 = Stuart | last1 = Brown | first2 = Diane | last2 = Collinson| first3 =Robert | last3 = Wilkinson | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz8OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA52 | date = 10 September 2012| publisher = Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-06043-1 | page = 52}}</ref>]]\nA non-fundamentalist rejection of liberal Christianity along the lines of the [[Christian existentialism]] of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], who attacked the [[Right Hegelians#Hegelian theologians|Hegelian]] state churches of his day for \"dead orthodoxy,\" neo-orthodoxy is associated primarily with [[Karl Barth]], [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]], and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]. Neo-orthodoxy sought to counter-act the tendency of liberal theology to make theological accommodations to modern scientific perspectives. Sometimes called \"crisis theology,\" in the existentialist sense of the word crisis, also sometimes called ''neo-evangelicalism'', which uses the sense of \"evangelical\" pertaining to continental European Protestants rather than American evangelicalism. \"Evangelical\" was the originally preferred label used by Lutherans and Calvinists, but it was replaced by the names some Catholics used to [[Labelling#Labelling in argumentation|label]] a heresy with the name of its founder.\n\n[[Paleo-orthodoxy]] is a movement similar in some respects to neo-evangelicalism but emphasizing the ancient Christian consensus of the undivided church of the first millennium AD, including in particular the early creeds and church councils as a means of properly understanding the scriptures. This movement is cross-denominational. A prominent theologian in this group is [[Thomas Oden]], a Methodist.\n\n===Christian fundamentalism===\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\nIn reaction to liberal Bible critique, [[fundamentalism]] arose in the 20th century, primarily in the United States, among those denominations most affected by Evangelicalism.\nFundamentalist theology tends to stress [[Biblical inerrancy]] and [[Biblical literalism]].\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some have tended to confuse evangelicalism and fundamentalism; however, the labels represent very distinct differences of approach that both groups are diligent to maintain, although because of fundamentalism's dramatically smaller size it often gets classified simply as an ultra-conservative branch of evangelicalism.\n\n===Modernism and liberalism===\n{{Main|Liberal Christianity}}\nModernism and liberalism do not constitute rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought into the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] within the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] in the 1920s.\n\n==Protestant culture==\n{{Main|Protestant culture}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=200\n|image1=2006 Berliner Dom Front.jpg\n|caption1=The [[Berlin Cathedral]], a [[United and uniting churches|United Protestant]] cathedral in [[Berlin]].\n|image2=Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]].''}}\n\nAlthough the Reformation was a religious movement, it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life: marriage and family, education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy, and the arts.<ref name=\"Karl Heussi 1956 pp. 317\u2013319\"/> Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" /> Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', p. 319</ref> Since about 1950, women have entered the ministry, and some have assumed leading positions (e.g. [[bishop]]s), in most Protestant churches.\n\nAs the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost.

Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ([[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]).<ref>Heinrich Bornkamm, ''{{lang|de|Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums}}'' in ''{{lang|de|Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart}}'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937</ref> The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise ''On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture''; 1523).<ref>Original German title: ''{{lang|de|Dass eine christliche Versammlung oder Gemeine Recht und Macht habe, alle Lehre zu beurteilen und Lehrer zu berufen, ein- und abzusetzen: Grund und Ursach aus der Schrift}}''</ref> Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyter]]s) in his representative church government.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 4\u201310</ref> The [[Huguenot]]s added regional [[synod]]s and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other reformed churches<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', 11. Auflage, p. 325</ref> and was adopted by some Lutherans beginning with those in [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]] during the 17th century.\n\nPolitically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of [[democracy]]: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''{{lang|de|Evangelisches Soziallexikon}}'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). Thus he and his followers resisted political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', p. 10</ref> Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', pp. 396\u2013397</ref>\n\nConsistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[English Bill of Rights]], and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].<ref>Cf.

On the contrary, the visible unity of the ''catholic'' or ''universal church'' was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted.{{efn|For more on this, see [[crypto-paganism]] and the [[Great Apostasy#Overview|Great Apostasy]]. In some areas, pagan Europeans were forced to adopt Christianity at least outwardly, such as after being defeated in battle by Christians. However, outlawing their paganism didn't just make it go away. Rather, it persisted as crypto-paganism. For example, [[Philip Melanchthon]], in his 1537 [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] identified the mechanical character of [[ex opere operato]] sacraments as being a form of pagan [[Deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic philosophy]].}} Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. The Protestant Reformers formed a new and radically different theological opinion on ecclesiology, that the visible Church is \"catholic\" (lower-case \"c\") rather than \"Catholic\" (upper-case \"C\"). Accordingly, there is not an indefinite number of parochial, congregational or national churches, constituting, as it were, so many ecclesiastical individualities, but one great spiritual republic of which these various organizations form a part,{{efn|This is the position of the Protestants who believe the church is visible. For those who think the church is invisible, organizations are irrelevant, as only individual sinners can be saved.}} although they each have very different opinions. This was markedly far-removed from the traditional and historic Roman Catholic understanding that the Roman Catholic Church was the one true Church of Christ.{{efn|See [[Augustine of Hippo#Ecclesiology|Ecclesiology of Augustine of Hippo]] for an example of a church father who discussed the invisible church.}}\n\nYet in the Protestant understanding, the ''visible church'' is not a genus, so to speak, with so many species under it.{{efn|This is a reference to the [[Marks of the Church]] in Reformed theology. It is thus you may think of the State, but the visible church is a ''totum integrale'', it is an empire, with an ethereal emperor, rather than a visible one. The churches of the various nationalities constitute the provinces of this empire; and though they are so far independent of each other, yet they are so one, that membership in one is membership in all, and separation from one is separation from all.... This conception of the church, of which, in at least some aspects, we have practically so much lost sight, had a firm hold of the Scottish theologians of the seventeenth century.

Rather, they were excommunicated such as in the 1520 ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' and the 1521 ''[[Edict of Worms]]''. Some Protestants avoided excommunication by living as [[crypto-Protestant]]s.}} from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument,{{efn|Some Protestants claim the church is visible today, this is a matter of dispute.}} saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a ''spiritual, invisible, and hidden church''\u2014this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nWherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received support from the ruling authorities, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole ''invisible church'', but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters,{{efn|The assertion of papal supremacy varied through history. For example, in 381 the [[First Council of Constantinople]] recognized the sees of Rome and Constantinople as being equal in authority. Papal supremacy continued to evolve after the Reformation with the [[First Vatican Council]].}} namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible [[ecclesiastical]] organization based on the 14th- and 15th-century [[Conciliarism|Conciliar movement]], rejecting the [[papacy]] and [[papal infallibility]] in favor of [[ecumenical council]]s, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the [[Council of Trent]].{{efn|Lutherans did not completely reject Trent. In fact, some attended it, although they were not given a vote. Instead, [[Martin Chemnitz]] on the basis that all councils are subject to examination, wrote the ''[[Examination of the Council of Trent]]'' in which some parts of Trent were accepted and others dissented from.}} Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action.\n\nThere are Protestants,{{efn|In history, Catholic sympathizing Protestants were termed [[crypto-papist]]s and lived as such because Catholicism was illegal in some areas under the legal principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''.

Instead, they remained continued to influence the dominant church in their area.}} especially of the [[Reformed tradition]], that either reject or down-play the designation ''Protestant'' because of the negative idea that the word invokes in addition to its primary meaning, preferring the designation ''Reformed'', ''Evangelical'' or even ''Reformed Catholic'' expressive of what they call a ''Reformed Catholicity'' and defending their arguments from the traditional Protestant confessions.<ref>''The Canadian Reformed Magazine'', 18 (20\u201327 September, 4\u201311 October, 18, 1, 8 November 1969) http://spindleworks.com/library/faber/008_theca.htm</ref>\n\n==Ecumenism==\n{{Main|Christian ecumenism}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|Size=thumb\n|image1= Marburger-Religionsgespr\u00e4ch.jpg\n|caption1=The [[Marburg Colloquy]] (1529) was an early attempt at uniting [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]].

Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa, Asia and Oceania. Since 1948, the [[World Council of Churches]] has been influential, but ineffective in creating a united church. There are also ecumenical bodies at regional, national and local levels across the globe; but schisms still far outnumber unifications. One, but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement, has been the move to form united churches, such as the [[Church of South India]], the [[Church of North India]], the US-based [[United Church of Christ]], the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] and the [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines]] which have rapidly declining memberships. There has been a strong engagement of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0804/__P1T.HTM |title=Orthodox Church: text \u2013 IntraText CT |publisher=Intratext.com |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nA Protestant [[baptism]] is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize. However, as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of [[apostolic succession]] and the disunity from Catholic Church, all other sacraments (except marriage) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid. Therefore, Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized (although they are confirmed) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the [[Catholic priesthood|priesthood]] after a period of study.\n\nIn 1999, the representatives of [[Lutheran World Federation]] and Catholic Church signed the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]], apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of [[Justification (theology)|justification]] which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation, although [[Confessional Lutheran]]s reject this statement.<ref name=WELS-JD>{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=6741 |website=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Justification |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |quote=A document which is aimed at settling differences needs to address those differences unambiguously.

People who were involved in the religious movement used the word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}). For further details, see the section below. Gradually, ''protestant'' became a general term, meaning any adherent of the Reformation in the German-speaking area. It was ultimately somewhat taken up by [[Lutherans]], even though [[Martin Luther]] himself insisted on ''Christian'' or ''evangelical'' as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ. [[Huguenots|French]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Protestants instead preferred the word ''reformed'' ({{lang-fr|r\u00e9form\u00e9}}), which became a popular, neutral, and alternative name for [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Evangelical===\n[[File:evangelischeVielfalt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Direction sign]]s showing ways to two different Protestant [[Church (building)|churches]] in the German city of [[Wiesbaden]].]]\nThe word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}), which refers to [[the gospel]], was widely used for those involved in the religious movement in the German-speaking area beginning in 1517.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |title=The Reformation: A History |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=2003 |author-link=Diarmaid MacCulloch |page=xx|title-link=The Reformation: A History }}</ref> Nowadays, ''evangelical'' is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations in the Lutheran, Calvinist, and United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed) traditions in Europe, and those with strong ties to them (e.g. [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]). Above all the term is used by Protestant bodies in the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking area]], such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. In continental Europe, an ''Evangelical'' is either a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or a United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed). The [[German language|German]] word ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' means Protestant, and is different from the German ''{{lang|de|evangelikal}}'', which refers to churches shaped by [[Evangelicalism]]. The English word ''evangelical'' usually refers to [[evangelical Protestant]] churches, and therefore to a certain part of Protestantism rather than to Protestantism as a whole. The English word traces its roots back to the [[Puritans]] in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.\n\nMartin Luther always disliked the term ''Lutheran'', preferring the term ''evangelical'', which was derived from ''euangelion'', a Greek word meaning \"good news\", i.e. \"[[The Gospel|gospel]]\".<ref name=OOE796>Esp\u00edn, Orlando O. and Nickoloff, James B. ''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies''. Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press, p. 796.</ref> The followers of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and other theologians linked to the [[Reformed tradition]] also began to use that term. To distinguish the two evangelical groups, others began to refer to the two groups as ''Evangelical Lutheran'' and ''Evangelical Reformed''. Nowadays, the word also pertains in the same way to some other mainline groups, for example ''Evangelical Methodist''. As time passed by, the word ''evangelical'' was dropped. Lutherans themselves began to use the term ''Lutheran'' in the middle of the 16th century, in order to distinguish themselves from other groups such as the [[Philippists]] and [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Reformational===\nThe German word ''{{lang|de|reformatorisch}}'', which roughly translates to English as \"reformational\" or \"reforming\", is used as an alternative for ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' in German, and is different from English ''reformed'' ({{lang-de|reformiert}}), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and other Reformed theologians. Being derived from the word \"Reformation\", the term emerged around the same time as ''evangelical'' (1517) and ''protestant'' (1529).\n\n==Theology==\n\n===Main principles===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|image1=Mikolow protestant church pulpit.jpg\n|caption1=Key figures of the Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther and John Calvin depicted on a church [[pulpit]].

The supreme authority of [[religious text|scripture]] is a fundamental principle of Protestantism.}}\n\nVarious experts on the subject tried to determine what makes a Christian denomination a part of Protestantism. A common consensus approved by most of them is that if a Christian denomination is to be considered Protestant, it must acknowledge the following three fundamental principles of Protestantism.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" />\n\n;Scripture alone:\n{{main|Sola Scriptura}}\nThe belief, emphasized by Luther, in the Bible as the [[Sola scriptura|highest source of authority]] for the church. The early churches of the Reformation believed in a critical, yet serious, reading of scripture and holding the Bible as a source of authority higher than that of [[Sacred Tradition|church tradition]]. The many abuses that had occurred in the Western Church before the Protestant Reformation led the Reformers to reject much of its tradition, though some{{who|date= November 2018}} would maintain tradition has been maintained and reorganized in the liturgy and in the confessions of the Protestant churches of the Reformation. In the early 20th century, a less critical reading of the Bible developed in the United States, leading to a \"fundamentalist\" reading of Scripture. Christian fundamentalists read the Bible as the \"inerrant, infallible\" Word of God, as do the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran churches, but interpret it in a literalist fashion without using the historical critical method.\n\n\"Biblical Christianity\" focused on a deep study of the Bible is characteristic of most Protestants as opposed to \"Church Christianity\", focused on performing rituals and good works, represented by Catholic and Orthodox traditions. However Quakers and Pentecostalists, emphasize the Holy Spirit and personal closeness to God.<ref>Woodhead, Linda. ''Christianity: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press, 2014) pp. 57\u201370</ref>\n\n;Justification by faith alone:\n{{main|Sola Fide}}\nThe belief that believers are [[justification (theology)|justified]], or pardoned for sin, solely on condition of faith in [[Jesus|Christ]] rather than a combination of faith and [[good works]]. For Protestants, good works are a necessary consequence rather than cause of justification.<ref name=\"SchaffHerzog\">Johann Jakob Herzog, Philip Schaff, Albert.

It is opposed to the hierarchical system which puts the essence and authority of the Church in an exclusive priesthood, and makes ordained priests the necessary mediators between God and the people.<ref name=\"SchaffHerzog\" /> It is distinguished from the concept of the priesthood of all believers, which did not grant individuals the right to interpret the Bible apart from the Christian community at large because universal priesthood opened the door to such a possibility.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Unitarianism and the Protestant Dilemma: The Conundrum of Biblical Authority|last=Willsky-Ciollo|first=Lydia|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2015|isbn=9780739188927|location=Lanham, MD|pages=9\u201310}}</ref> There are scholars who cite that this doctrine tends to subsume all distinctions in the church under a single spiritual entity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life|last=Chan|first=Simon|publisher=IVP Academic|year=1998|isbn=9780830815425|location=Downers Grove, IL|pages=105}}</ref> Calvin referred to the universal priesthood as an expression of the relation between the believer and his God, including the freedom of a Christian to come to God through Christ without human mediation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Church in the Theology of the Reformers|last=Avis|first=Paul|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2002|isbn=1592441009|location=Eugene, OR|pages=95}}</ref> He also maintained that this principle recognizes Christ as [[prophet]], priest, and king and that his priesthood is shared with his people.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Trinity===\n{{See also|Trinity|Nontrinitarianism}}\n[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief that God is one God in three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]), and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|God the Holy Spirit]].]]\nProtestants who adhere to the [[Nicene Creed]] believe in three [[person]]s ([[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]) as one God.\n\nMovements emerging around the time of the Protestant Reformation, but not a part of Protestantism, e.g. [[Unitarianism]] also reject the Trinity. This often serves as a reason for exclusion of the [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] and other movements from Protestantism by various observers. Unitarianism continues to have a presence mainly in Transylvania, England and the United States, as well as elsewhere.\n\n===Five solae===\n{{Main|Five solae}}\n{{Five solae}}\n\nThe Five ''{{lang|la|solae}}'' are five [[Latin]] phrases (or slogans) that emerged during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and summarize the reformers' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] of the day. The Latin word ''{{lang|la|sola}}'' means \"alone\", \"only\", or \"single\".\n\nThe use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation, based on the overarching principle of ''{{lang|la|[[sola scriptura]]}}'' (by scripture alone). This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible: that its teaching is needed for salvation (necessity); that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone (sufficiency); that everything taught in the Bible is correct (inerrancy); and that, by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin, believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself, though understanding is difficult, so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church (clarity).\n\nThe necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text.\n\nThe second main principle, ''{{lang|la|[[sola fide]]}}'' (by faith alone), states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation. Though argued from scripture, and hence logically consequent to ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'', this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers. Because ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'' placed the Bible as the only source of teaching, ''{{lang|la|sola fide}}'' epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to, namely the direct, close, personal connection between Christ and the believer, hence the reformers' contention that their work was Christocentric.\n\nThe other solas, as statements, emerged later, but the thinking they represent was also part of the early Reformation.\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Solus Christus]]}}'': ''Christ alone''\n: The Protestants characterize the dogma concerning the Pope as Christ's representative head of the Church on earth, the concept of works made meritorious by Christ, and the Catholic idea of a treasury of the merits of Christ and his saints, as a denial that Christ is the ''only'' mediator between [[God]] and man. Catholics, on the other hand, maintained the traditional understanding of Judaism on these questions, and appealed to the universal consensus of Christian tradition.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Matt.|16:18}}, {{Bibleref2|1Cor.|3:11||1 Cor. 3:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph.|2:20}}, {{Bibleref2|1Pet.|2:5\u20136||1 Pet. 2:5\u20136}}, {{Bibleref2|Rev.|21:14}}</ref>\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Sola Gratia]]}}'': ''Grace alone''\n: Protestants perceived Roman Catholic salvation to be dependent upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God on account of the change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one ''deserves'' salvation.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|7:21}}\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Soli Deo Gloria]]}}'': ''Glory to God alone''\n: All glory is due to God alone since salvation is accomplished solely through his will and action\u2014not only the gift of the all-sufficient [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus]] on [[Christian cross|the cross]] but also the gift of faith in that atonement, created in the heart of the believer by the [[Holy Spirit]].

One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the [[Eucharist]]. Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic [[dogma]] of [[transubstantiation]], which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion.\n* Lutherans hold that within the [[Lord's Supper]] the consecrated elements of bread and wine are the true body and blood of Christ \"in, with, and under the form\" of bread and wine for all those who eat and drink it,{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:16|47}} {{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|11:20,27|47}}<ref>Engelder, T.E.W., [https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 ''Popular Symbolics''].

Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the [[sacrament]] but instead affirm that Christ is united to the believer through faith\u2014toward which the supper is an outward and visible aid. This is often referred to as ''dynamic presence''.\n* Anglicans and Methodists refuse to define the Presence, preferring to leave it a mystery.<ref name=\"Neal2014\">{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Gregory S.|title=Sacramental Theology and the Christian Life|date=19 December 2014|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781490860077|page=111|quote=For Anglicans and Methodists the reality of the presence of Jesus as received through the sacramental elements is not in question.

However, the words of their liturgies suggest that one can hold to a belief in the Real Presence and Spiritual and Sacramental Present at the same time. For example, \"... and you have fed us with the spiritual food in the Sacrament of his body and Blood;\" \"...the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, and for assuring us in these holy mysteries...\" American Book of Common Prayer, 1977, pp.&nbsp;365\u2013366. Perhaps the best way to see it is that the Anglican view incorporates all three of the above positions and the Roman and Orthodox. The classic Anglican and Methodist view is that the bread and wine are instruments of God's Grace. Perhaps the closest that one can get to pinning down an Anglican view (they are notorious for refusing to so) are the words of St. John of Damascus, \"the bread and wine are visible symbols of a spiritual reality.\" The symbol is not empty but the visible to another reality present.\n* Anabaptists hold a popular simplification of the [[Theology of Huldrych Zwingli|Zwinglian view]], without concern for theological intricacies as hinted at above, may see the Lord's Supper merely as a symbol of the shared faith of the participants, a commemoration of the facts of the crucifixion, and a reminder of their standing together as the body of Christ (a view referred to as ''memorialism'').<ref name=\"Balmer2002\">{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall Herbert|last2=Winner|first2=Lauren F.|title=Protestantism in America|url=https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=9780231111300|page=[https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593/page/n42 26]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Protestantism}}\n\n===Pre-Reformation===\n{{See also|Proto-Protestantism|Girolamo Savonarola}}\n[[File:Muttich, Kamil Vladislav - Mistr Jan Hus na hranici v Kostnici 1415.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of [[Jan Hus]] in 1415.]]\n[[File:lollardmap.jpg|thumb|right|Spread of [[Lollardy]] in [[medieval England]] and [[medieval Scotland]].]]\n\nIn the late 1130s, [[Arnold of Brescia]], an Italian [[canon regular]] became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church. After his death, his teachings on [[apostolic poverty]] gained currency among [[Arnoldists]], and later more widely among [[Waldensians]] and the [[Spiritual Franciscans]], though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. In the early 1170s, [[Peter Waldo]] founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution. Despite that, the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy, as [[Waldensian Evangelical Church|a part of the wider Reformed tradition]].\n\nIn the 1370s, [[John Wycliffe]]\u2014later dubbed the \"Morning Star of Reformation\"\u2014started his activity as an English reformer. He rejected papal authority over secular power, [[Wycliffe's Bible|translated the Bible]] into [[vernacular]] [[English language|English]], and preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms.\n\nBeginning in the first decade of the 15th century, [[Jan Hus]]\u2014a Roman Catholic priest, Czech reformist and professor\u2014influenced by John Wycliffe's writings, founded the [[Hussite]] movement. He strongly advocated his reformist [[Bohemian]] religious denomination. He was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] and [[burned at the stake]] in [[Constance]], [[Bishopric of Constance]] in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy. After his execution, a revolt erupted. Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the [[Pope]].\n\nLater on, theological disputes caused a split within the Hussite movement. [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] maintained that both the bread and the wine should be administered to the people during the Eucharist. Another major faction were the [[Taborites]], who opposed the Utraquists in the [[Battle of Lipany]] during the [[Hussite Wars]]. There were two separate parties among the Hussites: moderate and radical movements. Other smaller regional Hussite branches in [[Bohemia]] included [[Adamites]], [[Orebites]], [[Sirotci|Orphans]] and Praguers.\n\nThe Hussite Wars concluded with the victory of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], his Catholic allies and moderate Hussites and the defeat of the radical Hussites. Tensions arose as the [[Thirty Years' War]] reached Bohemia in 1620. Both moderate and radical Hussitism was increasingly persecuted by Catholics and Holy Roman Emperor's armies.\n\nStarting in 1475, an Italian Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]] was calling for a Christian renewal. Later on, Martin Luther himself read some of the friar's writings and praised him as a martyr and forerunner whose ideas on faith and grace anticipated Luther's own doctrine of justification by faith alone.\n\nSome of Hus' followers founded the [[Unitas Fratrum]]\u2014\"Unity of the Brethren\"\u2014which was renewed under the leadership of [[Zinzendorf|Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf]] in [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]] in 1722 after its almost total destruction in the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]]. Today, it is usually referred to in English as the [[Moravian Church]] and in German as the [[Moravian Church|Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine]].\n\n===Reformation proper===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Distribution of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in [[Central Europe]] on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618).]]\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=vertical\n|width=200\n|image1=1491 Henry VIII.jpg\n|caption1=[[Henry VIII of England]], known for his role in the [[English Reformation|separation]] of the [[Church of England]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n|image2=JohnKnox.jpg\n|caption2=John Knox, who led the [[Reformation in Scotland]], founding [[Presbyterianism]].}}\n{{Reformation}}\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] began as an attempt to reform the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nOn 31 October 1517 ([[Halloween|All Hallows' Eve]]) [[Martin Luther]] allegedly nailed his [[Ninety-five Theses]] (Disputation on the Power of Indulgences) on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]] in [[Wittenberg]], Germany, detailing doctrinal and practical abuses of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], especially the selling of [[indulgence]]s. The theses debated and criticized many aspects of the Church and the papacy, including the practice of [[Purgatory#Protestantism|purgatory]], [[Particular judgment#Reformation concepts|particular judgment]], and the authority of the pope. Luther would later write works against the Catholic devotion to [[Virgin Mary]], the intercession of and devotion to the saints, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, good works, and the sacraments.<ref name=Schofield122>Schofield ''Martin Luther'' p. 122</ref>\n\nThe [[Reformation]] was a triumph of literacy and the new [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].<ref name=Cameron>Cameron ''European Reformation''{{page needed|date=March 2015}}</ref>{{efn|In the end, while the Reformation emphasis on Protestants reading the Scriptures was one factor in the development of literacy, the impact of printing itself, the wider availability of printed works at a cheaper price, and the increasing focus on education and learning as key factors in obtaining a lucrative post, were also significant contributory factors.<ref name=Pettegree543>Pettegree ''Reformation World'' p. 543</ref>}}  Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets.

After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the [[Bern]] reformer [[William Farel]], Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the city of [[Geneva]]. His ''Ordinances of 1541'' involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563.\n\nProtestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed [[Huguenots]]. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of [[Henry II of France]] in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when [[Henry IV of France]] issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official [[state religion]], and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV's]] [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg]] declared the [[Edict of Potsdam]], giving free passage to Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the [[C\u00e9vennes]] region.\n\nParallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the [[Swiss Confederation]] led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince [[Philip of Hesse]] saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the [[Colloquy of Marburg]], which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.\n\nIn 1534, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] put an end to all papal jurisdiction in [[England]], after the Pope failed to [[annul]] his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]];<ref>William P. Haugaard \"The History of Anglicanism I\" in ''The Study of Anglicanism'' Stephen Sykes and John Booty (eds) (SPCK 1987) pp. 6\u20137</ref> this opened the door to reformational ideas. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (''{{lang|la|via media}}'') between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the [[English Reformation]] came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as ''the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England''. Between 1535 and 1540, under [[Thomas Cromwell]], the policy known as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]. The [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.\n\nThe success of the [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritans|Puritan party]] dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the [[Elizabethan Age]]. The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The later Puritan movement, often referred to as [[dissenters]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations.\n\nThe [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560 decisively shaped the [[Church of Scotland]].<ref>Article 1, of the [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish Reformation'.</ref> The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation. The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament]] of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the [[Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560]], forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith. It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent [[Mary of Guise]], who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent [[Mary, Queen of Scots|daughter]].\n\nSome of the most important activists of the Protestant Reformation included [[Jacobus Arminius]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[Andreas von Carlstadt]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[William Farel]], [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]], [[Laurentius Petri]], [[Olaus Petri]], [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Menno Simons]], [[Louis de Berquin]], [[Primo\u017e Trubar]] and [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]].\n\nIn the course of this religious upheaval, the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524\u201325 swept through the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Thuringia]]n and [[Swabia]]n principalities. After the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the [[Low Countries]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]], the confessional division of the [[states of the Holy Roman Empire]] eventually erupted in the [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648. It devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25% and 40% of its population.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe \u2013 Demographics]\".

(the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'')\n* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.\n* The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power. [[Pope Innocent X]] declared the treaty \"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times\" in his bull ''{{lang|la|Zelo Domus Dei}}''.

It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism and hierarchy, it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality.<ref>Thomas S.

It gained momentum by 1800. After 1820, membership rose rapidly among [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1840s. It has been described as a reaction against skepticism, [[deism]], and [[rationalism]], although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood.<ref>[[Nancy Cott]], \"Young Women in the Great Awakening in New England,\" Feminist Studies 3, no. 1/2 (Autumn 1975): 15.</ref> It enrolled millions of new members in existing [[evangelical]] denominations and led to the formation of new denominations.\n\nThe [[Third Great Awakening]] refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in [[American history]] and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century.<ref>William G.

It was affiliated with the [[Social Gospel]] Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement.

The terminology is controversial. Thus, the idea of a Fourth Great Awakening itself has not been generally accepted.<ref>Robert William Fogel (2000), ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism''; see the review by Randall Balmer, ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 2002 33(2): 322\u2013325</ref>\n\nIn 1814, [[R\u00e9veil|Le R\u00e9veil]] swept through Calvinist regions in Switzerland and France.\n\nIn 1904, a [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival|Protestant revival in Wales]] had tremendous impact on the local population. A part of British modernization, it drew many people to churches, especially Methodist and Baptist ones.\n\nA noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal movement]]. Sprung from Methodist and [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] roots, it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on [[Azusa Street]] in Los Angeles. From there it spread around the world, carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there. These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history, such as seen in the two Great Awakenings. Pentecostalism, which in turn birthed the [[Charismatic movement]] within already established denominations, continues to be an important force in [[Western Christianity]].\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere in the world, there has been a marked rise in the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical wing]] of Protestant denominations, especially those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream liberal churches]]. In the post\u2013[[World War I]] era, [[Liberal Christianity]] was on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the post\u2013[[World War II]] era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures.\n\nIn Europe, there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards [[secularism]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is largely responsible for the spread of secularism. Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism, attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant-majority countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2012/03/has-lutheranism-caused-secularism/|title=Has Lutheranism caused secularism?|last=Cranach|date=22 March 2012}}</ref> In North America, South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe.

It was a rational extension of the state-approved Protestant dissent, which took the value of independence from constituted authority a step further, arguing the same for the civic realm. The Radical Reformation was non-mainstream, though in parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, a majority would sympathize with the Radical Reformation despite the intense persecution it faced from both Roman Catholics and Magisterial Protestants.<ref name=horsch>{{cite book|last=Horsch|first=John|authorlink=John Horsch|title=Mennonites in Europe|date=1995|publisher=Herald Press|isbn=978-0836113952|page=299}}</ref>\n\nThe early [[Anabaptists]] believed that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gonzalez, ''A History of Christian Thought'', 88.</ref> Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor by the use of the sword; [[Christianity]] was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Protestant ecclesial leaders such as [[Balthasar Hubmaier|Hubmaier]] and [[Melchior Hoffman|Hofmann]] preached the invalidity of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion ([[Believers baptism|\"believer's baptism\"]]) instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the [[Catharism|Albigenses]] in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] was involved in the [[German Peasants' War]]. [[Andreas Karlstadt]] disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers.<ref name=GAMEO-Karlstadt>{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Gerhard|title=Karlstadt, Andreas Rudolff-Bodenstein von (1486\u20131541)|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Karlstadt,_Andreas_Rudolff-Bodenstein_von_(1486-1541)|website=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> [[Kaspar Schwenkfeld]] and [[Sebastian Franck]] were influenced by [[German mysticism]] and [[spiritualism]].\n\nIn the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation, the [[Magisterial Reformation]] had not gone far enough. Radical Reformer, [[Andreas Karlstadt|Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt]], for example, referred to the Lutheran theologians at [[Wittenberg]] as the \"new papists\".<ref>[http://www.reformationhappens.com/movements/magisterial/ The Magisterial Reformation].</ref> Since the term \"magister\" also means \"teacher\", the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher. This is made evident in the prominence of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry. Because of their authority, they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes. A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of [[Hans Hut]], although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism.\n\nAnabaptism in shape of its various diversification such as the [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]] came out of the Radical Reformation. Later in history, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], and the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] would emerge in Anabaptist circles.\n\n==Denominations==\n{{See also|List of Christian denominations#Protestant|List of the largest Protestant churches}}\n[[File:Map of state religions (detailed).svg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Protestantism as [[state religion]]:\n{{legend|#062A87|[[Lutheranism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF2400|[[Anglicanism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF7F00|[[Calvinism]]}}\n{{legend|#FC0FC0|[[Methodism]]}}]]\n\nProtestants refer to specific groupings of congregations or churches that share in common foundational doctrines and the name of their groups as [[List of Christian Denominations#Protestant|denominations]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkhVtAEwZckC&pg=PA135|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 1996\u20131997|date=1996|publisher=Diane Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780788129056}}</ref> The term denomination (national body) is to be distinguished from branch (denominational family; tradition), communion (international body) and congregation (church).

As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia 1809\u20131917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and a state church separate from Sweden, later named the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], was established. It was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity when the new church law came to force in 1869. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919 and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922. Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland lost its position as a state church but gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], whose position, however, is not codified in the constitution.}} Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state, it is not described as a [[state religion]] in the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish Constitution]] or other laws passed by the [[Finnish Parliament]].<ref name=FinlandConstitution>[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html Finland \u2013 Constitution], Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html.</ref> In 2000, Sweden was the second Nordic country to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf|title=Maarit J\u00e4nter\u00e4-Jareborg: Religion and the Secular State in Sweden}}</ref>\n\n===United and uniting churches===\n{{Main|United and uniting churches}}\n{{See also|Continuing churches}}\n[[File:Union luthercalvin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Glass window in the town church of [[Wiesloch]] (''Stadtkirche [[Wiesloch]]'') with [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] commemorating the 1821 union of Lutheran and Reformed churches in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].]]\nUnited and uniting churches are churches formed from the merger or other form of union of two or more different Protestant denominations.\n\nHistorically, unions of Protestant churches were enforced by the state, usually in order to have a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern [[Christian ecumenism]] progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the [[United Protestant Church of France]] (2013) and the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] due to the rise of [[secularism]], [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among [[evangelical]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] and [[charismatic]] churches as new ones arise and plenty of them remain independent of each other.\n\nPerhaps the oldest official united church is found in [[Germany]], where the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] is a federation of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], United ([[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]]) and [[Reformed churches]], a union dating back to 1817. The first of the series of unions was at a synod in [[Idstein]] to form the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]] in August 1817, commemorated in naming the church of Idstein [[Unionskirche, Idstein|Unionskirche]] one hundred years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-jb-kirche.htm |title=Staatlicher Dirigismus und neue Gl\u00e4ubigkeit (Die Kirche im Herzogtum Nassau) |publisher= Nassau-info.de |language=German}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, each united or uniting church comprises a different mix of predecessor Protestant denominations. Trends are visible, however, as most united and uniting churches have one or more predecessors with heritage in the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]] and many are members of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].\n\n==Major branches==\nProtestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation, today regarded as branches. Some of these movements have a common lineage, sometimes directly spawning individual denominations. Due to the earlier stated multitude of [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]], this section discusses only the largest denominational families, or branches, widely considered to be a part of Protestantism. These are, in alphabetical order: [[Adventism|Adventist]], [[Anglican]], [[Baptist]], [[Calvinism|Calvinist (Reformed)]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Pentecostal]]. A small but historically significant [[Anabaptist]] branch is also discussed.\n\nThe chart below shows the mutual relations and historical origins of the main Protestant denominational families, or their parts. Due to factors such as [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]] and the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'', many people lived as [[Nicodemite]]s, where their professed religious affiliations were more or less at odds with the movement they sympathized with. As a result, the boundaries between the denominations do not separate as cleanly as this chart indicates. When a population was suppressed or persecuted into feigning an adherence to the dominant faith, over the generations they continued to influence the church they outwardly adhered to.\n\nBecause Calvinism was not specifically recognized in the Holy Roman Empire until the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, many Calvinists lived as [[Crypto-Calvinists]]. Due to Counter-Reformation related suppressions in Catholic lands during the 16th through 19th centuries, many Protestants lived as [[crypto-protestantism|Crypto-Protestants]]. Meanwhile, in Protestant areas, Catholics sometimes lived as [[crypto-papist]]s, although in continental Europe emigration was more feasible so this was less common.\n\n[[File:Protestant branches.svg|thumb|upright=2.95|center|Historical chart of the main Protestant branches.]]\n\n===Adventism===\n{{Main|Adventism}}\nAdventism began in the 19th century in the context of the [[Second Great Awakening]] revival in the [[United States]]. The name refers to belief in the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming (or \"Second Advent\") of Jesus Christ]]. [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as [[Millerism|Millerites]].\n\nAlthough the Adventist churches hold much in common, their [[Christian theology|theologies]] differ on whether the [[intermediate state]] is [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is [[annihilationism|annihilation]] or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of {{bibleverse ||Daniel|8|NKJV}} refers to the one in [[heavenly sanctuary|heaven]] or one on earth.<ref name=\"Handbook\">{{Citation | section = Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches | pages = 256\u2013276 | first1 = Frank S | last1 = Mead | first2 = Samuel S | last2 = Hill | first3 = Craig D | last3 = Atwood | title = Handbook of Denominations in the United States | edition = 12th | place = Nashville | publisher = Abingdon Press}}</ref> The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole [[Bible]], leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]].

From the perspective of their persecutors, the \"Baptizers\" baptized for the second time those \"who as infants had already been baptized\". Since the denigrative term ''Anabaptist'' signifies ''re-baptizing'', it is considered a polemic term and therefore has been dropped from use in modern German. However, in the English-speaking world it is still in use in order to distinguish the \"Baptizers\" more clearly from the \"Baptists\" who emerged later.</ref> While most Anabaptists adhered to a [[Sermon on the Mount#Analysis and interpretation|literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount]], which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise.<ref group = \"lower-alpha\">For example, the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion|followers of Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] and [[Balthasar Hubmaier]].</ref> They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Hutterites]] and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism.

Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the [[five points of Calvinism]], though these points identify the Calvinist view on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things\u2014in salvation but also in all of life. This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] and [[total depravity]].\n\nThe biggest Reformed association is the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]] with more than 80 million members in 211 member denominations around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcrc.ch/theology/ |title=Theology and Communion |website=Wcrc.ch |accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcrc.ch/wcrc-member-churches/ |title=Member Churches |website=Wcrc.ch |accessdate=5 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412134752/http://wcrc.ch/wcrc-member-churches/ |archivedate=12 April 2014 |df= }}</ref> There are more conservative Reformed federations like the [[World Reformed Fellowship]] and the [[International Conference of Reformed Churches]], as well as [[List of Reformed denominations|independent churches]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:John Calvin - Young.jpg|[[John Calvin]]'s theological thought influenced a variety of [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Continental Reformed church|Continental Reformed]], [[United and uniting churches|United]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and other Reformed churches.\nFile:Lorimer, Ordination.jpg|The Ordination of Elders in a Scottish Kirk, by [[John Henry Lorimer]], 1891.\nFile:First_Congregational_Church,_Cheshire_CT.jpg|A Congregational church in [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire, Connecticut, United States]].</gallery>\n\n===Lutheranism===\n{{Main|Lutheranism}}\nLutheranism identifies with the [[Theology of Martin Luther|theology]] of Martin Luther\u2014a [[Germans|German]] monk and priest, [[ecclesiastical]] reformer, and theologian.\n\nLutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification \"by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]] through [[Sola fide|faith alone]] on the basis of [[Sola scriptura|Scripture alone]]\", the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith, rejecting the assertion made by Roman Catholic leaders at the [[Council of Trent]] that authority comes from both Scriptures and [[Sacred tradition|Tradition]].<ref>''Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent'', Fourth Session, Decree on Sacred Scripture (Denzinger 783 [1501]; Schaff 2:79\u201381).

The term ''Pentecostal'' is derived from [[Pentecost]], the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the Jewish [[Feast of Weeks]]. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] upon the followers of [[Jesus Christ]], as described in the [[Second Chapter of Acts|second chapter]] of the [[Book of Acts]].\n\nThis branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit\u2013filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of [[spiritual gift]]s such as [[speaking in tongues]] and [[divine healing]]\u2014two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the [[Apostolic Age]] of the [[early church]]. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term ''Apostolic'' or ''[[Full Gospel]]'' to describe their movement.\n\nPentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations, including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ, both in the United States and elsewhere. There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide, and the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the [[global South]]. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches through the [[Charismatic Movement]]. Together, [[Charismatic Christianity|Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity]] numbers over 500 million adherents.<ref name=PewGlobalChristianity67>{{Citation | publisher=[[Pew Forum]] on Religion and Public Life | date=19 December 2011 | url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Christian/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf | title=Global Christianity: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population | page=67 | access-date=25 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723134849/http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Christian/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf | archive-date=23 July 2013 | url-status=dead }}.</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Charlesparham.png|[[Charles Fox Parham]], who associated glossolalia with the baptism in the Holy Spirit.\nFile:RH Worship Team.jpg |thumb|Contemporary Christian worship in Rock Harbor Church, [[Costa Mesa]], United States.\nFile:Ravensburg Freie Christengemeinde Saal.jpg|A Pentecostal church in [[Ravensburg, Germany]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Other Protestants===\n{{Main|List of Christian denominations#Protestant}}\n\nThere are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches, and are far smaller in membership.

[[Evangelicalism]] is a prominent example. Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism, some are Christian-wide. Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], such as does it the [[Charismatic Movement]], which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to [[Pentecostals]] into the various branches of Christianity. [[Neo-charismatic churches]] are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement.

Some of them are also in evidence today. Others appeared during the centuries following the Reformation and disappeared gradually with the time, such as much of [[Pietism]]. Some inspired the current transdenominational ones, such as [[Evangelicalism]] which has its foundation in the [[Christian fundamentalism]].\n\n===Arminianism===\n{{Main|Arminianism|Remonstrants}}\n{{See also|History of the Calvinist\u2013Arminian debate}}\n[[File:James Arminius 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Jacobus Arminius was a Dutch Reformed theologian, whose views influenced parts of Protestantism. A small Remonstrant community remains in the Netherlands.]]\nArminianism is based on [[Christian theology|theological]] ideas of the [[Dutch Reformed]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609) and his historic supporters known as [[Remonstrants]]. His teachings held to the [[five solae]] of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and other [[Protestant Reformers]]. Jacobus Arminius was a student of [[Theodore Beza]] at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a [[soteriological]] diversification of [[Calvinism]].<ref>\"Chambers Biographical Dictionary,\" ed. Magnus Magnusson (Chambers: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 62.</ref> However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.<ref>Kenneth D. Keathley, \"The Work of God: Salvation,\" in ''A Theology for the Church'', ed. Daniel L. Akin (Nashville: B&H Academic, 2007), 703.</ref> Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the [[Baptists]] in the 16th century,<ref>Robert G. Torbet, ''A History of the Baptists'', third edition</ref> the [[Methodists]] in the 18th century and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in the 19th century.\n\nThe original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself are commonly defined as Arminianism, but more broadly, the term may embrace the teachings of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]], and others as well. [[Arminianism#Classical Arminianism|Classical Arminianism]] and [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]] are the two main schools of thought. Wesleyan Arminianism is often identical with Methodism. The two systems of Calvinism and Arminianism share both history and many doctrines, and the [[History of Christianity|history of Christian theology]]. However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine [[predestination]] and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. In short, the difference can be seen ultimately by whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion.  Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.<ref>Gonzalez, Justo L. ''The Story of Christianity, Vol. Two: The Reformation to the Present Day'' (New York: Harpercollins Publishers, 1985; reprint \u2013 Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 180</ref>\n\n===Pietism===\n{{Main|Pietism|Haugean movement}}\n\nPietism was an influential movement within [[Lutheranism]] that combined the 17th-century Lutheran principles with the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] emphasis on individual piety and living a vigorous [[Christianity|Christian]] life.<ref>In places, such as parts of England and America, where Pietism was frequently juxtaposed with [[Roman Catholicism]], Catholics also became naturally influenced by Pietism, helping to foster a stronger tradition of congregational hymn-singing, including among Pietists who converted to Catholicism and brought their pietistic inclination with them, such as [[Frederick William Faber]].</ref>\n\nIt began in the late 17th century, reached its zenith in the mid-18th century, and declined through the 19th century, and had almost vanished in America by the end of the 20th century. While declining as an identifiable Lutheran group, some of its theological tenets influenced Protestantism generally, inspiring the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest [[John Wesley]] to begin the [[Methodism|Methodist]] movement and [[Alexander Mack]] to begin the [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]] movement among [[Anabaptists]].\n\nThough Pietism shares an emphasis on personal behavior with the [[Puritan]] movement, and the two are often confused, there are important differences, particularly in the concept of the role of religion in government.<ref>Calvinist Puritans believed that government was ordained by God to enforce Christian behavior upon the world; pietists see the government as a part of the world, and believers were called to voluntarily live faithful lives independent of government.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Philipp Jakob Spener.jpg|[[Philipp Jakob Spener]], German pioneer and founder of Pietism.\nFile:Pietism.JPG|Pietism has been a strong cultural influence in Scandinavia.\nFile:Der breite und der schmale Weg 2008.jpg|''The Broad and the Narrow Way'', a popular German Pietist painting, 1866.\n</gallery>\n\n===Puritanism, English dissenters and nonconformists===\n{{Main|Puritanism|English Dissenters|Independent (religion)|Nonconformist (Protestantism){{!}}Nonconformism|English Presbyterianism|Ecclesiastical separatism|17th-century denominations in England}}\n\nThe Puritans were a group of English Protestants in the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th]] and [[Christianity in the 17th century|17th centuries]], which sought to purify the [[Church of England]] of what they considered to be [[Roman Catholic]] practices, maintaining that the church was only partially reformed. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some of the returning [[Marian exiles|clergy exiled under Mary I]] shortly after the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1558, as an activist movement within the [[Church of England]].\n\nPuritans were blocked from changing the established church from within, and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands (and later to New England), and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later into Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the [[Synod of Dort]] they were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted [[Puritan Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarianism]] in the 17th century, and were influenced by [[millennialism]].\n\nThey formed, and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of [[worship]] and [[doctrine]], as well as personal and group [[pietism|piety]]. Puritans adopted a [[Reformed theology]], but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva. In church polity, some advocated for separation from all other Christians, in favor of autonomous [[gathered church]]es. These separatist and [[independent (religion)|independent]] strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a [[Presbyterian polity]] in the [[Westminster Assembly]] were unable to forge a new English national church.\n\nNonconforming Protestants along with the Protestant refugees from continental Europe were the primary founders of the United States of America.\n<gallery>\nFile:John.Cotton.cropped.jpg|[[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]], who sparked the [[Antinomian Controversy]] with his [[free grace theology]].\nFile:Landing-Bacon.PNG|[[Pilgrim Fathers]] landing at [[Plymouth Rock]] in 1620.\nFile:OldShipEntrance.jpg|Built in 1681, the [[Old Ship Church]] in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] is the oldest church in America in continuous ecclesiastical use.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Butterfield | first = Fox | title = The Perfect New England Town | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/14/travel/the-perfect-new-england-village.html?sec=&spon= | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 14 May 1989 | accessdate = 30 May 2010}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-orthodoxy and paleo-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Neo-orthodoxy|Paleo-orthodoxy}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-1283-23A, Wuppertal, Evangelische Gesellschaft, Jahrestagung.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Karl Barth]], often regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian of the twentieth century<ref name = \"McGrath2011\">{{citation| first = Alister E | last = McGrath| title= Christian Theology: An Introduction |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bus5TyjTfxYC&pg=PA76 | date= 14 January 2011| publisher= John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9770-3 |page = 76}}</ref><ref name = \"BrownCollinson2012\">{{citation | first1 = Stuart | last1 = Brown | first2 = Diane | last2 = Collinson| first3 =Robert | last3 = Wilkinson | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz8OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA52 | date = 10 September 2012| publisher = Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-06043-1 | page = 52}}</ref>]]\nA non-fundamentalist rejection of liberal Christianity along the lines of the [[Christian existentialism]] of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], who attacked the [[Right Hegelians#Hegelian theologians|Hegelian]] state churches of his day for \"dead orthodoxy,\" neo-orthodoxy is associated primarily with [[Karl Barth]], [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]], and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]. Neo-orthodoxy sought to counter-act the tendency of liberal theology to make theological accommodations to modern scientific perspectives. Sometimes called \"crisis theology,\" in the existentialist sense of the word crisis, also sometimes called ''neo-evangelicalism'', which uses the sense of \"evangelical\" pertaining to continental European Protestants rather than American evangelicalism. \"Evangelical\" was the originally preferred label used by Lutherans and Calvinists, but it was replaced by the names some Catholics used to [[Labelling#Labelling in argumentation|label]] a heresy with the name of its founder.\n\n[[Paleo-orthodoxy]] is a movement similar in some respects to neo-evangelicalism but emphasizing the ancient Christian consensus of the undivided church of the first millennium AD, including in particular the early creeds and church councils as a means of properly understanding the scriptures. This movement is cross-denominational. A prominent theologian in this group is [[Thomas Oden]], a Methodist.\n\n===Christian fundamentalism===\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\nIn reaction to liberal Bible critique, [[fundamentalism]] arose in the 20th century, primarily in the United States, among those denominations most affected by Evangelicalism.\nFundamentalist theology tends to stress [[Biblical inerrancy]] and [[Biblical literalism]].\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some have tended to confuse evangelicalism and fundamentalism; however, the labels represent very distinct differences of approach that both groups are diligent to maintain, although because of fundamentalism's dramatically smaller size it often gets classified simply as an ultra-conservative branch of evangelicalism.\n\n===Modernism and liberalism===\n{{Main|Liberal Christianity}}\nModernism and liberalism do not constitute rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought into the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] within the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] in the 1920s.\n\n==Protestant culture==\n{{Main|Protestant culture}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=200\n|image1=2006 Berliner Dom Front.jpg\n|caption1=The [[Berlin Cathedral]], a [[United and uniting churches|United Protestant]] cathedral in [[Berlin]].\n|image2=Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]].''}}\n\nAlthough the Reformation was a religious movement, it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life: marriage and family, education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy, and the arts.<ref name=\"Karl Heussi 1956 pp. 317\u2013319\"/> Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" /> Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', p. 319</ref> Since about 1950, women have entered the ministry, and some have assumed leading positions (e.g. [[bishop]]s), in most Protestant churches.\n\nAs the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost.

Luther's doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise ''On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture''; 1523).<ref>Original German title: ''{{lang|de|Dass eine christliche Versammlung oder Gemeine Recht und Macht habe, alle Lehre zu beurteilen und Lehrer zu berufen, ein- und abzusetzen: Grund und Ursach aus der Schrift}}''</ref> Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyter]]s) in his representative church government.<ref>Clifton E.

He appreciated the advantages of [[democracy]]: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''{{lang|de|Evangelisches Soziallexikon}}'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). Thus he and his followers resisted political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.<ref>Clifton E.

On the contrary, the visible unity of the ''catholic'' or ''universal church'' was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted.{{efn|For more on this, see [[crypto-paganism]] and the [[Great Apostasy#Overview|Great Apostasy]]. In some areas, pagan Europeans were forced to adopt Christianity at least outwardly, such as after being defeated in battle by Christians. However, outlawing their paganism didn't just make it go away. Rather, it persisted as crypto-paganism. For example, [[Philip Melanchthon]], in his 1537 [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] identified the mechanical character of [[ex opere operato]] sacraments as being a form of pagan [[Deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic philosophy]].}} Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. The Protestant Reformers formed a new and radically different theological opinion on ecclesiology, that the visible Church is \"catholic\" (lower-case \"c\") rather than \"Catholic\" (upper-case \"C\"). Accordingly, there is not an indefinite number of parochial, congregational or national churches, constituting, as it were, so many ecclesiastical individualities, but one great spiritual republic of which these various organizations form a part,{{efn|This is the position of the Protestants who believe the church is visible. For those who think the church is invisible, organizations are irrelevant, as only individual sinners can be saved.}} although they each have very different opinions. This was markedly far-removed from the traditional and historic Roman Catholic understanding that the Roman Catholic Church was the one true Church of Christ.{{efn|See [[Augustine of Hippo#Ecclesiology|Ecclesiology of Augustine of Hippo]] for an example of a church father who discussed the invisible church.}}\n\nYet in the Protestant understanding, the ''visible church'' is not a genus, so to speak, with so many species under it.{{efn|This is a reference to the [[Marks of the Church]] in Reformed theology. It is thus you may think of the State, but the visible church is a ''totum integrale'', it is an empire, with an ethereal emperor, rather than a visible one. The churches of the various nationalities constitute the provinces of this empire; and though they are so far independent of each other, yet they are so one, that membership in one is membership in all, and separation from one is separation from all.... This conception of the church, of which, in at least some aspects, we have practically so much lost sight, had a firm hold of the Scottish theologians of the seventeenth century.

For example, in 381 the [[First Council of Constantinople]] recognized the sees of Rome and Constantinople as being equal in authority. Papal supremacy continued to evolve after the Reformation with the [[First Vatican Council]].}} namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church.

''Ensiklopedi Gereja'' (2005). See Also Adolf Heuken, \"Chapter One: Christianity in Pre-Colonial Indonesia\", in ''A History of Christianity in Indonesia'', eds. Jan Aritonang and Karel Steenbrink, pgs. 3\u20137, Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2008, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17026-1}}</ref> No record nor trace of such a community remains, and the first significant evidence of Christian activity came with the arrival of Portuguese traders in the 16th century.\n\nThe Portuguese arrived in the [[Malacca Sultanate]] (modern-day Malaysia) in 1509 seeking access to its wealth. Although initially well-received, the [[Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)|capture of Goa]] in 1510 as well as other Muslim\u2013Christian conflicts convinced the Malaccan Muslims that the Portuguese Christians would be a hostile presence. The resulting [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|capture of Malacca]] in 1511 is believed to have enhanced a sense of Muslim solidarity against the Christian Portuguese, and ongoing resistance against the Portuguese came from Muslim [[Aceh]] as well as from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Although the Portuguese built some churches in [[Portuguese Malacca]] itself, their evangelical influence in neighbouring territories was perhaps more negative than positive in promulgating Christianity.\n\n===Bali===\n[[File:DenpasarSt.JosephChurch.JPG|thumb|Saint Joseph's Catholic Church, [[Denpasar]], [[Bali]]]]\n[[File:Altar Paroki Santo Yoseph, Denpasar.jpg|thumb|Saint Joseph's church altar]]\nBali, unlike neighbouring Java, retained its Hindu culture when Islam came to the Indonesian archipelago, even gaining strength in this with the absorption of Javanese Hindus not wishing to convert to Islam. The Dutch began to build a presence on the island after 1846 in [[Singaraja]], [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|subduing it entirely]] in 1908. Three missionaries from the Protestant Utrecht Mission Society began work around Singaraja in 1864. Only one Balinese was baptised, and in 1881 following a disagreement, he conspired to have one of the missionaries murdered.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapter Fifteen</ref><ref>Seeking the Asian Face of Jesus \u2013 Chris Sudgen</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the Dutch government forbade further missionary activity, wishing to avoid further such disruption. In 1930, a Chinese-speaking missionary from CAMA (see also above) obtained permission to work in Bali, in order to serve the needs of Chinese Christians. Several hundred native Balinese decided to convert. The reaction of the Hindu Balinese to the missionary's edicts \u2013 to destroy idols and temples as being of the devil \u2013 was hostile: the Christian converts had their rice fields sabotaged and they were expelled from their villages. As a result, the Dutch again withdrew permission to preach from foreign missionaries, as of 1933, on the basis that the missionary had not kept to the Chinese commununities, but had also preached to the native Balinese.\n\nA native Javanese missionary began work in Bali in 1933, and in 1937 the Dutch posted a minister to Denpasar of the Dutch 'Indische Kerk', catering for Europeans in the first instance, but also to the 1000+ Protestant Balinese, while a Catholic priest was posted to Denpasar in 1935, from where several hundred Balinese converts were made in several years.\n\nA Dutch response to the hostility of the Balinese to Christian converts was to establish a Protestant village in Bali, that of Blimbingsari, in 1939. Palasari, its neighbour, a Catholic village, was established in 1940.\n\nBlimbingsari village developed the Gereja Kristen Protestan Bali, the Balinese Protestant church, which was established in 1948. In its early years the GKPB and its antecedent followed the theology of [[Hendrik Kraemer]] in the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]] tradition, explicitly rejecting most of Balinese culture as heathen and unchristian, disposing of [[gamelan]] orchestras in favour of Western arts. As a result, many Balinese Protestants left Bali, where they were largely excluded from everyday Balinese life, to the extent that there are more GKPB members outside of Bali than within Bali.\n\nIn 1972 native Balinese I Wayan Mastra, who grew up in a Balinese Hindu family, but converted to Christianity while at a Christian school in Java,<ref>Seeking the Asian Face of Jesus \u2013 Chris Sudgen; p. 42</ref> became head of the GKPB church, and began a process of Balinisation. For instance, when the Blimbingsari church, a basic stone and wood building was destroyed by an [[1976 Bali earthquake|earthquake in 1976]], it was rebuilt in more Balinese [[pendopo]] style, with a garden with running water, traditional Balinese entrance and a semi-open aspect. Subsequent GKPB churches have followed a similar pattern. The Balinese Catholic church was from the beginning more open to Balinese traditions.\n\nThe Christian communities of Blimbingsari and Palasari<ref>http://www.baliblog.com/travel-tips/blimbingsari-palasari-christian-communities-in-bali.html</ref><ref>[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]: ''[http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2007/3/24/lifetravel/16931543&sec=lifetravel Beatific Blimbingsari]'', 24 March 2007</ref> are the core of Balinese Christianity, with the religion very much in a minority in the rest of the island.\n\n===Batavia (Jakarta)===\n[[File:AMH-4802-KB The Dutch church or 'Kruiskerk' at Batavia.jpg|thumb|Dutch church or 'Kruiskerk' in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] c. 1682]]\nAs the centre for the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] in the Indies, there were many European Christians as well as Asian Christians from areas proselytised by the Portuguese. The predominant denomination in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] was Dutch Reformed but there were also Lutherans and Catholics. The Dutch governors constructed Reformed churches, for Portuguese, Dutch and Malay speakers. Other religions were formally prohibited, but in practice Chinese temples as well as mosques remained in existence, and despite various measures to promote Christianity, there was a high degree of religious diversity and never at any time a Christian majority. At other VOC settlements clergy were likewise provided, such as at [[Semarang]], where the minister had a congregation that was only half Reformed and half Catholic or Lutheran and consequently efforts were made to provide inclusive preaching. Largely, however, the VOC had little impact or interest in upsetting their business interests in favour of religious ideals, and indeed the theology of the Dutch Reformed church was opposed to the mass baptism adopted by Catholic missionaries, and their impact on Java as a whole was very minor.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 121\u2013132</ref>\n\n===East Nusa Tenggara===\n[[File:Gereja Masehi Injili di Timor di Labuan Bajo.JPG|thumb|left|Dutch reformed church \"Gereja Masehi Injil di Timor\" in Labuan Bajo, [[Nusa Tenggara Timur]]]]\nPortuguese traders ventured from Malacca to [[Timor]] to purchase [[sandalwood]]. During their trading missions they were frequently becalmed, and during this time are said to have converted numerous people of [[Solor Archipelago|Solor island]], Timor and [[Flores]]. Hearing of these conversions, three [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionaries were sent from [[Malacca]], arriving and establishing a church in 1562 in Flores. The mission was given financial support from the Portuguese in Goa, enabling the construction of mission stations in the area.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapter Four</ref>\n\nA major setback came when two headmen were imprisoned and mistreated by the Portuguese in 1598, resulting in a rebellion and desecration of churches throughout the region, as those opposed to the Portuguese, many of whom had been previously converted to Islam in the early 16th century, attacked the Portuguese and the Dominican mission. Subsequent setbacks came in the form of the arrival of the Dutch, who allied against the Portuguese Christians.\n\nA new mission was established in 1617, which successfully furthered the spread of Catholicism in the region, including minor military ventures led from [[Larantuka]] on Flores, rejecting the dominionship of Islamic Makassar. 'Black' Portuguese control over Larantuka, and influence also over Timor, was settled by a truce with the Dutch in 1661. The Catholic community in east Flores was strengthened by the expulsion of Catholics from Makassar in 1660. In [[Portuguese Timor]] the Portuguese mission at [[Lifau]] (which supported the nominal cathedral of the Diocese of Malacca, as the Dutch would no longer tolerate one there) was in conflict with the Dutch at [[Kupang]], and wars were fought between the two sides with Catholic villages regarded as Portuguese and therefore enemies of the Dutch. In the first half of the 18th century 'Portuguese'-supporting factions were defeated entirely by the Dutch in West Timor, confining Catholicism to the eastern part of that island.\n\nThe Dominican mission declined in the late 18th century, and in 1817 the last priest covering Flores died. Many Catholics reverted to pagan practices, but still, thousands remained, continuing to follow Catholic pageantry. Portugal, severely weakened, withdrew from all but East Timor, but thanks to treaties signed in the 1850s, freedom of religion was guaranteed in areas being exchanged between the two countries. Following this treaty Catholicism strengthened considerably in Flores after 1860. In the western part of Flores, Dutch effective control over the area since 1907 led to the support of the spread of Catholicism among the [[Manggarai people|Manggarai]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Steenbrink |first=Karel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc5gAAAAQBAJ |title=Catholics in Indonesia, 1808-1942: A Documented History.

Following this two missionaries were sent in 1834, and in total between 1834 and 1859 20 missionaries were sent to the region, although mortality rates were high and never more than 7 were active at one time. Permission for the activity from the Dutch government was obtained after 1836.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapter 12</ref>\n\nAlthough the mission was headquartered in Banjarmasin, where the pastoral needs of European residents were supplied, it was apparent that converting the Muslims who dominate the cities of Kalimantan was an impossible task, and instead efforts were focused on the [[Dayak people]] of the interior, who practised traditional religions. Johann Becker, a capable linguist, translated the gospels into the Dayak [[Ngaju language]].\n\nThe missionaries also bought 1,100 Dayak slaves over the period 1836 to 1859 in order to emancipate them as free men. Despite their efforts, only a few hundred were baptised. In 1859 the [[Banjarmasin War]] broke out, several missionaries were killed, and the mission was excluded from the region until 1866 by the Dutch, which fought to bring the former Sultanate of Banjarmasin under direct rule.\n\nIn 1866 the missionaries returned. Despite building many mission stations and schools, only 3,000 had converted by 1911, as against 100,000 Batak Christians in the similarly resourced Rhenish mission of North Sumatra. It has been suggested that this slow progress was due to the fragmented nature of the Dayaks\u2014with no king or dominant regional powers, there was little prospect of mass conversion, while new converts faced exclusion from their traditional ceremonies.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the RMS was replaced by the Basel Mission. It transferred control to the first independent church, the 'Gereja Dayak Evangelis', in 1935, covering a vast geographical area from Banjarmasin 1,300&nbsp;km to the west and 600&nbsp;km inland. In 1950 the church became the more ethnically inclusive 'Gereja Kalimantan Evangelis' (GKE) as transmigrants from other parts of Indonesia to Kalimantan joined the congregation. The church has approximately 250,000 members, and is based in [[Central Kalimantan]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oikoumene.org/member-churches/regions/asia/indonesia/kalimantan-evangelical-church.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045136/http://www.oikoumene.org/member-churches/regions/asia/indonesia/kalimantan-evangelical-church.html |archive-date=5 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Catholic Church====\n[[File:Tumbang Titi church 101016-7875 mp.jpg|thumb|left|Catholic church in Tumbang Titi in [[Ketapang]], [[West Kalimantan]]]]\nThe Vatican agreed a [[Concordat]] with the Dutch in 1847 that Kalimantan was a possible mission area, provided they did not settle on rivers where other missionaries were already active.\n\nChinese, historically a major force in West Kalimantan, included among their number some Catholics, who had migrated from other parts of the region. A first church was consecreated in [[Singkawang]] in 1876, and from here in 1885 the post was established as a pastoral centre for the Jesuit priest who would be responsible for the area. A mission to the Dayaks of [[Sejiram]] was established in 1890, and a church<ref>http://mungan87.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/the-ancient-building-in-sejiram/</ref> constructed. The Singkawang and Sejiram missions closed in 1896 and 1898, respectively, due to lack of personnel.\n\nThe mission was re-established in Singkawang with [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Friars in 1905. The first new missions (1905\u20131913) were aimed at the coastal Chinese of [[Pemangkat|Pamangkat]], [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] (location of West Kalimantan's Bishop, as it was the largest town in the region) and [[Sambas Regency|Sambas]], as well as the deep Dayak interior, where the Catholics hoped to convert without competition from Islam, before working back towards the coast.\n\nThe Catholic training centre was established at [[Nyarumkop]], close to Singkawang, where children (mostly Dayak, as the Chinese were less inclined towards Catholicism in West Kalimantan than in other parts of Indonesia \u2013 in 1980 only 3% of Chinese in West Kalimantan were Catholics) were educated and Catholic teachers trained.\n\nCatholic growth prior to World War Two was slow, but subsequently saw some success, most notably after 1965 and the [[New Order (Indonesia)]], where all Indonesians were required to proclaim an approved religion. Growth in the Catholic population from 1950 to 2000 in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pontianak]] was from 1.1% to 8.7%, in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sintang]] from 1.7% to 20.1%. In the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sanggau]], just over 50% of the population are now Catholic, while in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ketapang]] it is around 20%. Catholic presence in East and South Kalimantan is much lower than the West Kalimantan Dioceses.\n\n====Christian and Missionary Alliance====\nMissionaries of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] began one of several Indonesian missions in [[East Kalimantan]] in 1929 in the region of [[Kutai]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1363&lg=eng |title=Gereja Kemah Injil Indonesia |website=www.reformiert-online.net}}</ref> George Fisk, the lead missionary, asked only that new converts accept Jesus as their saviour, unlike the Catholics, who required two years of teaching. The [[West Kalimantan]] mission, established in 1933 in [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] ventured up the [[Kapuas River]], where they found existing Catholic converts, some of whom converted to Protestantism. The Catholics, however, had an advantage over the CAMA Protestants in that CAMA, but not the Catholics, prohibited the consumption of alcohol.\n\nThe CAMA mission acted quickly in establishing churches in the interior, obtaining the use of an aeroplane from CAMA, and became part of the Kemah Injil Gereja Masehi Indonesia, or Tabernacle Gospel Messianic Indonesian church.\n\nIn 1990 the church had 98,000 members in East Kalimantan, and 62,000 in West Kalimantan, making it the third-largest Christian denomination in Kalimantan after the Catholic Church and the GKE.\n\n===Maluku===\n[[File:The Cathedral of Ambon.jpg|thumb|The Fransiscus Xaverius Cathedral in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]]]]\nWhile the Portuguese religious influence over Malacca and Sumatra was very small, their mission to [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], the important spice islands of the eastern archipelago, was more significant. They landed first in Ambon, where the natives were already polarised into 'uli-lima' (group of five) and 'uli-siwa' (group of nine), the former having converted to Islam and allying with the Muslim Javanese, with the latter retaining traditional beliefs. The Portuguese found themselves allied with the ulu-siwa, whose opposition to the uli-lima made Christianity an appealing choice.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapters 3 and 5</ref>\n\nThe Islamic [[Sultanate of Ternate]] sought the patronage of the Portuguese, offering a trading monopoly in return for military support against rival local kingdoms. In 1534, the first Catholic community was established in [[Halmahera]], the result of an appeal to the Portuguese for protection from Halmahera against Ternatean incursions\u2014protection offered on condition of converting to Christianity.\n\nFurther evangelising resulted in many Ternate nobles converting to Christianity, while [[Francis Xavier]], a Catholic missionary and co-founder of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] worked in Ternate, Moro and Ambon briefly in 1546 and also 1547. St Francis wrote that most of the population were 'pagan', and hated the local Muslims, resisting conversion to Islam. He appealed for support to save souls in Maluku, which arrived in 1547 in the shape of Nuno Ribeiro, a Jesuit who is said to have converted five hundred people before being murdered in 1549.\n\nSultan Hairun of Ternate had refused to convert to Christianity, regarding himself as defender of the Islamic faith, and when he was murdered by a Portuguese Captain in 1570, his son, Baabullah, the new Sultan, reacted angrily, expelling the Portuguese from Maluku, waging war against both the Portuguese and their local Christian allies. As a result, the Jesuit mission was abandoned almost entirely in 1573, and Christians were killed or converted at the point of a sword. The faith survived only around the Jesuit fort in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]; even there, there was a shortage of priests due to dangerous conditions, and many local people did not have knowledge of Christian creeds, and were easily apostatised to Islam or traditional beliefs.\n\nThe Portuguese by now largely impotent, the Dutch, allied with the Muslim locals against their mutual Portuguese enemy, seized the fort of Ambon in 1605. The Dutch expelled the Jesuits and Portuguese, adopting the Catholic churches for Protestant worship, which was supported through the establishment of numerous Protestant schools, where the teachers also led Sunday worship. Boundaries between Muslim and Christians were well-established on Ambon, but in [[Seram Island|Seram]] and [[Buru]], proselytisation took place converting 'pagans' to Christianity, the policy of the VOC being to contain the spread of Islam without converting existing Muslims. Idols were destroyed by the Dutch teachers as new Christians were prohibited from continuing to follow their traditional religion.\n\n===Papua===\n[[File:Wamena Church Betlehem.jpg|thumb|Betlehem church in [[Wamena]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]]]]\nPapua, unlike the rest of Indonesia, has had no historic contact with Muslim preachers, and had its first Christian missionary contact in 1855. With little competition, the mission was relatively successful. Missionaries Carl Ottow and Johann Geisler, under the initiative of [[Ottho Gerhard Heldring]], entered Papua at [[Mansinam]] island, near [[Manokwari]] on 5 February 1855, and are said to have knelt on the beach and prayed, claiming Papua for Christ. Since 2001, the fifth of February has been a Papuan public holiday, recognising this first landing.<ref>A History of Christianity in Indonesia \u2013 Chapter 8</ref>\n\nOttow and Geisler studied the [[Numfor]] [[Biak language|language]], and were subsequently granted a monthly stipend by the Dutch government. The missionaries proposed a scheme to start a [[tobacco]] plantation using Christian Javanese to train the Papuans, and were given 5,000 guilders by the Dutch and two Christian Javanese tobacco farmers. The Dutch administrators perceived the missionaries activities as a cut-price means of colonisation, while the missionaries themselves made profits from trading Papuan goods. The Utrecht Mission Society (UZV) joined the mission from 1863; they were prohibited from trade, and instead established a trading committee.\n\nThe UZV established a Christian-based education system as well as regular church services. Initially the Papuans' attendance was encouraged using bribes of [[Areca nut|betel nut]] and tobacco, but subsequently this was stopped. In addition, slaves were bought to be raised as step children and then freed. By 1880, only 20 Papuans had been baptised, including many freed slaves.\n\nThe Dutch government established posts in [[Netherlands New Guinea]] in 1898, a move welcomed by the missionaries, who saw orderly Dutch rule as the essential antidote to Papua paganism. Subsequently, the UZV mission had more success, with a mass conversion near [[Cenderawasih Bay]] in 1907 and the evangelisation of the [[Sentani (people)|Sentani]] people by Pamai, a native Papuan in the late 1920s. Due to the [[Great Depression]], the mission suffered a funding shortfall, and switched to native evangelists, who had the advantage of speaking the local language (rather than Malay), but were often poorly trained. The mission extended in the 1930s to [[Yos Sudarso Bay]], and the UZV mission by 1934 had over 50,000 Christians, 90% of them in North Papua, the remainder in West Papua. By 1942 the mission had expanded to 300 schools in 300 congregations.\n\nThe first Catholic presence in Papua was in [[Fakfak]], a Jesuit mission in 1894. In 1902 the Vicariate of Netherlands New Guinea was established. Despite the earlier activity in Fakfak, the Dutch restricted the Catholic Church to the southern part of the island, where they were active especially around [[Merauke]]. The mission campaigned against the destructive practices of [[headhunting]] and promiscuity among the [[Marind people|Marind-anim]]. Following the [[1918 flu pandemic]], which killed one in five in the area, the Dutch government agreed to the establishment of model villages, based on European conditions, including wearing European clothes, but which the people would submit to only by violence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nIn 1925 the Catholics sought to re-establish their mission in Fakfak; permission was granted in 1927. This brought the Catholics into conflict with the Protestants in North Papua, who suggested expanding to South Papua in retaliation. The Catholics and Protestants also began a race for the highlands.\n\nAfter World War Two, New Guinea remained outside of Indonesian control, under Dutch administration, but in 1963, it was absorbed under dubious circumstances into Indonesia. The Indonesians were suspicious of 'Dutch' elements, which included church teachers and missionaries, who had been educated in Dutch fashion, and began an overnight Indonesianisation. Papua acquired a significant population of mostly Muslim [[Transmigration program|transmigrants]], who were given land and a house by the Indonesian government. Religious differences as well as cultural with Muslim Indonesian army and administrators have exarcebated the [[Papua conflict]], in which over thousands of Papuans have been killed by Indonesian security forces. Some human rights groups like the [[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|IWGIA]] estimate the number of killed Papuans to be over 100,000.<ref>[[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|IWGIA]]: ''The Indigenous World 2006'', p. 266 ([http://www.iwgia.org/graphics/Synkron-Library/Documents/publications/Downloadpublications/IndigenousWorld/IW%202006/IW%202006.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903013604/http://www.iwgia.org//graphics/Synkron-Library/Documents/publications/Downloadpublications/IndigenousWorld/IW%202006/IW%202006.pdf |date=3 September 2010 }})</ref> The majority of government resources were directed to non-Papuan Muslims rather than Papuan Christians, and non-Papuan Muslims were also given senior administrative roles. Church leaders, suspected of Papuan nationalism, were strictly monitored and in many cases killed where they strayed too close to Papuan separatist movements.\n\n===Sulawesi===\n\n====Southern Sulawesi====\n[[File:Church in Rantepao.JPG|thumb|Catholic church in [[Rantepao]], [[South Sulawesi]]]]\nThe pork-eating leaders of [[Makassar]] in southern [[Sulawesi]] expressed an interest in Christianity on several occasions in the 16th century, and while a request was made to Malacca for missionaries, none were forthcoming, perhaps because of the lack of commercial opportunities (spices) in the area, and from 1605 the area converted to Islam, having received instruction in the faith from [[Johor]]. Subsequently, following the fall of Portuguese Malacca, many Catholics, including Jesuit priests, fled to Makassar, which was tolerant of their faith, but by 1660 the Dutch forced the expulsion of the Portuguese, who fled to Macau and Flores.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 59\u201362</ref>\n\n====Northern Sulawesi====\nThe Portuguese baptised over a thousand in [[Manado]], where the Portuguese, and Christianity, were seen as a bulwark against the powerful [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate Sultanate]] directly due east. Portuguese missionary activity continued in northern Sulawesi between 1563 and 1570, but following the murder of Sultan Hairun in Ternate and the ensuing anti-Portuguese attacks, the mission was abandoned.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 62\u201368</ref>\n\nIn the Spanish-controlled [[Sangihe Islands]] and [[Talaud Islands]] in the kingdom of [[Siau Island|Siau]], lying directly north of northern Sulawesi, Catholicism had been adopted with some enthusiasm, and when the allied Dutch-Ternatean Muslim pillaged the islands in 1613 and 1615, help was sought from the Philippines to the north. Franciscans visited from [[Manila]], as did a Jesuit mission.\n\nJesuit missionaries were also active in [[Minahasan people|Minahasa]] and neighbouring areas in the first half of the 17th century, but attacks from Muslims from Ternate as well as local animist peoples meant that priests had a short life expectancy. From 1655 to 1676 the Dutch established firm control of northern Sulawesi, and Catholicism was prohibited by the ruling [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]. With Catholicism harshly suppressed, as in Ambon in Maluku, the people of Minahasa, the Sangihe and Talaud islands are to this day almost entirely Protestant (the Dutch replacing the Catholic infrastructure with the schools of Dutch Protestantism), although in the 20th century fresh Catholic mission activity commenced.\n\n===Sumatra===\n\n====The Batak mission====\n[[File:HKBP Parapat, Resort Parapat 01.JPG|thumb|[[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]] Church in [[Parapat]], [[North Sumatra]]]]\nThe largely mountainous '[[Batak]]lands' of [[North Sumatra]] were surrounded to the north by the staunchly Islamic Acehnese, to the south by the Islamic [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and to the east by the Malays (also Muslims). The 'Bataks' were regarded by outsiders as a race of pagan cannibals, and it was largely their rejection of Islam that distinguished them from their neighbours. At the turn of the 19th century the southernmost Batak people, the [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]] came, through their subjection in the [[Padri War]], to follow Islam, rejecting traditional beliefs and, frequently, their identity as 'Batak'.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 527\u2013569</ref>\n\nFurther north, however, Batak proved more resistant to the hostile Muslim invaders, and receptive indeed to Christianity. The first missionaries were sent by [[Stamford Raffles]] in 1824, at which time Sumatra was under temporary British rule. They observed that the Batak seemed receptive to new religious thought, and were likely to fall to the first mission, either Islamic or Christian, to attempt conversion.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p. 530</ref>\n\nA second mission that in 1834 of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] met with a brutal end when its two missionaries were killed by Batak resistant to outside interference in their traditional [[adat]].\n\nThe first Christian community in North Sumatra was established in [[Sipirok]], a community of (Batak) [[Angkola]] people. Three missionaries from an independent church in [[Ermelo]], Netherlands arrived in 1857, and on 7 October 1861 one of the Ermelo missionaries united with the Rhenish Missionary Society, which had been recently expelled from Kalimantan as a result of the Banjarmasin War.\n\nThe mission was immensely successful, being well supported financially from Germany, and adopted effective evangelistic strategies led by [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]], who spent most of his life from 1862 until his death in 1918 in North Sumatra, successfully converting many among the [[Simalungun Regency|Simalungun]] and [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]] as well as a minority of [[Angkola]]. Nommensen initially established Huta Dame, his 'village of peace', as Christian converts were excluded from their home villages, becoming knowledgeable in matters of Batak custom. Nommensen's success was supported by Peter Johannsen, who arrived in 1866, and has been praised for the quality of his Batak translations, as well as by respected Batak Raja Pontas, an early convert. Nommensen's theology saw Christianity as renewing rather than replacing traditional Batak customs, except in cases where [[adat]] were in direct contradiction to the Christian faith. The [[Batak Christian Protestant Church|Huria Kristen Batak Protestan]] or HKBP (Batak Protestant Christian community) is the church that was formed from Nommensen's actions. To meet the desire for education, a seminary was established, along with elementary schools in Christian villages. By 1918, on Nommensen's death, his church comprised 180,000 members, with 34 ministers and 788 teacher/preachers. The distinct identity of Batak Toba people, separate from their Muslim neighbours, and their future role within Indonesia was thus assured.\n\nAs the process of decolonising continued following World Wars 1 and 2, the HKBP continued to grow, not just in the tanah Batak, but also in Java and Medan, where many Bataks were seeking economic opportunities. The congregation grew 50% between 1951 and 1960, by which time it had reached 745,000. A growing disquiet at Toba 'imperialism' resulted in the establishment of the [[Gereja Kristen Protestan Simalungun]] and [[Gereja Kristen Protestan Angkola]] in the 1960s, both of which were expressions of a movement towards the native Simalungun and Angkola languages and traditions as against those of the Toba among their communities. In 1992, the Gereja Kristen Protestan Pakpak-Dairi, of the [[Pakpak-Dairi]] people was split from the HKBP.\n\nWhile the traditional Batak church grew through rejecting only 'negative' adat, there is a more-recent anti-adat movement among [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalists]] that perceives non-Christian elements of Batak culture, such as [[ulos]] as satanic.\n\n====Karo Church====\n[[File:GBKP.JPG|thumb|[[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] Church in [[Kabanjahe]], [[North Sumatra]]]]\nThe (Batak) [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo people]] were harassing European interests in east Sumatra, and [[Jacob Theodoor Cremer]], a Dutch administrator regarded evangelism as a means to suppress this activity. The [[Netherlands Missionary Society]] answered the call, commencing activities in the Karolands in 1890, where they engaged not only in evangelism, but also in ethnology and documenting the Karo culture. The missionaries attempted to construct a base in [[Kabanjahe]] in the Karo highlands, but were repelled by the suspicious locals.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 569\u2013584</ref>\n\nIn retaliation the Dutch administration waged a war to conquer the Karolands, as part of their final consolidation of power in the Indies. The Karo perceived Christianity as the 'Dutch religion', and its followers as 'dark-skinned Dutch'. In this context, the Karo church was initially unsuccessful, and by 1950 the church had only 5,000 members. In the years following Indonesian independence the perception of Christianity among the Karo as an emblem of colonialism faded, with the church itself adopting more elements of traditional Karo culture such as music (previously the brass band was promoted), and by 1965 the Karo church had grown to some 35,000 members, with 60,000 baptised in 1966\u20131970.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p576</ref> At the same time, Islam was also being seen as increasingly attractive. From 5,000 Muslims (mostly non-Karo) in Karoland in 1950, there were 30,000 in 1970. Although the [[Karo Batak Protestant Church|Gereja Batak Karo Protestan]] (GBKP) is the largest Karo church there are also Catholic (33,000 members as of 1986) and [[Assemblies of God|several]] [[Pentecostal Church in Indonesia|Pentecostalist]] denominations.\n\n===The 19th century===\nAfter the collapse of the VOC and defeat by the English, the Indies were eventually restored to the Dutch in 1815. By this time the [[separation of church and state]] had been established in The Netherlands. This meant that the pretence of a Protestant monopoly in the Indies was abandoned, and in 1826 the Apostolic Prefecture of Batavia was established.<ref>http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/jaka0.htm</ref>\n\nAs of 1800, there were an estimated 40,000 indigenous Protestants, in northern Sulawesi, central Maluku and Timor, as well as approximately 11,000 Catholics in east Flores and the islands around. This out of a population of a total 7 million represented just 0.7% Christians, against approximately 85% Muslims.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p141</ref> Thus it can be seen that in the last two centuries although the proportion of Muslims has remained largely constant in the archipelago, the Christian population has risen rapidly, thanks in large part to the 19th-century missionary societies, discussed below.\n\n===The 20th century===\n[[File:Messiah Cathedral in Night.jpg|thumb|[[Messiah Cathedral]] [[megachurch]], hub of [[Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Church]] in [[Jakarta]]]]\nIn 1941, there were 1.7 million Protestants and 600.000 Catholics in a population of 60 million.<ref>Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume set by Hans J.

North Sulawesi had the third highest percentage (among religions reported in the province) of Christians (68.01%), including the second-highest percentage of Protestants (63.6%) and 4.4% Catholic population.<ref name=\"2010census\" /> North Sulawesi splits between a Protestant north/east, including the [[Sangihe Islands|Sangihe]], [[Sitaro Islands Regency|Sitaro]] and [[Talaud Islands|Talaud]] islands to the north, and the entire [[Minahasa Regency|Minahasa]] region, with an Islamic majority in [[Bolaang Mongondow Regency|Mongondow]] regencies. However, there are around 25% Christians in Mongondow, and around 15% Muslims in Minahasa (except for [[Manado]] city, which has 30%).\n\n[[Gorontalo]] province is a stark contrast to its eastern neighbour, North Sulawesi. Among Indonesian provinces in 2010, Gorontalo reported the smallest number of Christians (17,320) or 0.07% of Christians within Indonesia. Gorontalo had the fourth-smallest percentage (among religions reported in the province) of Christians (1.67%), including the smallest percentage of Catholics (0.07%) and seventh-smallest percentage of Protestants (1.59%).<ref name=\"2010census\" />\n\nThe region of [[Central Sulawesi]] is overall 17% Protestant; however, this ranges from 3% in Buol, to the west of North Sulawesi, up to 56%, in the central [[Poso Regency]]. Only in the [[Banggai Islands Regency|Banggai islands]] (4%) has a Catholic populations exceeding 1%. Sigi, a neighbouring city of [[Poso]], also has a large Protestant population, at 34%.\n\n[[West Sulawesi]] is 99%+ Islamic in the south, but Mamasa, part of the [[Toraja]] lands, is 75% Protestant.\n\nThe regencies of [[South Sulawesi]] are mostly 99%+ Islamic; however, [[Tana Toraja Regency|Tana Toraja]] and [[North Toraja Regency|North Toraja]] regencies are 15% Catholic, and, respectively, 70% and 80% Protestant. In addition, the Luwu regencies and Palopo, to the north of Toraja, are around 15% Protestant.

''Ensiklopedi Gereja'' (2005). See Also Adolf Heuken, \"Chapter One: Christianity in Pre-Colonial Indonesia\", in ''A History of Christianity in Indonesia'', eds. Jan Aritonang and Karel Steenbrink, pgs. 3\u20137, Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2008, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17026-1}}</ref> No record nor trace of such a community remains, and the first significant evidence of Christian activity came with the arrival of Portuguese traders in the 16th century.\n\nThe Portuguese arrived in the [[Malacca Sultanate]] (modern-day Malaysia) in 1509 seeking access to its wealth. Although initially well-received, the [[Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)|capture of Goa]] in 1510 as well as other Muslim\u2013Christian conflicts convinced the Malaccan Muslims that the Portuguese Christians would be a hostile presence. The resulting [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|capture of Malacca]] in 1511 is believed to have enhanced a sense of Muslim solidarity against the Christian Portuguese, and ongoing resistance against the Portuguese came from Muslim [[Aceh]] as well as from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Although the Portuguese built some churches in [[Portuguese Malacca]] itself, their evangelical influence in neighbouring territories was perhaps more negative than positive in promulgating Christianity.\n\n===Bali===\n[[File:DenpasarSt.JosephChurch.JPG|thumb|Saint Joseph's Catholic Church, [[Denpasar]], [[Bali]]]]\n[[File:Altar Paroki Santo Yoseph, Denpasar.jpg|thumb|Saint Joseph's church altar]]\nBali, unlike neighbouring Java, retained its Hindu culture when Islam came to the Indonesian archipelago, even gaining strength in this with the absorption of Javanese Hindus not wishing to convert to Islam. The Dutch began to build a presence on the island after 1846 in [[Singaraja]], [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|subduing it entirely]] in 1908. Three missionaries from the Protestant Utrecht Mission Society began work around Singaraja in 1864. Only one Balinese was baptised, and in 1881 following a disagreement, he conspired to have one of the missionaries murdered.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapter Fifteen</ref><ref>Seeking the Asian Face of Jesus \u2013 Chris Sudgen</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the Dutch government forbade further missionary activity, wishing to avoid further such disruption. In 1930, a Chinese-speaking missionary from CAMA (see also above) obtained permission to work in Bali, in order to serve the needs of Chinese Christians. Several hundred native Balinese decided to convert. The reaction of the Hindu Balinese to the missionary's edicts \u2013 to destroy idols and temples as being of the devil \u2013 was hostile: the Christian converts had their rice fields sabotaged and they were expelled from their villages. As a result, the Dutch again withdrew permission to preach from foreign missionaries, as of 1933, on the basis that the missionary had not kept to the Chinese commununities, but had also preached to the native Balinese.\n\nA native Javanese missionary began work in Bali in 1933, and in 1937 the Dutch posted a minister to Denpasar of the Dutch 'Indische Kerk', catering for Europeans in the first instance, but also to the 1000+ Protestant Balinese, while a Catholic priest was posted to Denpasar in 1935, from where several hundred Balinese converts were made in several years.\n\nA Dutch response to the hostility of the Balinese to Christian converts was to establish a Protestant village in Bali, that of Blimbingsari, in 1939. Palasari, its neighbour, a Catholic village, was established in 1940.\n\nBlimbingsari village developed the Gereja Kristen Protestan Bali, the Balinese Protestant church, which was established in 1948. In its early years the GKPB and its antecedent followed the theology of [[Hendrik Kraemer]] in the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]] tradition, explicitly rejecting most of Balinese culture as heathen and unchristian, disposing of [[gamelan]] orchestras in favour of Western arts. As a result, many Balinese Protestants left Bali, where they were largely excluded from everyday Balinese life, to the extent that there are more GKPB members outside of Bali than within Bali.\n\nIn 1972 native Balinese I Wayan Mastra, who grew up in a Balinese Hindu family, but converted to Christianity while at a Christian school in Java,<ref>Seeking the Asian Face of Jesus \u2013 Chris Sudgen; p. 42</ref> became head of the GKPB church, and began a process of Balinisation. For instance, when the Blimbingsari church, a basic stone and wood building was destroyed by an [[1976 Bali earthquake|earthquake in 1976]], it was rebuilt in more Balinese [[pendopo]] style, with a garden with running water, traditional Balinese entrance and a semi-open aspect. Subsequent GKPB churches have followed a similar pattern. The Balinese Catholic church was from the beginning more open to Balinese traditions.\n\nThe Christian communities of Blimbingsari and Palasari<ref>http://www.baliblog.com/travel-tips/blimbingsari-palasari-christian-communities-in-bali.html</ref><ref>[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]: ''[http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2007/3/24/lifetravel/16931543&sec=lifetravel Beatific Blimbingsari]'', 24 March 2007</ref> are the core of Balinese Christianity, with the religion very much in a minority in the rest of the island.\n\n===Batavia (Jakarta)===\n[[File:AMH-4802-KB The Dutch church or 'Kruiskerk' at Batavia.jpg|thumb|Dutch church or 'Kruiskerk' in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] c. 1682]]\nAs the centre for the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] in the Indies, there were many European Christians as well as Asian Christians from areas proselytised by the Portuguese. The predominant denomination in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] was Dutch Reformed but there were also Lutherans and Catholics. The Dutch governors constructed Reformed churches, for Portuguese, Dutch and Malay speakers. Other religions were formally prohibited, but in practice Chinese temples as well as mosques remained in existence, and despite various measures to promote Christianity, there was a high degree of religious diversity and never at any time a Christian majority. At other VOC settlements clergy were likewise provided, such as at [[Semarang]], where the minister had a congregation that was only half Reformed and half Catholic or Lutheran and consequently efforts were made to provide inclusive preaching. Largely, however, the VOC had little impact or interest in upsetting their business interests in favour of religious ideals, and indeed the theology of the Dutch Reformed church was opposed to the mass baptism adopted by Catholic missionaries, and their impact on Java as a whole was very minor.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 121\u2013132</ref>\n\n===East Nusa Tenggara===\n[[File:Gereja Masehi Injili di Timor di Labuan Bajo.JPG|thumb|left|Dutch reformed church \"Gereja Masehi Injil di Timor\" in Labuan Bajo, [[Nusa Tenggara Timur]]]]\nPortuguese traders ventured from Malacca to [[Timor]] to purchase [[sandalwood]]. During their trading missions they were frequently becalmed, and during this time are said to have converted numerous people of [[Solor Archipelago|Solor island]], Timor and [[Flores]]. Hearing of these conversions, three [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionaries were sent from [[Malacca]], arriving and establishing a church in 1562 in Flores. The mission was given financial support from the Portuguese in Goa, enabling the construction of mission stations in the area.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapter Four</ref>\n\nA major setback came when two headmen were imprisoned and mistreated by the Portuguese in 1598, resulting in a rebellion and desecration of churches throughout the region, as those opposed to the Portuguese, many of whom had been previously converted to Islam in the early 16th century, attacked the Portuguese and the Dominican mission. Subsequent setbacks came in the form of the arrival of the Dutch, who allied against the Portuguese Christians.\n\nA new mission was established in 1617, which successfully furthered the spread of Catholicism in the region, including minor military ventures led from [[Larantuka]] on Flores, rejecting the dominionship of Islamic Makassar. 'Black' Portuguese control over Larantuka, and influence also over Timor, was settled by a truce with the Dutch in 1661. The Catholic community in east Flores was strengthened by the expulsion of Catholics from Makassar in 1660. In [[Portuguese Timor]] the Portuguese mission at [[Lifau]] (which supported the nominal cathedral of the Diocese of Malacca, as the Dutch would no longer tolerate one there) was in conflict with the Dutch at [[Kupang]], and wars were fought between the two sides with Catholic villages regarded as Portuguese and therefore enemies of the Dutch. In the first half of the 18th century 'Portuguese'-supporting factions were defeated entirely by the Dutch in West Timor, confining Catholicism to the eastern part of that island.\n\nThe Dominican mission declined in the late 18th century, and in 1817 the last priest covering Flores died. Many Catholics reverted to pagan practices, but still, thousands remained, continuing to follow Catholic pageantry. Portugal, severely weakened, withdrew from all but East Timor, but thanks to treaties signed in the 1850s, freedom of religion was guaranteed in areas being exchanged between the two countries. Following this treaty Catholicism strengthened considerably in Flores after 1860. In the western part of Flores, Dutch effective control over the area since 1907 led to the support of the spread of Catholicism among the [[Manggarai people|Manggarai]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Steenbrink |first=Karel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc5gAAAAQBAJ |title=Catholics in Indonesia, 1808-1942: A Documented History.

Following this two missionaries were sent in 1834, and in total between 1834 and 1859 20 missionaries were sent to the region, although mortality rates were high and never more than 7 were active at one time. Permission for the activity from the Dutch government was obtained after 1836.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapter 12</ref>\n\nAlthough the mission was headquartered in Banjarmasin, where the pastoral needs of European residents were supplied, it was apparent that converting the Muslims who dominate the cities of Kalimantan was an impossible task, and instead efforts were focused on the [[Dayak people]] of the interior, who practised traditional religions. Johann Becker, a capable linguist, translated the gospels into the Dayak [[Ngaju language]].\n\nThe missionaries also bought 1,100 Dayak slaves over the period 1836 to 1859 in order to emancipate them as free men. Despite their efforts, only a few hundred were baptised. In 1859 the [[Banjarmasin War]] broke out, several missionaries were killed, and the mission was excluded from the region until 1866 by the Dutch, which fought to bring the former Sultanate of Banjarmasin under direct rule.\n\nIn 1866 the missionaries returned. Despite building many mission stations and schools, only 3,000 had converted by 1911, as against 100,000 Batak Christians in the similarly resourced Rhenish mission of North Sumatra. It has been suggested that this slow progress was due to the fragmented nature of the Dayaks\u2014with no king or dominant regional powers, there was little prospect of mass conversion, while new converts faced exclusion from their traditional ceremonies.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the RMS was replaced by the Basel Mission. It transferred control to the first independent church, the 'Gereja Dayak Evangelis', in 1935, covering a vast geographical area from Banjarmasin 1,300&nbsp;km to the west and 600&nbsp;km inland. In 1950 the church became the more ethnically inclusive 'Gereja Kalimantan Evangelis' (GKE) as transmigrants from other parts of Indonesia to Kalimantan joined the congregation. The church has approximately 250,000 members, and is based in [[Central Kalimantan]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oikoumene.org/member-churches/regions/asia/indonesia/kalimantan-evangelical-church.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045136/http://www.oikoumene.org/member-churches/regions/asia/indonesia/kalimantan-evangelical-church.html |archive-date=5 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Catholic Church====\n[[File:Tumbang Titi church 101016-7875 mp.jpg|thumb|left|Catholic church in Tumbang Titi in [[Ketapang]], [[West Kalimantan]]]]\nThe Vatican agreed a [[Concordat]] with the Dutch in 1847 that Kalimantan was a possible mission area, provided they did not settle on rivers where other missionaries were already active.\n\nChinese, historically a major force in West Kalimantan, included among their number some Catholics, who had migrated from other parts of the region. A first church was consecreated in [[Singkawang]] in 1876, and from here in 1885 the post was established as a pastoral centre for the Jesuit priest who would be responsible for the area. A mission to the Dayaks of [[Sejiram]] was established in 1890, and a church<ref>http://mungan87.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/the-ancient-building-in-sejiram/</ref> constructed. The Singkawang and Sejiram missions closed in 1896 and 1898, respectively, due to lack of personnel.\n\nThe mission was re-established in Singkawang with [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Friars in 1905. The first new missions (1905\u20131913) were aimed at the coastal Chinese of [[Pemangkat|Pamangkat]], [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] (location of West Kalimantan's Bishop, as it was the largest town in the region) and [[Sambas Regency|Sambas]], as well as the deep Dayak interior, where the Catholics hoped to convert without competition from Islam, before working back towards the coast.\n\nThe Catholic training centre was established at [[Nyarumkop]], close to Singkawang, where children (mostly Dayak, as the Chinese were less inclined towards Catholicism in West Kalimantan than in other parts of Indonesia \u2013 in 1980 only 3% of Chinese in West Kalimantan were Catholics) were educated and Catholic teachers trained.\n\nCatholic growth prior to World War Two was slow, but subsequently saw some success, most notably after 1965 and the [[New Order (Indonesia)]], where all Indonesians were required to proclaim an approved religion. Growth in the Catholic population from 1950 to 2000 in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pontianak]] was from 1.1% to 8.7%, in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sintang]] from 1.7% to 20.1%. In the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sanggau]], just over 50% of the population are now Catholic, while in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ketapang]] it is around 20%. Catholic presence in East and South Kalimantan is much lower than the West Kalimantan Dioceses.\n\n====Christian and Missionary Alliance====\nMissionaries of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] began one of several Indonesian missions in [[East Kalimantan]] in 1929 in the region of [[Kutai]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1363&lg=eng |title=Gereja Kemah Injil Indonesia |website=www.reformiert-online.net}}</ref> George Fisk, the lead missionary, asked only that new converts accept Jesus as their saviour, unlike the Catholics, who required two years of teaching. The [[West Kalimantan]] mission, established in 1933 in [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] ventured up the [[Kapuas River]], where they found existing Catholic converts, some of whom converted to Protestantism. The Catholics, however, had an advantage over the CAMA Protestants in that CAMA, but not the Catholics, prohibited the consumption of alcohol.\n\nThe CAMA mission acted quickly in establishing churches in the interior, obtaining the use of an aeroplane from CAMA, and became part of the Kemah Injil Gereja Masehi Indonesia, or Tabernacle Gospel Messianic Indonesian church.\n\nIn 1990 the church had 98,000 members in East Kalimantan, and 62,000 in West Kalimantan, making it the third-largest Christian denomination in Kalimantan after the Catholic Church and the GKE.\n\n===Maluku===\n[[File:The Cathedral of Ambon.jpg|thumb|The Fransiscus Xaverius Cathedral in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]]]]\nWhile the Portuguese religious influence over Malacca and Sumatra was very small, their mission to [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], the important spice islands of the eastern archipelago, was more significant. They landed first in Ambon, where the natives were already polarised into 'uli-lima' (group of five) and 'uli-siwa' (group of nine), the former having converted to Islam and allying with the Muslim Javanese, with the latter retaining traditional beliefs. The Portuguese found themselves allied with the ulu-siwa, whose opposition to the uli-lima made Christianity an appealing choice.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. Chapters 3 and 5</ref>\n\nThe Islamic [[Sultanate of Ternate]] sought the patronage of the Portuguese, offering a trading monopoly in return for military support against rival local kingdoms. In 1534, the first Catholic community was established in [[Halmahera]], the result of an appeal to the Portuguese for protection from Halmahera against Ternatean incursions\u2014protection offered on condition of converting to Christianity.\n\nFurther evangelising resulted in many Ternate nobles converting to Christianity, while [[Francis Xavier]], a Catholic missionary and co-founder of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] worked in Ternate, Moro and Ambon briefly in 1546 and also 1547. St Francis wrote that most of the population were 'pagan', and hated the local Muslims, resisting conversion to Islam. He appealed for support to save souls in Maluku, which arrived in 1547 in the shape of Nuno Ribeiro, a Jesuit who is said to have converted five hundred people before being murdered in 1549.\n\nSultan Hairun of Ternate had refused to convert to Christianity, regarding himself as defender of the Islamic faith, and when he was murdered by a Portuguese Captain in 1570, his son, Baabullah, the new Sultan, reacted angrily, expelling the Portuguese from Maluku, waging war against both the Portuguese and their local Christian allies. As a result, the Jesuit mission was abandoned almost entirely in 1573, and Christians were killed or converted at the point of a sword. The faith survived only around the Jesuit fort in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]; even there, there was a shortage of priests due to dangerous conditions, and many local people did not have knowledge of Christian creeds, and were easily apostatised to Islam or traditional beliefs.\n\nThe Portuguese by now largely impotent, the Dutch, allied with the Muslim locals against their mutual Portuguese enemy, seized the fort of Ambon in 1605. The Dutch expelled the Jesuits and Portuguese, adopting the Catholic churches for Protestant worship, which was supported through the establishment of numerous Protestant schools, where the teachers also led Sunday worship. Boundaries between Muslim and Christians were well-established on Ambon, but in [[Seram Island|Seram]] and [[Buru]], proselytisation took place converting 'pagans' to Christianity, the policy of the VOC being to contain the spread of Islam without converting existing Muslims. Idols were destroyed by the Dutch teachers as new Christians were prohibited from continuing to follow their traditional religion.\n\n===Papua===\n[[File:Wamena Church Betlehem.jpg|thumb|Betlehem church in [[Wamena]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]]]]\nPapua, unlike the rest of Indonesia, has had no historic contact with Muslim preachers, and had its first Christian missionary contact in 1855. With little competition, the mission was relatively successful. Missionaries Carl Ottow and Johann Geisler, under the initiative of [[Ottho Gerhard Heldring]], entered Papua at [[Mansinam]] island, near [[Manokwari]] on 5 February 1855, and are said to have knelt on the beach and prayed, claiming Papua for Christ. Since 2001, the fifth of February has been a Papuan public holiday, recognising this first landing.<ref>A History of Christianity in Indonesia \u2013 Chapter 8</ref>\n\nOttow and Geisler studied the [[Numfor]] [[Biak language|language]], and were subsequently granted a monthly stipend by the Dutch government. The missionaries proposed a scheme to start a [[tobacco]] plantation using Christian Javanese to train the Papuans, and were given 5,000 guilders by the Dutch and two Christian Javanese tobacco farmers. The Dutch administrators perceived the missionaries activities as a cut-price means of colonisation, while the missionaries themselves made profits from trading Papuan goods. The Utrecht Mission Society (UZV) joined the mission from 1863; they were prohibited from trade, and instead established a trading committee.\n\nThe UZV established a Christian-based education system as well as regular church services. Initially the Papuans' attendance was encouraged using bribes of [[Areca nut|betel nut]] and tobacco, but subsequently this was stopped. In addition, slaves were bought to be raised as step children and then freed. By 1880, only 20 Papuans had been baptised, including many freed slaves.\n\nThe Dutch government established posts in [[Netherlands New Guinea]] in 1898, a move welcomed by the missionaries, who saw orderly Dutch rule as the essential antidote to Papua paganism. Subsequently, the UZV mission had more success, with a mass conversion near [[Cenderawasih Bay]] in 1907 and the evangelisation of the [[Sentani (people)|Sentani]] people by Pamai, a native Papuan in the late 1920s. Due to the [[Great Depression]], the mission suffered a funding shortfall, and switched to native evangelists, who had the advantage of speaking the local language (rather than Malay), but were often poorly trained. The mission extended in the 1930s to [[Yos Sudarso Bay]], and the UZV mission by 1934 had over 50,000 Christians, 90% of them in North Papua, the remainder in West Papua. By 1942 the mission had expanded to 300 schools in 300 congregations.\n\nThe first Catholic presence in Papua was in [[Fakfak]], a Jesuit mission in 1894. In 1902 the Vicariate of Netherlands New Guinea was established. Despite the earlier activity in Fakfak, the Dutch restricted the Catholic Church to the southern part of the island, where they were active especially around [[Merauke]]. The mission campaigned against the destructive practices of [[headhunting]] and promiscuity among the [[Marind people|Marind-anim]]. Following the [[1918 flu pandemic]], which killed one in five in the area, the Dutch government agreed to the establishment of model villages, based on European conditions, including wearing European clothes, but which the people would submit to only by violence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nIn 1925 the Catholics sought to re-establish their mission in Fakfak; permission was granted in 1927. This brought the Catholics into conflict with the Protestants in North Papua, who suggested expanding to South Papua in retaliation. The Catholics and Protestants also began a race for the highlands.\n\nAfter World War Two, New Guinea remained outside of Indonesian control, under Dutch administration, but in 1963, it was absorbed under dubious circumstances into Indonesia. The Indonesians were suspicious of 'Dutch' elements, which included church teachers and missionaries, who had been educated in Dutch fashion, and began an overnight Indonesianisation. Papua acquired a significant population of mostly Muslim [[Transmigration program|transmigrants]], who were given land and a house by the Indonesian government. Religious differences as well as cultural with Muslim Indonesian army and administrators have exarcebated the [[Papua conflict]], in which over thousands of Papuans have been killed by Indonesian security forces. Some human rights groups like the [[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|IWGIA]] estimate the number of killed Papuans to be over 100,000.<ref>[[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|IWGIA]]: ''The Indigenous World 2006'', p. 266 ([http://www.iwgia.org/graphics/Synkron-Library/Documents/publications/Downloadpublications/IndigenousWorld/IW%202006/IW%202006.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903013604/http://www.iwgia.org//graphics/Synkron-Library/Documents/publications/Downloadpublications/IndigenousWorld/IW%202006/IW%202006.pdf |date=3 September 2010 }})</ref> The majority of government resources were directed to non-Papuan Muslims rather than Papuan Christians, and non-Papuan Muslims were also given senior administrative roles. Church leaders, suspected of Papuan nationalism, were strictly monitored and in many cases killed where they strayed too close to Papuan separatist movements.\n\n===Sulawesi===\n\n====Southern Sulawesi====\n[[File:Church in Rantepao.JPG|thumb|Catholic church in [[Rantepao]], [[South Sulawesi]]]]\nThe pork-eating leaders of [[Makassar]] in southern [[Sulawesi]] expressed an interest in Christianity on several occasions in the 16th century, and while a request was made to Malacca for missionaries, none were forthcoming, perhaps because of the lack of commercial opportunities (spices) in the area, and from 1605 the area converted to Islam, having received instruction in the faith from [[Johor]]. Subsequently, following the fall of Portuguese Malacca, many Catholics, including Jesuit priests, fled to Makassar, which was tolerant of their faith, but by 1660 the Dutch forced the expulsion of the Portuguese, who fled to Macau and Flores.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 59\u201362</ref>\n\n====Northern Sulawesi====\nThe Portuguese baptised over a thousand in [[Manado]], where the Portuguese, and Christianity, were seen as a bulwark against the powerful [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate Sultanate]] directly due east. Portuguese missionary activity continued in northern Sulawesi between 1563 and 1570, but following the murder of Sultan Hairun in Ternate and the ensuing anti-Portuguese attacks, the mission was abandoned.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 62\u201368</ref>\n\nIn the Spanish-controlled [[Sangihe Islands]] and [[Talaud Islands]] in the kingdom of [[Siau Island|Siau]], lying directly north of northern Sulawesi, Catholicism had been adopted with some enthusiasm, and when the allied Dutch-Ternatean Muslim pillaged the islands in 1613 and 1615, help was sought from the Philippines to the north. Franciscans visited from [[Manila]], as did a Jesuit mission.\n\nJesuit missionaries were also active in [[Minahasan people|Minahasa]] and neighbouring areas in the first half of the 17th century, but attacks from Muslims from Ternate as well as local animist peoples meant that priests had a short life expectancy. From 1655 to 1676 the Dutch established firm control of northern Sulawesi, and Catholicism was prohibited by the ruling [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]. With Catholicism harshly suppressed, as in Ambon in Maluku, the people of Minahasa, the Sangihe and Talaud islands are to this day almost entirely Protestant (the Dutch replacing the Catholic infrastructure with the schools of Dutch Protestantism), although in the 20th century fresh Catholic mission activity commenced.\n\n===Sumatra===\n\n====The Batak mission====\n[[File:HKBP Parapat, Resort Parapat 01.JPG|thumb|[[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]] Church in [[Parapat]], [[North Sumatra]]]]\nThe largely mountainous '[[Batak]]lands' of [[North Sumatra]] were surrounded to the north by the staunchly Islamic Acehnese, to the south by the Islamic [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and to the east by the Malays (also Muslims). The 'Bataks' were regarded by outsiders as a race of pagan cannibals, and it was largely their rejection of Islam that distinguished them from their neighbours. At the turn of the 19th century the southernmost Batak people, the [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]] came, through their subjection in the [[Padri War]], to follow Islam, rejecting traditional beliefs and, frequently, their identity as 'Batak'.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 527\u2013569</ref>\n\nFurther north, however, Batak proved more resistant to the hostile Muslim invaders, and receptive indeed to Christianity. The first missionaries were sent by [[Stamford Raffles]] in 1824, at which time Sumatra was under temporary British rule. They observed that the Batak seemed receptive to new religious thought, and were likely to fall to the first mission, either Islamic or Christian, to attempt conversion.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p. 530</ref>\n\nA second mission that in 1834 of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] met with a brutal end when its two missionaries were killed by Batak resistant to outside interference in their traditional [[adat]].\n\nThe first Christian community in North Sumatra was established in [[Sipirok]], a community of (Batak) [[Angkola]] people. Three missionaries from an independent church in [[Ermelo]], Netherlands arrived in 1857, and on 7 October 1861 one of the Ermelo missionaries united with the Rhenish Missionary Society, which had been recently expelled from Kalimantan as a result of the Banjarmasin War.\n\nThe mission was immensely successful, being well supported financially from Germany, and adopted effective evangelistic strategies led by [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]], who spent most of his life from 1862 until his death in 1918 in North Sumatra, successfully converting many among the [[Simalungun Regency|Simalungun]] and [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]] as well as a minority of [[Angkola]]. Nommensen initially established Huta Dame, his 'village of peace', as Christian converts were excluded from their home villages, becoming knowledgeable in matters of Batak custom. Nommensen's success was supported by Peter Johannsen, who arrived in 1866, and has been praised for the quality of his Batak translations, as well as by respected Batak Raja Pontas, an early convert. Nommensen's theology saw Christianity as renewing rather than replacing traditional Batak customs, except in cases where [[adat]] were in direct contradiction to the Christian faith. The [[Batak Christian Protestant Church|Huria Kristen Batak Protestan]] or HKBP (Batak Protestant Christian community) is the church that was formed from Nommensen's actions. To meet the desire for education, a seminary was established, along with elementary schools in Christian villages. By 1918, on Nommensen's death, his church comprised 180,000 members, with 34 ministers and 788 teacher/preachers. The distinct identity of Batak Toba people, separate from their Muslim neighbours, and their future role within Indonesia was thus assured.\n\nAs the process of decolonising continued following World Wars 1 and 2, the HKBP continued to grow, not just in the tanah Batak, but also in Java and Medan, where many Bataks were seeking economic opportunities. The congregation grew 50% between 1951 and 1960, by which time it had reached 745,000. A growing disquiet at Toba 'imperialism' resulted in the establishment of the [[Gereja Kristen Protestan Simalungun]] and [[Gereja Kristen Protestan Angkola]] in the 1960s, both of which were expressions of a movement towards the native Simalungun and Angkola languages and traditions as against those of the Toba among their communities. In 1992, the Gereja Kristen Protestan Pakpak-Dairi, of the [[Pakpak-Dairi]] people was split from the HKBP.\n\nWhile the traditional Batak church grew through rejecting only 'negative' adat, there is a more-recent anti-adat movement among [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalists]] that perceives non-Christian elements of Batak culture, such as [[ulos]] as satanic.\n\n====Karo Church====\n[[File:GBKP.JPG|thumb|[[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] Church in [[Kabanjahe]], [[North Sumatra]]]]\nThe (Batak) [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo people]] were harassing European interests in east Sumatra, and [[Jacob Theodoor Cremer]], a Dutch administrator regarded evangelism as a means to suppress this activity. The [[Netherlands Missionary Society]] answered the call, commencing activities in the Karolands in 1890, where they engaged not only in evangelism, but also in ethnology and documenting the Karo culture. The missionaries attempted to construct a base in [[Kabanjahe]] in the Karo highlands, but were repelled by the suspicious locals.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 569\u2013584</ref>\n\nIn retaliation the Dutch administration waged a war to conquer the Karolands, as part of their final consolidation of power in the Indies. The Karo perceived Christianity as the 'Dutch religion', and its followers as 'dark-skinned Dutch'. In this context, the Karo church was initially unsuccessful, and by 1950 the church had only 5,000 members. In the years following Indonesian independence the perception of Christianity among the Karo as an emblem of colonialism faded, with the church itself adopting more elements of traditional Karo culture such as music (previously the brass band was promoted), and by 1965 the Karo church had grown to some 35,000 members, with 60,000 baptised in 1966\u20131970.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p576</ref> At the same time, Islam was also being seen as increasingly attractive. From 5,000 Muslims (mostly non-Karo) in Karoland in 1950, there were 30,000 in 1970. Although the [[Karo Batak Protestant Church|Gereja Batak Karo Protestan]] (GBKP) is the largest Karo church there are also Catholic (33,000 members as of 1986) and [[Assemblies of God|several]] [[Pentecostal Church in Indonesia|Pentecostalist]] denominations.\n\n===The 19th century===\nAfter the collapse of the VOC and defeat by the English, the Indies were eventually restored to the Dutch in 1815. By this time the [[separation of church and state]] had been established in The Netherlands. This meant that the pretence of a Protestant monopoly in the Indies was abandoned, and in 1826 the Apostolic Prefecture of Batavia was established.<ref>http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/jaka0.htm</ref>\n\nAs of 1800, there were an estimated 40,000 indigenous Protestants, in northern Sulawesi, central Maluku and Timor, as well as approximately 11,000 Catholics in east Flores and the islands around. This out of a population of a total 7 million represented just 0.7% Christians, against approximately 85% Muslims.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p141</ref> Thus it can be seen that in the last two centuries although the proportion of Muslims has remained largely constant in the archipelago, the Christian population has risen rapidly, thanks in large part to the 19th-century missionary societies, discussed below.\n\n===The 20th century===\n[[File:Messiah Cathedral in Night.jpg|thumb|[[Messiah Cathedral]] [[megachurch]], hub of [[Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Church]] in [[Jakarta]]]]\nIn 1941, there were 1.7 million Protestants and 600.000 Catholics in a population of 60 million.<ref>Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume set by Hans J.

It is characterised by the process of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, the [[development of the human body]] entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Human fertilization|Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] successfully enters and [[Cell fusion|fuses]] with an [[egg cell]] (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of development commences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 }}</ref> Embryonic development in the human, covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].\n'''Human embryology''' is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of [[gestation]] (pregnancy) is about nine months or 40 weeks.\n \nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.\n\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.\n\n== Germinal stage ==\n\n=== Fertilization ===\n{{Main|Human fertilization}}\nFertilization takes place when the [[spermatozoon]] has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the [[gamete]]s fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single [[diploid]] cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the [[fallopian tube]]s. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\n\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of [[chemotaxis]] which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of [[acrosomal reaction]] takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an [[acrosome]] which contains digestive [[enzyme]]s to break down the [[zona pellucida]] and allow its entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the [[zona reaction]]. This sees the release of [[cortical granule]]s that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing [[polyspermy]].  The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\n\n=== Cleavage ===\n{{Further|Cleavage (embryo)}}\n[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|200px|8-cell embryo, at 3 days]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] process is marked when the zygote divides through [[mitosis]] into two cells.  This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours.  The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size.  This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&pg=PA27|author1=Forg\u00e1cs, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.}}</ref>  Initially the dividing cells, called [[blastomeres]] (''blastos'' Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of [[glycoproteins]] (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum.

Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the [[trophoblast]]) and an [[inner cell mass]]. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the [[zona pellucida]]. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become [[embryoblast]]s and [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarise]] at one end. They close together and form [[gap junction]]s, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the [[blastocoel]], creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the [[blastula]].) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to [[zona hatching|hatch]] through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.<ref>http://www.vanat.cvm.umn.edu/TFFLectPDFs/LectEarlyEmbryo{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\nThe inner cell mass will give rise to the [[pre-embryo]],<ref name=\"opentext\">{{cite web |title=28.2 Embryonic Development \u2013 Anatomy and Physiology |url=https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/28-2-embryonic-development/ |website=opentextbc.ca}}</ref> the [[amnion]], [[yolk sac]] and [[allantois]], while the fetal part of the [[placenta]] will form from the outer trophoblast layer.

These columns are known as [[Chorionic villi|primary villi]]. At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Moore/>\n\n=== Implantation ===\n{{Main|Implantation (human embryo)}}\n[[File:Gray36.png|thumb|200px|Trophoblast differentiation]]\nAfter [[ovulation]], the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the embryo. It becomes thickened, with its [[secretory gland]]s becoming elongated, and is increasingly [[vascular]]. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the [[decidua]], and it produces a great number of large [[decidual cells]] in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called [[Trophoblast]].The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into an inner layer, the [[cytotrophoblast]], and an outer layer, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast contains [[cuboidal]] [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a [[Syncytium|syncytial]] layer without cell boundaries.\n\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual [[epithelium]] by projections of [[chorionic villi]], forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the [[myometrium]] and forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. The implantation is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] that stimulates the release of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored [[glycogen]] from its cells to nourish the [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink= |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J. Heyden  |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston |pages = |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=0-13-250882-6 }}</ref> The villi begin to branch and contain blood vessels of the embryo. Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Smith/>\nArteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing [[Respiration (physiology)|gas exchange]] and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\n\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic [[stem cells]], which are [[pluripotent]] and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells, and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\n===Embryonic disc===\nThe embryoblast forms an [[embryonic disc]], which is a [[bilaminar blastocyst|bilaminar disc]] of two layers, an upper layer called the [[epiblast]] (primitive [[ectoderm]]) and a lower layer called the [[hypoblast]] (primitive [[endoderm]]). The disc is stretched between what will become the [[amniotic cavity]] and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called [[Heuser's membrane]] (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or [[extraembryonic coelom]].\n\n==Gastrulation==\n{{Main|Gastrulation}}\n[[File:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|800px|[[Histogenesis]] of the three germ layers]]\n[[File:Ultrasound of embryo at 5 weeks, colored.png|thumb|200px|Artificially colored - [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]] and [[embryo]] (measuring 3 mm at 5 weeks)]]\n[[File:2910 The Placenta-02.jpg|420px|thumb|Embryo attached to placenta in amniotic cavity]]\n\nThe [[primitive streak]], a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of [[gastrulation]], which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes [[bilateral symmetry]]. A [[primitive node]] (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of [[neurulation]]. A [[primitive pit]] forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the [[notochord]] which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the [[neural plate]] which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]], which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, [[multipotent]] [[stromal]] cells that can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the [[amnion]]. The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the [[gastrula]].\n\nThe three germ layers are the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of [[somitogenesis]], [[histogenesis]] and [[organogenesis]].<ref>Ross, Lawrence M. & Lamperti, Edward D., ed.

As in all [[deuterostome]]s, the blastopore becomes the [[anus]] whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth.

[[Neurulation]] refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the [[neural tube]], and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow [[neural groove]] which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the [[neural crest]]. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the [[paraxial mesoderm]], which will give rise to the [[somitomeres]] that in the process of [[somitogenesis]] will differentiate into [[somite]]s that will form the [[sclerotome]], the syndetome,<ref name=\"pmid12705871\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent AE, Schweitzer R, Tabin CJ |title=A somitic compartment of tendon progenitors |journal=Cell |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=235\u201348 |date=April 2003  |pmid=12705871 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00268-X}}</ref> the\n[[myotome]] and the [[dermatome (embryology)|dermatome]] to form [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], [[tendon]]s, [[dermis]] (skin), and [[muscle]].

The development of [[haematopoiesis|blood formation]] takes place in clusters of blood cells, known as [[blood island]]s, in the [[yolk sac]]. Blood islands develop outside the embryo, on the umbilical vesicle, allantois, connecting stalk, and chorion, from mesodermal [[hemangioblast]]s.\n\nIn the centre of a blood island, hemangioblasts form the haematopoietic stem cells that are the precursor to all types of blood cell.

These two [[endocardial tubes]] grow and by day 21 have migrated towards each other and fused to form a single primitive heart tube, the [[tubular heart]]. This is enabled by the folding of the embryo which pushes the tubes into the [[thoracic cavity]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\">{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=W J|title=Human Embryology|date=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-443-06583-7|pages=170\u2013190|edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\nAlso at the same time that the endocardial tubes are forming, [[vasculogenesis]] (the development of the circulatory system) has begun. This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into [[angioblast]]s that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of [[angiogenesis]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/> Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of [[vascular remodelling in the embryo|vascular remodelling]] takes place.\n\nThe tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the [[infundibulum (heart)|infundibulum]], [[bulbus cordis]], [[primitive ventricle]], [[primitive atrium]], and the [[sinus venosus]].  Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the [[truncus arteriosus]]. This will divide to form the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary artery]]; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\"Anatomy & physiology\"/>\n\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of [[morphogenesis]], and this completes by the end of the fourth week. [[Programmed cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]) at the joining surfaces enables fusion to take place.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\nIn the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the [[vitelline vein|vitelline]], the [[umbilical vein|umbilical]] and the [[common cardinal vein]]s.\n\nDuring the first two months of development, the [[interatrial septum]] begins to form. This septum divides the [[primitive atrium]] into a right and a left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the [[septum primum]]. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the [[ostium primum]]. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the [[ostium secundum]]) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\nA second septum (the [[septum secundum]]) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth. Between the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]\nthe [[intraventricular septum|septum inferius]] also forms which develops into the muscular [[interventricular septum]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\n===Digestive system===\n{{Main |Development of the digestive system}}\nThe digestive system starts to develop from the third week and by the twelfth week, the organs have correctly positioned themselves.\n\n=== Respiratory system ===\nThe respiratory system develops from the [[lung bud]], which appears in the ventral wall of the foregut about four weeks into development. The lung bud forms the trachea and two lateral growths known as the bronchial buds, which enlarge at the beginning of the fifth week to form the left and right main [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. These bronchi in turn form secondary (lobar) bronchi; three on the right and two on the left (reflecting the number of lung lobes). Tertiary bronchi form from secondary bronchi.\n\nWhile the internal lining of the [[larynx]] originates from the [[lung bud]], its cartilages and muscles originate from the fourth and sixth [[pharyngeal arch]]es.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Langman's medical embryology.|last=W.)|first=Sadler, T.

Only the metanephros develops into the permanent kidney. All three are derived from the [[intermediate mesoderm]].\n\n===== Pronephros =====\nThe [[pronephros]] derives from the intermediate mesoderm in the cervical region. It is not functional and degenerates before the end of the fourth week.\n\n===== Mesonephros =====\nThe [[mesonephros]] derives from intermediate mesoderm in the upper thoracic to upper lumbar segments. Excretory tubules are formed and enter the [[mesonephric duct]], which ends in the [[Cloaca (embryology)|cloaca]]. The mesonephric duct atrophies in females, but participate in [[development of the reproductive system]] in males.\n\n===== Metanephros =====\nThe metanephros appears in the fifth week of development. An outgrowth of the mesonephric duct, the [[ureteric bud]], penetrates metanephric tissue to form the primitive [[renal pelvis]], [[Renal calyx|renal calyces]] and [[renal pyramids]]. The [[ureter]] is also formed.\n\n==== Bladder and urethra ====\nBetween the fourth and seventh weeks of development, the [[urorectal septum]] divides the [[Cloaca (embryology)|cloaca]] into the [[urogenital sinus]] and the [[anal canal]]. The upper part of the urogenital sinus forms the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], while the lower part forms the [[urethra]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Reproductive system ===\n{{Main|Development of the reproductive system}}\n{{Further|Development of the gonads}}\n\n=== Integumentary system ===\n{{Further|Human skin colour}}\nThe superficial layer of the [[human skin|skin]], the [[epidermis]], is derived from the [[ectoderm]]. The deeper layer, the [[dermis]], is derived from [[mesenchyme]].\n\nThe formation of the epidermis begins in the second month of development and it acquires its definitive arrangement at the end of the fourth month. The ectoderm divides to form a flat layer of cells on the surface known as the periderm. Further division forms the individual [[Epidermis#Layers|layers of the epidermis]].\n\nThe mesenchyme that will form the dermis is derived from three sources:\n\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the limbs and body wall derives from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the back derives from [[paraxial mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the face and neck derives from [[Neural crest|neural crest cells]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Nervous system===\n{{Main|Development of the nervous system in humans |Development of the human brain}}\n[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 4.JPG|thumb|240px|Development of brain in 8 week old embryo]]\nLate in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube bends ventrally as the [[Flexure (embryology)|cephalic flexure]] at the level of the future [[midbrain]]\u2014the [[mesencephalon]].

The [[alar plate]] of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] becomes the diencephalon.

These placodes [[Invagination|invaginate]] to form [[otic pit]]s, and then [[otic vesicle]]s. The otic vesicles then form ventral and dorsal components.\n\nThe ventral component forms the [[saccule]] and the [[cochlear duct]]. In the sixth week of development the cochlear duct emerges and penetrates the surrounding [[mesenchyme]], travelling in a spiral shape until it forms 2.5 turns by the end of the eighth week. The saccule is the remaining part of the ventral component. It remains connected to the cochlear duct via the narrow [[ductus reuniens]].\n\nThe dorsal component forms the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[semicircular canals]].\n\n==== Middle ear ====\nThe [[tympanic cavity]] and [[eustachian tube]] are derived from the [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)#First pouch|first pharyngeal pouch]] (a cavity lined by [[endoderm]]). The distal part of the cleft, the tubotympanic recess, widens to create the tympanic cavity. The proximal part of the cleft remains narrow and creates the eustachian tube.\n\nThe [[bone]]s of the middle ear, the [[ossicles]], derive from the cartilages of the [[pharyngeal arch]]es. The [[malleus]] and [[incus]] derive from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#First arch|first pharyngeal arch]], whereas the [[stapes]] derives from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#Second arch|second pharyngeal arch]].\n\n==== Outer ear ====\nThe [[Ear canal|external auditory meatus]] develops from the dorsal portion of the first [[Pharyngeal groove|pharyngeal cleft]].

Ectodermal cells at the distal end of the buds form the [[apical ectodermal ridge]], which creates an area of rapidly proliferating mesenchymal cells known as the [[progress zone]].

This [[cell potency]] means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]], can be removed by [[biopsy]] and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's [[uterus]].\n\n[[Sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear.<ref name=Carlson/><ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Larsen/>\n\n[[First arch syndrome]]s are [[congenital disorder]]s of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch.\n\n[[Spina bifida]] a [[congenital disorder]] is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube.\n\n[[Vertically transmitted infection]]s can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its [[prenatal development|development]].\n\n[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a [[preterm birth|preterm]] or premature birth.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Aorta-gonad-mesonephros]]\n* [[CDX2]]\n* [[Development of the reproductive system]]\n* [[Development of the urinary system]]\n* [[Developmental biology]]\n* [[Drosophila embryogenesis]]\n* [[Embryomics]]\n* [[Gonadogenesis]]\n* [[Human tooth development]]\n* [[List of human cell types derived from the germ layers]]\n* [[Potential person]]\n* [[Recapitulation theory]]\n\n==Additional images==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 01.jpg|Representing different stages of embryogenesis\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 05.jpg|Early stage of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 03.jpg|Phase of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 04.jpg|Top of the form of the embryo\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 02.jpg|Establishment of embryo medium\nFile:Sobo 1909 621.png|Spinal cord at 5 weeks\nFile:Gray947.png|Head and neck at 32 days\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Human embryos}}\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle/images/stem_blastocyst.jpg Photo of blastocyst in utero]\n* Slideshow: [https://web.archive.org/web/20161222152312/http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/99/womb In the Womb]\n* [http://www.embryology.ch/indexen.html Online course in embryology] for medicine students developed by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern\n\n{{Embryology}}\n{{Human development}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Human Embryogenesis}}\n[[Category:Embryology]]\n[[Category:Human biology]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Human embryonic development|Embryonic development in general|Embryonic development}}\n[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|400px|The initial stages of human embryonic development]]\n{{Human growth and development}}\n'''Human embryonic development''', or '''human embryogenesis''', refers to the development and formation of the human embryo. It is characterised by the process of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, the [[development of the human body]] entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Human fertilization|Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] successfully enters and [[Cell fusion|fuses]] with an [[egg cell]] (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of development commences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 }}</ref> Embryonic development in the human, covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].\n'''Human embryology''' is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of [[gestation]] (pregnancy) is about nine months or 40 weeks.\n \nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.\n\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.\n\n== Germinal stage ==\n\n=== Fertilization ===\n{{Main|Human fertilization}}\nFertilization takes place when the [[spermatozoon]] has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the [[gamete]]s fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single [[diploid]] cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the [[fallopian tube]]s. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\n\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of [[chemotaxis]] which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of [[acrosomal reaction]] takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an [[acrosome]] which contains digestive [[enzyme]]s to break down the [[zona pellucida]] and allow its entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the [[zona reaction]]. This sees the release of [[cortical granule]]s that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing [[polyspermy]].  The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\n\n=== Cleavage ===\n{{Further|Cleavage (embryo)}}\n[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|200px|8-cell embryo, at 3 days]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] process is marked when the zygote divides through [[mitosis]] into two cells.  This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours.  The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size.  This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&pg=PA27|author1=Forg\u00e1cs, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.}}</ref>  Initially the dividing cells, called [[blastomeres]] (''blastos'' Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of [[glycoproteins]] (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum.

They close together and form [[gap junction]]s, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the [[blastocoel]], creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the [[blastula]].) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to [[zona hatching|hatch]] through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.<ref>http://www.vanat.cvm.umn.edu/TFFLectPDFs/LectEarlyEmbryo{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\nThe inner cell mass will give rise to the [[pre-embryo]],<ref name=\"opentext\">{{cite web |title=28.2 Embryonic Development \u2013 Anatomy and Physiology |url=https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/28-2-embryonic-development/ |website=opentextbc.ca}}</ref> the [[amnion]], [[yolk sac]] and [[allantois]], while the fetal part of the [[placenta]] will form from the outer trophoblast layer.

It becomes thickened, with its [[secretory gland]]s becoming elongated, and is increasingly [[vascular]]. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the [[decidua]], and it produces a great number of large [[decidual cells]] in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called [[Trophoblast]].The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into an inner layer, the [[cytotrophoblast]], and an outer layer, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast contains [[cuboidal]] [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a [[Syncytium|syncytial]] layer without cell boundaries.\n\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual [[epithelium]] by projections of [[chorionic villi]], forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the [[myometrium]] and forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. The implantation is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] that stimulates the release of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored [[glycogen]] from its cells to nourish the [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink= |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Smith/>\nArteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing [[Respiration (physiology)|gas exchange]] and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\n\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic [[stem cells]], which are [[pluripotent]] and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells, and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\n===Embryonic disc===\nThe embryoblast forms an [[embryonic disc]], which is a [[bilaminar blastocyst|bilaminar disc]] of two layers, an upper layer called the [[epiblast]] (primitive [[ectoderm]]) and a lower layer called the [[hypoblast]] (primitive [[endoderm]]). The disc is stretched between what will become the [[amniotic cavity]] and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called [[Heuser's membrane]] (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or [[extraembryonic coelom]].\n\n==Gastrulation==\n{{Main|Gastrulation}}\n[[File:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|800px|[[Histogenesis]] of the three germ layers]]\n[[File:Ultrasound of embryo at 5 weeks, colored.png|thumb|200px|Artificially colored - [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]] and [[embryo]] (measuring 3 mm at 5 weeks)]]\n[[File:2910 The Placenta-02.jpg|420px|thumb|Embryo attached to placenta in amniotic cavity]]\n\nThe [[primitive streak]], a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of [[gastrulation]], which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes [[bilateral symmetry]]. A [[primitive node]] (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of [[neurulation]]. A [[primitive pit]] forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the [[notochord]] which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the [[neural plate]] which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]], which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, [[multipotent]] [[stromal]] cells that can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the [[amnion]]. The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the [[gastrula]].\n\nThe three germ layers are the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of [[somitogenesis]], [[histogenesis]] and [[organogenesis]].<ref>Ross, Lawrence M. & Lamperti, Edward D., ed.

As in all [[deuterostome]]s, the blastopore becomes the [[anus]] whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of [[neurulation]] can begin.\n\n==Neurulation==\n{{Main|Neurulation}}\n[[File:Neural crest.svg|220px|thumb|left|Neural plate]]\n[[File:Embryonic Development CNS.png|thumb|280px|Neural tube development]]\nFollowing gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and [[nervous tissue|neural tissue]], and the gastrula is now referred to as the [[neurula]].

[[Neurulation]] refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the [[neural tube]], and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow [[neural groove]] which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the [[neural crest]]. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the [[paraxial mesoderm]], which will give rise to the [[somitomeres]] that in the process of [[somitogenesis]] will differentiate into [[somite]]s that will form the [[sclerotome]], the syndetome,<ref name=\"pmid12705871\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent AE, Schweitzer R, Tabin CJ |title=A somitic compartment of tendon progenitors |journal=Cell |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=235\u201348 |date=April 2003  |pmid=12705871 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00268-X}}</ref> the\n[[myotome]] and the [[dermatome (embryology)|dermatome]] to form [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], [[tendon]]s, [[dermis]] (skin), and [[muscle]].

This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into [[angioblast]]s that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of [[angiogenesis]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/> Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of [[vascular remodelling in the embryo|vascular remodelling]] takes place.\n\nThe tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the [[infundibulum (heart)|infundibulum]], [[bulbus cordis]], [[primitive ventricle]], [[primitive atrium]], and the [[sinus venosus]].  Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the [[truncus arteriosus]]. This will divide to form the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary artery]]; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\"Anatomy & physiology\"/>\n\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of [[morphogenesis]], and this completes by the end of the fourth week. [[Programmed cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]) at the joining surfaces enables fusion to take place.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\nIn the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the [[vitelline vein|vitelline]], the [[umbilical vein|umbilical]] and the [[common cardinal vein]]s.\n\nDuring the first two months of development, the [[interatrial septum]] begins to form. This septum divides the [[primitive atrium]] into a right and a left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the [[septum primum]]. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the [[ostium primum]]. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the [[ostium secundum]]) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\nA second septum (the [[septum secundum]]) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth.

They consist of an outer layer of [[ectoderm]] and an inner part consisting of [[mesenchyme]] which is derived from the parietal layer of [[lateral plate mesoderm]]. Ectodermal cells at the distal end of the buds form the [[apical ectodermal ridge]], which creates an area of rapidly proliferating mesenchymal cells known as the [[progress zone]]. [[Cartilage]] (some of which ultimately becomes [[bone]]) and muscle develop from the mesenchyme.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{Further |Prenatal testing |Environmental toxicants and fetal development}}\n{{See also|Obstetric ultrasonography}}\nToxic exposures in the embryonic period can be the cause of major [[congenital malformation]]s, since the precursors of the major organ systems are now developing.\n\nEach cell of the preimplantation embryo has the potential to form all of the [[cellular differentiation|different cell types]] in the developing embryo. This [[cell potency]] means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]], can be removed by [[biopsy]] and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's [[uterus]].\n\n[[Sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear.<ref name=Carlson/><ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Larsen/>\n\n[[First arch syndrome]]s are [[congenital disorder]]s of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch.\n\n[[Spina bifida]] a [[congenital disorder]] is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube.\n\n[[Vertically transmitted infection]]s can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its [[prenatal development|development]].\n\n[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a [[preterm birth|preterm]] or premature birth.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Aorta-gonad-mesonephros]]\n* [[CDX2]]\n* [[Development of the reproductive system]]\n* [[Development of the urinary system]]\n* [[Developmental biology]]\n* [[Drosophila embryogenesis]]\n* [[Embryomics]]\n* [[Gonadogenesis]]\n* [[Human tooth development]]\n* [[List of human cell types derived from the germ layers]]\n* [[Potential person]]\n* [[Recapitulation theory]]\n\n==Additional images==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 01.jpg|Representing different stages of embryogenesis\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 05.jpg|Early stage of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 03.jpg|Phase of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 04.jpg|Top of the form of the embryo\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 02.jpg|Establishment of embryo medium\nFile:Sobo 1909 621.png|Spinal cord at 5 weeks\nFile:Gray947.png|Head and neck at 32 days\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Human embryos}}\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle/images/stem_blastocyst.jpg Photo of blastocyst in utero]\n* Slideshow: [https://web.archive.org/web/20161222152312/http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/99/womb In the Womb]\n* [http://www.embryology.ch/indexen.html Online course in embryology] for medicine students developed by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern\n\n{{Embryology}}\n{{Human development}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Human Embryogenesis}}\n[[Category:Embryology]]\n[[Category:Human biology]]\n", "name_user": "Iztwoz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_embryonic_development"}
