If the Taylor series is centered at zero, then that series is also called a '''Maclaurin series''', after the Scottish mathematician [[Colin Maclaurin]], who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.\n\nA function can be approximated by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series. [[Taylor's theorem]] gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such an approximation.  The polynomial formed by taking some initial terms of the Taylor series is called a Taylor polynomial. The Taylor series of a function is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of that function's Taylor polynomials as the degree increases, provided that the limit exists. A function may not be equal to its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series [[Convergence (mathematics)|converges]] at every point. A function that is equal to its Taylor series in an [[open interval]] (or a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] in the [[complex plane]]) is known as an [[analytic function]] in that interval.\n\n==Definition==\nThe Taylor series of a [[real-valued function|real]] or [[complex-valued function]] {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} that is [[infinitely differentiable function|infinitely differentiable]] at a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]] {{math|''a''}} is the [[power series]]\n<!--\n\nAny changes to the following formula, without first obtaining consensus on the discussion page will be reverted.

The [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] also worked in this area and published several Maclaurin series. It was not until 1715 however that a general method for constructing these series for all functions for which they exist was finally provided by [[Brook Taylor]],<ref>{{cite book|language=Latin|last=Taylor |first=Brook |title=Methodus Incrementorum Directa et Inversa |url=https://archive.org/details/UFIE003454_TO0324_PNI-2529_000000|trans-title=Direct and Reverse Methods of Incrementation |location=London |date=1715 |at=p. 21\u201323 (Prop.

Thus for {{mvar|x}} in this disc, {{mvar|f}} is given by a convergent power series\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-b)^n.</math>\nDifferentiating by {{mvar|x}} the above formula {{mvar|n}} times, then setting {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}} gives:\n:<math>\\frac{f^{(n)}(b)}{n!} = a_n</math>\nand so the power series expansion agrees with the Taylor series.  Thus a function is analytic in an open disc centred at {{mvar|b}} if and only if its Taylor series converges to the value of the function at each point of the disc.\n\nIf {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is equal to its Taylor series for all {{mvar|x}} in the complex plane, it is called [[entire function|entire]]. The polynomials, [[exponential function]] {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, and the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine, are examples of entire functions. Examples of functions that are not entire include the [[square root]], the [[logarithm]], the [[trigonometric function]] tangent, and its inverse, [[arctan]]. For these functions the Taylor series do not [[convergent series|converge]] if {{mvar|x}} is far from {{mvar|b}}. That is, the Taylor series [[divergent series|diverges]] at {{mvar|x}} if the distance between {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|b}} is larger than the [[radius of convergence]]. The Taylor series can be used to calculate the value of an entire function at every point, if the value of the function, and of all of its derivatives, are known at a single point.\n\nUses of the Taylor series for analytic functions include:\n# The partial sums (the [[Taylor polynomial]]s) of the series can be used as approximations of the function. These approximations are good if sufficiently many terms are included.\n#Differentiation and integration of power series can be performed term by term and is hence particularly easy.\n#An [[analytic function]] is uniquely extended to a [[holomorphic function]] on an [[open disk]] in the [[complex number|complex plane]]. This makes the machinery of [[complex analysis]] available.\n#The (truncated) series can be used to compute function values numerically, (often by recasting the polynomial into the [[Chebyshev form]] and evaluating it with the [[Clenshaw algorithm]]).\n#Algebraic operations can be done readily on the power series representation; for instance, [[Euler's formula]] follows from Taylor series expansions for trigonometric and exponential functions. This result is of fundamental importance in such fields as [[harmonic analysis]].\n#Approximations using the first few terms of a Taylor series can make otherwise unsolvable problems possible for a restricted domain; this approach is often used in physics.\n\n==Approximation error and convergence==\n{{main|Taylor's theorem}}\n[[Image:Taylorsine.svg|300px|thumb|right|The sine function (blue) is closely approximated by its Taylor polynomial of degree 7 (pink) for a full period centered at the origin.]]\n[[Image:LogTay.svg|300px|thumb|right|The Taylor polynomials for {{math|ln(1 + ''x'')}} only provide accurate approximations in the range {{math|\u22121 < ''x'' \u2264 1}}.

For {{math|''x'' > 1}}, the approximations diverge.]]\n\nPictured on the right is an accurate approximation of {{math|sin ''x''}} around the point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}. The pink curve is a polynomial of degree seven:\n\n:<math>\\sin\\left( x \\right) \\approx x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!}.\\!</math>\n\nThe error in this approximation is no more than {{math|{{sfrac|{{abs|''x''}}<sup>9</sup>|9!}}}}. In particular, for {{math|\u22121 < ''x'' < 1}}, the error is less than&nbsp;0.000003.\n\nIn contrast, also shown is a picture of the natural logarithm function {{math|ln(1 + ''x'')}} and some of its [[Taylor polynomial]]s around {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}. These approximations converge to the function only in the region {{math|\u22121 < ''x'' \u2264 1}}; outside of this region the higher-degree Taylor polynomials are ''worse'' approximations for the function. This is similar to [[Runge's phenomenon]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe ''error'' incurred in approximating a function by its {{mvar|n}}th-degree Taylor polynomial is called the ''remainder'' or ''[[Residual (numerical analysis)|residual]]'' and is denoted by the function {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}}. [[Taylor's theorem]] can be used to obtain a bound on the size of the remainder.\n\nIn general, Taylor series need not be [[convergent series|convergent]] at all. And in fact the set of functions with a convergent Taylor series is a [[meager set]] in the [[Fr\u00e9chet space]] of [[smooth functions]]. And even if the Taylor series of a function {{mvar|f}} does converge, its limit need not in general be equal to the value of the function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. For example, the function\n:<math>\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\ne^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}&\\text{if } x\\neq0\\\\\n0&\\text{if } x=0\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\nis [[infinitely differentiable]] at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, and has all derivatives zero there. Consequently, the Taylor series of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} about {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} is identically zero. However, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is not the zero function, so does not equal its Taylor series around the origin.  Thus, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an example of a [[non-analytic smooth function]].\n\nIn [[real analysis]], this example shows that there are [[infinitely differentiable function]]s {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} whose Taylor series are ''not'' equal to {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} even if they converge. By contrast, the [[holomorphic function]]s studied in [[complex analysis]] always possess a convergent Taylor series, and even the Taylor  series of [[meromorphic function]]s, which might have singularities, never converge to a value different from the function itself. The complex function {{math|''e''<sup>\u22121/''z''<sup>2</sup></sup>}}, however, does not approach 0 when {{mvar|z}} approaches 0 along the imaginary axis, so it is not [[Continuous function|continuous]] in the complex plane and its Taylor series is undefined at 0.\n\nMore generally, every sequence of real or complex numbers can appear as [[coefficient]]s in the Taylor series of an infinitely differentiable function defined on the real line, a consequence of [[Borel's lemma]].  As a result, the [[radius of convergence]] of a Taylor series can be zero. There are even infinitely differentiable functions defined on the real line whose Taylor series have a radius of convergence 0 everywhere.<ref>{{Citation | last = Rudin | first = Walter | author-link = Walter Rudin| title = Real and Complex Analysis | place = New Dehli | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1980 | page = 418, Exercise 13 | isbn = 0-07-099557-5 | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>\n\nA function cannot be written as a Taylor series centred at a [[singularity (mathematics)|singularity]]; in these cases, one can often still achieve a series expansion if one allows also negative powers of the variable {{mvar|x}}; see [[Laurent series]].

When the function {{mvar|f}} is analytic at {{mvar|a}}, the terms in the series converge to the terms of the Taylor series, and in this sense generalizes the usual Taylor series.\n\nIn general, for any infinite sequence {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, the following power series identity holds:\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{u^n}{n!}\\Delta^na_i = e^{-u}\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty\\frac{u^j}{j!}a_{i+j}.</math>\nSo in particular,\n:<math>f(a+t) = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+} e^{-\\frac{t}{h}}\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty f(a+jh) \\frac{\\left(\\frac{t}{h}\\right)^j}{j!}.</math>\nThe series on the right is the [[expectation value]] of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''a'' + ''X'')}}, where {{mvar|X}} is a [[Poisson distribution|Poisson-distributed]] [[random variable]] that takes the value {{math|''jh''}} with probability {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''t''/''h''</sup>\u00b7{{sfrac|(''t''/''h''){{isup|''j''}}|''j''!}}}}.

Particularly convenient is the use of [[computer algebra system]]s to calculate Taylor series.\n\n===First example===\nIn order to compute the 7th degree Maclaurin polynomial for the function\n:<math>f(x)=\\ln(\\cos x),\\quad x\\in\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)</math> ,\none may first rewrite the function as\n:<math>f(x)=\\ln\\bigl(1+(\\cos x-1)\\bigr)\\!</math>.\nThe Taylor series for the natural logarithm is (using the [[big O notation]])\n:<math>\\ln(1+x) = x - \\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^3}3 + {O}\\left(x^4\\right)\\!</math>\nand for the cosine function\n:<math>\\cos x - 1 = -\\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^4}{24} - \\frac{x^6}{720} + {O}\\left(x^8\\right)\\!</math>.\nThe latter series expansion has a zero [[constant term]], which enables us to substitute the second series into the first one and to easily omit terms of higher order than the 7th degree by using the big {{mvar|O}} notation:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}f(x)&=\\ln\\bigl(1+(\\cos x-1)\\bigr)\\\\\n&=(\\cos x-1) - \\tfrac12(\\cos x-1)^2 + \\tfrac13(\\cos x-1)^3+ {O}\\left((\\cos x-1)^4\\right)\\\\\n&=\\left(-\\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^4}{24} - \\frac{x^6}{720} +{O}\\left(x^8\\right)\\right)-\\frac12\\left(-\\frac{x^2}2+\\frac{x^4}{24}+{O}\\left(x^6\\right)\\right)^2+\\frac13\\left(-\\frac{x^2}2+O\\left(x^4\\right)\\right)^3 + {O}\\left(x^8\\right)\\\\ & =-\\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^4}{24}-\\frac{x^6}{720} - \\frac{x^4}8 + \\frac{x^6}{48} - \\frac{x^6}{24} +O\\left(x^8\\right)\\\\\n& =- \\frac{x^2}2 - \\frac{x^4}{12} - \\frac{x^6}{45}+O\\left(x^8\\right). \\end{align}\\!</math>\nSince the cosine is an [[even function]], the coefficients for all the odd powers {{math|''x'', ''x''<sup>3</sup>, ''x''<sup>5</sup>, ''x''<sup>7</sup>, ...}} have to be zero.\n\n===Second example===\nSuppose we want the Taylor series at 0 of the function\n: <math>g(x)=\\frac{e^x}{\\cos x}.\\!</math>\nWe have for the exponential function\n: <math>e^x = \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^n}{n!} =1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\cdots\\!</math>\nand, as in the first example,\n: <math>\\cos x = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\cdots\\!</math>\nAssume the power series is\n: <math>\\frac{e^x}{\\cos x} = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \\cdots\\!</math>\nThen multiplication with the denominator and substitution of the series of the cosine yields\n: <math>\\begin{align} e^x &= \\left(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \\cdots\\right)\\cos x\\\\\n&=\\left(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4x^4 + \\cdots\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\cdots\\right)\\\\&=c_0 - \\frac{c_0}{2}x^2 + \\frac{c_0}{4!}x^4 + c_1x - \\frac{c_1}{2}x^3 + \\frac{c_1}{4!}x^5 + c_2x^2 - \\frac{c_2}{2}x^4 + \\frac{c_2}{4!}x^6 + c_3x^3 - \\frac{c_3}{2}x^5 + \\frac{c_3}{4!}x^7 + c_4x^4 +\\cdots \\end{align}\\!</math>\nCollecting the terms up to fourth order yields\n: <math>e^x =c_0 + c_1x + \\left(c_2 - \\frac{c_0}{2}\\right)x^2 + \\left(c_3 - \\frac{c_1}{2}\\right)x^3+\\left(c_4-\\frac{c_2}{2}+\\frac{c_0}{4!}\\right)x^4 + \\cdots\\!</math>\nThe values of <math>c_i</math> can be found by comparison of coefficients with the top expression for <math>e^x</math>, yielding:\n: <math>\\frac{e^x}{\\cos x}=1 + x + x^2 + \\frac{2x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^4}{2} + \\cdots.\\!</math>\n\n===Third example===\nHere we employ a method called \"indirect expansion\" to expand the given function. This method uses the known Taylor expansion of the exponential function. In order to expand {{math|(1 + ''x'')''e<sup>x</sup>''}} as a Taylor series in {{mvar|x}}, we use the known Taylor series of function {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}:\n: <math>e^x = \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^n}{n!} =1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\cdots.</math>\nThus,\n: <math>\\begin{align}(1+x)e^x &= e^x + xe^x = \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^n}{n!} + \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n!} = 1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1} \\frac{x^n}{n!} + \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n!} \\\\ &= 1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1} \\frac{x^n}{n!} + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1} \\frac{x^n}{(n-1)!} =1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\left(\\frac{1}{n!} + \\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\\right)x^n \\\\ &= 1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\frac{n+1}{n!}x^n\\\\ &= \\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\frac{n+1}{n!}x^n.\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Taylor series as definitions==\nClassically, [[algebraic function]]s are defined by an algebraic equation, and [[transcendental function]]s (including those discussed above) are defined by some property that holds for them, such as a [[differential equation]]. For example, the [[exponential function]] is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an [[analytic function]] by its Taylor series.\n\nTaylor series are used to define functions and \"[[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s\" in diverse areas of mathematics. In particular, this is true in areas where the classical definitions of functions break down. For example, using Taylor series, one may extend analytic functions to sets of matrices and operators, such as the [[matrix exponential]] or [[matrix logarithm]].\n\nIn other areas, such as formal analysis, it is more convenient to work directly with the [[power series]] themselves. Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation ''as'' a power series which, one hopes to prove, is the Taylor series of the desired solution.\n\n==Taylor series in several variables==\n\nThe Taylor series may also be generalized to functions of more than one variable with<ref>{{citation|author=[[Lars H\u00f6rmander]]|title=The analysis of partial differential operators, volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Springer|at=Eqq. 1.1.7 and 1.1.7\u2032}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author1=Duistermaat|author2=Kolk|title=Distributions: Theory and applications|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2010|at=ch. 6}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nT(x_1,\\ldots,x_d) &= \\sum_{n_1=0}^\\infty \\cdots \\sum_{n_d = 0}^\\infty  \\frac{(x_1-a_1)^{n_1}\\cdots (x_d-a_d)^{n_d}}{n_1!\\cdots n_d!}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{n_1 + \\cdots + n_d}f}{\\partial x_1^{n_1}\\cdots \\partial x_d^{n_d}}\\right)(a_1,\\ldots,a_d) \\\\\n&= f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d) + \\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{\\partial f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d)}{\\partial x_j} (x_j - a_j) + \\frac{1}{2!} \\sum_{j=1}^d \\sum_{k=1}^d \\frac{\\partial^2 f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d)}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k} (x_j - a_j)(x_k - a_k) \\\\ \n& \\qquad \\qquad + \\frac{1}{3!} \\sum_{j=1}^d\\sum_{k=1}^d\\sum_{l=1}^d \\frac{\\partial^3 f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d)}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k \\partial x_l} (x_j - a_j)(x_k - a_k)(x_l - a_l) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor example, for a function <math>f(x,y)</math> that depends on two variables, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, the Taylor series to second order about the point {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is\n\n:<math>f(a,b) +(x-a) f_x(a,b) +(y-b) f_y(a,b) + \\frac{1}{2!}\\Big( (x-a)^2 f_{xx}(a,b) + 2(x-a)(y-b) f_{xy}(a,b) +(y-b)^2 f_{yy}(a,b) \\Big)</math>\n\nwhere the subscripts denote the respective [[partial derivative]]s.\n\nA second-order Taylor series expansion of a scalar-valued function of more than one variable can be written compactly as\n\n:<math>T(\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{a})^\\mathsf{T} D f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\frac{1}{2!} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{a})^\\mathsf{T} \\left \\{D^2 f(\\mathbf{a}) \\right \\} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{a}) + \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''D'' ''f''&thinsp;('''a''')}} is the [[gradient]] of {{mvar|f}} evaluated at {{math|'''x''' {{=}} '''a'''}} and {{math|''D''<sup>2</sup> ''f''&thinsp;('''a''')}} is the [[Hessian matrix]].

In this sense, the Fourier series is analogous to Taylor series, since the latter allows one to express a function as an infinite sum of [[power function|powers]]. Nevertheless, the two series differ from each other in several relevant issues:\n* The finite truncations of the Taylor series of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} about the point {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} are all exactly equal to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}. In contrast, the Fourier series is computed by integrating over an entire interval, so there is generally no such point where all the finite truncations of the series are exact.\n* The computation of Taylor series requires the knowledge of the function on an arbitrary small [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of a point, whereas the computation of the Fourier series requires knowing the function on its whole domain [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]. In a certain sense one could say that the Taylor series is \"local\" and the Fourier series is \"global\".\n* The Taylor series is defined for a function which has infinitely many derivatives at a single point, whereas the Fourier series is defined for any [[integrable function|integrable]] function.  In particular, the function could be nowhere differentiable. (For example, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} could be a [[Weierstrass function]].)\n* The convergence of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not coincide with the function; but if the function is analytic then the series converges [[pointwise convergence|pointwise]] to the function, and [[uniform convergence|uniformly]] on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the function is [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] then the series converges in [[Convergence in quadratic mean|quadratic mean]], but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C<sup>1</sup> then the convergence is uniform).\n* Finally, in practice one wants to approximate the function with a finite number of terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asymptotic expansion]]\n* [[Generating function]]\n* [[Laurent series]]\n* [[Madhava series]]\n* [[Newton polynomial|Newton's divided difference interpolation]]\n* [[Pad\u00e9 approximant]]\n* [[Puiseux series]]\n* [[Shift operator]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation| last1=Abramowitz| first1=Milton| author1-link=Milton Abramowitz| last2=Stegun| first2=Irene A.| author2-link=Irene Stegun| title=[[Abramowitz and Stegun|Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables]]| publisher=[[Dover Publications]]| location=New York| id=Ninth printing| year=1970| postscript=<!--none-->}}\n*{{citation| last1=Thomas|first1=George B., Jr.|last2=Finney|first2=Ross L.| title=Calculus and Analytic Geometry |edition=9th | publisher=Addison Wesley| year=1996| isbn=0-201-53174-7| postscript=<!--none-->}}\n*{{citation| last=Greenberg| first=Michael| title=Advanced Engineering Mathematics| edition=2nd| publisher=Prentice Hall| year=1998| isbn=0-13-321431-1| postscript=<!--none-->| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/advancedengineer0000gree}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links\n|wikt=Taylor series\n|commons=Category:Taylor series\n|b=Calculus/Taylor series\n|v=Taylor's series\n|n=no |q=no |s=no |species=no\n|d=Q131187}}\n* {{springer|title=Taylor series|id=p/t092320}}\n* {{MathWorld| urlname= TaylorSeries| title= Taylor Series}}\n* [http://blog.ivank.net/taylor-polynomial-clarified.html Taylor polynomial] - practical introduction\n* [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Projects/Pearce/Chapters/Ch9_3.html Madhava of Sangamagramma ]\n* \"[http://csma31.csm.jmu.edu/physics/rudmin/ParkerSochacki.htm Discussion of the Parker-Sochacki Method]\"\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070605020930/http://stud3.tuwien.ac.at/~e0004876/taylor/Taylor_en.html Another Taylor visualisation] &mdash; where you can choose the point of the approximation and the number of derivatives\n* [http://numericalmethods.eng.usf.edu/topics/taylor_series.html Taylor series revisited for numerical methods] at [http://numericalmethods.eng.usf.edu Numerical Methods for the STEM Undergraduate]\n* [http://cinderella.de/files/HTMLDemos/2C02_Taylor.html  Cinderella 2: Taylor expansion]\n* [http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/tayser/tayser01/tayser01.html Taylor series]\n* [http://www.efunda.com/math/taylor_series/inverse_trig.cfm Inverse trigonometric functions Taylor series]\n* {{cite web |title=Essence of Calculus: Taylor series |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4&index=11&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr |via=[[YouTube]] }}\n{{series (mathematics)}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Real analysis]]\n[[Category:Complex analysis]]\n[[Category:Series expansions]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n[[File:sintay_SVG.svg|thumb|300px|As the degree of the Taylor polynomial rises, it approaches the correct function.

If the Taylor series is centered at zero, then that series is also called a '''Maclaurin series''', after the Scottish mathematician [[Colin Maclaurin]], who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.\n\nA function can be approximated by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series. [[Taylor's theorem]] gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such an approximation.  The polynomial formed by taking some initial terms of the Taylor series is called a Taylor polynomial. The Taylor series of a function is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of that function's Taylor polynomials as the degree increases, provided that the limit exists. A function may not be equal to its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series [[Convergence (mathematics)|converges]] at every point.

The [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] also worked in this area and published several Maclaurin series. It was not until 1715 however that a general method for constructing these series for all functions for which they exist was finally provided by [[Brook Taylor]],<ref>{{cite book|language=Latin|last=Taylor |first=Brook |title=Methodus Incrementorum Directa et Inversa |url=https://archive.org/details/UFIE003454_TO0324_PNI-2529_000000|trans-title=Direct and Reverse Methods of Incrementation |location=London |date=1715 |at=p. 21\u201323 (Prop.

Thus for {{mvar|x}} in this disc, {{mvar|f}} is given by a convergent power series\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-b)^n.</math>\nDifferentiating by {{mvar|x}} the above formula {{mvar|n}} times, then setting {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}} gives:\n:<math>\\frac{f^{(n)}(b)}{n!} = a_n</math>\nand so the power series expansion agrees with the Taylor series.  Thus a function is analytic in an open disc centred at {{mvar|b}} if and only if its Taylor series converges to the value of the function at each point of the disc.\n\nIf {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is equal to its Taylor series for all {{mvar|x}} in the complex plane, it is called [[entire function|entire]]. The polynomials, [[exponential function]] {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, and the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine, are examples of entire functions. Examples of functions that are not entire include the [[square root]], the [[logarithm]], the [[trigonometric function]] tangent, and its inverse, [[arctan]]. For these functions the Taylor series do not [[convergent series|converge]] if {{mvar|x}} is far from {{mvar|b}}. That is, the Taylor series [[divergent series|diverges]] at {{mvar|x}} if the distance between {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|b}} is larger than the [[radius of convergence]]. The Taylor series can be used to calculate the value of an entire function at every point, if the value of the function, and of all of its derivatives, are known at a single point.\n\nUses of the Taylor series for analytic functions include:\n# The partial sums (the [[Taylor polynomial]]s) of the series can be used as approximations of the function. These approximations are good if sufficiently many terms are included.\n#Differentiation and integration of power series can be performed term by term and is hence particularly easy.\n#An [[analytic function]] is uniquely extended to a [[holomorphic function]] on an [[open disk]] in the [[complex number|complex plane]]. This makes the machinery of [[complex analysis]] available.\n#The (truncated) series can be used to compute function values numerically, (often by recasting the polynomial into the [[Chebyshev form]] and evaluating it with the [[Clenshaw algorithm]]).\n#Algebraic operations can be done readily on the power series representation; for instance, [[Euler's formula]] follows from Taylor series expansions for trigonometric and exponential functions. This result is of fundamental importance in such fields as [[harmonic analysis]].\n#Approximations using the first few terms of a Taylor series can make otherwise unsolvable problems possible for a restricted domain; this approach is often used in physics.\n\n==Approximation error and convergence==\n{{main|Taylor's theorem}}\n[[Image:Taylorsine.svg|300px|thumb|right|The sine function (blue) is closely approximated by its Taylor polynomial of degree 7 (pink) for a full period centered at the origin.]]\n[[Image:LogTay.svg|300px|thumb|right|The Taylor polynomials for {{math|ln(1 + ''x'')}} only provide accurate approximations in the range {{math|\u22121 < ''x'' \u2264 1}}. For {{math|''x'' > 1}}, Taylor polynomials of higher degree provide worse approximations.]]\n[[Image:Logarithm GIF.gif|300px|thumb|right|The Taylor approximations for {{math|ln(1 + ''x'')}} (black). For {{math|''x'' > 1}}, the approximations diverge.]]\n\nPictured on the right is an accurate approximation of {{math|sin ''x''}} around the point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}. The pink curve is a polynomial of degree seven:\n\n:<math>\\sin\\left( x \\right) \\approx x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!}.\\!</math>\n\nThe error in this approximation is no more than {{math|{{sfrac|{{abs|''x''}}<sup>9</sup>|9!}}}}. In particular, for {{math|\u22121 < ''x'' < 1}}, the error is less than&nbsp;0.000003.\n\nIn contrast, also shown is a picture of the natural logarithm function {{math|ln(1 + ''x'')}} and some of its [[Taylor polynomial]]s around {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}. These approximations converge to the function only in the region {{math|\u22121 < ''x'' \u2264 1}}; outside of this region the higher-degree Taylor polynomials are ''worse'' approximations for the function. This is similar to [[Runge's phenomenon]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe ''error'' incurred in approximating a function by its {{mvar|n}}th-degree Taylor polynomial is called the ''remainder'' or ''[[Residual (numerical analysis)|residual]]'' and is denoted by the function {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}}. [[Taylor's theorem]] can be used to obtain a bound on the size of the remainder.\n\nIn general, Taylor series need not be [[convergent series|convergent]] at all. And in fact the set of functions with a convergent Taylor series is a [[meager set]] in the [[Fr\u00e9chet space]] of [[smooth functions]]. And even if the Taylor series of a function {{mvar|f}} does converge, its limit need not in general be equal to the value of the function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. For example, the function\n:<math>\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\ne^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}&\\text{if } x\\neq0\\\\\n0&\\text{if } x=0\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\nis [[infinitely differentiable]] at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, and has all derivatives zero there. Consequently, the Taylor series of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} about {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} is identically zero. However, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is not the zero function, so does not equal its Taylor series around the origin.  Thus, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an example of a [[non-analytic smooth function]].\n\nIn [[real analysis]], this example shows that there are [[infinitely differentiable function]]s {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} whose Taylor series are ''not'' equal to {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} even if they converge. By contrast, the [[holomorphic function]]s studied in [[complex analysis]] always possess a convergent Taylor series, and even the Taylor  series of [[meromorphic function]]s, which might have singularities, never converge to a value different from the function itself. The complex function {{math|''e''<sup>\u22121/''z''<sup>2</sup></sup>}}, however, does not approach 0 when {{mvar|z}} approaches 0 along the imaginary axis, so it is not [[Continuous function|continuous]] in the complex plane and its Taylor series is undefined at 0.\n\nMore generally, every sequence of real or complex numbers can appear as [[coefficient]]s in the Taylor series of an infinitely differentiable function defined on the real line, a consequence of [[Borel's lemma]].  As a result, the [[radius of convergence]] of a Taylor series can be zero. There are even infinitely differentiable functions defined on the real line whose Taylor series have a radius of convergence 0 everywhere.<ref>{{Citation | last = Rudin | first = Walter | author-link = Walter Rudin| title = Real and Complex Analysis | place = New Dehli | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1980 | page = 418, Exercise 13 | isbn = 0-07-099557-5 | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>\n\nA function cannot be written as a Taylor series centred at a [[singularity (mathematics)|singularity]]; in these cases, one can often still achieve a series expansion if one allows also negative powers of the variable {{mvar|x}}; see [[Laurent series]].

When the function {{mvar|f}} is analytic at {{mvar|a}}, the terms in the series converge to the terms of the Taylor series, and in this sense generalizes the usual Taylor series.\n\nIn general, for any infinite sequence {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, the following power series identity holds:\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{u^n}{n!}\\Delta^na_i = e^{-u}\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty\\frac{u^j}{j!}a_{i+j}.</math>\nSo in particular,\n:<math>f(a+t) = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+} e^{-\\frac{t}{h}}\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty f(a+jh) \\frac{\\left(\\frac{t}{h}\\right)^j}{j!}.</math>\nThe series on the right is the [[expectation value]] of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''a'' + ''X'')}}, where {{mvar|X}} is a [[Poisson distribution|Poisson-distributed]] [[random variable]] that takes the value {{math|''jh''}} with probability {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''t''/''h''</sup>\u00b7{{sfrac|(''t''/''h''){{isup|''j''}}|''j''!}}}}.

One can attempt to use the definition of the Taylor series, though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a readily apparent pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying [[integration by parts]]. Particularly convenient is the use of [[computer algebra system]]s to calculate Taylor series.\n\n===First example===\nIn order to compute the 7th degree Maclaurin polynomial for the function\n:<math>f(x)=\\ln(\\cos x),\\quad x\\in\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)</math> ,\none may first rewrite the function as\n:<math>f(x)=\\ln\\bigl(1+(\\cos x-1)\\bigr)\\!</math>.\nThe Taylor series for the natural logarithm is (using the [[big O notation]])\n:<math>\\ln(1+x) = x - \\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^3}3 + {O}\\left(x^4\\right)\\!</math>\nand for the cosine function\n:<math>\\cos x - 1 = -\\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^4}{24} - \\frac{x^6}{720} + {O}\\left(x^8\\right)\\!</math>.\nThe latter series expansion has a zero [[constant term]], which enables us to substitute the second series into the first one and to easily omit terms of higher order than the 7th degree by using the big {{mvar|O}} notation:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}f(x)&=\\ln\\bigl(1+(\\cos x-1)\\bigr)\\\\\n&=(\\cos x-1) - \\tfrac12(\\cos x-1)^2 + \\tfrac13(\\cos x-1)^3+ {O}\\left((\\cos x-1)^4\\right)\\\\\n&=\\left(-\\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^4}{24} - \\frac{x^6}{720} +{O}\\left(x^8\\right)\\right)-\\frac12\\left(-\\frac{x^2}2+\\frac{x^4}{24}+{O}\\left(x^6\\right)\\right)^2+\\frac13\\left(-\\frac{x^2}2+O\\left(x^4\\right)\\right)^3 + {O}\\left(x^8\\right)\\\\ & =-\\frac{x^2}2 + \\frac{x^4}{24}-\\frac{x^6}{720} - \\frac{x^4}8 + \\frac{x^6}{48} - \\frac{x^6}{24} +O\\left(x^8\\right)\\\\\n& =- \\frac{x^2}2 - \\frac{x^4}{12} - \\frac{x^6}{45}+O\\left(x^8\\right). \\end{align}\\!</math>\nSince the cosine is an [[even function]], the coefficients for all the odd powers {{math|''x'', ''x''<sup>3</sup>, ''x''<sup>5</sup>, ''x''<sup>7</sup>, ...}} have to be zero.\n\n===Second example===\nSuppose we want the Taylor series at 0 of the function\n: <math>g(x)=\\frac{e^x}{\\cos x}.\\!</math>\nWe have for the exponential function\n: <math>e^x = \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^n}{n!} =1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\cdots\\!</math>\nand, as in the first example,\n: <math>\\cos x = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\cdots\\!</math>\nAssume the power series is\n: <math>\\frac{e^x}{\\cos x} = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \\cdots\\!</math>\nThen multiplication with the denominator and substitution of the series of the cosine yields\n: <math>\\begin{align} e^x &= \\left(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \\cdots\\right)\\cos x\\\\\n&=\\left(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4x^4 + \\cdots\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\cdots\\right)\\\\&=c_0 - \\frac{c_0}{2}x^2 + \\frac{c_0}{4!}x^4 + c_1x - \\frac{c_1}{2}x^3 + \\frac{c_1}{4!}x^5 + c_2x^2 - \\frac{c_2}{2}x^4 + \\frac{c_2}{4!}x^6 + c_3x^3 - \\frac{c_3}{2}x^5 + \\frac{c_3}{4!}x^7 + c_4x^4 +\\cdots \\end{align}\\!</math>\nCollecting the terms up to fourth order yields\n: <math>e^x =c_0 + c_1x + \\left(c_2 - \\frac{c_0}{2}\\right)x^2 + \\left(c_3 - \\frac{c_1}{2}\\right)x^3+\\left(c_4-\\frac{c_2}{2}+\\frac{c_0}{4!}\\right)x^4 + \\cdots\\!</math>\nThe values of <math>c_i</math> can be found by comparison of coefficients with the top expression for <math>e^x</math>, yielding:\n: <math>\\frac{e^x}{\\cos x}=1 + x + x^2 + \\frac{2x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^4}{2} + \\cdots.\\!</math>\n\n===Third example===\nHere we employ a method called \"indirect expansion\" to expand the given function.

In order to expand {{math|(1 + ''x'')''e<sup>x</sup>''}} as a Taylor series in {{mvar|x}}, we use the known Taylor series of function {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}:\n: <math>e^x = \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^n}{n!} =1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\cdots.</math>\nThus,\n: <math>\\begin{align}(1+x)e^x &= e^x + xe^x = \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^n}{n!} + \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n!} = 1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1} \\frac{x^n}{n!} + \\sum^\\infty_{n=0} \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n!} \\\\ &= 1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1} \\frac{x^n}{n!} + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1} \\frac{x^n}{(n-1)!} =1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\left(\\frac{1}{n!} + \\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\\right)x^n \\\\ &= 1 + \\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\frac{n+1}{n!}x^n\\\\ &= \\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\frac{n+1}{n!}x^n.\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Taylor series as definitions==\nClassically, [[algebraic function]]s are defined by an algebraic equation, and [[transcendental function]]s (including those discussed above) are defined by some property that holds for them, such as a [[differential equation]]. For example, the [[exponential function]] is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an [[analytic function]] by its Taylor series.\n\nTaylor series are used to define functions and \"[[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s\" in diverse areas of mathematics. In particular, this is true in areas where the classical definitions of functions break down. For example, using Taylor series, one may extend analytic functions to sets of matrices and operators, such as the [[matrix exponential]] or [[matrix logarithm]].\n\nIn other areas, such as formal analysis, it is more convenient to work directly with the [[power series]] themselves. Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation ''as'' a power series which, one hopes to prove, is the Taylor series of the desired solution.\n\n==Taylor series in several variables==\n\nThe Taylor series may also be generalized to functions of more than one variable with<ref>{{citation|author=[[Lars H\u00f6rmander]]|title=The analysis of partial differential operators, volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Springer|at=Eqq. 1.1.7 and 1.1.7\u2032}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author1=Duistermaat|author2=Kolk|title=Distributions: Theory and applications|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2010|at=ch. 6}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nT(x_1,\\ldots,x_d) &= \\sum_{n_1=0}^\\infty \\cdots \\sum_{n_d = 0}^\\infty  \\frac{(x_1-a_1)^{n_1}\\cdots (x_d-a_d)^{n_d}}{n_1!\\cdots n_d!}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{n_1 + \\cdots + n_d}f}{\\partial x_1^{n_1}\\cdots \\partial x_d^{n_d}}\\right)(a_1,\\ldots,a_d) \\\\\n&= f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d) + \\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{\\partial f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d)}{\\partial x_j} (x_j - a_j) + \\frac{1}{2!} \\sum_{j=1}^d \\sum_{k=1}^d \\frac{\\partial^2 f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d)}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k} (x_j - a_j)(x_k - a_k) \\\\ \n& \\qquad \\qquad + \\frac{1}{3!} \\sum_{j=1}^d\\sum_{k=1}^d\\sum_{l=1}^d \\frac{\\partial^3 f(a_1, \\ldots,a_d)}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k \\partial x_l} (x_j - a_j)(x_k - a_k)(x_l - a_l) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor example, for a function <math>f(x,y)</math> that depends on two variables, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, the Taylor series to second order about the point {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is\n\n:<math>f(a,b) +(x-a) f_x(a,b) +(y-b) f_y(a,b) + \\frac{1}{2!}\\Big( (x-a)^2 f_{xx}(a,b) + 2(x-a)(y-b) f_{xy}(a,b) +(y-b)^2 f_{yy}(a,b) \\Big)</math>\n\nwhere the subscripts denote the respective [[partial derivative]]s.\n\nA second-order Taylor series expansion of a scalar-valued function of more than one variable can be written compactly as\n\n:<math>T(\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{a})^\\mathsf{T} D f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\frac{1}{2!} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{a})^\\mathsf{T} \\left \\{D^2 f(\\mathbf{a}) \\right \\} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{a}) + \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''D'' ''f''&thinsp;('''a''')}} is the [[gradient]] of {{mvar|f}} evaluated at {{math|'''x''' {{=}} '''a'''}} and {{math|''D''<sup>2</sup> ''f''&thinsp;('''a''')}} is the [[Hessian matrix]].

In this sense, the Fourier series is analogous to Taylor series, since the latter allows one to express a function as an infinite sum of [[power function|powers]]. Nevertheless, the two series differ from each other in several relevant issues:\n* The finite truncations of the Taylor series of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} about the point {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} are all exactly equal to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}. In contrast, the Fourier series is computed by integrating over an entire interval, so there is generally no such point where all the finite truncations of the series are exact.\n* The computation of Taylor series requires the knowledge of the function on an arbitrary small [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of a point, whereas the computation of the Fourier series requires knowing the function on its whole domain [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]. In a certain sense one could say that the Taylor series is \"local\" and the Fourier series is \"global\".\n* The Taylor series is defined for a function which has infinitely many derivatives at a single point, whereas the Fourier series is defined for any [[integrable function|integrable]] function.  In particular, the function could be nowhere differentiable. (For example, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} could be a [[Weierstrass function]].)\n* The convergence of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not coincide with the function; but if the function is analytic then the series converges [[pointwise convergence|pointwise]] to the function, and [[uniform convergence|uniformly]] on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the function is [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] then the series converges in [[Convergence in quadratic mean|quadratic mean]], but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C<sup>1</sup> then the convergence is uniform).\n* Finally, in practice one wants to approximate the function with a finite number of terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asymptotic expansion]]\n* [[Generating function]]\n* [[Laurent series]]\n* [[Madhava series]]\n* [[Newton polynomial|Newton's divided difference interpolation]]\n* [[Pad\u00e9 approximant]]\n* [[Puiseux series]]\n* [[Shift operator]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation| last1=Abramowitz| first1=Milton| author1-link=Milton Abramowitz| last2=Stegun| first2=Irene A.| author2-link=Irene Stegun| title=[[Abramowitz and Stegun|Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables]]| publisher=[[Dover Publications]]| location=New York| id=Ninth printing| year=1970| postscript=<!--none-->}}\n*{{citation| last1=Thomas|first1=George B., Jr.|last2=Finney|first2=Ross L.| title=Calculus and Analytic Geometry |edition=9th | publisher=Addison Wesley| year=1996| isbn=0-201-53174-7| postscript=<!--none-->}}\n*{{citation| last=Greenberg| first=Michael| title=Advanced Engineering Mathematics| edition=2nd| publisher=Prentice Hall| year=1998| isbn=0-13-321431-1| postscript=<!--none-->| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/advancedengineer0000gree}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links\n|wikt=Taylor series\n|commons=Category:Taylor series\n|b=Calculus/Taylor series\n|v=Taylor's series\n|n=no |q=no |s=no |species=no\n|d=Q131187}}\n* {{springer|title=Taylor series|id=p/t092320}}\n* {{MathWorld| urlname= TaylorSeries| title= Taylor Series}}\n* [http://blog.ivank.net/taylor-polynomial-clarified.html Taylor polynomial] - practical introduction\n* [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Projects/Pearce/Chapters/Ch9_3.html Madhava of Sangamagramma ]\n* \"[http://csma31.csm.jmu.edu/physics/rudmin/ParkerSochacki.htm Discussion of the Parker-Sochacki Method]\"\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070605020930/http://stud3.tuwien.ac.at/~e0004876/taylor/Taylor_en.html Another Taylor visualisation] &mdash; where you can choose the point of the approximation and the number of derivatives\n* [http://numericalmethods.eng.usf.edu/topics/taylor_series.html Taylor series revisited for numerical methods] at [http://numericalmethods.eng.usf.edu Numerical Methods for the STEM Undergraduate]\n* [http://cinderella.de/files/HTMLDemos/2C02_Taylor.html  Cinderella 2: Taylor expansion]\n* [http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/tayser/tayser01/tayser01.html Taylor series]\n* [http://www.efunda.com/math/taylor_series/inverse_trig.cfm Inverse trigonometric functions Taylor series]\n* {{cite web |title=Essence of Calculus: Taylor series |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4&index=11&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr |via=[[YouTube]] }}\n\n[[Category:Real analysis]]\n[[Category:Complex analysis]]\n[[Category:Series expansions]]\n", "name_user": "MathXplore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series"}

Violence against blacks increased, with numerous [[lynchings]] through the turn of the century. The system of ''[[de jure]]'' state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged from the post-Reconstruction South became to be known as the \"[[Jim Crow]]\" system. The United States Supreme Court, made up almost entirely of Northerners, upheld the constitutionality of those state laws that required [[racial segregation]] in public facilities in its 1896 decision ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', legitimizing them through the \"[[separate but equal]]\" doctrine.<ref>[[Rayford Logan]],''The Betrayal of the Negro from Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson'', pp. 97\u201398.

While tensions and [[civil rights]] violations were most intense in the South, social discrimination affected African Americans in other regions as well.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'', 3rd rev. ed.

When white Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more restrictive, essentially forcing black voters off the voting rolls. The number of African-American voters dropped dramatically, and they were no longer able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised tens of thousands of African Americans, and U.S. states such as Alabama disenfranchised poor whites as well.\n* [[Exploitation of labour|Exploitation]]. Increased economic oppression of blacks through the [[convict lease]] system, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]], and [[Asian Pacific American|Asians]], denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.\n* Violence. Individual, police, paramilitary, organizational, and [[Mass racial violence in the United States|mob racial violence against blacks]] (and Latinos in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and Asians in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]).\n\n[[File:KKK night rally in Chicago c1920 cph.3b12355.jpg|thumb|KKK night rally in [[Chicago]], {{circa|1920}}]]\n\nAfrican Americans and other ethnic minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing (see the [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)]]). The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through [[litigation]], education, and [[lobbying]] efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), when the [[Warren Court]] ruled that segregation of public schools in the US was unconstitutional and, by implication, overturned the \"[[separate but equal]]\" doctrine established in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' of 1896.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Following the unanimous Supreme Court ruling, many states began to gradually integrate their schools, but some areas of the South resisted by closing public schools altogether.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe integration of Southern public libraries followed demonstrations and protests that used techniques seen in other elements of the larger civil rights movement.<ref name=\"Fultz, M. 2006\">Fultz, M.

From 1910 to 1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west out of the South. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], most during and after World War II. So many people migrated that the demographics of some previously black-majority states changed to a white majority (in combination with other developments). The rapid influx of blacks altered the demographics of Northern and Western cities; happening at a period of expanded European, Hispanic, and Asian immigration, it added to social competition and tensions, with the new migrants and immigrants battling for a place in jobs and housing.\n\nReflecting social tensions after World War I, as veterans struggled to return to the workforce and labor unions were organizing, the [[Red Summer]] of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of white race riots against blacks that took place in more than three dozen cities, such as the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]] and the [[Omaha race riot of 1919]]. Urban problems such as crime and disease were blamed on the large influx of Southern blacks to cities in the north and west, based on stereotypes of rural southern African-Americans. Overall, African Americans in Northern and Western cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of \"targeted violence, [[restrictive covenants]], [[redlining]] and racial steering\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tolnay |first=Stewart |title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |year=2003 |volume=29 |pages=218\u2013221 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009 |jstor=30036966|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6557078cf3beb9eae2bcd7ad443cf49f46b8ef4 }}</ref> The Great Migration resulted in many African Americans becoming urbanized, and they began to realign from the Republican to the Democratic Party, especially because of opportunities under the [[New Deal]] of the [[Franklin D.

The situation was perpetuated by real estate agents' continuing [[Residential segregation|racial discrimination]].

They were faced with \"[[massive resistance]]\" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and [[disfranchisement|voter suppression]]. In defiance, African-American activists adopted a combined strategy of [[direct action]], [[nonviolence]], [[nonviolent resistance]], and many events described as [[civil disobedience]], giving rise to the civil rights movement of 1954 to 1968.\n\n== The Beginnings of Direct Action (1950s) ==\nThe strategy of public education, legislative lobbying, and litigation that had typified the civil rights movement during the first half of the 20th century broadened after ''Brown'' to a strategy that emphasized \"[[direct action]]\": boycotts, [[sit-in]]s, [[Freedom Rides]], marches or walks, and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance, standing in line, and, at times, civil disobedience.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nChurches, local grassroots organizations, fraternal societies, and black-owned businesses mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions.

Their method of addressing the issue of school segregation was to enumerate several arguments. One pertained to having exposure to interracial contact in a school environment. It was argued that interracial contact would, in turn, help prepare children to live with the pressures that society exerts in regards to race and thereby afford them a better chance of living in a democracy. In addition, another argument emphasized how \"'education' comprehends the entire process of developing and training the mental, physical and moral powers and capabilities of human beings\".<ref>Risa L.

Parks soon became the symbol of the resulting Montgomery Bus Boycott and received national publicity. She was later hailed as the \"mother of the civil rights movement\".<ref>J. Mills Thornton III, \"Challenge and Response in the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955\u20131956.\" ''Alabama Review'' 67.1 (2014): 40-112.</ref>\n\nParks was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee where nonviolence as a strategy was taught by [[Myles Horton]] and others.

Following Rosa Park's arrest, Jo Ann Robinson mimeographed 52,500 leaflets calling for a boycott. They were distributed around the city and helped gather the attention of civil rights leaders. After the city rejected many of their suggested reforms, the NAACP, led by [[Edgar Nixon|E. D. Nixon]], pushed for full desegregation of public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days, until the local ordinance segregating African Americans and whites on public buses was repealed. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery partook in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue significantly, as they comprised the majority of the riders. In November 1956, the United States Supreme Court upheld a district court ruling in the case of ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' and ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated, ending the boycott.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nLocal leaders established the Montgomery Improvement Association to focus their efforts. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was elected President of this organization. The lengthy protest attracted national attention for him and the city. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.<ref name=\"Robinson 1986\" />\n\n=== Desegregating Little Rock Central High School, 1957 ===\n{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}\nA crisis erupted in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], when [[Governor of Arkansas]] [[Orval Faubus]] called out the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] on September 4 to prevent entry to the [[Little Rock Nine|nine African-American students]] who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school, [[Little Rock Central High School]].<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm#1957lrsd The Little Rock Nine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504182855/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm#1957lrsd |date=May 4, 2017 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> Under the guidance of [[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)|Daisy Bates]], the nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades.\n\nOn the first day of school, 15-year-old [[Elizabeth Eckford]] was the only one of the nine students who showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. A photo was taken of Eckford being harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car for her protection. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in [[jeep]]s.\n\n[[File:Little Rock integration protest.jpg|thumb|left|White parents rally against integrating Little Rock's schools.]]\n\nFaubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the ''Brown'' decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court ruling. Faubus' resistance received the attention of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. But, Eisenhower federalized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in Arkansas and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower deployed elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Little Rock to protect the students.\n\nThe students attended high school under harsh conditions. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from other students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers were not around. One of the Little Rock Nine, [[Minnijean Brown-Trickey|Minnijean Brown]], was suspended for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line. Later, she was expelled for verbally abusing a white female student.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html Minnijean Brown Trickey, America.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128093710/http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html |date=November 28, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOnly [[Ernest Green]] of the Little Rock Nine graduated from Central High School. After the 1957\u201358 school year was over, Little Rock closed its public school system completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.\n\n=== The method of nonviolence and nonviolence training ===\nDuring the time period considered to be the \"African-American civil rights\" era, the predominant use of protest was nonviolent, or peaceful.<ref name=Erikson>{{cite book |last1=Erikson |first1=Erik |title=Gandhi's Truth: On the Origins of Militant Nonviolence |date=1969 |publisher=Norton |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-393-31034-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/gandhistruth00erik_0/page/415 415] |url=https://archive.org/details/gandhistruth00erik_0/page/415 }}</ref> Often referred to as pacifism, the method of nonviolence is considered to be an attempt to impact society positively. Although acts of racial discrimination have occurred historically throughout the United States, perhaps the most violent regions have been in the former Confederate states. During the 1950s and 1960s, the nonviolent protesting of the civil rights movement caused definite tension, which gained national attention.\n\nIn order to prepare for protests physically and psychologically, demonstrators received training in nonviolence. According to former civil rights activist Bruce Hartford, there are two main branches of nonviolence training. There is the philosophical method, which involves understanding the method of nonviolence and why it is considered useful, and there is the tactical method, which ultimately teaches demonstrators \"how to be a protestor{{mdash}}how to sit-in, how to picket, how to defend yourself against attack, giving training on how to remain cool when people are screaming racist insults into your face and pouring stuff on you and hitting you\" (Civil Rights Movement Veterans). The philosophical method of nonviolence, in the American civil rights movement, was largely inspired by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s \"non-cooperation\" with the British colonists in India, which was intended to gain attention so that the public would either \"intervene in advance,\" or \"provide public pressure in support of the action to be taken\" (Erikson, 415). As Hartford explains it, philosophical nonviolence training aims to \"shape the individual person's attitude and mental response to crises and violence\" (Civil Rights Movement Veterans). Hartford and activists like him, who trained in tactical nonviolence, considered it necessary in order to ensure physical safety, instill discipline, teach demonstrators how to demonstrate, and form mutual confidence among demonstrators (Civil Rights Movement Veterans).<ref name=Erikson /><ref>{{cite web |title=Civil Rights Movement Veterans |url=http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv3.htm |website=Civil Rights Movement Veterans |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor many, the concept of nonviolent protest was a way of life, a culture. However, not everyone agreed with this notion. James Forman, former SNCC (and later Black Panther) member, and nonviolence trainer, was among those who did not. In his autobiography, ''The Making of Black Revolutionaries'', Forman revealed his perspective on the method of nonviolence as \"strictly a tactic, not a way of life without limitations.\" Similarly, [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]], who was also an active member of SNCC, felt that the method of nonviolence was practical. When interviewed by author Robert Penn Warren, Moses said \"There's no question that he [Martin Luther King Jr.] had a great deal of influence with the masses. But I don't think it's in the direction of love. It's in a practical direction . . .\" (Who Speaks for the Negro? Warren).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bruce Hartford (full interview) |url=https://vimeo.com/17532881 |via=Vimeo |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Forman |first1=James |title=The Making of Black Revolutionaries |url=https://archive.org/details/makingofblackrev00form |url-access=registration |date=1972 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-940880-10-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Robert F. Williams and the debate on nonviolence, 1959\u20131964 ===\nThe Jim Crow system employed \"terror as a means of social control,\"<ref>Francis Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, ''Poor People's Movements: How They Succeed, How They Fail'' (Random House, 1977), 182</ref> with the most organized manifestations being the Ku Klux Klan and their collaborators in local police departments. This violence played a key role in blocking the progress of the civil rights movement in the late 1950s. Some black organizations in the South began practicing armed self-defense. The first to do so openly was the Monroe, North Carolina, chapter of the NAACP led by [[Robert F. Williams]]. Williams had rebuilt the chapter after its membership was terrorized out of public life by the Klan. He did so by encouraging a new, more working-class membership to arm itself thoroughly and defend against attack.<ref>[http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/T-1534.html Timothy B.

Williams and the Roots of \"Black Power\"'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 79\u201380]</ref> When Klan nightriders attacked the home of NAACP member Albert Perry in October 1957, Williams' militia exchanged gunfire with the stunned Klansmen, who quickly retreated.

Williams' declaration was quoted on the front page of ''The New York Times'', and ''The Carolina Times'' considered it \"the biggest civil rights story of 1959\".<ref>Tyson, Radio Free Dixie, 149</ref> NAACP National chairman Roy Wilkins immediately suspended Williams from his position, but the Monroe organizer won support from numerous NAACP chapters across the country. Ultimately, Wilkins resorted to bribing influential organizer Daisy Bates to campaign against Williams at the NAACP national convention and the suspension was upheld. The convention nonetheless passed a resolution which stated: \"We do not deny, but reaffirm the right of individual and collective self-defense against unlawful assaults.\"<ref>Tyson, Radio Free Dixie, 159\u2013164</ref> Martin Luther King Jr. argued for Williams' removal,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/williams-robert-franklin|title=Williams, Robert Franklin|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> but Ella Baker<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEfOhvXSvZsC&pg=PA213 Barbara Ransby, ''Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 213\u2013216]</ref> and WEB Dubois<ref name=\"history.msu.edu\" /> both publicly praised the Monroe leader's position.\n\nWilliams{{mdash}}along with his wife, Mabel Williams{{mdash}}continued to play a leadership role in the Monroe movement, and to some degree, in the national movement.

That proved to be a dangerous mission. In [[Anniston, Alabama]], one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives.<ref name=\"Arsenault\">{{cite book |last=Arsenault |first=Raymond |title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice |url=https://archive.org/details/freedomriders1960000arse |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford Press |year=2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Freedom Riders attacked.jpg|thumb|A mob beats Freedom Riders in Birmingham.

Although they were protesting interstate bus segregation in peace, they were met with violence in Montgomery as a large, white mob attacked them for their activism. They caused an enormous, 2-hour long riot which resulted in 22 injuries, five of whom were hospitalized.<ref>Black Protest (1961)</ref>\n\nMob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides. SNCC activists from Nashville brought in new riders to continue the journey from Birmingham to New Orleans. In [[Montgomery, Alabama]], at the [[Greyhound Bus Station (Montgomery, Alabama)|Greyhound Bus Station]], a mob charged another busload of riders, knocking [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] unconscious with a crate and smashing ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' photographer [[Don Urbrock]] in the face with his own camera.

In Jackson, some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100&nbsp;\u00b0F heat. Others were transferred to the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] at Parchman, where they were treated to harsh conditions. Sometimes the men were suspended by \"wrist breakers\" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.\n\nPublic sympathy and support for the freedom riders led [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration to order the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, 1961, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; \"white\" and \"colored\" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.\n\nThe student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, a single-minded activist; [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], the revered \"guru\" of nonviolent theory and tactics; [[Diane Nash]], an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice; [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]], pioneer of voting registration in Mississippi; and [[James Bevel]], a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer, strategist, and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included [[Charles McDew]], [[Bernard Lafayette]], [[Charles Jones (activist)|Charles Jones]], [[Lonnie C. King Jr.|Lonnie King]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Hosea Williams]], and [[Stokely Carmichael]].\n\n=== Voter registration organizing ===\nAfter the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as [[Amzie Moore]], [[Aaron Henry]], [[Medgar Evers]], and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and to build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its new constitution in 1890 with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from voter rolls and voting. Also, violence at the time of elections had earlier suppressed black voting.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, preventing blacks from voting had become an essential part of the culture of white supremacy. In June and July 1959, members of the black community in Fayette County, TN formed the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League to spur voting. At the time, there were 16,927 blacks in the county, yet only 17 of them had voted in the previous seven years. Within a year, some 1,400 blacks had registered, and the white community responded with harsh economic reprisals. Using registration rolls, the White Citizens Council circulated a blacklist of all registered black voters, allowing banks, local stores, and gas stations to conspire to deny registered black voters essential services. What's more, sharecropping blacks who registered to vote were getting evicted from their homes. All in all, the number of evictions came to 257 families, many of whom were forced to live in a makeshift Tent City for well over a year. Finally, in December 1960, the Justice Department invoked its powers authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to file a suit against seventy parties accused of violating the civil rights of black Fayette County citizens.<ref>Our Portion of Hell: Fayette County, Tennessee, an Oral History of the Struggle For Civil Rights by Robert Hamburger (New York; Links Books, 1973)</ref> In the following year the first voter registration project in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]] and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen, the [[White Citizens' Council]], and the Ku Klux Klan.

In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962cofo Council of Federated Organizations Formed in Mississippi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962cofo |date=October 4, 2006 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1962, with funds from the [[Voter Education Project]], SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]], and the areas surrounding [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]], and [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition{{mdash}}arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the [[literacy test]] to keep blacks off the voting rolls by creating standards that even highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register, and landlords evicted them from their rental homes.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm Mississippi Voter Registration\u2014Greenwood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm |date=October 4, 2006 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> Despite these actions, over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.\n\nSimilar voter registration campaigns{{mdash}}with similar responses{{mdash}}were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\" /> protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which had provisions to enforce the constitutional right to vote for all citizens.\n\n=== Integration of Mississippi universities, 1956\u20131965 ===\nBeginning in 1956, [[Clyde Kennard]], a black [[Korean War]]-veteran, wanted to enroll at Mississippi Southern College (now the [[University of Southern Mississippi]]) at [[Hattiesburg]] under the [[G.I.

McCain said:\n<blockquote>We insist that educationally and socially, we maintain a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] society...In all fairness, I admit that we are not encouraging Negro voting...The Negroes prefer that control of the government remain in the white man's hands.<ref name=\"Funding\" /><ref name=\"report\" /><ref name=\"Evers\" /></blockquote>\n\nNote: Mississippi had passed a new constitution in 1890 that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks by changing electoral and voter registration requirements; although it deprived them of constitutional rights authorized under post-Civil War amendments, it survived [[U.S. Supreme Court]] challenges at the time. It was not until after passage of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] that most blacks in Mississippi and other southern states gained federal protection to enforce the constitutional right of citizens to vote.\n\n[[File:James Meredith OleMiss.jpg|thumb|James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals]]\n\nIn September 1962, [[James Meredith]] won a lawsuit to secure admission to the previously segregated [[University of Mississippi]].

King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers faced{{mdash}}and given the derisive nickname \"De Lawd\" as a result{{mdash}}intervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.\n\nThe campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of [[Laurie Pritchett]], the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Pritchett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories.

It focused on one goal{{mdash}}the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany.\n\nThe movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular [[Bull Connor|Eugene \"Bull\" Connor]], the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.\n\nThe campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an [[injunction]] barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for [[mass arrest]]s of its supporters.

[[James Bevel]], SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education, then came up with a bold and controversial alternative: to train high school students to take part in the demonstrations. As a result, in what would be called the [[Children's Crusade (civil rights)|Children's Crusade]], more than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to meet at the 16th Street Baptist Church to join the demonstrations. More than six hundred marched out of the church fifty at a time in an attempt to walk to City Hall to speak to Birmingham's mayor about segregation. They were arrested and put into jail. In this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When Bevel started them marching fifty at a time, Bull Connor finally unleashed police dogs on them and then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. National television networks broadcast the scenes of the dogs attacking demonstrators and the water from the fire hoses knocking down the schoolchildren.<ref>{{cite news|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/02/20/children-have-changed-america-before-braving-fire-hoses-and-police-dogs-for-civil-rights/|title=Children have changed America before, braving fire hoses and police dogs for civil rights|date=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWidespread public outrage led the Kennedy administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC.

Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals:\n* meaningful civil rights laws\n* a massive federal works program\n* full and fair employment\n* decent housing\n* the right to vote\n* adequate integrated education.\nOf these, the march's major focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.\n\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

It became the stage for a great drama leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. A local movement, led by Robert B. Hayling, a black dentist and Air Force veteran affiliated with the NAACP, had been picketing segregated local institutions since 1963. In the fall of 1964, Hayling and three companions were brutally beaten at a Ku Klux Klan rally.\n\nNightriders shot into black homes, and teenagers Audrey Nell Edwards, JoeAnn Anderson, Samuel White, and Willie Carl Singleton (who came to be known as \"The St. Augustine Four\") sat in at a local Woolworth's lunch counter, seeking to get served. They were arrested and convicted of trespassing, and sentenced to six months in jail and reform school. It took a special act of the governor and cabinet of Florida to release them after national protests by the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', [[Jackie Robinson]], and others.\n\nIn response to the repression, the St. Augustine movement practiced armed self-defense in addition to nonviolent direct action. In June 1963, Hayling publicly stated that \"I and the others have armed. We will shoot first and answer questions later. We are not going to die like Medgar Evers.\" The comment made national headlines.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963staug Civil Rights Movement Veterans. \"St. Augustine FL, Movement\u20141963\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816034441/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963staug |date=August 16, 2016 }}; [https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/hayling-robert-b \"Hayling, Robert B.\", Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University]; [http://www.augustine.com/history/black_history/dr_robert_hayling/ \"Black History: Dr. Robert B.

The arrest of Peabody, the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, for attempting to eat at the segregated Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge in an integrated group, made front-page news across the country and brought the movement in St. Augustine to the attention of the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/07/obituaries/mary-peabody-89-rights-activist-dies.html|title=MARY PEABODY, 89, RIGHTS ACTIVIST, DIES|work=New York Times|date=7 Feb 1981}}</ref>\n\nWidely publicized activities continued in the ensuing months.

[[James Farmer]], the national director of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] called Chester \"''the Birmingham of the North''\".<ref name=Mele>{{cite book |last1=Mele |first1=Christopher |title=Race and the Politics of Deception: The Making of an American City |date=2017 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4798-6609-0 |pages=74\u2013100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAl3DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Branche and the CFFN focused on improving conditions at the predominantly black Franklin Elementary school in Chester.

State and local governments, police, the [[White Citizens' Council]] and the Ku Klux Klan used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf Mississippi: Subversion of the Right to Vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505032056/http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf |date=May 5, 2010 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|[[Missing persons]] poster created by the [[FBI]] in 1964 shows the photographs of [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], [[James Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner]].]]\n\nOn June 21, 1964, [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|three civil rights workers disappeared]]: [[James Chaney]], a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two [[Jewish]] activists, [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], a [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] anthropology student; and [[Michael Schwerner]], a [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] organizer from [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]]. They were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of the members of the [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] sheriff's department. This outraged the public, leading the U.S. Justice Department along with the FBI (the latter which had previously avoided dealing with the issue of segregation and persecution of blacks) to take action. The outrage over these murders helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nFrom June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students, were established, and 28 community centers set up.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McAdam |first=Doug |title=Freedom Summer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-504367-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/freedomsummer00mcad }}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of [[white supremacy]] arrayed against them{{mdash}}only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded.

It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. The progression of events throughout the South increased media attention to Mississippi.<ref name=\"crmvet1\">[http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm Veterans Roll Call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423070052/http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm |date=April 23, 2008 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\nThe deaths of affluent northern white students and threats to non-Southerners attracted the full attention of the media spotlight to the state. Many black activists became embittered, believing the media valued lives of whites and blacks differently. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers, almost all of whom{{mdash}}black and white{{mdash}}still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives.<ref name=\"crmvet1\" />\n\n=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===\n{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964}}\n\nAlthough President Kennedy had [[Civil Rights Address|proposed civil rights legislation]] and it had support from Northern Congressmen and Senators of both parties, Southern Senators blocked the bill by threatening [[filibuster]]s. After considerable parliamentary maneuvering and 54 days of filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate, President Johnson got a bill through the Congress.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=521\u2013524}}\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|Lyndon B.

The bill authorized the Attorney General to file lawsuits to enforce the new law. The law also nullified state and local laws that required such discrimination.\n\n=== Harlem riot of 1964 ===\n{{Main|Harlem riot of 1964}}\n\nWhen police shot an unarmed black teenager in Harlem in July 1964, tensions escalated out of control. Residents were frustrated with racial inequalities. Rioting broke out, and [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]], a major black neighborhood in Brooklyn erupted next. That summer, [[1964 Philadelphia race riot|rioting also broke out in Philadelphia]], for similar reasons. The riots were on a much smaller scale than what would occur in 1965 and later.\n\nWashington responded with a pilot program called [[Project Uplift]]. Thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by [[Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited|HARYOU]] called ''[[Youth in the Ghetto]]''.<ref>''Youth in the Ghetto: A Study of the Consequences of Powerlessness'', Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, Inc., 1964</ref> HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the [[National Urban League]] and nearly 100 smaller community organizations.<ref>''Poverty and Politics in Harlem'', Alphnso Pinkney and Roger Woock, College & University Press Services, Inc., 1970</ref> Permanent jobs at living wages were still out of reach of many young black men.\n\n=== Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964 ===\n{{Main|Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party}}\n\nBlacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 19th century. In 1963 COFO held a [[1963 Freedom Ballot|Freedom Ballot]] in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election, which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the \"Freedom Party\" against the official state Democratic Party candidates.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm Freedom Ballot in MS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816034441/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm |date=August 16, 2016 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ''(center)'' meets with civil rights leaders [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Whitney Young]], and [[James L. Farmer Jr.|James Farmer]], January 1964]]\n\nIn 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], [[Annie Bell Robinson Devine|Annie Devine]], and [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]] to run for [[United States Congress|Congress]], and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.<ref name=\"crmvet.org\" />\n\nThe presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson administration's achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican [[Barry Goldwater]]'s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the \"Solid South\", as well as support that [[George Wallace]] had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.\n\nJohnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, \"Is this America?\"\n\nJohnson offered the MFDP a \"compromise\" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the \"compromise.\"\n\nThe MFDP kept up its agitation at the convention after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the \"regular\" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. National party organizers removed them. When they returned the next day, they found convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before. They stayed and sang \"freedom songs\".\n\nThe 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the civil rights movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited [[Malcolm X]] to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]].\n\n=== Selma Voting Rights Movement ===\n{{Main|Selma to Montgomery marches|Voting Rights Act}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename=Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act (August 6, 1965) Lyndon Baines Johnson.ogv\n| title=\"Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act\"\n| description=Statement before the [[United States Congress]] by Johnson on August 6, 1965, about the [[Voting Rights Act]]\n| filename2=Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act (August 6, 1965) Lyndon Baines Johnson.ogg\n| title2=\"Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act\"\n| description2=audio only\n| format=[[Ogg]]\n| image=[[File:Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. - Voting Rights Act.jpg|thumb|President Johnson, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] at the signing of the [[Voting Rights Act]] on August 6, 1965]]\n}}\n\n[[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in [[Selma, Alabama]], in 1963, but by 1965 little headway had been made in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the SCLC for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from the police. [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march on February 17, 1965. Jackson's death prompted [[James Bevel]], director of the Selma Movement, to initiate and organize a plan to march from Selma to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], the state capital.\n\nOn March 7, 1965, acting on Bevel's plan, [[Hosea Williams]] of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87&nbsp;km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Six blocks into the march, at the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] where the marchers left the city and moved into the county, state troopers, and local county law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs, [[tear gas]], rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire, and bullwhips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]], who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.\n\n[[File:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|Police attack non-violent marchers on \"Bloody Sunday\", the first day of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]].]]\n\nThe national broadcast of the news footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers' seeking to exercise their constitutional right to vote provoked a national response and hundreds of people from all over the country came for a second march. These marchers were turned around by Dr. King at the last minute so as not to violate a federal injunction. With the support of [[James Forman]] and other SNCC leaders, activists throughout the country committed civil disobedience for Selma, particularly in Montgomery and at the White House. The marchers were able to lift the injunction and obtain protection from federal troops, permitting them to make the march across Alabama without incident two weeks later.\n\nOn the evening of a second march on March 9 to the site of Bloody Sunday, local whites attacked Rev. [[James Reeb]], a voting rights supporter. He died of his injuries in a Birmingham hospital on March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed [[Detroit]] homemaker [[Viola Liuzzo]] as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.\n\n=== Voting Rights Act of 1965 ===\nEight days after the first march, but before the final march, President Johnson delivered a televised address to support the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:\n\n{{quote|quote=Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.}}\n\nOn August 6, Johnson signed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which suspended literacy tests and other subjective voter registration tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used and where African Americans were historically under-represented in voting rolls compared to the eligible population. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts, which had seldom prosecuted their cases to success. If discrimination in voter registration occurred, the 1965 act authorized the [[Attorney General of the United States]] to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars.\n\nWithin months of the bill's passage, 250,000 new black voters had been registered, one-third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout at 74% and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout among black voters; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.\n\nSeveral whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966 [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Sheriff Jim Clark]] of Selma, Alabama, infamous for using [[cattle prod]]s against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious \"Never\" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as blacks voted to get him out of office.\n\nBlacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every county where populations were majority black in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions in city, county, and state governments.\n\nAtlanta elected a black mayor, [[Andrew Young]], as did [[Jackson, Mississippi]], with [[Harvey Johnson Jr.]], and [[New Orleans]], with [[Ernest Nathan Morial|Ernest Morial]]. Black politicians on the national level included [[Barbara Jordan]], elected as a Representative from Texas in Congress, and President Jimmy Carter appointed Andrew Young as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]. [[Julian Bond]] was elected to the [[Georgia General Assembly|Georgia State Legislature]] in 1965, although political reaction to his public [[opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]] prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] was first elected in 1986 to represent [[Georgia's 5th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he has served since 1987.\n\n=== Watts riot of 1965 ===\n{{Main|Watts Riots}}\n\n[[File:Wattsriots-policearrest-loc.jpg|thumb|Police arrest a man during the [[Watts Riots]], August 1965]]\n\nThe new Voting Rights Act of 1965 had no immediate effect on living conditions for poor blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]]. Like Harlem, Watts was a majority-black neighborhood with very high unemployment and associated poverty.

In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as \"Negroes\" but as \"Afro-Americans,\" similar to other ethnic groups, such as Irish Americans and Italian Americans. Until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and often [[Hair straightening|straightened their hair]]. As a part of affirming their identity, blacks started to wear African-based [[dashiki]]s and grow their hair out as a natural [[afro]]. The afro, sometimes nicknamed the \"'fro,\" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s. Other variations of traditional African styles have become popular, often featuring braids, extensions, and dreadlocks.\n\nThe [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP), which was founded by [[Huey Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] in [[Oakland, California]], in 1966, gained the most attention for Black Power nationally. The group began following the revolutionary pan-Africanism of late-period [[Malcolm X]], using a \"by-any-means necessary\" approach to stopping racial inequality. They sought to rid African-American neighborhoods of [[police brutality]] and to establish [[socialist]] [[dual power|community control]] in the ghettos.

In 1966, [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] formed the [[Black Guerrilla Family]] in the California [[San Quentin State Prison]]. The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty of shooting and killing three black prisoners from the prison tower. They retaliated by killing a white prison guard.\n\n{{listen\n| filename=Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud) sample.ogg\n| title=\"Say It Loud&nbsp;\u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\"\n| description=[[James Brown]]'s \"[[Say It Loud&nbsp;\u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\" from ''[[Say It Loud&nbsp;\u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]''\n| filetype=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:John Carlos, Tommie Smith, Peter Norman 1968cr.jpg|thumb|left|Gold medalist [[Tommie Smith]] ''(center)'' and bronze medalist [[John Carlos]] ''(right)'' showing the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|raised fist on the podium]] after the 200&nbsp;m race at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]; both wear [[Olympic Project for Human Rights]] badges.

When King was assassinated in 1968, Stokely Carmichael said that whites had murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. Riots broke out in more than 100 cities across the country. Some cities did not recover from the damage for more than a generation; other city neighborhoods never recovered.\n\n=== Black conservatism ===\nDespite the common notion that the ideas of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Malcolm X]] and [[Black Power]] only conflicted with each other and were the only ideologies of the civil rights movement, there were other sentiments felt by many blacks. Fearing the events during the movement was occurring too quickly, there were some blacks who felt that leaders should take their activism at a slower pace. Others had reservations on how focused blacks were on the movement and felt that such attention was better spent on reforming issues within the black community.\n\nThose who blatantly rejected integration had various rationales for doing so, such as fearing a change in the status quo they had been used to for so long or fearing for their safety if they found themselves in environments where whites were much more present. Some defended segregation for the sake of keeping ties with the white power structure from which many relied on for social and economic mobility above other blacks. Based on her interpretation of a 1966 study made by Donald Matthews and James Prothro detailing the relative percentage of blacks for integration, against it or feeling something else, Lauren Winner asserts that:\n\n{{quote|quote=Black defenders of segregation look, at first blush, very much like black nationalists, especially in their preference for all-black institutions; but black defenders of segregation differ from nationalists in two key ways. First, while both groups criticize [[NAACP]]-style integration, nationalists articulate a third alternative to integration and [[Jim Crow]], while segregationists preferred to stick with the status quo. Second, absent from black defenders of segregation's political vocabulary was the demand for [[self-determination]]. They called for all-black institutions, but not autonomous all-black institutions; indeed, some defenders of segregation asserted that black people needed white paternalism and oversight in order to thrive.<ref>Winner, Lauren F. \"Doubtless Sincere: New Characters in the Civil Rights Cast.\" In The Role of Ideas in the Civil Rights South, edited by Ted Ownby. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2002, pp. 158\u2013159.</ref>}}\n\nOftentimes, African-American community leaders would be staunch defenders of segregation. Church ministers, businessmen, and educators were among those who wished to keep segregation and segregationist ideals in order to retain the privileges they gained from patronage from whites, such as monetary gains. In addition, they relied on segregation to keep their jobs and economies in their communities thriving. It was feared that if integration became widespread in the South, black-owned businesses and other establishments would lose a large chunk of their customer base to white-owned businesses, and many blacks would lose opportunities for jobs that were presently exclusive to their interests.<ref>Winner, Doubtless Sincere, 164\u2013165.</ref> On the other hand, there were the everyday, average black people who criticized integration as well. For them, they took issue with different parts of the civil rights movement and the potential for blacks to exercise consumerism and economic liberty without hindrance from whites.<ref>Winner, Doubtless Sincere, 166\u2013167.</ref>\n\nFor Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and other leading activists and groups during the movement, these opposing viewpoints acted as an obstacle against their ideas. These different views made such leaders' work much harder to accomplish, but they were nonetheless important in the overall scope of the movement. For the most part, the black individuals who had reservations on various aspects of the movement and ideologies of the activists were not able to make a game-changing dent in their efforts, but the existence of these alternate ideas gave some blacks an outlet to express their concerns about the changing social structure.\n\n=== Avoiding the \"Communist\" label ===\n{{See also|The Communist Party and African-Americans}}\n\nOn December 17, 1951, the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]\u2013affiliated [[Civil Rights Congress]] delivered the petition ''[[We Charge Genocide]]: The Crime of Government Against the Negro People'' to the United Nations, arguing that the U.S. federal government, by its failure to act against [[lynching in the United States]], was guilty of [[genocide]] under Article II of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|UN Genocide Convention]] (see [[Black genocide]]).<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis51.htm ''We Charge Genocide''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402015621/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis51.htm |date=April 2, 2008 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> The petition was presented to the United Nations at two separate venues: [[Paul Robeson]], a concert singer and activist, presented it to a UN official in New York City, while [[William L.

The ILD was known for leading the defense of the [[Scottsboro Boys]] in [[Alabama]] in 1931, where the Communist Party had a considerable amount of influence among African Americans in the 1930s. This influence had largely declined by the late 1950s, although it could command international attention. As earlier civil rights figures such as Robeson, Du Bois and Patterson became more politically radical (and therefore targets of Cold War [[anti-Communism]] by the U.S. Government), they lost favor with mainstream Black America as well as with the NAACP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\" />\n\nIn order to secure a place in the political mainstream and gain the broadest base of support, the new generation of civil rights activists believed that it had to openly distance itself from anything and anyone associated with the Communist party. According to [[Ella Baker]], the Southern Christian Leadership Conference added the word \"Christian\" to its name in order to deter charges that it was associated with [[Communism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/html_use/G-0007.html |title=Oral History Interview with Ella Baker, September 4, 1974.

In the early 1960s, the practice of distancing the civil rights movement from \"Reds\" was challenged by the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] which adopted a policy of accepting assistance and participation from anyone who supported the SNCC's political program and was willing to \"put their body on the line, regardless of political affiliation.\" At times the SNCC's policy of political openness put it at odds with the NAACP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\" />\n\n=== Kennedy administration, 1961\u20131963 ===\n[[File:Robert Kennedy speaking before a crowd, June 14, 1963.jpg|thumb|[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] Robert Kennedy speaking before a hostile Civil Rights crowd protesting low [[Affirmative action in the United States|minority hiring]] in his [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] June 14, 1963<ref name=\"Risen 2014 76\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOu1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA76 |title=The Bill of the Century: The Epic Battle for the Civil Rights Act |last=Risen |first=Clay |date=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-60819-824-5 |location= |pages=76 |language=en}}</ref>]]\n\nFor the first two years of the Kennedy administration, civil rights activists had mixed opinions of both the president and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. A well of historical skepticism toward liberal politics had left African Americans with a sense of uneasy disdain for any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom, particularly ones connected to the historically pro-segregationist Democratic Party. Still, many were encouraged by the discreet support Kennedy gave to Dr. King, and the administration's willingness, after dramatic pressure from civil disobedience, to bring forth racially progressive initiatives.\n\nMany of the initiatives resulted from Robert Kennedy's passion. The younger Kennedy gained a rapid education in the realities of racism through events such as the [[Baldwin-Kennedy meeting]]. The president came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matter, resulting in the landmark [[Civil Rights Address]] of June 1963 and the introduction of the first major civil rights act of the decade.<ref>James Hilty, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Za8TAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA356 ''Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector''] (Temple University Press, 2000), p. 350-361.</ref><ref>Schlesinger, Arthur Jr, ''Robert Kennedy And His Times'' (2002)</ref>\n\nRobert Kennedy first became concerned with civil rights in mid-May 1961 during the [[Freedom Rides]], when photographs of the burning bus and savage beatings in [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]] and Birmingham were broadcast around the world. They came at an especially embarrassing time, as President Kennedy was about to have a [[Vienna summit|summit with the Soviet premier]] in Vienna. The White House was concerned with its image among the populations of newly independent nations in Africa and Asia, and Robert Kennedy responded with an address for [[Voice of America]] stating that great progress had been made on the issue of race relations. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the administration worked to resolve the crisis with a minimum of violence and prevent the Freedom Riders from generating a fresh crop of headlines that might divert attention from the President's international agenda. The [[Freedom Riders (film)|''Freedom Riders'']] documentary notes that, \"The back burner issue of civil rights had collided with the urgent demands of Cold War [[realpolitik]].\"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/issues/the-cold-war \"Freedom Riders-The Cold War\" ''Freedom Riders'', American Experience, PBS website]</ref>\n\nOn May 21, when a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King was holding out with protesters, Robert Kennedy telephoned King to ask him to stay in the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for \"allowing the situation to continue\". King later publicly thanked Kennedy for deploying the force to break up an attack that might otherwise have ended King's life.\n\nWith a very small majority in Congress, the president's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Without the support of Vice-President Johnson, a former Senator who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed.\n\nBy late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives, including administrative representation across all U.S. Government departments and greater access to the ballot box. From squaring off against Governor [[George Wallace]], to \"tearing into\" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the civil rights movement. He continued to work on these social justice issues in his bid for the presidency in 1968.\n\nOn the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation to African-American enrollment at the [[University of Alabama]], President Kennedy gave an [[Civil Rights Address|address]] to the nation, which marked the changing tide, an address that was to become a landmark for the ensuing change in political policy as to civil rights. In 1966, Robert Kennedy visited South Africa and voiced his objections to [[apartheid]], the first time a major US politician had done so:\n\n{{quote|quote=At the [[University of Natal]] in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve. \"But suppose God is black\", I replied. \"What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white?

Many Jewish students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era.

[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], a writer, rabbi, and professor of theology at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York, was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches#The march to Montgomery|Selma to Montgomery march]]. In the 1964 [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]], the two white activists killed, [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]], were both Jewish.\n\n[[Brandeis University]], the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP) in 1968, in part response to Rev.

Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance for disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.\n\nThe [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Jewish Congress]], and [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) actively promoted civil rights. While Jews were very active in the civil rights movement in the South, in the North, many had experienced a more strained relationship with African Americans. <!-- In communities experiencing white flight, racial rioting, and urban decay, Jewish Americans were more often the last remaining whites in the communities most affected.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} --> It has been argued that with Black militancy and the [[Black Power]] movements on the rise, \"Black Anti-Semitism\" increased leading to strained relations between Blacks and Jews in Northern communities.

He moved further [[Left-wing politics|left]] in the following years, speaking about the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed that change was needed beyond the civil rights which had been gained by the movement.\n\nHowever, King's attempts to broaden the scope of the civil rights movement were halting and largely unsuccessful.

The Justice Department, led by Robert Kennedy, moved from a posture of defending Kennedy from the quagmire minefield of racial politics to acting to fulfill his legacy. The violent death and public reaction dramatically moved the moderate Republicans, led by Senator [[Everett McKinley Dirksen]], whose support was the margin of victory for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

For a period, African Americans voted and held political office, but they were increasingly deprived of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], often under [[Jim Crow laws]], and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South. Over the following century, various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights.

The system of ''[[de jure]]'' state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged from the post-Reconstruction South became to be known as the \"[[Jim Crow]]\" system. The United States Supreme Court, made up almost entirely of Northerners, upheld the constitutionality of those state laws that required [[racial segregation]] in public facilities in its 1896 decision ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', legitimizing them through the \"[[separate but equal]]\" doctrine.<ref>[[Rayford Logan]],''The Betrayal of the Negro from Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson'', pp. 97\u201398.

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through [[litigation]], education, and [[lobbying]] efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision ''[[Brown v.

From 1910 to 1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west out of the South. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], most during and after World War II. So many people migrated that the demographics of some previously black-majority states changed to a white majority (in combination with other developments). The rapid influx of blacks altered the demographics of Northern and Western cities; happening at a period of expanded European, Hispanic, and Asian immigration, it added to social competition and tensions, with the new migrants and immigrants battling for a place in jobs and housing.\n\nReflecting social tensions after World War I, as veterans struggled to return to the workforce and labor unions were organizing, the [[Red Summer]] of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of white race riots against blacks that took place in more than three dozen cities, such as the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]] and the [[Omaha race riot of 1919]]. Urban problems such as crime and disease were blamed on the large influx of Southern blacks to cities in the north and west, based on stereotypes of rural southern African-Americans. Overall, African Americans in Northern and Western cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of \"targeted violence, [[restrictive covenants]], [[redlining]] and racial steering\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tolnay |first=Stewart |title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |year=2003 |volume=29 |pages=218\u2013221 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009 |jstor=30036966|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6557078cf3beb9eae2bcd7ad443cf49f46b8ef4 }}</ref> The Great Migration resulted in many African Americans becoming urbanized, and they began to realign from the Republican to the Democratic Party, especially because of opportunities under the [[New Deal]] of the [[Franklin D.

Although the federal government had become increasingly involved in mortgage lending and development in the 1930s and 1940s, it did not reject the use of race-restrictive covenants until 1950, in part because of provisions by the Solid South Democrats in Congress.<ref name=\"propublica.org\" /> Suburbanization became connected with [[white flight]] by this time, because whites were better established economically to move to newer housing. The situation was perpetuated by real estate agents' continuing [[Residential segregation|racial discrimination]].

They were faced with \"[[massive resistance]]\" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and [[disfranchisement|voter suppression]]. In defiance, African-American activists adopted a combined strategy of [[direct action]], [[nonviolence]], [[nonviolent resistance]], and many events described as [[civil disobedience]], giving rise to the civil rights movement of 1954 to 1968.\n\n== The Beginnings of Direct Action (1950s) ==\nThe strategy of public education, legislative lobbying, and litigation that had typified the civil rights movement during the first half of the 20th century broadened after ''Brown'' to a strategy that emphasized \"[[direct action]]\": boycotts, [[sit-in]]s, [[Freedom Rides]], marches or walks, and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance, standing in line, and, at times, civil disobedience.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nChurches, local grassroots organizations, fraternal societies, and black-owned businesses mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges used by the NAACP and others.\n\nIn 1952, the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL), led by [[T. R. M. Howard]], a black surgeon, entrepreneur, and planter organized a successful boycott of gas stations in Mississippi that refused to provide restrooms for blacks. Through the RCNL, Howard led campaigns to expose brutality by the Mississippi state highway patrol and to encourage blacks to make deposits in the black-owned [[Tri-State Bank]] of [[Nashville]] which, in turn, gave loans to civil rights activists who were victims of a \"credit squeeze\" by the [[White Citizens' Councils]].<ref name=\"Beito and Beito\">David T.

Their method of addressing the issue of school segregation was to enumerate several arguments. One pertained to having exposure to interracial contact in a school environment. It was argued that interracial contact would, in turn, help prepare children to live with the pressures that society exerts in regards to race and thereby afford them a better chance of living in a democracy. In addition, another argument emphasized how \"'education' comprehends the entire process of developing and training the mental, physical and moral powers and capabilities of human beings\".<ref>Risa L. Goluboff, ''The Lost Promise of Civil Rights'', Harvard University Press, MA: Cambridge, 2007, pp. 249\u2013251</ref>\n\nRisa Goluboff wrote that the NAACP's intention was to show the Courts that African American children were the victims of school segregation and their futures were at risk.

Richmond County Board of Education]]'' (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional.\n\nThe federal government filed a [[friend of the court brief]] in the case urging the justices to consider the effect that segregation had on America's image in the [[Cold War]].

In Virginia, some counties closed their public schools rather than integrate, and many white [[Christianity|Christian]] private schools were founded to accommodate students who used to go to public schools. Even in Greensboro, much local resistance to desegregation continued, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days, until the local ordinance segregating African Americans and whites on public buses was repealed. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery partook in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue significantly, as they comprised the majority of the riders.

A photo was taken of Eckford being harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car for her protection. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in [[jeep]]s.\n\n[[File:Little Rock integration protest.jpg|thumb|left|White parents rally against integrating Little Rock's schools.]]\n\nFaubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the ''Brown'' decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court ruling. Faubus' resistance received the attention of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. But, Eisenhower federalized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in Arkansas and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower deployed elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Little Rock to protect the students.\n\nThe students attended high school under harsh conditions. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from other students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers were not around. One of the Little Rock Nine, [[Minnijean Brown-Trickey|Minnijean Brown]], was suspended for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line. Later, she was expelled for verbally abusing a white female student.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html Minnijean Brown Trickey, America.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128093710/http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html |date=November 28, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOnly [[Ernest Green]] of the Little Rock Nine graduated from Central High School.

Although acts of racial discrimination have occurred historically throughout the United States, perhaps the most violent regions have been in the former Confederate states. During the 1950s and 1960s, the nonviolent protesting of the civil rights movement caused definite tension, which gained national attention.\n\nIn order to prepare for protests physically and psychologically, demonstrators received training in nonviolence. According to former civil rights activist Bruce Hartford, there are two main branches of nonviolence training. There is the philosophical method, which involves understanding the method of nonviolence and why it is considered useful, and there is the tactical method, which ultimately teaches demonstrators \"how to be a protestor{{mdash}}how to sit-in, how to picket, how to defend yourself against attack, giving training on how to remain cool when people are screaming racist insults into your face and pouring stuff on you and hitting you\" (Civil Rights Movement Veterans). The philosophical method of nonviolence, in the American civil rights movement, was largely inspired by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s \"non-cooperation\" with the British colonists in India, which was intended to gain attention so that the public would either \"intervene in advance,\" or \"provide public pressure in support of the action to be taken\" (Erikson, 415). As Hartford explains it, philosophical nonviolence training aims to \"shape the individual person's attitude and mental response to crises and violence\" (Civil Rights Movement Veterans). Hartford and activists like him, who trained in tactical nonviolence, considered it necessary in order to ensure physical safety, instill discipline, teach demonstrators how to demonstrate, and form mutual confidence among demonstrators (Civil Rights Movement Veterans).<ref name=Erikson /><ref>{{cite web |title=Civil Rights Movement Veterans |url=http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv3.htm |website=Civil Rights Movement Veterans |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor many, the concept of nonviolent protest was a way of life, a culture. However, not everyone agreed with this notion. James Forman, former SNCC (and later Black Panther) member, and nonviolence trainer, was among those who did not. In his autobiography, ''The Making of Black Revolutionaries'', Forman revealed his perspective on the method of nonviolence as \"strictly a tactic, not a way of life without limitations.\" Similarly, [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]], who was also an active member of SNCC, felt that the method of nonviolence was practical. When interviewed by author Robert Penn Warren, Moses said \"There's no question that he [Martin Luther King Jr.] had a great deal of influence with the masses. But I don't think it's in the direction of love. It's in a practical direction . . .\" (Who Speaks for the Negro? Warren).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bruce Hartford (full interview) |url=https://vimeo.com/17532881 |via=Vimeo |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Forman |first1=James |title=The Making of Black Revolutionaries |url=https://archive.org/details/makingofblackrev00form |url-access=registration |date=1972 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-940880-10-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Robert F. Williams and the debate on nonviolence, 1959\u20131964 ===\nThe Jim Crow system employed \"terror as a means of social control,\"<ref>Francis Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, ''Poor People's Movements: How They Succeed, How They Fail'' (Random House, 1977), 182</ref> with the most organized manifestations being the Ku Klux Klan and their collaborators in local police departments. This violence played a key role in blocking the progress of the civil rights movement in the late 1950s. Some black organizations in the South began practicing armed self-defense. The first to do so openly was the Monroe, North Carolina, chapter of the NAACP led by [[Robert F. Williams]]. Williams had rebuilt the chapter after its membership was terrorized out of public life by the Klan. He did so by encouraging a new, more working-class membership to arm itself thoroughly and defend against attack.<ref>[http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/T-1534.html Timothy B.

Ultimately, Wilkins resorted to bribing influential organizer Daisy Bates to campaign against Williams at the NAACP national convention and the suspension was upheld. The convention nonetheless passed a resolution which stated: \"We do not deny, but reaffirm the right of individual and collective self-defense against unlawful assaults.\"<ref>Tyson, Radio Free Dixie, 159\u2013164</ref> Martin Luther King Jr. argued for Williams' removal,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/williams-robert-franklin|title=Williams, Robert Franklin|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> but Ella Baker<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEfOhvXSvZsC&pg=PA213 Barbara Ransby, ''Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 213\u2013216]</ref> and WEB Dubois<ref name=\"history.msu.edu\" /> both publicly praised the Monroe leader's position.\n\nWilliams{{mdash}}along with his wife, Mabel Williams{{mdash}}continued to play a leadership role in the Monroe movement, and to some degree, in the national movement.

In Jackson, some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100&nbsp;\u00b0F heat. Others were transferred to the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] at Parchman, where they were treated to harsh conditions. Sometimes the men were suspended by \"wrist breakers\" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.\n\nPublic sympathy and support for the freedom riders led [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration to order the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, 1961, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; \"white\" and \"colored\" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.\n\nThe student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, a single-minded activist; [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], the revered \"guru\" of nonviolent theory and tactics; [[Diane Nash]], an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice; [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]], pioneer of voting registration in Mississippi; and [[James Bevel]], a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer, strategist, and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included [[Charles McDew]], [[Bernard Lafayette]], [[Charles Jones (activist)|Charles Jones]], [[Lonnie C. King Jr.|Lonnie King]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Hosea Williams]], and [[Stokely Carmichael]].\n\n=== Voter registration organizing ===\nAfter the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as [[Amzie Moore]], [[Aaron Henry]], [[Medgar Evers]], and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and to build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its new constitution in 1890 with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from voter rolls and voting. Also, violence at the time of elections had earlier suppressed black voting.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, preventing blacks from voting had become an essential part of the culture of white supremacy. In June and July 1959, members of the black community in Fayette County, TN formed the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League to spur voting. At the time, there were 16,927 blacks in the county, yet only 17 of them had voted in the previous seven years. Within a year, some 1,400 blacks had registered, and the white community responded with harsh economic reprisals. Using registration rolls, the White Citizens Council circulated a blacklist of all registered black voters, allowing banks, local stores, and gas stations to conspire to deny registered black voters essential services. What's more, sharecropping blacks who registered to vote were getting evicted from their homes. All in all, the number of evictions came to 257 families, many of whom were forced to live in a makeshift Tent City for well over a year. Finally, in December 1960, the Justice Department invoked its powers authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to file a suit against seventy parties accused of violating the civil rights of black Fayette County citizens.<ref>Our Portion of Hell: Fayette County, Tennessee, an Oral History of the Struggle For Civil Rights by Robert Hamburger (New York; Links Books, 1973)</ref> In the following year the first voter registration project in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]] and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen, the [[White Citizens' Council]], and the Ku Klux Klan.

In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962cofo Council of Federated Organizations Formed in Mississippi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962cofo |date=October 4, 2006 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1962, with funds from the [[Voter Education Project]], SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]], and the areas surrounding [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]], and [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition{{mdash}}arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the [[literacy test]] to keep blacks off the voting rolls by creating standards that even highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register, and landlords evicted them from their rental homes.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm Mississippi Voter Registration\u2014Greenwood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm |date=October 4, 2006 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> Despite these actions, over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.\n\nSimilar voter registration campaigns{{mdash}}with similar responses{{mdash}}were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\" /> protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which had provisions to enforce the constitutional right to vote for all citizens.\n\n=== Integration of Mississippi universities, 1956\u20131965 ===\nBeginning in 1956, [[Clyde Kennard]], a black [[Korean War]]-veteran, wanted to enroll at Mississippi Southern College (now the [[University of Southern Mississippi]]) at [[Hattiesburg]] under the [[G.I.

More significantly, it collected data on activists, harassed them legally, and used economic boycotts against them by threatening their jobs (or causing them to lose their jobs) to try to suppress their work.\n\nKennard was twice arrested on trumped-up charges, and eventually convicted and sentenced to seven years in the state prison.<ref name=\"Kennard\" /> After three years at [[hard labor]], Kennard was paroled by Mississippi Governor [[Ross Barnett]].

McCain said:\n<blockquote>We insist that educationally and socially, we maintain a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] society...In all fairness, I admit that we are not encouraging Negro voting...The Negroes prefer that control of the government remain in the white man's hands.<ref name=\"Funding\" /><ref name=\"report\" /><ref name=\"Evers\" /></blockquote>\n\nNote: Mississippi had passed a new constitution in 1890 that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks by changing electoral and voter registration requirements; although it deprived them of constitutional rights authorized under post-Civil War amendments, it survived [[U.S. Supreme Court]] challenges at the time. It was not until after passage of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] that most blacks in Mississippi and other southern states gained federal protection to enforce the constitutional right of citizens to vote.\n\n[[File:James Meredith OleMiss.jpg|thumb|James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals]]\n\nIn September 1962, [[James Meredith]] won a lawsuit to secure admission to the previously segregated [[University of Mississippi]].

King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers faced{{mdash}}and given the derisive nickname \"De Lawd\" as a result{{mdash}}intervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.\n\nThe campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of [[Laurie Pritchett]], the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Pritchett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany Albany GA, Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707051408/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany |date=July 7, 2010 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n=== Birmingham campaign, 1963 ===\n{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}\n\nThe Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director [[Wyatt Tee Walker]] carefully planned the early strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goal{{mdash}}the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany.\n\nThe movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular [[Bull Connor|Eugene \"Bull\" Connor]], the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.\n\nThe campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an [[injunction]] barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for [[mass arrest]]s of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham The Birmingham Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615060449/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham |date=June 15, 2009 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\nWhile in jail, King wrote his famous \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\"<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/group/King//popular_requests/frequentdocs/birmingham.pdf Letter from a Birmingham Jail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407103314/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/popular_requests/frequentdocs/birmingham.pdf |date=April 7, 2008 }} ~ King Research & Education Institute at Stanford Univ.</ref> on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement.<ref>Bass, S.

King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child and was released early on April 19.\n\nThe campaign, however, faltered as it ran out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. [[James Bevel]], SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education, then came up with a bold and controversial alternative: to train high school students to take part in the demonstrations. As a result, in what would be called the [[Children's Crusade (civil rights)|Children's Crusade]], more than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to meet at the 16th Street Baptist Church to join the demonstrations. More than six hundred marched out of the church fifty at a time in an attempt to walk to City Hall to speak to Birmingham's mayor about segregation. They were arrested and put into jail. In this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When Bevel started them marching fifty at a time, Bull Connor finally unleashed police dogs on them and then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. National television networks broadcast the scenes of the dogs attacking demonstrators and the water from the fire hoses knocking down the schoolchildren.<ref>{{cite news|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/02/20/children-have-changed-america-before-braving-fire-hoses-and-police-dogs-for-civil-rights/|title=Children have changed America before, braving fire hoses and police dogs for civil rights|date=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWidespread public outrage led the Kennedy administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC.

Philip Randolph had planned a march on Washington, D.C., in 1941 to support demands for elimination of [[employment discrimination]] in defense industries; he called off the march when the [[Franklin D.

In 1963, the Kennedy administration initially opposed the march out of concern it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, Randolph and King were firm that the march would proceed.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kennedy, Johnson, and the Quest for Justice: The Civil Rights Tapes |last=Rosenberg |first=Jonathan |first2=Zachary |last2=Karabell |page=[https://archive.org/details/kennedyjohnsonth00rose/page/130 130] |isbn=978-0-393-05122-3 |year=2003 |publisher=WW Norton & Co |url=https://archive.org/details/kennedyjohnsonth00rose/page/130 }}</ref> With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success.

Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals:\n* meaningful civil rights laws\n* a massive federal works program\n* full and fair employment\n* decent housing\n* the right to vote\n* adequate integrated education.\nOf these, the march's major focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.\n\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], where King delivered his famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] took the administration to task for not doing more to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.\n\nAfter the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the [[White House]].

State and local governments, police, the [[White Citizens' Council]] and the Ku Klux Klan used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf Mississippi: Subversion of the Right to Vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505032056/http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf |date=May 5, 2010 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|[[Missing persons]] poster created by the [[FBI]] in 1964 shows the photographs of [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], [[James Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner]].]]\n\nOn June 21, 1964, [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|three civil rights workers disappeared]]: [[James Chaney]], a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two [[Jewish]] activists, [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], a [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] anthropology student; and [[Michael Schwerner]], a [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] organizer from [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]]. They were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of the members of the [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] sheriff's department. This outraged the public, leading the U.S. Justice Department along with the FBI (the latter which had previously avoided dealing with the issue of segregation and persecution of blacks) to take action. The outrage over these murders helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nFrom June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students, were established, and 28 community centers set up.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McAdam |first=Doug |title=Freedom Summer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-504367-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/freedomsummer00mcad }}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of [[white supremacy]] arrayed against them{{mdash}}only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded.

It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. The progression of events throughout the South increased media attention to Mississippi.<ref name=\"crmvet1\">[http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm Veterans Roll Call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423070052/http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm |date=April 23, 2008 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\nThe deaths of affluent northern white students and threats to non-Southerners attracted the full attention of the media spotlight to the state. Many black activists became embittered, believing the media valued lives of whites and blacks differently. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers, almost all of whom{{mdash}}black and white{{mdash}}still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives.<ref name=\"crmvet1\" />\n\n=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===\n{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964}}\n\nAlthough President Kennedy had [[Civil Rights Address|proposed civil rights legislation]] and it had support from Northern Congressmen and Senators of both parties, Southern Senators blocked the bill by threatening [[filibuster]]s. After considerable parliamentary maneuvering and 54 days of filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate, President Johnson got a bill through the Congress.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=521\u2013524}}\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|Lyndon B. Johnson signs the historic [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].]]\n\nOn July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\" /> which banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, sex or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations. The bill authorized the Attorney General to file lawsuits to enforce the new law. The law also nullified state and local laws that required such discrimination.\n\n=== Harlem riot of 1964 ===\n{{Main|Harlem riot of 1964}}\n\nWhen police shot an unarmed black teenager in Harlem in July 1964, tensions escalated out of control. Residents were frustrated with racial inequalities. Rioting broke out, and [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]], a major black neighborhood in Brooklyn erupted next. That summer, [[1964 Philadelphia race riot|rioting also broke out in Philadelphia]], for similar reasons. The riots were on a much smaller scale than what would occur in 1965 and later.\n\nWashington responded with a pilot program called [[Project Uplift]]. Thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by [[Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited|HARYOU]] called ''[[Youth in the Ghetto]]''.<ref>''Youth in the Ghetto: A Study of the Consequences of Powerlessness'', Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, Inc., 1964</ref> HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the [[National Urban League]] and nearly 100 smaller community organizations.<ref>''Poverty and Politics in Harlem'', Alphnso Pinkney and Roger Woock, College & University Press Services, Inc., 1970</ref> Permanent jobs at living wages were still out of reach of many young black men.\n\n=== Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964 ===\n{{Main|Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party}}\n\nBlacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 19th century. In 1963 COFO held a [[1963 Freedom Ballot|Freedom Ballot]] in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election, which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the \"Freedom Party\" against the official state Democratic Party candidates.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm Freedom Ballot in MS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816034441/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm |date=August 16, 2016 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ''(center)'' meets with civil rights leaders [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Whitney Young]], and [[James L. Farmer Jr.|James Farmer]], January 1964]]\n\nIn 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], [[Annie Bell Robinson Devine|Annie Devine]], and [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]] to run for [[United States Congress|Congress]], and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.<ref name=\"crmvet.org\" />\n\nThe presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson administration's achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican [[Barry Goldwater]]'s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the \"Solid South\", as well as support that [[George Wallace]] had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.\n\nJohnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, \"Is this America?\"\n\nJohnson offered the MFDP a \"compromise\" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the \"compromise.\"\n\nThe MFDP kept up its agitation at the convention after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the \"regular\" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. National party organizers removed them. When they returned the next day, they found convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before. They stayed and sang \"freedom songs\".\n\nThe 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the civil rights movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited [[Malcolm X]] to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]].\n\n=== Selma Voting Rights Movement ===\n{{Main|Selma to Montgomery marches|Voting Rights Act}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename=Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act (August 6, 1965) Lyndon Baines Johnson.ogv\n| title=\"Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act\"\n| description=Statement before the [[United States Congress]] by Johnson on August 6, 1965, about the [[Voting Rights Act]]\n| filename2=Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act (August 6, 1965) Lyndon Baines Johnson.ogg\n| title2=\"Remarks on the Signing of the Voting Rights Act\"\n| description2=audio only\n| format=[[Ogg]]\n| image=[[File:Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. - Voting Rights Act.jpg|thumb|President Johnson, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] at the signing of the [[Voting Rights Act]] on August 6, 1965]]\n}}\n\n[[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in [[Selma, Alabama]], in 1963, but by 1965 little headway had been made in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the SCLC for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from the police. [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march on February 17, 1965. Jackson's death prompted [[James Bevel]], director of the Selma Movement, to initiate and organize a plan to march from Selma to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], the state capital.\n\nOn March 7, 1965, acting on Bevel's plan, [[Hosea Williams]] of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87&nbsp;km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Six blocks into the march, at the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] where the marchers left the city and moved into the county, state troopers, and local county law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs, [[tear gas]], rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire, and bullwhips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]], who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.\n\n[[File:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|Police attack non-violent marchers on \"Bloody Sunday\", the first day of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]].]]\n\nThe national broadcast of the news footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers' seeking to exercise their constitutional right to vote provoked a national response and hundreds of people from all over the country came for a second march. These marchers were turned around by Dr. King at the last minute so as not to violate a federal injunction. With the support of [[James Forman]] and other SNCC leaders, activists throughout the country committed civil disobedience for Selma, particularly in Montgomery and at the White House. The marchers were able to lift the injunction and obtain protection from federal troops, permitting them to make the march across Alabama without incident two weeks later.\n\nOn the evening of a second march on March 9 to the site of Bloody Sunday, local whites attacked Rev. [[James Reeb]], a voting rights supporter. He died of his injuries in a Birmingham hospital on March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed [[Detroit]] homemaker [[Viola Liuzzo]] as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.\n\n=== Voting Rights Act of 1965 ===\nEight days after the first march, but before the final march, President Johnson delivered a televised address to support the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:\n\n{{quote|quote=Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.}}\n\nOn August 6, Johnson signed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which suspended literacy tests and other subjective voter registration tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used and where African Americans were historically under-represented in voting rolls compared to the eligible population. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts, which had seldom prosecuted their cases to success. If discrimination in voter registration occurred, the 1965 act authorized the [[Attorney General of the United States]] to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars.\n\nWithin months of the bill's passage, 250,000 new black voters had been registered, one-third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout at 74% and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout among black voters; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.\n\nSeveral whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966 [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Sheriff Jim Clark]] of Selma, Alabama, infamous for using [[cattle prod]]s against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious \"Never\" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as blacks voted to get him out of office.\n\nBlacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every county where populations were majority black in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions in city, county, and state governments.\n\nAtlanta elected a black mayor, [[Andrew Young]], as did [[Jackson, Mississippi]], with [[Harvey Johnson Jr.]], and [[New Orleans]], with [[Ernest Nathan Morial|Ernest Morial]]. Black politicians on the national level included [[Barbara Jordan]], elected as a Representative from Texas in Congress, and President Jimmy Carter appointed Andrew Young as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]. [[Julian Bond]] was elected to the [[Georgia General Assembly|Georgia State Legislature]] in 1965, although political reaction to his public [[opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]] prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] was first elected in 1986 to represent [[Georgia's 5th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he has served since 1987.\n\n=== Watts riot of 1965 ===\n{{Main|Watts Riots}}\n\n[[File:Wattsriots-policearrest-loc.jpg|thumb|Police arrest a man during the [[Watts Riots]], August 1965]]\n\nThe new Voting Rights Act of 1965 had no immediate effect on living conditions for poor blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]]. Like Harlem, Watts was a majority-black neighborhood with very high unemployment and associated poverty. Its residents confronted a largely white police department that had a history of abuse against blacks.<ref>Spencer Crump, ''Black riot in Los Angeles: the story of the Watts tragedy'' (1966).</ref>\n\nWhile arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The spark triggered massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the [[Watts Riots]] among the most expensive in American history.\n\nWith black militancy on the rise, ghetto residents directed acts of anger at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers. Riots among blacks occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Baltimore]], [[Seattle]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Hough Riots|Cleveland]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[1967 Newark riots|Newark]], Chicago, New York City (specifically in [[Brooklyn]], Harlem and [[the Bronx]]), and worst of all in Detroit.\n\n=== Fair housing movements, 1966\u20131968 ===\nThe first major blow against housing segregation in the era, the [[Rumford Fair Housing Act]], was passed in [[California]] in 1963.

Additionally, there was profound disillusionment at Lyndon Johnson's denial of voting status for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party at the Democratic National Convention.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/384127 |title=SNCC, the Federal Government & the Road to Black Power |accessdate=July 29, 2016|last1=Davies |first1=Tom Adam }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studythepast.com/4333_spring12/acrm/ACRM%205.1.pdf |title=Allen J.

In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as \"Negroes\" but as \"Afro-Americans,\" similar to other ethnic groups, such as Irish Americans and Italian Americans. Until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and often [[Hair straightening|straightened their hair]]. As a part of affirming their identity, blacks started to wear African-based [[dashiki]]s and grow their hair out as a natural [[afro]]. The afro, sometimes nicknamed the \"'fro,\" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s. Other variations of traditional African styles have become popular, often featuring braids, extensions, and dreadlocks.\n\nThe [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP), which was founded by [[Huey Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] in [[Oakland, California]], in 1966, gained the most attention for Black Power nationally. The group began following the revolutionary pan-Africanism of late-period [[Malcolm X]], using a \"by-any-means necessary\" approach to stopping racial inequality. They sought to rid African-American neighborhoods of [[police brutality]] and to establish [[socialist]] [[dual power|community control]] in the ghettos. While they conducted armed confrontation with police, they also set up free breakfast and healthcare programs for children.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4KogCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA273 |title=We Are an African People: Independent Education, Black Power, and the Radical Imagination |last=Rickford |first=Russell |date=January 14, 2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-986148-4 |language=en}}</ref> Between 1968 and 1971, the BPP was one of the most important black organizations in the country and had support from the NAACP, SCLC, [[Peace and Freedom Party]], and others.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D7UwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA118 |title=Black Against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party |last=Bloom |first=Joshua |last2=Martin |first2=Waldo E. |date=October 25, 2016 |publisher=Univ of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-29328-1 |location= |pages=223\u2013236 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBlack Power was taken to another level inside prison walls. In 1966, [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] formed the [[Black Guerrilla Family]] in the California [[San Quentin State Prison]]. The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty of shooting and killing three black prisoners from the prison tower. They retaliated by killing a white prison guard.\n\n{{listen\n| filename=Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud) sample.ogg\n| title=\"Say It Loud&nbsp;\u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\"\n| description=[[James Brown]]'s \"[[Say It Loud&nbsp;\u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\" from ''[[Say It Loud&nbsp;\u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]''\n| filetype=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:John Carlos, Tommie Smith, Peter Norman 1968cr.jpg|thumb|left|Gold medalist [[Tommie Smith]] ''(center)'' and bronze medalist [[John Carlos]] ''(right)'' showing the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|raised fist on the podium]] after the 200&nbsp;m race at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]; both wear [[Olympic Project for Human Rights]] badges.

When King was assassinated in 1968, Stokely Carmichael said that whites had murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. Riots broke out in more than 100 cities across the country. Some cities did not recover from the damage for more than a generation; other city neighborhoods never recovered.\n\n=== Black conservatism ===\nDespite the common notion that the ideas of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Malcolm X]] and [[Black Power]] only conflicted with each other and were the only ideologies of the civil rights movement, there were other sentiments felt by many blacks. Fearing the events during the movement was occurring too quickly, there were some blacks who felt that leaders should take their activism at a slower pace. Others had reservations on how focused blacks were on the movement and felt that such attention was better spent on reforming issues within the black community.\n\nThose who blatantly rejected integration had various rationales for doing so, such as fearing a change in the status quo they had been used to for so long or fearing for their safety if they found themselves in environments where whites were much more present. Some defended segregation for the sake of keeping ties with the white power structure from which many relied on for social and economic mobility above other blacks. Based on her interpretation of a 1966 study made by Donald Matthews and James Prothro detailing the relative percentage of blacks for integration, against it or feeling something else, Lauren Winner asserts that:\n\n{{quote|quote=Black defenders of segregation look, at first blush, very much like black nationalists, especially in their preference for all-black institutions; but black defenders of segregation differ from nationalists in two key ways. First, while both groups criticize [[NAACP]]-style integration, nationalists articulate a third alternative to integration and [[Jim Crow]], while segregationists preferred to stick with the status quo. Second, absent from black defenders of segregation's political vocabulary was the demand for [[self-determination]]. They called for all-black institutions, but not autonomous all-black institutions; indeed, some defenders of segregation asserted that black people needed white paternalism and oversight in order to thrive.<ref>Winner, Lauren F. \"Doubtless Sincere: New Characters in the Civil Rights Cast.\" In The Role of Ideas in the Civil Rights South, edited by Ted Ownby. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2002, pp. 158\u2013159.</ref>}}\n\nOftentimes, African-American community leaders would be staunch defenders of segregation. Church ministers, businessmen, and educators were among those who wished to keep segregation and segregationist ideals in order to retain the privileges they gained from patronage from whites, such as monetary gains. In addition, they relied on segregation to keep their jobs and economies in their communities thriving. It was feared that if integration became widespread in the South, black-owned businesses and other establishments would lose a large chunk of their customer base to white-owned businesses, and many blacks would lose opportunities for jobs that were presently exclusive to their interests.<ref>Winner, Doubtless Sincere, 164\u2013165.</ref> On the other hand, there were the everyday, average black people who criticized integration as well. For them, they took issue with different parts of the civil rights movement and the potential for blacks to exercise consumerism and economic liberty without hindrance from whites.<ref>Winner, Doubtless Sincere, 166\u2013167.</ref>\n\nFor Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and other leading activists and groups during the movement, these opposing viewpoints acted as an obstacle against their ideas. These different views made such leaders' work much harder to accomplish, but they were nonetheless important in the overall scope of the movement. For the most part, the black individuals who had reservations on various aspects of the movement and ideologies of the activists were not able to make a game-changing dent in their efforts, but the existence of these alternate ideas gave some blacks an outlet to express their concerns about the changing social structure.\n\n=== Avoiding the \"Communist\" label ===\n{{See also|The Communist Party and African-Americans}}\n\nOn December 17, 1951, the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]\u2013affiliated [[Civil Rights Congress]] delivered the petition ''[[We Charge Genocide]]: The Crime of Government Against the Negro People'' to the United Nations, arguing that the U.S. federal government, by its failure to act against [[lynching in the United States]], was guilty of [[genocide]] under Article II of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|UN Genocide Convention]] (see [[Black genocide]]).<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis51.htm ''We Charge Genocide''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402015621/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis51.htm |date=April 2, 2008 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> The petition was presented to the United Nations at two separate venues: [[Paul Robeson]], a concert singer and activist, presented it to a UN official in New York City, while [[William L.

The ILD was known for leading the defense of the [[Scottsboro Boys]] in [[Alabama]] in 1931, where the Communist Party had a considerable amount of influence among African Americans in the 1930s. This influence had largely declined by the late 1950s, although it could command international attention. As earlier civil rights figures such as Robeson, Du Bois and Patterson became more politically radical (and therefore targets of Cold War [[anti-Communism]] by the U.S. Government), they lost favor with mainstream Black America as well as with the NAACP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\" />\n\nIn order to secure a place in the political mainstream and gain the broadest base of support, the new generation of civil rights activists believed that it had to openly distance itself from anything and anyone associated with the Communist party. According to [[Ella Baker]], the Southern Christian Leadership Conference added the word \"Christian\" to its name in order to deter charges that it was associated with [[Communism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/html_use/G-0007.html |title=Oral History Interview with Ella Baker, September 4, 1974.

In the early 1960s, the practice of distancing the civil rights movement from \"Reds\" was challenged by the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] which adopted a policy of accepting assistance and participation from anyone who supported the SNCC's political program and was willing to \"put their body on the line, regardless of political affiliation.\" At times the SNCC's policy of political openness put it at odds with the NAACP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\" />\n\n=== Kennedy administration, 1961\u20131963 ===\n[[File:Robert Kennedy speaking before a crowd, June 14, 1963.jpg|thumb|[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] Robert Kennedy speaking before a hostile Civil Rights crowd protesting low [[Affirmative action in the United States|minority hiring]] in his [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] June 14, 1963<ref name=\"Risen 2014 76\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOu1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA76 |title=The Bill of the Century: The Epic Battle for the Civil Rights Act |last=Risen |first=Clay |date=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-60819-824-5 |location= |pages=76 |language=en}}</ref>]]\n\nFor the first two years of the Kennedy administration, civil rights activists had mixed opinions of both the president and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. A well of historical skepticism toward liberal politics had left African Americans with a sense of uneasy disdain for any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom, particularly ones connected to the historically pro-segregationist Democratic Party. Still, many were encouraged by the discreet support Kennedy gave to Dr. King, and the administration's willingness, after dramatic pressure from civil disobedience, to bring forth racially progressive initiatives.\n\nMany of the initiatives resulted from Robert Kennedy's passion. The younger Kennedy gained a rapid education in the realities of racism through events such as the [[Baldwin-Kennedy meeting]]. The president came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matter, resulting in the landmark [[Civil Rights Address]] of June 1963 and the introduction of the first major civil rights act of the decade.<ref>James Hilty, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Za8TAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA356 ''Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector''] (Temple University Press, 2000), p. 350-361.</ref><ref>Schlesinger, Arthur Jr, ''Robert Kennedy And His Times'' (2002)</ref>\n\nRobert Kennedy first became concerned with civil rights in mid-May 1961 during the [[Freedom Rides]], when photographs of the burning bus and savage beatings in [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]] and Birmingham were broadcast around the world. They came at an especially embarrassing time, as President Kennedy was about to have a [[Vienna summit|summit with the Soviet premier]] in Vienna. The White House was concerned with its image among the populations of newly independent nations in Africa and Asia, and Robert Kennedy responded with an address for [[Voice of America]] stating that great progress had been made on the issue of race relations. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the administration worked to resolve the crisis with a minimum of violence and prevent the Freedom Riders from generating a fresh crop of headlines that might divert attention from the President's international agenda. The [[Freedom Riders (film)|''Freedom Riders'']] documentary notes that, \"The back burner issue of civil rights had collided with the urgent demands of Cold War [[realpolitik]].\"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/issues/the-cold-war \"Freedom Riders-The Cold War\" ''Freedom Riders'', American Experience, PBS website]</ref>\n\nOn May 21, when a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King was holding out with protesters, Robert Kennedy telephoned King to ask him to stay in the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for \"allowing the situation to continue\". King later publicly thanked Kennedy for deploying the force to break up an attack that might otherwise have ended King's life.\n\nWith a very small majority in Congress, the president's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Without the support of Vice-President Johnson, a former Senator who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed.\n\nBy late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives, including administrative representation across all U.S. Government departments and greater access to the ballot box. From squaring off against Governor [[George Wallace]], to \"tearing into\" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the civil rights movement. He continued to work on these social justice issues in his bid for the presidency in 1968.\n\nOn the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation to African-American enrollment at the [[University of Alabama]], President Kennedy gave an [[Civil Rights Address|address]] to the nation, which marked the changing tide, an address that was to become a landmark for the ensuing change in political policy as to civil rights. In 1966, Robert Kennedy visited South Africa and voiced his objections to [[apartheid]], the first time a major US politician had done so:\n\n{{quote|quote=At the [[University of Natal]] in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve. \"But suppose God is black\", I replied. \"What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white?

Many Jewish students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era.

[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], a writer, rabbi, and professor of theology at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York, was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches#The march to Montgomery|Selma to Montgomery march]]. In the 1964 [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]], the two white activists killed, [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]], were both Jewish.\n\n[[Brandeis University]], the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP) in 1968, in part response to Rev.

Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance for disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.\n\nThe [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Jewish Congress]], and [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) actively promoted civil rights. While Jews were very active in the civil rights movement in the South, in the North, many had experienced a more strained relationship with African Americans. <!-- In communities experiencing white flight, racial rioting, and urban decay, Jewish Americans were more often the last remaining whites in the communities most affected.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} --> It has been argued that with Black militancy and the [[Black Power]] movements on the rise, \"Black Anti-Semitism\" increased leading to strained relations between Blacks and Jews in Northern communities.

In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing of Vietnam]]. He moved further [[Left-wing politics|left]] in the following years, speaking about the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed that change was needed beyond the civil rights which had been gained by the movement.\n\nHowever, King's attempts to broaden the scope of the civil rights movement were halting and largely unsuccessful. In 1965 King made several attempts to take the Movement north in order to address [[housing discrimination]]. The SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, because Chicago's Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] marginalized the SCLC's campaign by promising to \"study\" the city's problems.

{"title_page": "Power series", "text_new": "<!-- {{Calculus|Series}} -->\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''power series''' (in one variable) is an [[infinite series]] of the form\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n \\left(x - c\\right)^n = a_0 + a_1 (x - c)^1 + a_2 (x - c)^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nwhere ''a<sub>n</sub>'' represents the coefficient of the ''n''th term and ''c'' is a constant. ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is independent of x and may be expressed as a function of n (e.g., <math>a_n = 1/n!</math>). Power series are useful in analysis since they arise as [[Taylor series]] of infinitely differentiable [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. In fact, [[Borel's lemma|Borel's theorem]] implies that every power series is the Taylor series of some smooth function.\n\nIn many situations ''c'' (the ''center'' of the series) is equal to zero, for instance when considering a [[Maclaurin series]].  In such cases, the power series takes the simpler form\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nThese power series arise primarily in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], but also occur in [[combinatorics]] as [[generating function]]s (a kind of [[formal power series]]) and in electrical engineering (under the name of the [[Z-transform]]). The familiar [[Decimal representation|decimal notation]] for [[real number]]s can also be viewed as an example of a power series, with integer coefficients, but with the argument ''x'' fixed at {{Fraction|1|10}}. In [[number theory]], the concept of [[p-adic number]]s is also closely related to that of a power series.\n\n==Examples==<!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] -->\n\n[[Image:Exp series.gif|right|thumb|The [[exponential function]] (in blue), and the sum of the first ''n'' + 1 terms of its [[Maclaurin series|Maclaurin power series]] (in red).]]\n\nAny [[polynomial]] can be easily expressed as a power series around any center ''c'', although all but finitely many of the coefficients will be zero since a power series has infinitely many terms by definition.  For instance, the polynomial <math display=\"inline\">f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3</math> can be written as a power series around the center <math display=\"inline\">c = 0</math> as\n: <math>f(x) = 3 + 2 x + 1 x^2 + 0 x^3 + 0 x^4 + \\cdots \\,</math>\n\nor around the center <math display=\"inline\">c = 1</math> as\n: <math>f(x) = 6 + 4(x - 1) + 1(x - 1)^2 + 0(x - 1)^3 + 0(x - 1)^4 + \\cdots \\,</math>\n\nor indeed around any other center ''c''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Levi|title=Polynomials, Power Series, and Calculus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcI-AAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Van Nostrand|pages=24|author-link=Howard Levi}}</ref>  One can view power series as being like \"polynomials of infinite degree,\" although power series are not polynomials.\n\nThe [[geometric series]] formula\n: <math>\\frac{1}{1 - x} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is valid for <math display=\"inline\">|x| < 1</math>, is one of the most important examples of a power series, as are the exponential function formula\n: <math>e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nand the sine formula\n: <math>\\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n + 1)!} = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nvalid for all real x.\n\nThese power series are also examples of [[Taylor series]].\n\n=== On the set of exponents ===\n\nNegative powers are not permitted in a power series; for instance, <math display=\"inline\">1 + x^{-1} + x^{-2} + \\cdots</math> is not considered a power series (although it is a [[Laurent series]]).  Similarly, fractional powers such as <math display=\"inline\">x^\\frac{1}{2}</math> are not permitted (but see [[Puiseux series]]).  The coefficients <math display=\"inline\">a_n</math> are not allowed to depend on <math display=\"inline\">x</math>, thus for instance:\n: <math>\\sin(x) x + \\sin(2x) x^2 + \\sin(3x) x^3 + \\cdots \\,</math>\n\nis not a power series.\n\n==Radius of convergence==\n\nA power series will converge for some values of the variable ''x'' and may diverge for others. All power series ''f''(''x'') in powers of (''x'' &minus; ''c'') will converge at ''x'' = ''c''. (The correct value ''f''(''c'') = ''a''<sub>0</sub> requires interpreting the expression 0<sup>0</sup> as equal to 1.) If ''c'' is not the only convergent point, then there is always a number ''r'' with 0 < ''r'' \u2264 \u221e such that the series converges whenever |''x'' &minus; ''c''| < ''r'' and diverges whenever |''x'' &minus; ''c''| > ''r''.  The number ''r'' is called the '''[[radius of convergence]]''' of the power series; in general it is given as\n: <math>r = \\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|a_n\\right|^{-\\frac{1}{n}}</math>\n\nor, equivalently,\n: <math>r^{-1} = \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|a_n\\right|^\\frac{1}{n}</math>\n\n(this is the [[Cauchy\u2013Hadamard theorem]]; see [[limit superior and limit inferior]] for an explanation of the notation). The relation\n: <math>r^{-1} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|{a_{n+1}\\over a_n}\\right|</math>\nis also satisfied, if this limit exists.\n\nThe series [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]] for |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| < ''r'' and [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]] on every [[compact space|compact]] [[subset]] of {''x'' : |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| < ''r''}.  That is, the series is absolutely and [[compactly convergent]] on the interior of the disc of convergence.\n\nFor |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| = ''r'', we cannot make any general statement on whether the series converges or diverges. However, for the case of real variables, [[Abel's theorem]] states that the sum of the series is continuous at ''x'' if the series converges at ''x''. In the case of complex variables, we can only claim continuity along the line segment starting at ''c'' and ending at ''x''.\n\n== Operations on power series ==\n\n=== Addition and subtraction ===\nWhen two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are decomposed into power series around the same center ''c'', the power series of the sum or difference of the functions can be obtained by termwise addition and subtraction. That is, if\n: <math>f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n (x - c)^n</math> and <math>g(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n</math>\n\nthen\n: <math>f(x) \\pm g(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (a_n \\pm b_n) (x - c)^n.</math>\n\nIt is not true that if two power series <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n x^n</math> have the same radius of convergence, then <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(a_n + b_n\\right) x^n</math> also has this radius of convergence. If <math display=\"inline\">a_n = (-1)^n</math> and <math display=\"inline\">b_n = (-1)^{n+1} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3^n}\\right)</math>, then both series have the same radius of convergence of 1, but the series <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(a_n + b_n\\right) x^n = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{3^n} x^n</math> has a radius of convergence of 3.\n\n=== Multiplication and division ===\nWith the same definitions for <math>f(x)</math> and <math>g(x)</math>, the power series of the product and quotient of the functions can be obtained as follows:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  f(x)g(x) &= \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n (x-c)^n\\right)\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n\\right) \\\\\n           &= \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty  a_i b_j (x - c)^{i+j} \\\\\n           &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}\\right) (x - c)^n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe sequence <math>m_n = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}</math> is known as the [[convolution]] of the sequences <math>a_n</math> and <math>b_n</math>.\n\nFor division, if one defines the sequence <math>d_n</math> by\n: <math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n (x - c)^n}{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty d_n (x - c)^n</math>\n\nthen \n: <math>f(x) = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n\\right)\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty d_n (x - c)^n\\right)</math>\n\nand one can solve recursively for the terms <math>d_n</math> by comparing coefficients.\n\nSolving the corresponding equations yields the formulae based on [[determinant]]s of certain matrices of the coefficients of <math>f(x)</math> and <math>g(x)</math>\n:<math>d_0=\\frac{a_0}{b_0}</math>\n:<math>d_n=\\frac{1}{b_0^{n+1}}\\cdot\\det\\begin{vmatrix}a_n&b_1&b_2&\\ldots&b_n\\\\a_{n-1}&b_0&b_1&\\ldots&b_{n-1}\\\\a_{n-2}&0&b_0&\\ldots&b_{n-2}\\\\\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\a_0&0&0&\\ldots&b_0\\end{vmatrix}</math>\n\n=== Differentiation and integration===\nOnce a function <math>f(x)</math> is given as a power series as above, it is [[derivative|differentiable]] on the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of the domain of convergence. It can be [[derivative|differentiated]] and [[integral|integrated]] quite easily, by treating every term separately:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    f^\\prime(x) &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n n \\left(x - c\\right)^{n-1} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{n+1} \\left(n + 1\\right) \\left(x - c\\right)^n, \\\\\n  \\int f(x)\\,dx &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{a_n \\left(x - c\\right)^{n+1}}{n + 1} + k = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_{n-1} \\left(x - c\\right)^n}{n} + k.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBoth of these series have the same radius of convergence as the original one.\n\n== Analytic functions ==\n{{main|Analytic function}}\nA function ''f'' defined on some [[open set|open subset]] ''U'' of '''R''' or '''C''' is called [[Analytic function|analytic]] if it is locally given by a convergent power series. This means that every ''a'' \u2208 ''U'' has an open [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', such that there exists a power series with center ''a'' that converges to ''f''(''x'') for every ''x'' \u2208 ''V''.\n\nEvery power series with a positive radius of convergence is analytic on the [[topological interior|interior]] of its region of convergence. All [[holomorphic function]]s are complex-analytic. Sums and products of analytic functions are analytic, as are quotients as long as the denominator is non-zero.\n\nIf a function is analytic, then it is infinitely differentiable, but in the real case the converse is not generally true. For an analytic function, the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> can be computed as\n: <math>a_n = \\frac{f^{\\left( n \\right)} \\left( c \\right)}{n!}</math>\n\nwhere <math>f^{(n)}(c)</math> denotes the ''n''th derivative of ''f'' at ''c'', and <math>f^{(0)}(c) = f(c)</math>. This means that every analytic function is locally represented by its [[Taylor series]].\n\nThe global form of an analytic function is completely determined by its local behavior in the following sense: if ''f'' and ''g'' are two analytic functions defined on the same [[connectedness|connected]] open set ''U'', and if there exists an element ''c''\u2208''U'' such that ''f''<sup>&nbsp;(''n'')</sup>(''c'') = ''g''<sup>&nbsp;(''n'')</sup>(''c'') for all ''n'' \u2265 0, then ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'') for all ''x'' \u2208 ''U''.\n\nIf a power series with radius of convergence ''r'' is given, one can consider [[analytic continuation]]s of the series, i.e. analytic functions ''f'' which are defined on larger sets than { ''x'' : |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| < ''r'' } and agree with the given power series on this set. The number ''r'' is maximal in the following sense: there always exists a [[complex number]] ''x'' with |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| = ''r'' such that no analytic continuation of the series can be defined at ''x''.\n\nThe power series expansion of the [[inverse function]] of an analytic function can be determined using the [[Lagrange inversion theorem]].\n\n=== Behavior near the boundary ===\n\nThe sum of a power series with a positive radius of convergence is an analytic function at every point in the interior of the disc of convergence. However, different behavior can occur at points on the boundary of that disc. For example:\n\n# ''Divergence while the sum extends to an analytic function'': <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}z^n</math> has radius of convergence equal to <math>1</math> and diverges at every point of <math>|z|=1</math>. Nevertheless, the sum in <math>|z|<1</math> is <math>\\frac{1}{1-z}</math>, which is analytic at every point of the plane except for <math>z=1</math>.\n# ''Convergent at some points divergent at others.'': <math>\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\frac{z^n}{n}</math> has radius of convergence <math>1</math>. It converges for <math>z=1</math>, while it diverges for <math>z=-1</math>\n# ''Absolute convergence at every point of the boundary'': <math>\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{z^n}{n^2}</math> has radius of convergence <math>1</math>, while it converges absolutely, and uniformly, at every point of <math>|z|=1</math> due to [[Weierstrass M-test]] applied with the [[Harmonic series (mathematics)#p-series|hyper-harmonic convergent series]] <math>\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^2}</math>.\n# ''Convergent on the closure of the disc of convergence but not continuous sum'': [[Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski|Sierpi\u0144ski]] gave an example<ref>{{cite book|author=Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski|title=Sur une s\u00e9rie potentielle qui, \u00e9tant convergente en tout point de son cercle de convergence, repr\u00e9sente sur ce cercle une fonction discontinue. (French)|url=https://zbmath.org/?q=an:46.1466.03|year=1916|publisher=Palermo Rend.|pages=187\u2013190|author-link=Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski}}</ref> of a power series with radius of convergence <math>1</math>, convergent at all points with <math>|z|=1</math>, but the sum is an unbounded function and, in particular, discontinuous. A sufficient condition for one-sided continuity at a boundary point is given by [[Abel's theorem]].\n\n== Formal power series ==\n{{main|Formal power series}}\nIn [[abstract algebra]], one attempts to capture the essence of power series without being restricted to the [[field (mathematics)|field]]s of real and complex numbers, and without the need to talk about convergence. This leads to the concept of [[formal power series]], a concept of great utility in [[algebraic combinatorics]].\n\n== Power series in several variables ==\nAn extension of the theory is necessary for the purposes of [[multivariable calculus]]. A '''power series''' is here defined to be an infinite series of the form\n: <math>f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\sum_{j_1, \\dots, j_n = 0}^\\infty a_{j_1, \\dots, j_n} \\prod_{k=1}^n \\left(x_k - c_k\\right)^{j_k},</math>\n\nwhere ''j'' = (''j''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''j''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a vector of natural numbers, the coefficients ''a''<sub>(''j<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, j<sub>n</sub>'')</sub> are usually real or complex numbers, and the center ''c'' = (''c''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''c''<sub>''n''</sub>) and argument ''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) are usually real or complex vectors. The symbol <math>\\Pi</math> is the [[multiplication#Capital Pi notation|product symbol]], denoting multiplication. In the more convenient [[multi-index]] notation this can be written\n: <math>f(x) = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}^n} a_{\\alpha} \\left(x - c \\right)^{\\alpha}.</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbb{N}</math> is the set of [[natural number]]s, and so <math>\\mathbb{N}^n</math> is the set of ordered n-[[tuple]]s of natural numbers.\n\nThe theory of such series is trickier than for single-variable series, with more complicated regions of convergence.  For instance, the power series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x_1^n x_2^n</math> is absolutely convergent in the set <math>\\{ (x_1, x_2): |x_1 x_2| < 1\\}</math> between two hyperbolas.  (This is an example of a ''log-convex set'', in the sense that the set of points <math>(\\log |x_1|, \\log |x_2|)</math>, where <math>(x_1, x_2)</math> lies in the above region, is a convex set.  More generally, one can show that when c=0, the interior of the region of absolute convergence is always a log-convex set in this sense.)  On the other hand, in the interior of this region of convergence one may differentiate and integrate under the series sign, just as one may with ordinary power series.\n\n== Order of a power series ==\nLet \u03b1 be a multi-index for a power series ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>).  The '''order''' of the power series ''f'' is defined to be the least value <math>r</math> such that there is ''a''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2260 0 with <math>r=|\\alpha|=\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2+\\ldots+\\alpha_n</math>, or <math>\\infty</math> if ''f'' \u2261 0.  In particular, for a power series ''f''(''x'') in a single variable ''x'', the order of ''f'' is the smallest power of ''x'' with a nonzero coefficient.  This definition readily extends to [[Laurent series]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flat function]]\n* [[Linear approximation]]\n* [[Random variable]]\n* [[Series multisection]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{SpringerEOM|title=Power series|id=Power_series&oldid=15309|last=Solomentsev|first=E.D.}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathWorld | urlname= FormalPowerSeries | title= Formal Power Series }}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname= PowerSeries | title= Power Series }}\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PowersOfComplexNumbers/ Powers of Complex Numbers] by Michael Schreiber, [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n{{series (mathematics)}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Power Series}}\n[[Category:Real analysis]]\n[[Category:Complex analysis]]\n[[Category:Multivariable calculus]]\n[[Category:Mathematical series]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- {{Calculus|Series}} -->\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''power series''' (in one variable) is an [[infinite series]] of the form\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n \\left(x - c\\right)^n = a_0 + a_1 (x - c)^1 + a_2 (x - c)^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nwhere ''a<sub>n</sub>'' represents the coefficient of the ''n''th term and ''c'' is a constant.

In such cases, the power series takes the simpler form\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nThese power series arise primarily in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], but also occur in [[combinatorics]] as [[generating function]]s (a kind of [[formal power series]]) and in electrical engineering (under the name of the [[Z-transform]]). The familiar [[Decimal representation|decimal notation]] for [[real number]]s can also be viewed as an example of a power series, with integer coefficients, but with the argument ''x'' fixed at {{Fraction|1|10}}. In [[number theory]], the concept of [[p-adic number]]s is also closely related to that of a power series.\n\n==Examples==<!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] -->\n\n[[Image:Exp series.gif|right|thumb|The [[exponential function]] (in blue), and the sum of the first ''n'' + 1 terms of its [[Maclaurin series|Maclaurin power series]] (in red).]]\n\nAny [[polynomial]] can be easily expressed as a power series around any center ''c'', although all but finitely many of the coefficients will be zero since a power series has infinitely many terms by definition.  For instance, the polynomial <math display=\"inline\">f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3</math> can be written as a power series around the center <math display=\"inline\">c = 0</math> as\n: <math>f(x) = 3 + 2 x + 1 x^2 + 0 x^3 + 0 x^4 + \\cdots \\,</math>\n\nor around the center <math display=\"inline\">c = 1</math> as\n: <math>f(x) = 6 + 4(x - 1) + 1(x - 1)^2 + 0(x - 1)^3 + 0(x - 1)^4 + \\cdots \\,</math>\n\nor indeed around any other center ''c''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Levi|title=Polynomials, Power Series, and Calculus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcI-AAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Van Nostrand|pages=24|author-link=Howard Levi}}</ref>  One can view power series as being like \"polynomials of infinite degree,\" although power series are not polynomials.\n\nThe [[geometric series]] formula\n: <math>\\frac{1}{1 - x} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is valid for <math display=\"inline\">|x| < 1</math>, is one of the most important examples of a power series, as are the exponential function formula\n: <math>e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nand the sine formula\n: <math>\\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n + 1)!} = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nvalid for all real x.\n\nThese power series are also examples of [[Taylor series]].\n\n=== On the set of exponents ===\n\nNegative powers are not permitted in a power series; for instance, <math display=\"inline\">1 + x^{-1} + x^{-2} + \\cdots</math> is not considered a power series (although it is a [[Laurent series]]).  Similarly, fractional powers such as <math display=\"inline\">x^\\frac{1}{2}</math> are not permitted (but see [[Puiseux series]]).  The coefficients <math display=\"inline\">a_n</math> are not allowed to depend on <math display=\"inline\">x</math>, thus for instance:\n: <math>\\sin(x) x + \\sin(2x) x^2 + \\sin(3x) x^3 + \\cdots \\,</math>\n\nis not a power series.\n\n==Radius of convergence==\n\nA power series will converge for some values of the variable ''x'' and may diverge for others. All power series ''f''(''x'') in powers of (''x'' &minus; ''c'') will converge at ''x'' = ''c''. (The correct value ''f''(''c'') = ''a''<sub>0</sub> requires interpreting the expression 0<sup>0</sup> as equal to 1.) If ''c'' is not the only convergent point, then there is always a number ''r'' with 0 < ''r'' \u2264 \u221e such that the series converges whenever |''x'' &minus; ''c''| < ''r'' and diverges whenever |''x'' &minus; ''c''| > ''r''.  The number ''r'' is called the '''[[radius of convergence]]''' of the power series; in general it is given as\n: <math>r = \\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|a_n\\right|^{-\\frac{1}{n}}</math>\n\nor, equivalently,\n: <math>r^{-1} = \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|a_n\\right|^\\frac{1}{n}</math>\n\n(this is the [[Cauchy\u2013Hadamard theorem]]; see [[limit superior and limit inferior]] for an explanation of the notation). The relation\n: <math>r^{-1} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|{a_{n+1}\\over a_n}\\right|</math>\nis also satisfied, if this limit exists.\n\nThe series [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]] for |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| < ''r'' and [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]] on every [[compact space|compact]] [[subset]] of {''x'' : |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| < ''r''}.  That is, the series is absolutely and [[compactly convergent]] on the interior of the disc of convergence.\n\nFor |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| = ''r'', we cannot make any general statement on whether the series converges or diverges. However, for the case of real variables, [[Abel's theorem]] states that the sum of the series is continuous at ''x'' if the series converges at ''x''. In the case of complex variables, we can only claim continuity along the line segment starting at ''c'' and ending at ''x''.\n\n== Operations on power series ==\n\n=== Addition and subtraction ===\nWhen two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are decomposed into power series around the same center ''c'', the power series of the sum or difference of the functions can be obtained by termwise addition and subtraction. That is, if\n: <math>f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n (x - c)^n</math> and <math>g(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n</math>\n\nthen\n: <math>f(x) \\pm g(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (a_n \\pm b_n) (x - c)^n.</math>\n\nIt is not true that if two power series <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n x^n</math> have the same radius of convergence, then <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(a_n + b_n\\right) x^n</math> also has this radius of convergence. If <math display=\"inline\">a_n = (-1)^n</math> and <math display=\"inline\">b_n = (-1)^{n+1} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3^n}\\right)</math>, then both series have the same radius of convergence of 1, but the series <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(a_n + b_n\\right) x^n = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{3^n} x^n</math> has a radius of convergence of 3.\n\n=== Multiplication and division ===\nWith the same definitions for <math>f(x)</math> and <math>g(x)</math>, the power series of the product and quotient of the functions can be obtained as follows:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  f(x)g(x) &= \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n (x-c)^n\\right)\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n\\right) \\\\\n           &= \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty  a_i b_j (x - c)^{i+j} \\\\\n           &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}\\right) (x - c)^n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe sequence <math>m_n = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}</math> is known as the [[convolution]] of the sequences <math>a_n</math> and <math>b_n</math>.\n\nFor division, if one defines the sequence <math>d_n</math> by\n: <math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n (x - c)^n}{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty d_n (x - c)^n</math>\n\nthen \n: <math>f(x) = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (x - c)^n\\right)\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty d_n (x - c)^n\\right)</math>\n\nand one can solve recursively for the terms <math>d_n</math> by comparing coefficients.\n\nSolving the corresponding equations yields the formulae based on [[determinant]]s of certain matrices of the coefficients of <math>f(x)</math> and <math>g(x)</math>\n:<math>d_0=\\frac{a_0}{b_0}</math>\n:<math>d_n=\\frac{1}{b_0^{n+1}}\\cdot\\det\\begin{vmatrix}a_n&b_1&b_2&\\ldots&b_n\\\\a_{n-1}&b_0&b_1&\\ldots&b_{n-1}\\\\a_{n-2}&0&b_0&\\ldots&b_{n-2}\\\\\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\a_0&0&0&\\ldots&b_0\\end{vmatrix}</math>\n\n=== Differentiation and integration===\nOnce a function <math>f(x)</math> is given as a power series as above, it is [[derivative|differentiable]] on the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of the domain of convergence. It can be [[derivative|differentiated]] and [[integral|integrated]] quite easily, by treating every term separately:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    f^\\prime(x) &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n n \\left(x - c\\right)^{n-1} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{n+1} \\left(n + 1\\right) \\left(x - c\\right)^n, \\\\\n  \\int f(x)\\,dx &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{a_n \\left(x - c\\right)^{n+1}}{n + 1} + k = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_{n-1} \\left(x - c\\right)^n}{n} + k.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBoth of these series have the same radius of convergence as the original one.\n\n== Analytic functions ==\n{{main|Analytic function}}\nA function ''f'' defined on some [[open set|open subset]] ''U'' of '''R''' or '''C''' is called [[Analytic function|analytic]] if it is locally given by a convergent power series. This means that every ''a'' \u2208 ''U'' has an open [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', such that there exists a power series with center ''a'' that converges to ''f''(''x'') for every ''x'' \u2208 ''V''.\n\nEvery power series with a positive radius of convergence is analytic on the [[topological interior|interior]] of its region of convergence. All [[holomorphic function]]s are complex-analytic. Sums and products of analytic functions are analytic, as are quotients as long as the denominator is non-zero.\n\nIf a function is analytic, then it is infinitely differentiable, but in the real case the converse is not generally true. For an analytic function, the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> can be computed as\n: <math>a_n = \\frac{f^{\\left( n \\right)} \\left( c \\right)}{n!}</math>\n\nwhere <math>f^{(n)}(c)</math> denotes the ''n''th derivative of ''f'' at ''c'', and <math>f^{(0)}(c) = f(c)</math>. This means that every analytic function is locally represented by its [[Taylor series]].\n\nThe global form of an analytic function is completely determined by its local behavior in the following sense: if ''f'' and ''g'' are two analytic functions defined on the same [[connectedness|connected]] open set ''U'', and if there exists an element ''c''\u2208''U'' such that ''f''<sup>&nbsp;(''n'')</sup>(''c'') = ''g''<sup>&nbsp;(''n'')</sup>(''c'') for all ''n'' \u2265 0, then ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'') for all ''x'' \u2208 ''U''.\n\nIf a power series with radius of convergence ''r'' is given, one can consider [[analytic continuation]]s of the series, i.e. analytic functions ''f'' which are defined on larger sets than { ''x'' : |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| < ''r'' } and agree with the given power series on this set. The number ''r'' is maximal in the following sense: there always exists a [[complex number]] ''x'' with |''x'' \u2212 ''c''| = ''r'' such that no analytic continuation of the series can be defined at ''x''.\n\nThe power series expansion of the [[inverse function]] of an analytic function can be determined using the [[Lagrange inversion theorem]].\n\n=== Behavior near the boundary ===\n\nThe sum of a power series with a positive radius of convergence is an analytic function at every point in the interior of the disc of convergence. However, different behavior can occur at points on the boundary of that disc. For example:\n\n# ''Divergence while the sum extends to an analytic function'': <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}z^n</math> has radius of convergence equal to <math>1</math> and diverges at every point of <math>|z|=1</math>. Nevertheless, the sum in <math>|z|<1</math> is <math>\\frac{1}{1-z}</math>, which is analytic at every point of the plane except for <math>z=1</math>.\n# ''Convergent at some points divergent at others.'': <math>\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\frac{z^n}{n}</math> has radius of convergence <math>1</math>. It converges for <math>z=1</math>, while it diverges for <math>z=-1</math>\n# ''Absolute convergence at every point of the boundary'': <math>\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{z^n}{n^2}</math> has radius of convergence <math>1</math>, while it converges absolutely, and uniformly, at every point of <math>|z|=1</math> due to [[Weierstrass M-test]] applied with the [[Harmonic series (mathematics)#p-series|hyper-harmonic convergent series]] <math>\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^2}</math>.\n# ''Convergent on the closure of the disc of convergence but not continuous sum'': [[Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski|Sierpi\u0144ski]] gave an example<ref>{{cite book|author=Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski|title=Sur une s\u00e9rie potentielle qui, \u00e9tant convergente en tout point de son cercle de convergence, repr\u00e9sente sur ce cercle une fonction discontinue. (French)|url=https://zbmath.org/?q=an:46.1466.03|year=1916|publisher=Palermo Rend.|pages=187\u2013190|author-link=Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski}}</ref> of a power series with radius of convergence <math>1</math>, convergent at all points with <math>|z|=1</math>, but the sum is an unbounded function and, in particular, discontinuous. A sufficient condition for one-sided continuity at a boundary point is given by [[Abel's theorem]].\n\n== Formal power series ==\n{{main|Formal power series}}\nIn [[abstract algebra]], one attempts to capture the essence of power series without being restricted to the [[field (mathematics)|field]]s of real and complex numbers, and without the need to talk about convergence. This leads to the concept of [[formal power series]], a concept of great utility in [[algebraic combinatorics]].\n\n== Power series in several variables ==\nAn extension of the theory is necessary for the purposes of [[multivariable calculus]]. A '''power series''' is here defined to be an infinite series of the form\n: <math>f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\sum_{j_1, \\dots, j_n = 0}^\\infty a_{j_1, \\dots, j_n} \\prod_{k=1}^n \\left(x_k - c_k\\right)^{j_k},</math>\n\nwhere ''j'' = (''j''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''j''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a vector of natural numbers, the coefficients ''a''<sub>(''j<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, j<sub>n</sub>'')</sub> are usually real or complex numbers, and the center ''c'' = (''c''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''c''<sub>''n''</sub>) and argument ''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) are usually real or complex vectors. The symbol <math>\\Pi</math> is the [[multiplication#Capital Pi notation|product symbol]], denoting multiplication. In the more convenient [[multi-index]] notation this can be written\n: <math>f(x) = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}^n} a_{\\alpha} \\left(x - c \\right)^{\\alpha}.</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbb{N}</math> is the set of [[natural number]]s, and so <math>\\mathbb{N}^n</math> is the set of ordered n-[[tuple]]s of natural numbers.\n\nThe theory of such series is trickier than for single-variable series, with more complicated regions of convergence.  For instance, the power series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x_1^n x_2^n</math> is absolutely convergent in the set <math>\\{ (x_1, x_2): |x_1 x_2| < 1\\}</math> between two hyperbolas.  (This is an example of a ''log-convex set'', in the sense that the set of points <math>(\\log |x_1|, \\log |x_2|)</math>, where <math>(x_1, x_2)</math> lies in the above region, is a convex set.  More generally, one can show that when c=0, the interior of the region of absolute convergence is always a log-convex set in this sense.)  On the other hand, in the interior of this region of convergence one may differentiate and integrate under the series sign, just as one may with ordinary power series.\n\n== Order of a power series ==\nLet \u03b1 be a multi-index for a power series ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>).  The '''order''' of the power series ''f'' is defined to be the least value <math>r</math> such that there is ''a''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2260 0 with <math>r=|\\alpha|=\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2+\\ldots+\\alpha_n</math>, or <math>\\infty</math> if ''f'' \u2261 0.  In particular, for a power series ''f''(''x'') in a single variable ''x'', the order of ''f'' is the smallest power of ''x'' with a nonzero coefficient.  This definition readily extends to [[Laurent series]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flat function]]\n* [[Linear approximation]]\n* [[Random variable]]\n* [[Series multisection]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{SpringerEOM|title=Power series|id=Power_series&oldid=15309|last=Solomentsev|first=E.D.}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathWorld | urlname= FormalPowerSeries | title= Formal Power Series }}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname= PowerSeries | title= Power Series }}\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PowersOfComplexNumbers/ Powers of Complex Numbers] by Michael Schreiber, [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Power Series}}\n[[Category:Real analysis]]\n[[Category:Complex analysis]]\n[[Category:Multivariable calculus]]\n[[Category:Mathematical series]]\n", "name_user": "MathXplore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series"}

He is also known by the nicknames \"Christ\" and \"Holmes\".\n\n==Early life==\nHosoi was born on October 5, 1967 to a father of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent from [[Hawaii]], and his mother is Caucasian. He grew up in [[Los Angeles]] and Hawaii.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/christian-hosoi-tony-hawk-rise-skating-x-games/|title=Rising Down|publisher=[[Grantland]]|author=Hsu, Hua|date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Skateboard career==\nHosoi started skating at seven or eight years old with veterans such as [[Shogo Kubo]], [[Tony Alva]], [[Stacy Peralta]], and [[Jay Adams]] as his idols. His father, Ivan \"Pops\" Hosoi became the manager of the [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina Del Rey]] Skatepark, and Christian quit school and spent his time there where he developed his skill. In 1979, as an amateur, Hosoi was sponsored by [[Powell Peralta]]. He left Powell Peralta a year later when they would not allow him to turn professional and joined Dogtown Skateboards. Shortly thereafter, Dogtown went out of business. Christian turned pro at the age of 14 with Sims Skateboards.\n\nChristian Hosoi emerged as a competitor of vertical riding alongside such pros as [[Steve Caballero]], [[Mike McGill]], [[Lester Kasai]], and [[Mark Rogowski|Mark \"Gator\" Rogowski]]\n\nHosoi invented the [[Christ Air]] and [[Skateboarding trick|Rocket Air]]. In 1984 he formed his own company, Hosoi Skates, first distributed through Skull Skates, then through NHS-INC. \n\nWhen street skating began to emerge in the mid-to-late '80s, Hosoi showed talent there, winning both the vert and street contests at the Lotte Cup contest in Japan in 1989.<ref name=\"Things\">{{cite web\n |last      = Craft\n |first     = Kevin Craft\n |title     = 15 Things: Hosoi\n |publisher = Skateboarder Magazine\n |date      = June 8, 2005\n |url       = http://www.skateboardermag.com/features/15hosi/\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050616030952/http://skateboardermag.com/features/15hosi/\n|url-status  = dead\n|archive-date = June 16, 2005\n}}</ref>\n\n===Contest history===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2009}}\n*Placed in top 5 in 1980 Van's/Offshore Amateur State Finals (California) in boys' 11\u201313 division\n*1st in 1985 NSA Summer Series #5 (Vancouver, BC): pro vert\n*1st in 1985 NSA\n*2nd in 1986 Expo 86 (Vancouver, BC): vert\n*1st in 1987 Thrasher Savannah Slamma I, street\n*2nd in 1987 Vision Ramp N' Rage Down South: vert\n*1st in 1988 Vision Skate Escape: vert\n*2nd in 1988 Ohio Skateout: street\n*1st in 1988 Ramp Riot Bells beach (Australia): vert\n*1st in 1988 Titus World Cup (Germany): vert\n*2nd in 1988 Titus World Cup (Germany): street\n*2nd in 1988 Vision Bluegrass Aggression Session: vert\n*1st in 1989 NSA Savannah Slamma III: Arena Street Style\n*2nd in 1989 NSA Gotcha Grind: vert\n*1st in 1989 Japan Slam Jam (Japan): vert\n*3rd in 1990 Disco in Frisco: street\n*3rd in 1990 NSA All Pro Mini Ramp Jam Hawaiian Style: mini ramp\n*1st in 2008 the 10th Annual Tim Brauch Memorial Contest Grandmasters Event\n*1st in 2008 Etnies GVR Skull Bowl \u2013 Masters (Lake Forest, CA)\n*Overall Best \u201880s in 2008 The \u201cAll \u201880s All Day Vert Challenge\u201d\n*the 1st annual Team event at the 2009 Ultimate Boarder.\n*2nd in 2009 Pro-tec Pool Party-Master's division\n*TransWorld Legend Award 11th 2009\n*1st in 2009 the X Games 15 Skateboard Park Legends contest\n*2nd in 2009 the 11th Annual Tim Brauch Memorial Contest Grandmasters Event\n*1st in 2010 the X Games 16 Skateboard Park Legends contest\n\n==Incarceration==\nHosoi's pro career began to falter as a recession hit the US in the early 1990s and the new street skating stars began to overshadow vertical riders in media coverage. Hosoi faced bankruptcy after financial difficulties with a series of failed skateboard companies like Tuff Sk8s, Sk8 Kultur, Milk, and Focus, in addition to a growing addiction to drugs.\n\nIn 1995, Hosoi was arrested on two minor offences, and a warrant for his arrest was issued for failing to appear in court. To avoid arrest, Hosoi stopped attending competitions and demos, including declining an invitation to the first [[X Games]] (then the Extreme Games), which was going to be marketed as a renewed rivalry between Hawk and Hosoi.\n\nHosoi was finally captured in January 2000 at the [[Honolulu]] airport. He was apprehended while attempting to transport nearly {{convert|1.5|lb|abbr=on}} of crystal [[methamphetamine]] from Los Angeles to Honolulu.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCdxNkXnjpA Hosoi Bio]</ref><ref name=\"skateboarder\">{{cite web\n |last        = Barayuga\n |first       = Debra\n |title       = Noted skateboarder nets jail time for drug charges\n |publisher   = Honolulu Star-Bulletin\n |date        = September 11, 2001\n |url         = http://www.50-50.com/absorb/articles/2001/hosoi_sentenced.shtml\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090613002505/http://www.50-50.com/absorb/articles/2001/hosoi_sentenced.shtml\n |archivedate = June 13, 2009\n}}</ref>\nHe was charged with trafficking with the intent to distribute. He was sentenced to ten years' incarceration, of which he served four and was released from the [[San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department|San Bernardino Central Detention Center]] in June 2004.\n\n==Personal life==\nHosoi is married to former nightclub dancer Jennifer Lee and has four sons, James Hosoi, Rhythm Hosoi (from a previous relationship), Classic Hosoi and Endless Hosoi. He is currently living in [[Huntington Beach, California]].\n\n===Christianity===\nHosoi became a born-again Christian through the urging of his wife and her uncle, Pastor Christopher Swaim.

He is also known by the nicknames \"Christ\" and \"Holmes\".\n\n==Early life==\nHosoi was born on October 5, 1967 to a father of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent from [[Hawaii]], and his mother is Caucasian. He grew up in [[Los Angeles]] and Hawaii.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/christian-hosoi-tony-hawk-rise-skating-x-games/|title=Rising Down|publisher=[[Grantland]]|author=Hsu, Hua|date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Skateboard career==\nHosoi started skating at seven or eight years old with veterans such as [[Shogo Kubo]], [[Tony Alva]], [[Stacy Peralta]], and [[Jay Adams]] as his idols. His father, Ivan \"Pops\" Hosoi became the manager of the [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina Del Rey]] Skatepark, and Christian quit school and spent his time there where he developed his skill. In 1979, as an amateur, Hosoi was sponsored by [[Powell Peralta]]. He left Powell Peralta a year later when they would not allow him to turn professional and joined Dogtown Skateboards. Shortly thereafter, Dogtown went out of business. Christian turned pro at the age of 14 with Sims Skateboards.\n\nChristian Hosoi emerged as a competitor of vertical riding alongside such pros as [[Steve Caballero]], [[Mike McGill]], [[Lester Kasai]], and [[Mark Rogowski|Mark \"Gator\" Rogowski]]\n\nHosoi invented the [[Christ Air]] and [[Skateboarding trick|Rocket Air]]. In 1984 he formed his own company, Hosoi Skates, first distributed through Skull Skates, then through NHS-INC. \n\nWhen street skating began to emerge in the mid-to-late '80s, Hosoi showed talent there, winning both the vert and street contests at the Lotte Cup contest in Japan in 1989.<ref name=\"Things\">{{cite web\n |last      = Craft\n |first     = Kevin Craft\n |title     = 15 Things: Hosoi\n |publisher = Skateboarder Magazine\n |date      = June 8, 2005\n |url       = http://www.skateboardermag.com/features/15hosi/\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050616030952/http://skateboardermag.com/features/15hosi/\n|url-status  = dead\n|archive-date = June 16, 2005\n}}</ref>\n\n===Contest history===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2009}}\n*Placed in top 5 in 1980 Van's/Offshore Amateur State Finals (California) in boys' 11\u201313 division\n*1st in 1985 NSA Summer Series #5 (Vancouver, BC): pro vert\n*1st in 1985 NSA\n*2nd in 1986 Expo 86 (Vancouver, BC): vert\n*1st in 1987 Thrasher Savannah Slamma I, street\n*2nd in 1987 Vision Ramp N' Rage Down South: vert\n*1st in 1988 Vision Skate Escape: vert\n*2nd in 1988 Ohio Skateout: street\n*1st in 1988 Ramp Riot Bells beach (Australia): vert\n*1st in 1988 Titus World Cup (Germany): vert\n*2nd in 1988 Titus World Cup (Germany): street\n*2nd in 1988 Vision Bluegrass Aggression Session: vert\n*1st in 1989 NSA Savannah Slamma III: Arena Street Style\n*2nd in 1989 NSA Gotcha Grind: vert\n*1st in 1989 Japan Slam Jam (Japan): vert\n*3rd in 1990 Disco in Frisco: street\n*3rd in 1990 NSA All Pro Mini Ramp Jam Hawaiian Style: mini ramp\n*1st in 2008 the 10th Annual Tim Brauch Memorial Contest Grandmasters Event\n*1st in 2008 Etnies GVR Skull Bowl \u2013 Masters (Lake Forest, CA)\n*Overall Best \u201880s in 2008 The \u201cAll \u201880s All Day Vert Challenge\u201d\n*the 1st annual Team event at the 2009 Ultimate Boarder.\n*2nd in 2009 Pro-tec Pool Party-Master's division\n*TransWorld Legend Award 11th 2009\n*1st in 2009 the X Games 15 Skateboard Park Legends contest\n*2nd in 2009 the 11th Annual Tim Brauch Memorial Contest Grandmasters Event\n*1st in 2010 the X Games 16 Skateboard Park Legends contest\n\n==Incarceration==\nHosoi's pro career began to falter as a recession hit the US in the early 1990s and the new street skating stars began to overshadow vertical riders in media coverage. Hosoi faced bankruptcy after financial difficulties with a series of failed skateboard companies like Tuff Sk8s, Sk8 Kultur, Milk, and Focus, in addition to a growing addiction to drugs.\n\nIn 1995, Hosoi was arrested on two minor offences, and a warrant for his arrest was issued for failing to appear in court. To avoid arrest, Hosoi stopped attending competitions and demos, including declining an invitation to the first [[X Games]] (then the Extreme Games), which was going to be marketed as a renewed rivalry between Hawk and Hosoi.\n\nHosoi was finally captured in January 2000 at the [[Honolulu]] airport. He was apprehended while attempting to transport nearly {{convert|1.5|lb|abbr=on}} of crystal [[methamphetamine]] from Los Angeles to Honolulu.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCdxNkXnjpA Hosoi Bio]</ref><ref name=\"skateboarder\">{{cite web\n |last        = Barayuga\n |first       = Debra\n |title       = Noted skateboarder nets jail time for drug charges\n |publisher   = Honolulu Star-Bulletin\n |date        = September 11, 2001\n |url         = http://www.50-50.com/absorb/articles/2001/hosoi_sentenced.shtml\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090613002505/http://www.50-50.com/absorb/articles/2001/hosoi_sentenced.shtml\n |archivedate = June 13, 2009\n}}</ref>\nHe was charged with trafficking with the intent to distribute.

Papas moved on from Green Gully after accepting an offer to coach again in Asia.\n\n===Ettifaq FC===\n\nPapas joined [[Saudi Professional League]] club [[Ettifaq FC]] working alongside former VV Venlo coach [[Eelco Schattorie]] for the latter part of the Saudi Professional League season. They joined Ettifaq FC whilst the club was in the middle of a relegation battle after not having won in a league match for three months. Together they managed to save the Pro League club from relegation with two games to spare.\"Our predicament was not the easiest situation to inherit as the team hadn\u2019t won a league match since November 24, and in a situation like this there are numerous factors surrounding the dynamics of the team which clearly are not functioning at an optimum level. So to improve the results, whilst finding a playing style that was suited the characteristics of the playing group, was a fine balancing act but one we managed to navigate successfully.I was privileged to work in the Saudi Pro League and with their players and therefore understand deeply the affiliation they have for their country and what it means to them all as football  really is the only sport that matters there.<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/aussie-coachs-success-saudi-arabia</ref>.\u201d\n\n===Double Pass===\nIn 2018, Papas was appointed Project Manager and Football Consultant for Belgian based Talent Development Company, Double Pass. Papas led an experienced group of European coaches in consulting to Japanese & US professional football clubs on how to optimise their talent development structures.\n\n===Northeast United FC===\n\nIn 2018 Papas returned to India and teamed up again with Dutch Coach Eelco Schattorie to take over Indian Super League side Northeast United FC. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult job here in the north east of India. They are the only club never to qualify for ISL playoffs. But it's gone well so far, we amassed the same points after five games than we did in 18 last season.\u201d <ref>https://www.ftbl.com.au/news/papas-thrilled-with-life-inindian-football-hotbed-515569/page2</ref>Northeast United FC eventually qualified for the maiden ISL finals appearance and this still remains their only finals appearance in the ISL since the leagues inception. \u201cThis ISL has improved a lot from when I was first here. The foreign players are a lot better now. It\u2019s not just about marquees anymore. It\u2019s a longer league too, going now for eight months.\u201d<ref>https://www.ftbl.com.au/news/papas-thrilled-with-life-inindian-football-hotbed-515569/page2</ref>Papas left NorthEast United FC prior to the finals series to link up with J.League team Yokohama F. Marinos for the 2019 season.\n\n===Yokohama F. Marinos===\n\nIn January 2019, Papas was appointed Assistant Coach of J-league side Yokohama F. Marinos joining Ange Postecoglou and Peter Cklamovski as part of the Australian contingent at the club. They went on to create history and become J.League champions winning the clubs first championship in 15 years, the first Australians to win a league title in Japan. Papas was then elevated to Head Coach under Postecoglou in 2020 explaining \"I think I'm in a really good period in my career, working for someone I really respect and can learn so much from and challenge myself. For me it's an outstanding learning period that will hold me in really good stead, wherever I want to go down the track. \"I'm working for one of the most successful coaches in world football, to be honest. It's measurable at the top level in the world, let alone the country<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/why-postecoglou-s-new-right-hand-man-brushed-a-possible-a-league-gig-20200218-p541zk.html</ref>.\u201d\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papas, Arthur}}\n[[Category:I-League managers]]\n[[Category:Pailan Arrows managers]]\n[[Category:Dempo S.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Greek football managers]]\n<ref>https://www.gazzetta.gr/football/world/article/1464637/tin-triti-stamatisan-oi-proponiseis-stin-iaponia-mpala-xana-apo-ton-ioynio</ref>\n", "name_user": "Manny Wantong", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGreen Gully SC", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Papas"}
