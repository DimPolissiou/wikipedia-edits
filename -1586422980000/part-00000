FC Schweinfurt 05 team in 1905]]\n\nThe football club was founded on 5 May 1905 and played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. The club had a couple of successful seasons in the [[Gauliga]] era, winning the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]] in [[1939 German football championship|1939]] and [[1942 German football championship|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. In the German football championship 1939 competition, Schweinfurt barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the first round of the 1942 German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title. Again in 1936, the club moved into its newly constructed stadium, the [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]], a donation by local industrialist and patron [[Willy Sachs]].<ref name=\"Cicero\">{{cite web|title=Der braune Schatten|trans-title=The brown shadow|publisher=cicero.de|url=http://cicero.de/wirtschaft/der-braune-schatten/37229|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, FC 05 midfielders [[Albin Kitzinger]] and [[Andreas Kupfer|Andreas 'Ander' Kupfer]] became renowned in international football as they formed one of the best half-back duos in Europe. Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. In addition, an electronic [[scoreboard]] was contributed by Schweinfurt's [[Ball bearing|large]] industry.

At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931.

In the German football championship 1939 competition, Schweinfurt barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the first round of the 1942 German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]].

FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2.

The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. In addition, an electronic [[scoreboard]] was contributed by Schweinfurt's [[Ball bearing|large]] industry.

Grazing by the thousands of cattle that belong to the villagers are a threat. Livestock carry diseases like foot and mouth disease to the herbivores in the park. During the 1989-99 time period, [[rinderpest]] wiped out most of the [[Gaur]] population, which numbered more than a thousand, reducing the population to its present numbers. With proactive programs of inoculating local cattle, the population of Gaur is again on the rise.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nAnother concern due to closeness of the population is procurement of [[non-timber forest product]]s for commercial purposes and the procurement of timber for firewood. These affect the health of the forest in a long run. The other large threats are fishing and illegal poaching of wild animals.<ref name=yale>{{Citation| title = Forest use and human-wildlife conflicts in Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka, India|first = krithi|last = D karanth|accessdate = 2011-03-12| url = http://www.metaglyfix.com/gallery/Bulletin2003%20(linked).pdf#page=50}}</ref>\n\nManagement practices of the forest department are habitat improvement, boundary consolidation, protection against poaching and fires, and infrastructure development. However, operating funds are insufficient and often delayed and the sanctuary management is understaffed. There are problems with frequent fires which adversely affect the habitat and biodiversity of Bhadra. Timber smuggling of valuable trees is a big problem.<ref name=\"WPSI\"/>\n\nTunga-Bhadra Lift Irrigation Project promises to bring water to the rain shadow areas of Chikmagalur district by transferring water from the [[Tunga River]] to the [[Bhadra River]], however this poses a threat of disturbance to the natural habitat of Bhadra sanctuary.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mature Gaur (bison) at Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Bull gaur at Bhadra WLS\nFile:Bhadra Dam.png|Bhadra WLS located south of Bhadra dam\nImage:Chocolate pansy butterfiles mating in Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Lemon pansy butterflies\nFile:Blue winged Parakeet roost, Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary,Karnataka.JPG|Blue winged Malabar parakeet roost\nImage:Bhadra rainforest dk.JPG|A view of a Bhadra WLS\nImage:Ring necked parakeet pair at Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Rose ringed parakeet or common parrot at Bhadra WLS\nImage:River Tern nestling learning to fly on an island in the Bhadra reservoir in Chikkamagaluru district.jpg|River tern nestling learning to fly, Bhadra WLS\nImage:Baron butterfly at Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Common Baron butterfly at Bhadra WLS\nImage:Bhadra reservoir in Chikkamagaluru district.jpg|Bhadra Reservoir and River Tern Islands\nImage:Islands in the Bhadra reservoir.jpg|Bhadra Reservoir with River Tern Islands\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n9.

Grazing by the thousands of cattle that belong to the villagers are a threat. Livestock carry diseases like foot and mouth disease to the herbivores in the park. During the 1989-99 time period, [[rinderpest]] wiped out most of the [[Gaur]] population, which numbered more than a thousand, reducing the population to its present numbers. With proactive programs of inoculating local cattle, the population of Gaur is again on the rise.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nAnother concern due to closeness of the population is procurement of [[non-timber forest product]]s for commercial purposes and the procurement of timber for firewood. These affect the health of the forest in a long run. The other large threats are fishing and illegal poaching of wild animals.<ref name=yale>{{Citation| title = Forest use and human-wildlife conflicts in Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka, India|first = krithi|last = D karanth|accessdate = 2011-03-12| url = http://www.metaglyfix.com/gallery/Bulletin2003%20(linked).pdf#page=50}}</ref>\n\nManagement practices of the forest department are habitat improvement, boundary consolidation, protection against poaching and fires, and infrastructure development. However, operating funds are insufficient and often delayed and the sanctuary management is understaffed. There are problems with frequent fires which adversely affect the habitat and biodiversity of Bhadra. Timber smuggling of valuable trees is a big problem.<ref name=\"WPSI\"/>\n\nTunga-Bhadra Lift Irrigation Project promises to bring water to the rain shadow areas of Chikmagalur district by transferring water from the [[Tunga River]] to the [[Bhadra River]], however this poses a threat of disturbance to the natural habitat of Bhadra sanctuary.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mature Gaur (bison) at Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Bull gaur at Bhadra WLS\nFile:Bhadra Dam.png|Bhadra WLS located south of Bhadra dam\nImage:Chocolate pansy butterfiles mating in Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Lemon pansy butterflies\nFile:Blue winged Parakeet roost, Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary,Karnataka.JPG|Blue winged Malabar parakeet roost\nImage:Bhadra rainforest dk.JPG|A view of a Bhadra WLS\nImage:Ring necked parakeet pair at Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Rose ringed parakeet or common parrot at Bhadra WLS\nImage:River Tern nestling learning to fly on an island in the Bhadra reservoir in Chikkamagaluru district.jpg|River tern nestling learning to fly, Bhadra WLS\nImage:Baron butterfly at Bhadra wildlife sanctuary.jpg|Common Baron butterfly at Bhadra WLS\nImage:Bhadra reservoir in Chikkamagaluru district.jpg|Bhadra Reservoir and River Tern Islands\nImage:Islands in the Bhadra reservoir.jpg|Bhadra Reservoir with River Tern Islands\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n9.
