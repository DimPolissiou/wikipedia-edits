It is situated 30 km east of Negros Island, and 565 kilometers from [[Manila]]. \n\n==Campuses==\nThe SSC Main Campus has a total land area of 3.9 hectares and is located at Old Capitol Circle in Barangay North Poblaci\u00f3n, municipality of [[Larena]]. It has one satellite campus located in the town of [[Lazi, Siquijor]].\n\n==History==\nSiquijor State College was founded in 1920 by Lt. Governor Vicente Villanueva. It was then called as the '''Larena High School''' (LHS) that offered only the first and the second-year levels, one section per curriculum-year level with only two teachers including the principal and was under the supervision of the Negros Oriental Provincial High School (NOPHS) in [[Dumaguete City]].\n\nNine years later (1929), it operated as a complete [[secondary school]] and was renamed the '''Larena Sub-Provincial High School''' (LSPHS). On 01 July 1960, by virtue of Republic Act No. 2423, the school was converted into a [[vocational school]] offering the Secondary Trades Curriculum. This time the school was renamed '''Larena National Vocational School''' (LNVS). As the only vocational school in the province, it offered collegiate technical courses and evening opportunity classes.\n\nThe dream of the administration for the full conversion of the Larena National Vocational School into a college was realized when the National Assembly approved Batasang Pambansa Blg. 387 on 14 April 1983 and LNVS became the '''Larena National Vocational College''' (LNVC). Since this law authorized the offering of collegiate courses, the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE) and the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology (BSIT) were offered in 1985 and seven years after (1992) the Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering. In 1994, Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd), Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation, Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM) and the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) were offered. To cater to the needs of the employees in the province who had to cross the rough seas to attend, the college offered Graduate Programs in 1993 with two degrees; namely: the Master of Arts in Educational Management (MAEM) and the Master of Arts in Industrial Education (MAIE) and in 1997, the Master of Public Management (MPM).\n\nOn 03 March 1995, House Bill No. 402 was approved into law by his Excellency, President Fidel V. Ramos as Republic Act No. 7947 converted LNVC into the ''Siquijor State College (SSC)''. The conversion was made through the joint efforts of Hon. Orlando B. Fua Sr., Representative of the Lone District of [[Siquijor]], and Hon. Miguel Romero, Representative of the Second District of [[Negros Oriental]], and the Siquijodnons. Siquijor State College is authorized to offer courses in higher technological education leading to the degrees of bachelor of science in civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, electronics engineering, industrial engineering, education, forestry, fishery, nautical, physical and natural sciences, and such other collegiate and/or degree courses as may be approved by the Board of Trustees of the Siquijor State College, in addition to its present curricular offerings in the four-year secondary trade and general secondary curricula, two-year technical education curriculum, degree courses leading to the degrees in Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education and Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology. \n\nIn answer to the call for higher technology, additional courses were offered: Associate in Computer Science (1996), Bachelor of Science in Computer Technology (1999) and the Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology (2000). When Dr. Tan retired on 31 December 1999, Dr. Rosita T. Bidad, the Vice-President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) of the College was appointed by the Board of Trustees as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) until Dr. Dominador Q. Cabanganan was appointed as the second College President on 15 August 2000. He was re-appointed as College President effective 14 August 2004. \n\nA team of evaluators from the Commission on Higher Education Regional Office 7 (CHEDRO 7) headed by its Regional Director, Dr. Enrique P. Grecia together with Dr. Nenita V. Lapingcao, Dr. Perla D. Dalumpines, Dr. Pedro C. Fudolig, Dr. Josefino A. Ronquillo, Dr. Constantina A. Barbas, Dr. Dante D. Gabonillas and Dr. Ernesto K. Gemota came to SSC on 08 July 2004 to evaluate and monitor all the programs offered by the college benchmarking on some standards. Fortunately, SSC got a high rating practically in all programs especially on facilities, functional research and extension services, and the employability status of graduates in the College of Business and Management (CBM) that surpassed the 10% average return. \n\nOn 16-18 March 2005, a team of Accreditors from the Accrediting Agencies of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP came to SSC for a Preliminary Survey of the five programs that qualified for Level I (Candidate) namely, Master in Educational Management (MEM), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED), Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED), Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), and Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM). A team of assessors from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) headed by Sister Maria Myrna Concepcion of Region VI, Dr. Chloe Fe Abdulla of Region IX, Dr. Dave Cariaga of Butuan City and Ms. Rita Sescar, OPS-IQuaMe Technical Staff of CHED Central Office came to SSC on 13-16 December 2006 for the Institutional Quality Assurance Monitoring Evaluation (IQuaMe). Fortunately, the result of the assessment revealed that SSC passed Category B as applied for. \n\nOn 10 August 2006, the Lazi Skills Development Center (LSDC) was adopted by Siquijor State College and named as Siquijor State College-Lazi Campus through BOT Resolution No. 22, s. 2006 during the 43rd BOT Meeting held at Cebu Midtown Hotel, Cebu City. The Colleges of Teacher Education, Business and Management and the Graduate School granted Level I accreditation by the Accrediting Agencies of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP) on 16-19 March 2007.\n\nThe Civil Service Commission Regional Office VII granted Level II accreditation to SSC on 02 May 2007. This was the first of its kind in Central Visayas that an institution was given full autonomy to act on appointments for career and non-career positions under MC 11, s. 2005. The following month, SSC got Level II in the SUC Leveling on 21 June 2007 based on the DBM-CHED Joint Circular No. 1-B. With this new result, the school was already entitled to have two (2) Vice-Presidents in the Plantilla of Positions with a Salary Grade of 26. \n\nOn 17 March 2008, the following courses were approved to be offered effective school year 2008-2009: Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, Bachelor of Science in Development Communication, Bachelor of Science in Political Science, Bachelor of Arts, major in English, and Bachelor of Arts, major in Filipino through BOT Resolution No. 09 s. 2008. When Dr. Cabanganan retired from the service on 14 August 2008, he was bestowed by the Board of Trustees as [[Professor Emeritus]]. \n\nOn 21 August 2008, a new College President was elected by the Board of Trustees in the person of Dr. Baldomero R. Martinez, Jr. On 19 August 2013, Dr. Maria Imogen Tan-Quilicot assumed into office as the fourth and first woman college president. She was later renewed as College President on 22 October 2017 to the present. \n\nOn 14 March 2016, the College of Education became the Center of Development (COD) per CMO # 17 s. 2016 that would serve as a catalyst for world scholarships, best practices, innovative curricula, research and extension and professional development in Teacher Education programs. This success was through the collaborative efforts of the College President-Dr. Quilicot together with Dr. Sumaylo as VPAA and at the same time Dean of the College of Education, Mrs Santos as Assistant Dean, Faculty & Staff, students and stakeholders.\n\nOn 06 January 2020, the administration was reorganized. As a result, effective second semester of school year 2019-2020, the college is adopting the vertical alignment in terms of its program offerings. Through transforming SSC into Siquijor Province State University (SIPSU), SSC aims to continue broadening its horizons and discovering areas in which it can provide quality education. To this end, a task force will be set up to take responsibility for its transformation into a university. For this reason new courses for the next opening will be offered.\n\n==General Administration==\nThe College's government is vested in the Board of Trustees as stipulated in R.A. 8292. It passes rules and regulations, and sets policies as appropriate to run the College's affairs. The SSC Board of Trustees is composed of the Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education, or his/her designated representative from among the Commissioners, as the Board Chairperson. The Board of Trustees is the highest policy-making body trusted to accept rules and regulations that are not contrary to the country's established laws, so that the College can carry out its functions and operations.\n\nThe President of the college is the College's chief executive and serves as the Board of Trustees' Vice-Chairman. He/she exercises general management and oversight of all the activities and operations of the College, and of all its employees, faculty and non-teaching personnel, within the scope of current laws. The President of the college is assisted by the Vice-President for Administration and Finance as well as the Vice-President for Academic Affairs in terms of administrative, financial and academic matters.\n\nOther members of the Board of Trustees are: the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and Culture, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Higher and Technical Education, the Regional Director of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the Regional Director of the Science and Technology Department (DOST), the President of the SSC Faculty Association, President of the SSC Alumni Association, President of the Student Government and two prominent citizens of the Province of Siquijor who have distinguished themselves in their profession or specialization, as private sector representatives.\n\n==Maritime Education Program: Its Roots and Development==\nIn 1992, LNVC expanded its two-year Marine Engineering Technology (MET) course into a four-year program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering (BSMarE). The Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation (BSMT) was also offered two (2) years after in 1994. By means of RA No. 7947, by converting LNVC into a state college, Section 3 of that law authorizes SSC to operate maritime programs. As a result of this provision, SSC operated maritime programs without seeking a government permit issued by CHED. \n\nThe team of CHED Central Office evaluators arrived at Siquijor State College on 03 February 1998 to evaluate BSMT and BSMarE programs where BSMT got a point of 20.492 or 3.49 with a verbal description of Poorly Complied; while BSMarE got a point of 25.972 or 7.72 with a verbal description of Poorly Complied. On 21 October 2000, CHED Central Office reassessed the SSC maritime programs: BSMT and BSMarE received a rating of 76.76 and 76.45 percent, respectively, with a verbal description of Moderate Compliance, respectively. This means that the program will be phased out slowly. If however, the institution did not comply with CMO # 09 s. 1999 the program might be closed. \n\nIn 2004, the BSMT and BSMarE courses were shortened to a two year course, during the tenure of Dr. Cabanganan, in order to prevent technical CHED issues. This has resulted in lower MEP enrollment. As a result, poor parents were forced to continue studying in other schools with higher tuition fees for their children. On 16 June 2005, BOT Resolution No. 14, s. 2005 reaffirmed the maritime course offerings at SSC. During the 38th SSC BOT Meeting held at SSC, Larena, Siquijor the Ladderized Curriculum for Associate in Marine Engineering, leading to Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering and Associate in Marine Transportation, leading to Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation were approved. \n\nDuring the reign of Dr. Martinez in 2008, when he discovered that maritime programs were the dreamed courses of many parents, he revived both the BSMT and the BSMarE programs. Dr. Filemon P. Caroro was assigned as the Dean of the Maritime Department, who was then Vice-President for Administration and Finance and simultaneously Dean of the College of Technology. Later Capt. Margarito Sugabo became Dean because CHED required a seagoing full-time merchant officer to become a full-time Dean. \n\nOn 27 June 2010, Dr. Martinez facilitated the complete installation of the Integrated Bridge System (IBS) with Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) amounting to almost PhP 6M including its building renovation fully equipped with three (3) air-conditioned units. The IBS with GMDSS was composed of the following Instructor Station Console, Student Stations Console 1 and 2, GMDSS Instructor Station, GMDSS Student Stations 1 and 2, Koden RADAR DC Model MDS-52R, Nobeltic C Map admiral Max Pro with unlock code, Koden GPS Model KGP 913, Koden Echo Sounder, ICOM SSB Transreceiver Model IC 710, BNW HF Antenna, XAXERPA Weather Fax 2000 Software including USB/demodulator, 3 Channel visualization, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and RADAR/ARPA program capability with GMDSS. The Integrated Bridge System (IBS) with Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) was located at the Marine Engineering Laboratory Building adjacent to the SSC Guest House fronting the SSC Dormitory and Boys Trade Building at the Siquijor State College Main Campus, Larena, Siquijor. \n\nDr. Martinez noted that there was no permanent staff to manage the maritime programs because faculty members would only come and go when they returned to the maritime fleet and often merchant officers would no longer come back because they had already been employed by other maritime institutions with a higher pay. As he decided to apply for a government permit to conduct maritime programs, Dr. Roel D. Taroc-formerly Research Director was designated as Director for the Maritime Education Program  to run the Siquijor State College Maritime Education Program (SSC-MEP) on 15 October 2010 through Office Order No. 27 s. 2010. In addition, Capt. Margarito S. Sugabo was designated Acting Dean and later Capt. Samuel M. Daug took over as OIC Dean/BSMT Chair when the former returned to his shipping company. \n\nOn 21-22 October 2010, a team from the Office of Programs and Standards (OPS), in particular the Maritime Education Unit (MEU) of the Central Office of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) came to the SSC to conduct a monitoring and evaluation on the Nine (9) Areas of Evaluation on the existing course offerings of the SSC-MEP as one of the procedures in complying with the requirements of the International Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) '78, as amended in applying for the Permit Status for the courses namely: Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation (BSMT) and Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering (BSMarE) as stipulated in CMO #13, s. 2005. The Nine (9) Areas of Evaluation were as follows: Administration, Faculty, Physical Facilities, Laboratory Equipment, Library Holdings, Shipboard Training, Research and Development, Extension Services and Quality Standard System (QSS). Of the nine areas of evaluation only one area was complied that was on Physical Facilities. Due to this result, on 10 November 2010, a Matrix Plan was submitted to the OPS-MEU expressing its intention to comply with all the provisions of the STCW '78 as amended so that previous SSC graduates would be allowed to take the PRC Examination since SSC was has no government permit yet. \n\nOn 22 November 2010, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was drafted and in turn submitted to CHED Central Office on 03 December 2010 for approval. This MOA was between the University of Cebu-Maritime Education and Training Center (UC-METC) in Cebu City, a duly organized educational institution and duly authorized accredited Maritime Training Center in Central Visayas to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the required Basic Safety Courses in Fire Fighting and Fire Prevention, Medical Emergency, Personal Survival and Personal Safety and Social Responsibility (PSSSR), among other upgrading courses; and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses, in their desire to comply with curriculum requirements of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in its STCW 1995 and pursuant to the objectives of LOI 538, in improving the acceptability of Filipino Seafarers for employment on board vessels in domestic and foreign. \n\nMeanwhile, the Extension Activities of the SSC-MEP Re: Coastal Clean-up and Mangrove Planting were conducted on 27 November 2010. These activities were in collaboration with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), LGU-Larena headed by its Mayor, Sangguniang Bayan members of Larena and Barangay Council of Sandugan, Larena, Siquijor. \n\nSSC-MEP sent participants for the first time after reviving the maritime programs to attended the 36th PAMI (Philippine Association of Maritime Institutions) Annual Convention and General Assembly on 03-04 December 2010 that ensured the success of the event in pursuing its theme, \u201cPAMI: Meeting the Challenge of Global Standards in Maritime Education.\u201d This was hosted by the Mariners\u2019 Polytechnic Colleges Foundation (MPCF) Rawis, Legazpi City, Albay with Hon. Patricia B. Licuanan, Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker. \n\nIn order to provide for a functional Research & Development Program of the SSC Maritime Education Programs, a List of Research Studies to be undertaken was approved by the College President for its implementation based on the time frame. Hence, the Proposal Hearing was conducted on 16 December 2010 at the SSC Audio Visual Room. The Examining Tribunal was composed of Dr. Baldomero R. Martinez, Jr. as Chairman with Dr. Maria T. Jumawan, Dr. Vergie B. Miquiabas and Dr. Rosalina E. Catid as members. The Final Presentation was scheduled on 16 March 2011. \n\nWith the management of Dr. Taroc in the SSC-MEP, he was able to initiate and facilitate the conduct of the Training Course for Instructors (IMO Model Course 6.09) for Maritime Instructors and Trainers from 20-24 December 2010 and 17-21 January 2011 held at the SSC Audio-Visual Room. This was conducted by the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines with twenty-three (23) SSC-MEP faculty-trainees. This training course was in accordance with MTC Resolution # 3 s. 1996 and with CHED Memorandum Order # 13 s. 2005 Article VII Sections 19 and 20 and in compliance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended pursuant to Regulation I/6 and Section A-I/6. \n\nDr. Taroc successfully coordinated with Dr. Rodolfo P. Ceballos, the Graduate School Extension Coordinator of the John B. Lacson Foundation Maritime University (Arevalo), Inc., M. H. del Pilar St., Molo, Iloilo City on 04 January 2011 to facilitate the enrollment procedure of the Maritime Faculty Instructors to the different programs. In answer to the needs of an ever dynamic maritime environment and in response to the challenge of producing globally competitive seafarers, managers of maritime institutions and leaders in maritime education, the Graduate School of JBLFU (Arevalo) has established continually evolving and dynamic curricular programs. Consequently, twelve (12) of the Maritime Faculty members filled out the enrollment forms categorized as follows: 0ne (1) to pursue leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maritime Education (Ph.D.M.E.) major in Curriculum Assessment, five (5) to pursue Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) major in Teaching Competency, three (3) to pursue Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) major in Administration and Supervision, one (1) to pursue Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) major in English Language Teaching, one (1) to pursue Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) major in Social Studies Teaching, one (1) to pursue Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) major in Science Teaching, and two (2) to pursue Bridging Program in Maritime Education. \n\nOn 15 February 2011, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between Orlines Sea-Land Transport, Inc. and SSC. This MOA was intended for the conduct of the Shipboard Training of SSC cadets since the two maritime courses offered at SSC require a twelve (12)-month on board apprenticeship as a pre-requisite for graduation. Moreover, two (2) of the SSC-MEP Professional Faculty members were able upgrade their associate courses to baccalaureate degrees. On 12 April 2011, Capt. Daug successfully completed the BSMT course via the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) at John B. Lacson Foundation Maritime University (Arevalo), Inc., M. H. del Pilar St., Molo, Iloilo City. Conversely, Engr. Gilbert P. Sumalpong successfully completed the BSMarE course via ETEEAP from the University of the Visayas, Cebu City on 18 March 1999. Capt. Valdez, who had completed the Associate in Marine Transportation Course, also enrolled in ETEEAP offered by the John B. Lacson Foundation Maritime University (Arevalo), Inc., M. H. Del Pilar St., Molo, Iloilo City and finished in April 2013.\n\nIn compliance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended pursuant to regulation 1/6 and section A-1/6, Siquijor State College sent two (2) participants to attend the Training Course on Assessment, Examination and Certification of Seafarers (IMO Model Course 3.12) from 25 April to 06 May 2011 at the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP), Sen. Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City. This training course was in accordance with MTC Resolution #3 s. 1996 and with CHED Memorandum order #13 s. 2005 Article VII Sections 19 and 20. The SSC-MEP participants were as follows: Dr. Roel D. Taroc, Director for Maritime Education Program (elected President, MC 3.12, Batch 2-2011) and Capt. Samuel M. Daug, OIC Dean/BSMT Chair of SSC-MEP. Two (2) of the SSC-MEP Faculty members attended the Basic Safety Courses in Fire Fighting and Fire Prevention, Medical Emergency, Personal Survival and Personal Safety and Social Responsibility (PSSSR) at the University of Cebu-Maritime Education and Training Center (UC-METC) in Cebu City on 25 April to 01 May 2011. The faculty members were as follows: Mr. Ricky C. Jumawan, Persman Instructor and Mr. Herculanito M. Miquiabas, PE 1 & 2 Instructor. Five (5) of the SSC-MEP Faculty members attended the following training courses at the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines: Mrs. Philna S. Palongpalong-Training Course for Instructors (IMO Model Course 6.09) from 25 April 25 to 06 May 2011; Mr. Meynardo C. Aso-Marine Refrigeration/Air Conditioning (MRAC) from 25-29 April 2011; Mr. Ronald Alexis M. Tan and Mrs. Renee G. Sedigo-Medical Emergency First Aid (MEFA) and Baisc Safety Training (BST) from 04-06 May 2011 and 09-20 May 2011, respectively; Miss Rhea T. Bidad-Consolidated MARPOL 73/78 Annexes I-IV and Maritime Law (MarLaw) from 16-20 May 2011 and 23-27 May 2011, respectively. \n\nAnother MOA was signed between Carlos A. Gothong Lines, Inc. in Cebu City and SSC on 12 August 2011 for the conduct of the Shipboard Training of SSC cadets. Moreover, one (1) of the SSC-MEP Faculty members attended the Training Course for Instructors (IMO Model Course 3.12) from 07 to 18 November 2011 at the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines to wit: Capt. Margarito S. Sugabo-Acting Dean of SSC-MEP. \n\nThree (3) of the SSC-MEP Faculty members successfully finished the course in Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) at John B. Lacson Foundation Maritime University (Arevalo), Inc., M. H. del Pilar St., Molo, Iloilo City on 13 April 2012: They were as follows: Engr. Hermilita L. Paculba (major in Science Teaching), Miss Rhea T. Bidad (major in Social Studies Teaching), and Mrs. Jonalyn L. Fuentes (major in English Language Teaching). Dr. Taroc decided to enroll the course leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maritime Education (Ph.D.M.E.) major in Curriculum Assessment in Summer 2012 at John B. Lacson Foundation Maritime University (Arevalo), Inc., M. H. del Pilar St., Molo, Iloilo City so that extension classes in Master in Maritime Education would be held in SSC so as to economize expenses of the maritime faculty. As a result, the following instructors finished the course in Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) major in Administration and Supervision in Summer 2012 to wit: Capt. Margarito S. Sugabo, Capt. Samuel M. Daug, Engr. Gilbert P. Sumalpong, and Mr. Ronald Alexis M. Tan. However, Mr. Tan continued his studies leading to the degree of Master in Maritime Education major in Science Teaching for his vertical alignment being a Physical Therapist Registered, Philippines (PTRP). \n\nOn 19 September 2012, SSC-MEP purchased the Engine Room Simulator ERS 5000 amounting to PhP 7M complete with accessories with an original license of the software including its Rehabilitation of the Existing Bridge Deck Simulator making both compatible. This was supplied by the Safety Utilities for Maritime and Computer Systems, Inc. (SUMACS) located at 5th Floor, Room 507 Victoria Bldg., 429 United Nation Avenue, Ermita, Manila. The ERS 5000 was specifically designed for the education, training and assessment of competence of engine department personnel including the engineer officer in charge of watch, senior engineering staff and ratings forming part of engineering watch. It covered the essential areas of maritime training in full compliance with the STCW \u201895 requirements, designed to meet the requirements of IMO conventions and Resolutions and IEC standards, approved by DNV (as per Standard for Certification of Maritime Simulators No. 2.14 October 2007). It has flexible solutions re: computer based training (SOLO), networked classes and full mission simulator. \n\nOn 22 October 2012, SSC-MEP purchased Two (2) units 20-kW with KVA or smaller 3-phase 50 Hz Marine Generating sets and One (1) unit Synchronizing Panel Board with Standard Marine Accessories amounting to PhP 795, 000.00 with complete accessories as follows: 4 strokes cycle engine, cylinder at 1500-1800 rpm, air start with air bottle for starting, cooling system, sea water coolant (preferably reconditioned) with brand new generator. The Panel Board included supply of labor and materials needed for the installation, training of personnel for the operation and maintenance with manual of operation where warranty and delivery was free of charge. This was supplied by the Cebu Diesel Supply, Cebu City. Likewise purchased the 10 BHP CIMECH Bolier, horizontal type on 23 November 2012 amounting to PhP 680, 000.00 with complete accessories as follows: Steam Boiler and Burner, Feedwater Tank, Fuel Day Tank, Feedwater Pump, Control Panel, Smokestack, Heat Exchanger, Cooling Tower, Installation of and Piping within Boiler Testing and Commissioning, permits fabrication from DOLE with One (1) Year Warranty after Testing and Commissioning. This was supplied by CIMECH Systems Construction Inc., Novaliches, Caloocan City. \n\nCapt. Valdez was designated as STO Chair effective 30 October 2012 with Engr. Sumalpong as Co-Chair-STO at the same time Assistant Head of the Engine Department. Capt. Daug, Acting Dean of MEP attended the Training Course for Simulator Instructors and Assessors (IMO Model Course 6.10) for Maritime Instructors and Assessors conducting Simulator Based Training and Assessment conducted from 26 November to 01 December 2012 held at the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines. This training course was in accordance with Sec. 12 of MTC Resolution # 5 s. 2010 and with CHED Memorandum Order # 13 s. 2005 Article VII Section 20.5 and in compliance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended pursuant to Regulation I/6 and Section A-I/6 paragraph 4.3. Furthermore, two (2) of the SSC-MEP Faculty members attended the Training Course for Instructors (IMO Model Course 3.12) from 03 to 14 December 2012 at the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines namely, Capt. Valdez and Engr. Sumalpong. \n\nOn 14-15 February 2013, a team from the Office of Programs and Standards (OPS) particularly the Maritime Education Unit (MEU) of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Central Office came to Siquijor State College again to determine the extent of compliance with the requirements of the International Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) \u201978, as amended. The team of evaluators was composed of the following: Capt. Eutiquio Reyes, Jr. (External Assessor), Chief Engineer John Buendia (External Assessor), Mr. Dante D. Cabunilas (CHEDRO VII), Mr. Jaginder Delina (OPS-MEU), and Engr. Sherwin C. Revereza as Team Leader. Out of nine areas, all areas were complied for both programs. SSC-MEP was supposed to be issued a permit status for operating maritime programs at this time based on CMO #13 s. 2005. However, its issuance of CHED's permit was overshadowed when a new guideline came out using an Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) Instrument. To this effect, all MHEIs would be subjected for a monitoring and evaluation using the said instrument. Drastically, all requirements were changed especially on the area of facilities and equipment, many were added on the previous listings. \n\nDuring the leadership of President Martinez, there was a tremendous increase in the SSC-MEP enrollment. It means that during his term as College President, it was very evident that he had supported the Maritime Education Program to comply the requirements mandated by CHED. He moved heaven and earth for its full compliance. This was his legacy of reviving the Maritime education Program. This was continued however during the reign of the fourth and first woman president-Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot. \n\nOn 27-28 May 2014, a Joint CHED-MARINA Monitoring and Evaluation using Outcomes-Based Education Team came to Siquijor State College to verify the continued compliance with the pertinent standards or degree of deviation from expected norms in the operation of BSMT and BSMarE programs. This monitoring and evaluation likewise ensured that defined program objectives in accordance with the STCW prescribed standards of competence were achieved. The team of evaluators was composed of the following: Capt. Danilo Arevalo and Chief Engineer Ferdinand Pascua as Technical Experts, Mr. Samuel Batalla and John Guardaya (Observer) from MARINA Central Office, Dr. Josefino Ronquillo (CHEDRO VII), and Engr. Sherwin C. Revereza (OPS-MEU) as Team Leader. Out of eleven areas, only two areas (I & IV) were fully complied. SSC-MEP got 8 Minor Nonconformance\u2019s (mNCs) from the following Areas to wit: Area II-Organization, Management, and Support (1mNC); Area III-Curriculum (1mNC); Area V-Examination and Assessment System (1mNC); Area VI-Staff on Instructors and Assessors (1mNC and 1 Observation); VIII-Onboard Training (1mNC); Area IX-Facilities and Equipment (2mNCs and 3 Observations); Area X-Research and Development (1mNC) and Area XI-Extension Services (1 Observation). To undertake corrective action for MINOR NCs-reasonable period this shall not exceed three (3) months, while OBSERVATIONS were to be addressed within a period of one (1) year.\n\nOn 12 March 2015, a CHED Memorandum from the Chairperson was issued pertaining to the conversion of BS Maritime Education Programs to the Enhanced Support Level Programs. These programs are especially designed to take into consideration the value added to the training of active Filipino seafarers-i.e. their exposure to general education and technical courses at the college level-in addition to compliance with the STCW requirements for certification as Ratings Forming Part of a Watch and Ratings as Able Seafarer. The programs aim to enhance the competitiveness of Filipino seafarers in the international maritime industry as they perform support level functions and responsibilities at the deck and engine departments of seagoing ships. For the deck department, the program shall be called the Enhanced Support Level Program for Marine Deck (ESLPMD) and Enhanced Support Level Program for Marine Engineering (ESLPME) for the engine department. In this memorandum, it was clarified that in order to address the concerns of the MHEIs that converted their BS programs into ESLP, they might continue to offer the BS programs to their incoming 2nd year, 3rd year and 4th year students. However, they were strongly urged to give students who prefer to work as ratings at the soonest possible time the freedom to shift to the ESLP (while crediting the courses they have taken). Moreover, even if they were not allowed to admit first year applicants, MHEIs were still expected to hone the competencies required of their 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students. Eventually, MARINA-STCW Office released the list of MHEIs that have expressed their interest to offer ratings (deck) and ratings (engine) programs where SSC was one of the recognized MHEIs to offer ESLP. \n\nOn 24 April 2015, a letter was submitted to CHED by SSC-MEP re: Corrective Action Report on the Minor Non-Conformances (mNCs) during the Joint CHED-MARINA Monitoring and Evaluation on 27-29 May 2014 presented in a Matrix Action Plan; ESLP Curriculum for Marine Deck (ESLPMD) and ESLP Curriculum for Marine Engineering (ESLPME) with \u201cTrack A\u201d and \u201cTrack B\u201d effective First Semester, School Year 2015-2016 per STCW Circular 2014-7; Revised BSMT and BSMarE Curricula for Second, Third, and Fourth Year Students, effective Second Semester, SY 2013-2014 per CMO # 31 & 32 s. 2013. On 19 June 2015, Hon. Maria Cynthia Rose B. Bautista- Oversight Commissioner for Maritime Education acknowledged receipt of the documents submitted by SSC-MEP for the Enhanced Support Level Program (ESLP) for Marine Deck and Engine to be offered first semester of Academic Year 2015-2016. Starting this time, SSC strictly followed the order from CHED not to accept first year applicants for BSMT and BSMarE programs until further notice. \n\nOn 10 July 2015, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was renewed between Cebu Reliable and Excellent Seafarers Training Center (CREST) with principal office at 4th Floor DG3 Corporation Bldg., 72 N Escario St., Capitol Site, Cebu City, a duly organized Maritime Education and Training provider duly accredited by the Maritime Training Council and duly certified by AJA Registrars, Inc to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the required Basic Safety Courses (Personal Survival Techniques, Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting, Elementary First Aid, and Personal Safety and Social Responsibility), Ratings Forming Part of a Navigational Watch serving seagoing ship of 500 gross tonnage, Ratings Forming Part of a Watch in a Manned Engine-Room or Designated to Perform Duties in a Periodically Unmanned Engine-Room, Proficiency in Survival Craft  and Rescue Boats other than Fast Rescue Boat (PSCRB), Advanced Fire Fighting (AFF), and Medical First Aid (MFA); and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses. The first MOA was signed on 28 September 2012.\n\nLikewise on 22 July 2015,  a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was renewed between Philasia Maritime Services Training Center, Inc. with principal office at 2nd Floor, Cebu Lioc Kui Bldg., #6 J. L. Briones Avenue, North Reclamation, Cebu City, a duly recognized Maritime Training provider duly accredited by the Maritime Training Council and duly accredited by Bureau Veritas to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the required Basic Safety Courses (Personal Survival Techniques, Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting, Elementary First Aid, and Personal Safety and Social Responsibility), Ratings Forming Part of a Navigational Watch (RFPNW), Ratings Forming Part of a Engineering Watch (RFPEW), Deck Watchkeeping, Engine Watchkeeping, Ship Security Awareness Training and Seafarer\u2019s with Designated Security Duties (SSAT-SDSD), Crowd and Crisis Management of Personnel Serving on Board Domestic Roro/Passenger/Cargo Passenger Ships, and Medical Emergency First Aid (MEFA); and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses. The first MOA was signed on 30 October 2014.\n\nOn 10 February 2016, SSC-MEP celebrated World Seafarers Day for the remaining students, in appreciation of the special and all too often ignored contribution to the public's well-being, to 1.5 million sailors worldwide. The Day of the Seafarers also offered the public an opportunity to learn about modern seafarers' problems as piracy. However, the most important thing was the occasion to say \u201cThank you, Seafarers.\u201d  The Ring Hop of the Third year BSMT and BSMarE ceremony and the ESLPMD and ESLPME students were highlighted. The affair was held at the Siquijor State College Gymnasium with Chief Engineer Nelson Ramirez, President of United Filipino Seafarers and Executive Editor & Founder of Tinig Marino of Ermita, Manila as Guest of Honor. It was participated in by SSC-MEP students, faculty and parents.\n\nIn addition, SSC-MEP availed for the first time the MARINA Mobile Processing of Seafarers Identification Record Book (SIRB) on 21 April 2016.  The Regional Office of Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) 7 headed by Ms. Remedios Cadungog, Engr. Jeff Badon and Mr Manuelito facilitated the undertaking. The mobile processing carried out by MARINA was used by 80 students.\n\nOn 08 August 2016, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between Oceanwide Maritime Services Corp., (OMSC), a Maritime Training Institution duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission No. CS201227376 and operating with the authority of the STCW office MARINA, with principal office at Room 307, 3rd Floor, Kang Ha Bldg., Osme\u00f1a St. Corner Lapu-Lapu St., Cebu City to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the following courses: Safe Navigation & Collision Regulation, Deck Watchkeeping in the Domestic Trade, Engine Watchkeeping in the Domestic Trade, ISM Code Familiarization; and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses.\n\nThe World Seafarers Day was celebrated again on 17 March 2017. The affair started with the Street Parade and Pass and Review. This event was highlighted by the Ring Hop Ceremony of the last batch of BSMT and BSMarE students with the Bon Voyage Ceremony of ESLPMD and ESLPME students. The invited guests included Capt. Emerico Gepilano, President and Founder of the CREST Review, Assessment and Training Center as Keynote Speaker and Chief Engineer Nikias Antonio Calledo as Guest of Honor. SSC-MEP students, faculty and parents also witnessed the event. \n\nIn view of the full implementation of the Senior High School-Maritime Program (SHS-MP) under the new basic education structure of the Department of Education (DepEd) which is the K to 12 Program, all concerned were hereby informed that effective 01 October 2017, the implementation of the Enhanced Support Level Program (ESLP) for Marine Deck and Marine Engineering was hereby suspended/terminated per STCW Advisory No. 2017-14. All MHEIs offering ESLP were hereby directed to cease and desist from accepting new or first year students under ESLP. Students who were currently enrolled and were already taken up the ESLP prior to 01 October 2017 shall be allowed to complete the academic requirements of the said program until 31 May 2019 and earned the required seagoing service not later than 31 December 2020 in order to be considered by MARINA for certification as Ratings Forming Part of a watch under STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, subject to compliance with all other requirements thereof. \n\nOn 15 December 2017, SSC-MEP sent a further letter of appeal to the CHED Central Office with supporting documents, which reiterated that the maritime programs had to be re-evaluated. To SSC-MEP's surprise, a result of the Documentary Analysis made by the Chair/members of the joint CHED-Technical Committee for Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering with inputs from the OPSD-Division of Programs with International Convention (DPIC) was released on 30 January 2018. The supporting documents attached to the letter of appeal were the ones evaluated by them. The evaluation of documents was actually conducted on 11-12 January 2018 headed by the CHED-Technical Committee for Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering composed of the following: For Marine Transportation: Capt. Michael S. Caris, Capt Luis Evidente; and for Marine Engineering: C/E Wilson P. Travi\u00f1a as Chair with Dr. Felicito P. Dalageute and Engr. Felix M. Oca as members. \n\nMoreover, the CHED-Technical Committee members were supported by the following CHED Personnel headed by Ms. Eleanor BA, Fernandez, Chief, Division of Programs with International Convention with the assistance of Ms. Elsa G. Florendo, Chief, Non-Conventional Higher Education Division (NHD), Mr. Roland Ni\u00f1o L. Agoncillo-Asst. Chief of NHD and Mutya L. Mangubat-EPS II, DPIC. The initial deficiencies noted on the documents submitted were indicated in the attached instruments for documentary analysis. Unlike other MHEIs, SSC has not been provided with tools for documentary analysis: Instrument I: Documentary Analysis (General Requirements), Instrument II: Documentary Analysis (Specific Requirements for Discipline), only the supporting documents attached to the letter of appeal have been assessed. However, SSC-MEP was never discouraged from complying instead with the initial deficiencies noted and was able to meet the deadline for submission of the required documents by CHED-OPSD on 15 February 2018. \n\nOn 15 May 2018, the CHED Evaluation Team headed by C/M Renante A. Garcia-CHED Technical Panel for Marine Transportation with C/E Charlie M. Pandongan-CHED Technical Panel for Marine Engineering, Mr. Richie S. De la Rosa-Education Program Specialist II of MEU, DPIC, OPSD-CHED Central Office and Dr. Dante D. Cabunilas-Supervisor-in-Charge of Maritime Education, CHEDRO 7 came to SSC to conduct an ocular visit of its application to operate maritime programs. The following deficiencies were noted: 1) No proof to show records of validation, testing of scenarios for both deck and engine department; 2) Only 3 chart tables were working; 3) Only 9 vises attached to work bench; 4) Chart room lacks 1 set of gnomonic, 1 set of Mercator plotting sheet from equator to 90 degrees latitude (9 degrees to 45 degrees available) and routing chart; 5) Navigation equipment was found to have defective pelorous/azimuth circle and signaling lamp and lacks international signal flags and morse light (simulator); 6) Marcom room lacks International Radio Laws (ITU) Part I and II, outdated Admiralty List of Radio Signals (Vol. I & II), outdated International Code of Signals, defective morse signaling apparatus, lacks semaphore flags and lacks single letter flags; 7) Seamanship room lacks hand scraper (angular), thread for canvass, computer based software on trim and stability, ship certificates (e.g. SOLAS etc.) and the anchor with chains have no markings; 8) Machine shop lacks inside micrometers, I unit pedestal grinder, washing facility, die nuts, and protractor (steel); 9) Auxiliary machinery lacks reciprocating driven pump; 10) Steam plant lacks boiler water test kit; 11) Refrigeration lacks expansion valves, open type refrigerating compressor (complete), thermostat, and pressure switch; 12) Electro technology lacks electrical training module for AC Circuits, electronic training module, motor control module, analog multi-tester, insulation tester, digital clamp meter, and live line tester; and 13) Automation lacks process simulator that contains process to be controlled, process transmitter/sensor, controller (PID, PI, PD), correcting elements/final control elements, thermistor, 100 ohm resistance bulb, U-tube manometer, and transmitters (pneumatic and electric). \n\nOn 29 May 2018, the CHED Commission en banc '' '''disapproved''' '' the SSC\u2019s application to operate the BSMT and BSMarE programs effective Academic Year 2018-2019. As such, SSC cannot accept enrollees into the said programs. In view of this, a letter of appeal was sent to CHED Commission en banc on 19 June 2018 that SSC would be given a chance to comply the deficiencies noted during the CHED Evaluation Team. \n\nOn 17 August 2018, another letter of appeal submitted to CHED for Re-Evaluation/Revisit SSC in connection with its application for government permit to operate maritime programs. SSC moved heaven and earth to comply the noted deficiencies noted on the previous CHED\u2019s Team evaluation. The efforts made by the SSC Faculty, Staff, Students, Alumni, Parents and Stakeholders to purchase such equipment and facilities were enough reasons for the offering of the maritime programs. In fact, the money used to purchase such equipment and facilities were donations to SSC from the SSC Alumni Association (PhP 900,000.00), and the Parents, Faculty and Students Association (PhP 250,000.00). \n\nOn 18 August 2018, a letter was received from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) through its OIC Chair, J. Prospero E. De Vera informing SSC that CHED and MARINA had an ongoing discussion regarding the implementation of the STCW Convention 1978 as amended. The discussion included the administration and supervision of maritime higher education institutions (MHEIs) including the reconstitution of the Technical Panel for Maritime Education (TPME). The CHED-MARINA discussion and agreements would be consolidated into an Executive Order to be signed by the President. In this regard, the processing of the SSC\u2019s appeal on the application to operate BSMT and BSMarE programs would be held in abeyance until the Executive Order (EO) had been finalized by CHED and MARINA and the TPME would be reconstituted and meet for this purpose. \n\nOn 21 September 2018, His Excellency, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, signed the Executive Order No. 63, \u201cFurther strengthening the Authority of the Maritime Industry Authority as the Single Maritime Administration for the Purpose of Implementing the 1978 International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, as Amended.\u201d To cite, Section 2 of this EO, the MARINA shall take the lead in the evaluation of requests of the following maritime education programs: BSMT, BSMarE, and other higher education programs that may be developed in the future which would require compliance with the STCW Convention. Moreover, the MARINA in coordination with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) shall evaluate and inspect all maritime higher education institutions to ensure that the maritime education programs being offered by said institutions comply with the minimum standards set under the STCW Convention.\n\nUpon the recommendation of the Technical Panel for Maritime Education, the Commission en banc during its meeting on 19 March 2019 '' '''approved''' '' the re-evaluation of the SSC\u2019s application to determine its eligibility to offer the BSMT and BSMarE programs for Academic Year 2019-2020. Consequently, the CHED Evaluation Team conducted the re-evaluation on 10-11 June 2019 to determine the SSC\u2019s compliance requirements of the existing policies, standards and guidelines (PSGs) and other rules and regulations relative to offer BSMT and BSMarE programs. \n\nConsequently on 31 July 2019, upon the recommendation of the Technical Panel for Maritime Education (TPME) and upon its discussion and agreement, the Commission en banc '' '''granted''' '' the SSC\u2019s request for reconsideration for the issuance of Government Permit to operate the first-year and second-year levels of BSMT and BSMarE programs effective Academic Year 2019-2020 in accordance with CMO Nos. 67, 70 and 71 series of 2017, without prejudice to evaluation/inspection and monitoring in accordance with the Joint CHED-MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 1, series of 2019. Relative to this, the Certificates of Government Permit would be issued by CHED to SSC. \n\nOn '' '''11 September 2019,''' '' in accordance with the pertinent provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 77222, otherwise known as the \u201cHigher Education Act of 1994,\u201d and virtue of Resolution No. 462-2019, of the Commission, the '' '''Government Permit (GP)''' '' was hereby '' '''granted''' '' to Siquijor State College, Larena, Siquijor to operate and conduct the '' '''First and Second Year Levels''' '' of the Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering and the Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation programs, respectively. This GP, however, would be valid effective Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 and shall be subjected to revocation if herein grantee fails to operate in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines and/or fails to maintain the prescribed standards of instruction and/or fails to comply with the rules and regulations pertaining to the organization, administration and supervision of private/public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines. This GP does not extend to any branch of the grantee, whether located in the same place or elsewhere. \n\nOn 19-22 November 2020, the Joint CHED-MARINA Evaluation/Inspection Team came to SSC to conduct evaluation/inspection in determining its compliance requirements of the Joint CHED-MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 1 series of 2019 or the \u201cPolicies, Standards and Guidelines (PSGs) for the Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation and Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering Programs\u201d. The team was headed Ms. Ma. Elizabeth I. Tejuco with C/E Jonathn A. Seguritan, Ms. Nora R. Acedera, Ms. Teresa V. Tulio, Capt. Danilo G. Arevalo-CHED Technical Evaluator, and Dr. Sotera C. Cagang-CHED Evaluator. \n\nDr. Taroc was named as the Acting Vice-President for Academic Affairs on 06 January 2020, and already has a broad range of functions with regards to the implementation of the educational policies and programs of the institution in terms of quality control, accreditation and adherence with CHED and MARINA requirements. He is responsible for the design, implementation and evaluation of educational initiatives and programs. \n\nOn 13 January 2020, PAMI appreciated the support given by SSC by sending representatives to attend and participate in all Association\u2019s workshops in the development of uniformed course syllabi. SSC was congratulated further for achieving the permit status from MARINA and CHED to be eligible in accepting 1st year enrollees in the BSMT and BSMarE Programs for Academic Year 2019-2020. In the meantime, PAMI reiterated its desire to invite Dr. Taroc as a member of the Philippine Association of Maritime Institutions (PAMI)'s Course Program Development Committee for Assessment (PCDC), which considers that the input of Dr Taroc will make such a significant contribution to improving maritime education. While PAMI invited Dr. Taroc on 28 July 2018 to join the Committee, President Quilicot declined the invitation, as SSC had no BSMT and BSMarE offerings yet at that time. Dr. Taroc finally received the College President's permission on 04 February 2020 to be a Member of the Committee spearheaded by Engr. Felix M. Oca-PAMI President. \n\nCurrently, Dr. Roel D. Taroc as MEP Director together with Engr. Gilbert P. Sumalpong as Dean and at the same time Head of the Engine Department are working hard to attain its '' '''Recognition Permit Status.''' '' It is expected therefore that anytime this year, SSC-MEP will be evaluated for its compliance to operate and conduct the '' '''Third and Fourth Year Levels''' '' of the BSMT and BSMarE programs. Assisting SSC-MEP in preparation for the evaluation and monitoring are Capt. Bertrand Y. Valdez as Head of the Deck Department and Assessor of the BSMT Classes as well as 2/E Hilario B. Ongue as On Board Training (OBT) Supervisor and Assessor of BSMarE classes. Moreover, the OBT staff and the Extension Chair, Bosun Arnold B. Apiag shall work hand-hand with Mr. John Anthony Y. Jimenez as the Student Placement Coordinator. In addition, Engr. Hermilita L. Paculba as Research Chair and at the same time Document Controller (DC) with Jonalyn L. Fuentes as the Internal Communication Officer (ICO) shall also prepare the necessary documents needed. To complete the Maritime Education Program set-up, the following personnel will also take part in this endeavor to wit: Mr. Ronald Alexis M. Tan as Laboratory Safety Officer, Mrs. Michelle M. Dagohoy as Laboratory Manager, Engr. Bryanpete R. Tabada as Calibration Officer, Engr. Victor B. Petere as Electro-Technology Laboratory-in-Charge, Mr. Masay T. Degrano as facilitator of MaShop with Mr. Limuel C. Salindo, as assistant facilitator of MaShop.\n\n==ISO Certification==\nDr. Roel D. Taroc was designated as Quality Management Representative (QMR) by President Martinez to take the lead in ISO certification on 26 October 2010 through Office Order No. 30 s. 2010. One of the main findings of the CHED monitoring and evaluation team on 21-22 October 2010 was that the Quality Management System (QMS) was not yet ISO Certified, which was a key requirement as set out in Annex IV of CMO # 13, series of 2005. It therefore invited Bersales Consultancy to take the lead in establishing, recording and implementing a QMS based on ISO 9001:2008 International Standard and its training criteria.\n\nSSC-MEP manifested its desire in T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines Inc. for the Management System Certification on 24 November 2010. T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines is a subsidiary of T\u00dcV S\u00dcD Management Service GmbH, the largest T\u00dcV S\u00dcD group. Every maritime school shall have a certified quality standards system in accordance with the provisions of the Rules for a Quality Standards System in Maritime Academies as contained in Annex IV of CMO # 13, s. 2005.\n\nOn 07-08 January 2011, SSC-MEP conducted a Seminar-Workshop on QMS Documentation and Training Course on ISO 9001:2008 at the SSC Function Room. The resource person was the SSC-MEP ISO Consultant-Engr. Luther D. Bersales, an ISO Management System Consultant and trainer of the Bersales Consultancy, MMB Compound, Kinalumsan Road, Canjulao, Lapu-lapu City.\n\nDr. Taroc recommended to the SUC President II of Siquijor State College the implementation of the Executive Order (EO) No. 605, \u201cInstitutionalizing the Structure, Mechanisms and Standards to implement the Government Quality Management Program on 8 March 2011. The said EO directs all government agencies to adopt the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System as part of a government-wide quality management program. To this effect, all remaining colleges were hereby enjoined to develop ISO-QMS and pursue certification. However, people assigned for the ISO SSC-MEP would be utilized to have uniformity of all documents namely: Quality Assurance Manager (QAM), Quality Management Representative (QMR), Document and Data Controllers (DDC) and Internal Communication Officer (ICO). It means that all remaining colleges of the institution would be working for its ISO 9001:2008 compliance effective April 2011 so that by next year all colleges would be all ISO certified to wit: 1) College of Business and Management: BSBA, BSHRM, and BS Tourism Programs; 2) College of Technology: BS Indu Tech and BS Info Tech Programs; 3) College of Teacher Education: BEED and BSED Programs; and 4) College Arts & Sciences: BS Crim Program.\n\nOn 11-15 April 2011, Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot-Vice-President for Academic Affairs and at the same time Lead Auditor took part in the ISO 9001:2008 QMS Auditor/Lead Auditor Training Course in Cebu City. Hong Kong Veritas Limited has provided the Certificate of Completion for Dr. Quilicot in partnership with T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines. \n\nA Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was drafted on 14 November 2011 between AJA Registrars, Inc. as certification body for ISO 9001:2008 and Siquijor State College since T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines encountered a problem during the bidding process. Consequently, the MOA was signed and strongly enforced on 03 April 2012. AJA represents the main countries in the development and adoption of standards: Anglo (U.K.) Japanese American. The first locally based certification body (CB) to obtain International Accreditation thru JAS-ANZ. \n\nConsequently, AJA Registrars conducted the On-Site Stage 1 Audit and Document Review of the developed QMS of SSC-MEP for the Provision of Maritime Education under ISO 9001:2008 on 10 April 2012 with Mrs. Remedios Cagulada as Lead Auditor and Mr. Kevin T. Castillon as Audit Team member. There were 9 audit findings raised by the auditors and in turn submitted a proposed action for the issues raised on 11 April 2012. It then successfully hurdled the Stage 2 (Final Stage): Certification Audit of the developed QMS on 11 May 2012 held at the SSC Function Room with Capt. Virginio Aris as Lead Auditor and Mr. Kevin T. Castillon as Audit Team member. Eventually, the Registration Certificate for '''ISO 9001:2008''' was released for the first time on 16 October 2012 having an ANZIC Code of 8431 and Certificate Number of AJA 12.0689 whose expiry date on 11 May 2015. This effort was headed by Dr. Roel Taroc as its MEP Director and at the same time the '''QMR''' with Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot-then Vice-President for Academic Affairs and '''Lead auditor''' at the same time. \n\nSSC-MEP successfully passed the Surveillance Audit conducted by the AJA Registrars Inc. for the Provision of Maritime Education under ISO 9001:2008 on 06 May 2013 with Dr. Mark Vera as Lead Auditor. The audit findings raised by the auditors were as follows: 0 major nonconformance, 2 minor nonconformance and 7 observations and in turn the SSC ISO Committee submitted a proposed action for the issues raised on 10 May 2013. To this effect, Dr. Taroc attended the IRCA-Approved ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Lead Auditor Training Course conducted by AJA Registrar's Incorporated on 01-05 July 2013 held at the Marco Polo Plaza Hotel, Cebu City. \n\nOn 06 May 2014, the Final Surveillance Audit for the Provision of Maritime Education under ISO 9001:2008 took place with Dr. Mark Vera as Lead Auditor. The audit findings raised by the auditors were as follows: 0 major nonconformance, 3 minor nonconformance and 5 observations and in turn the SSC ISO Committee submitted a proposed action for the issues raised on 10 May 2014. \n\nWhen Dr. Quilicot became the College President, the Lead Auditor position was vacated. So, Dr. Steven J. Sumaylo took over her place and served as Lead Auditor. In order to qualify himself as the new Lead Audtor, he was sent to attend the IRCA-Approved ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Lead Auditor Training Course on 23-27 June 2015 conducted by AJA Registrar's Incorporated held at the Marco Polo Plaza Hotel, Cebu City.\n\nThe ISO Certification of SSC-MEP was conducted by AJA Registrar's Incorporated as its Certifying Body with JAZ-ANZ as its Accreditation Body. ISO Certification's success has been attributed to support from the College President-Dr. R. Martinez Baldomero, Jr. It underwent another three consecutive years of monitoring audits and was re-registered on 01 July 2015 and with an expiry date of 11 May 2018.\n\nAlthough SSC-MEP was already re-registered for ISO 9001:2008, President Quilicot realized and decided to institutionalize the ISO certification in order for the school to be internationally competitive after two years of oversight audits. Accordingly, it underwent a surveillance audit to broaden its scope from 28 February to 01 March 2017, issued a Certificate of Attestation on 02 August 2017 and eventually, in September 2017, the Certificate of Registration and Scope of Registration for the '''Provision of Education Services covering Maritime and Non-Maritime''', ''(College of Education, Arts and Sciences, Business and Management, and College of Technology)'', and '''Graduate Education and General Administrative Services'''.\n\nThe specification for ISO 9001 has been updated to version 2015 due to the clientele's increasing demand for its approval. In addition, QMR has been modified to ISO Program Manager, and DDC has also been modified to Document Controller. With this progress, the College under the leadership of Dr. Roel D. Taroc as the ISO Program Manager toiled for its re-registration before its expiry date on 12 May 2018 and thus underwent a surveillance audit for '''ISO 9001:2015''' and was awarded certificate number AJA 12.0689 on 09 September 2018.\n\nThe quality of its ISO certification was achieved through the joint efforts of the SSC Administration led by the College President-Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot, members of IQA, all ISO Process Owners, ICO and DC, faculty and staff, students and stakeholders. As AJA Registrars' Incorporated is run by a new ISO Company, the official SSC Certifying Body is now '''SOCOTEC Certification Philippines, Incorporated'''. \n\nDr. Steven J. Sumaylo, Dr. Benita R. Padayhag and Dr. Marjorie P. Eslit resigned as Lead Auditor and IQA members, respectively on 13 February 2020. In order to avoid paralyzing the operation of the ISO Program, Dr. Dave S. Mamhot was recommended by the ISO Program Manager to take over the position of Dr. Sumaylo as Lead Auditor. In addition, additional IQA members have been added to ensure smooth operation of the ISO Certification.\n\nCurrently, the ISO Program Office as managed by Dr. Roel D. Taroc being the ISO Program Manager together with Engr. Hermilita L. Paculba as Document Controller (DC) and Mrs. Jonalyn L. Fuentes as the Internal Communication Officer (ICO) will be preparing for an internal and external audits to take place in May and another sometime in November of this year. The respective Deputy ISO Program Managers as well as the Deputy Document Controllers and Deputy ICOs of each Department as well as the General Administrative Services and other Key Personnel of the College will likewise prepare their respective ISO processes. This endeavor will be in collaboration with the Lead Auditor and IQA members for a smooth and effective ISO Program implementation.\n\n==Tri-Summer Physics Institute Program==\nFrom the renewed vitality of community life emerging from the 24th Annual National Physics Seminar-Workshop Convention of the Philippine Physics Society (PPS), an organization of physicists, physics professionals, physics teachers, physics students and physics enthusiasts which was hosted by Silliman University, a Regional Upgrading Seminar on Electricity, Optics and Modern Physics was held for the first time in SSC, Larena, Siquijor on 16-17 August 2002 with Mr. Roel D. Taroc as the Seminar Coordinator. This resulted in the formation of the PPS-Siquijor Chapter with its pioneer set of officers as follows: President-Roel D. Taroc of SSC, Vice-President-Nicarter B. Lomocso of DepEd-Siquijor, Secretary-Angeles Jra. J. Anoos of Siquijor Provincial Science High School, Treasurer-Marjorie P. Eslit of SSC, Auditor-Arthur P. Lagorra of Basac High School, Business Manager-Engr. Bryanpete R. Tabada of SSC, PRO-Oscar S. Moreno of Po-o High School and Engr. Lemuel D. Banglos of SSC .  \n\t\nThe idea of the Tri-Summer Institute degree program cropped up during a lunch at the residence of Superintendent Aleli Rojo-Abne in Banban, Siquijor, Siquijor on 17 August 2002. It all started when Dr. Gerardo C. Maxino, PPS National President and then Professor of Physics at Silliman University made a proposal to Dr. Dominador Q. Cabanganan, then SSC President to offer Master\u2019s degree program in Physics Teaching at Siquijor State College. He was seconded by his wife-Dr. Vicenta Cabahug-Maxino, PPS National Secretary, his sister-Dr. Hope Maxino-Bandal, Chairperson of the Physics Department of Silliman University. While Mr. Nicarter B. Lomocso, ES I (Science), Division of Siquijor, Mr. Roel D. Taroc, President of the PPS-Siquijor Chapter, Engr. Lauro Casocot and Engr. Raymund Vizacarra of Ateneo de Davao University, Clare Maxino of Ateneo de Manila University, Vanessa Bandal of Silliman University and Mrs. Angeles Jra. Anoos, Secretary of PPS-Siquijor Chapter readily and enthusiastically gave a positive response as a sign of their strong support to the proposed program. \n\nConsequently, President Cabanganan designated Mr. Roel D. Taroc as the MAST-Physics Program Coordinator to take charge of the program being the latter a holder of a Master of Arts in Science Teaching major in Physics degree at the University of San Carlos, Cebu City in 1999 where Dr. Ed van den Berg was his Thesis Adviser. The degree program was designed for a tri-summer institute program including thesis with a total units of 36 which means that a student would carry a load of 12 units per summer. The students would finish the crash program in just three summer terms. The curriculum was scrutinized by a group of Physics experts from the PPS before it was submitted to the SSC Board of Trustees for approval. It was approved during the 29th Regular Meeting of the SSC Board of Trustees on 26 February 2003 at Cebu Normal University (CNU), Cebu City. The program was offered by Siquijor State College in cooperation with the Philippine Physics Society (PPS) and the CHED Center of Development in Physics, Physics Department of Silliman University, Dumaguete City and Ateneo de Davao University, Davao City. The program was under the supervision of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs and assisted by the Program Coordinator and the Dean of the Graduate Studies. \n\nIn Summer 2003, Fr. Francisco Glover of Ateneo de Davao University, Davao City came to SSC to teach Mathematical Physics during the first summer term of the Tri-Summer Institute program. In fact, during his short stay in SSC, he was able to come up with the design of the General Physics and Natural Science Laboratories of Siquijor State College on 20 April 2003. The program has an initial enrolment of 18 students categorized as follows: 2 from Iloilo; 1 from Cagayan de Oro City; 5 from SSC; 1 from TESDA-LNAS; and 9 from DepEd Siquijor. In Summer 2004 the enrollment went down to 12. On 19 June 2005, a special graduation ceremony held at Siquijor State College granted the degree Master of Arts in Science Teaching (Physics) to ten of the participants and the degree Master in Teaching (Physics) to three of the participants with Dr. Enrique P. Grecia, Regional Director of CHEDRO VII as Commencement Speaker.\n\nWith the continued support of Siquijor State College to the PPS Community, SSC was chosen to host one annual convention. Eventually, SSC graciously hosted the 30th Annual National Physics Seminar-Workshop Convention, 21st National Physics Olympics & 16th National Physics Fair of the Philippine Physics Society during the PPS Jade Celebration on 02-05 April 2008 with the theme: \u201cPhysics and Magic, Mystics, and Wizardry.\u201d \n\nDue to the retirement of Dr. Gerardo C. Maxino, National President of the PPS and Physics Professor of Silliman University in 2006, he eventually opened the Maxino College at Bagacay, Dumaguete City in 2007. Hence, the office and publication of the PPS was then transferred officially at Maxino College. On 12 May 2010, Dr. Maxino visited SSC and presented the proposal to the new SSC College President, Dr. Baldomero R. Martinez, Jr. The latter agreed to offer the second batch of the Tri-Summer Institute Physics program at Siquijor State College starting Summer 2011 after informing the Board of Trustees of the schedule. This was the very reason why the second batch of the Tri-Summer Institute Physics program was a cooperative program among Siquijor State College, the Philippine Physics Society (PPS), and Maxino College, Dumaguete City and Ateneo de Davao Univeristy, Davao City.\n\nIn Summer 2011, the program has an initial enrolment of 13 students categorized as follows: 8 from Dumaguete City ( 6 from Maxino College, 1 from Silliman University and 1 from Junob HS); 3 from Cebu City (2 from Bethany Christian School); 1 from Siquijor State College, Larena, Siquijor, and 1 from Surigao State College of Technology, Surigao City. In Summer 2012, the enrollment went down to 9. On 26 July 2013, a special graduation ceremony held at Siquijor State College granted the degree Master of Science in Science Education major in Physics Teaching to eight of the participants and the degree Master in Teaching (Physics) to one of the participants with Dr. Marcelo T. Lopez, University President of Cebu Normal University as Commencement Speaker.\n\nThe third and final batch of the Tri-Summer Institute Physics program was reaffirmed per Board Resolution No. 17 s. 2017 during the 83rd Regular Meeting of the SSC Board of Trustees on 11 May 2017 at Coco Grove Beach Resort, San Juan, Siquijor. The MS Science Education major in Physics Teaching Program was offered at Siquijor State College in cooperation with the Philippine Physics Society, Maxino College, Dumaguete City and Ateneo de Davao University, Davao City that started in Summer 2015 and ended in Summer 2017. This program was under the leadership of the fourth and first woman president of Siquijor State College, SUC President II-Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot. \n\nOn 17 November 2017, a special graduation ceremony held at Siquijor State College granted the degree Master of Science in Science Education major in Physics Teaching to four (4) participants with Dr. Peter T. Dayot, Retired Physics Professor and OIC-President of Negros Oriental State University as the Commencement Speaker. The theme of the Special Graduation is \u201cPioneering an Innovative Physics Graduate Program for Scientific Manpower Essential to National Development.\u201d\n\n==Academic Programs==\n'''College of

It is situated 30 km east of Negros Island, and 565 kilometers from [[Manila]]. \n\n==Campuses==\nThe SSC Main Campus has a total land area of 3.9 hectares and is located at Old Capitol Circle in Barangay North Poblaci\u00f3n, municipality of [[Larena]]. It has one satellite campus located in the town of [[Lazi, Siquijor]].\n\n==History==\nSiquijor State College was founded in 1920 by Lt. Governor Vicente Villanueva. It was then called as the '''Larena High School''' (LHS) that offered only the first and the second-year levels, one section per curriculum-year level with only two teachers including the principal and was under the supervision of the Negros Oriental Provincial High School (NOPHS) in [[Dumaguete City]].\n\nNine years later (1929), it operated as a complete [[secondary school]] and was renamed the '''Larena Sub-Provincial High School''' (LSPHS). On 01 July 1960, by virtue of Republic Act No. 2423, the school was converted into a [[vocational school]] offering the Secondary Trades Curriculum. This time the school was renamed '''Larena National Vocational School''' (LNVS). As the only vocational school in the province, it offered collegiate technical courses and evening opportunity classes.\n\nThe dream of the administration for the full conversion of the Larena National Vocational School into a college was realized when the National Assembly approved Batasang Pambansa Blg. 387 on 14 April 1983 and LNVS became the '''Larena National Vocational College''' (LNVC). Since this law authorized the offering of collegiate courses, the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE) and the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology (BSIT) were offered in 1985 and seven years after (1992) the Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering. In 1994, Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd), Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation, Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM) and the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) were offered. To cater to the needs of the employees in the province who had to cross the rough seas to attend, the college offered Graduate Programs in 1993 with two degrees; namely: the Master of Arts in Educational Management (MAEM) and the Master of Arts in Industrial Education (MAIE) and in 1997, the Master of Public Management (MPM).\n\nOn 03 March 1995, House Bill No. 402 was approved into law by his Excellency, President Fidel V. Ramos as Republic Act No. 7947 converted LNVC into the ''Siquijor State College (SSC)''. The conversion was made through the joint efforts of Hon. Orlando B. Fua Sr., Representative of the Lone District of [[Siquijor]], and Hon. Miguel Romero, Representative of the Second District of [[Negros Oriental]], and the Siquijodnons. Siquijor State College is authorized to offer courses in higher technological education leading to the degrees of bachelor of science in civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, electronics engineering, industrial engineering, education, forestry, fishery, nautical, physical and natural sciences, and such other collegiate and/or degree courses as may be approved by the Board of Trustees of the Siquijor State College, in addition to its present curricular offerings in the four-year secondary trade and general secondary curricula, two-year technical education curriculum, degree courses leading to the degrees in Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education and Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology. \n\nIn answer to the call for higher technology, additional courses were offered: Associate in Computer Science (1996), Bachelor of Science in Computer Technology (1999) and the Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology (2000). When Dr. Tan retired on 31 December 1999, Dr. Rosita T. Bidad, the Vice-President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) of the College was appointed by the Board of Trustees as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) until Dr. Dominador Q. Cabanganan was appointed as the second College President on 15 August 2000. He was re-appointed as College President effective 14 August 2004. \n\nA team of evaluators from the Commission on Higher Education Regional Office 7 (CHEDRO 7) headed by its Regional Director, Dr. Enrique P. Grecia together with Dr. Nenita V. Lapingcao, Dr. Perla D. Dalumpines, Dr. Pedro C. Fudolig, Dr. Josefino A. Ronquillo, Dr. Constantina A. Barbas, Dr. Dante D. Gabonillas and Dr. Ernesto K. Gemota came to SSC on 08 July 2004 to evaluate and monitor all the programs offered by the college benchmarking on some standards. Fortunately, SSC got a high rating practically in all programs especially on facilities, functional research and extension services, and the employability status of graduates in the College of Business and Management (CBM) that surpassed the 10% average return. \n\nOn 16-18 March 2005, a team of Accreditors from the Accrediting Agencies of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP came to SSC for a Preliminary Survey of the five programs that qualified for Level I (Candidate) namely, Master in Educational Management (MEM), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED), Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED), Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), and Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM). A team of assessors from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) headed by Sister Maria Myrna Concepcion of Region VI, Dr. Chloe Fe Abdulla of Region IX, Dr. Dave Cariaga of Butuan City and Ms. Rita Sescar, OPS-IQuaMe Technical Staff of CHED Central Office came to SSC on 13-16 December 2006 for the Institutional Quality Assurance Monitoring Evaluation (IQuaMe). Fortunately, the result of the assessment revealed that SSC passed Category B as applied for. \n\nOn 10 August 2006, the Lazi Skills Development Center (LSDC) was adopted by Siquijor State College and named as Siquijor State College-Lazi Campus through BOT Resolution No. 22, s. 2006 during the 43rd BOT Meeting held at Cebu Midtown Hotel, Cebu City. The Colleges of Teacher Education, Business and Management and the Graduate School granted Level I accreditation by the Accrediting Agencies of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP) on 16-19 March 2007.\n\nThe Civil Service Commission Regional Office VII granted Level II accreditation to SSC on 02 May 2007. This was the first of its kind in Central Visayas that an institution was given full autonomy to act on appointments for career and non-career positions under MC 11, s. 2005. The following month, SSC got Level II in the SUC Leveling on 21 June 2007 based on the DBM-CHED Joint Circular No. 1-B. With this new result, the school was already entitled to have two (2) Vice-Presidents in the Plantilla of Positions with a Salary Grade of 26. \n\nOn 17 March 2008, the following courses were approved to be offered effective school year 2008-2009: Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, Bachelor of Science in Development Communication, Bachelor of Science in Political Science, Bachelor of Arts, major in English, and Bachelor of Arts, major in Filipino through BOT Resolution No. 09 s. 2008. When Dr. Cabanganan retired from the service on 14 August 2008, he was bestowed by the Board of Trustees as [[Professor Emeritus]]. \n\nOn 21 August 2008, a new College President was elected by the Board of Trustees in the person of Dr. Baldomero R. Martinez, Jr. On 19 August 2013, Dr. Maria Imogen Tan-Quilicot assumed into office as the fourth and first woman college president. She was later renewed as College President on 22 October 2017 to the present. \n\nOn 14 March 2016, the College of Education became the Center of Development (COD) per CMO # 17 s. 2016 that would serve as a catalyst for world scholarships, best practices, innovative curricula, research and extension and professional development in Teacher Education programs. This success was through the collaborative efforts of the College President-Dr. Quilicot together with Dr. Sumaylo as VPAA and at the same time Dean of the College of Education, Mrs Santos as Assistant Dean, Faculty & Staff, students and stakeholders.\n\nOn 06 January 2020, the administration was reorganized. As a result, effective second semester of school year 2019-2020, the college is adopting the vertical alignment in terms of its program offerings. Through transforming SSC into Siquijor Province State University (SIPSU), SSC aims to continue broadening its horizons and discovering areas in which it can provide quality education. To this end, a task force will be set up to take responsibility for its transformation into a university. For this reason new courses for the next opening will be offered.\n\n==General Administration==\nThe College's government is vested in the Board of Trustees as stipulated in R.A. 8292. It passes rules and regulations, and sets policies as appropriate to run the College's affairs. The SSC Board of Trustees is composed of the Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education, or his/her designated representative from among the Commissioners, as the Board Chairperson. The Board of Trustees is the highest policy-making body trusted to accept rules and regulations that are not contrary to the country's established laws, so that the College can carry out its functions and operations.\n\nThe President of the college is the College's chief executive and serves as the Board of Trustees' Vice-Chairman. He/she exercises general management and oversight of all the activities and operations of the College, and of all its employees, faculty and non-teaching personnel, within the scope of current laws. The President of the college is assisted by the Vice-President for Administration and Finance as well as the Vice-President for Academic Affairs in terms of administrative, financial and academic matters.\n\nOther members of the Board of Trustees are: the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and Culture, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Higher and Technical Education, the Regional Director of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the Regional Director of the Science and Technology Department (DOST), the President of the SSC Faculty Association, President of the SSC Alumni Association, President of the Student Government and two prominent citizens of the Province of Siquijor who have distinguished themselves in their profession or specialization, as private sector representatives.\n\n==Maritime Education Program: Its Roots and Development==\nIn 1992, LNVC expanded its two-year Marine Engineering Technology (MET) course into a four-year program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering (BSMarE). The Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation (BSMT) was also offered two (2) years after in 1994. By means of RA No. 7947, by converting LNVC into a state college, Section 3 of that law authorizes SSC to operate maritime programs. As a result of this provision, SSC operated maritime programs without seeking a government permit issued by CHED. \n\nThe team of CHED Central Office evaluators arrived at Siquijor State College on 03 February 1998 to evaluate BSMT and BSMarE programs where BSMT got a point of 20.492 or 3.49 with a verbal description of Poorly Complied; while BSMarE got a point of 25.972 or 7.72 with a verbal description of Poorly Complied. On 21 October 2000, CHED Central Office reassessed the SSC maritime programs: BSMT and BSMarE received a rating of 76.76 and 76.45 percent, respectively, with a verbal description of Moderate Compliance, respectively. This means that the program will be phased out slowly. If however, the institution did not comply with CMO # 09 s. 1999 the program might be closed. \n\nIn 2004, the BSMT and BSMarE courses were shortened to a two year course, during the tenure of Dr. Cabanganan, in order to prevent technical CHED issues. This has resulted in lower MEP enrollment. As a result, poor parents were forced to continue studying in other schools with higher tuition fees for their children. On 16 June 2005, BOT Resolution No. 14, s. 2005 reaffirmed the maritime course offerings at SSC. During the 38th SSC BOT Meeting held at SSC, Larena, Siquijor the Ladderized Curriculum for Associate in Marine Engineering, leading to Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering and Associate in Marine Transportation, leading to Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation were approved. \n\nDuring the reign of Dr. Martinez in 2008, when he discovered that maritime programs were the dreamed courses of many parents, he revived both the BSMT and the BSMarE programs. Dr. Filemon P. Caroro was assigned as the Dean of the Maritime Department, who was then Vice-President for Administration and Finance and simultaneously Dean of the College of Technology. Later Capt. Margarito Sugabo became Dean because CHED required a seagoing full-time merchant officer to become a full-time Dean. \n\nOn 27 June 2010, Dr. Martinez facilitated the complete installation of the Integrated Bridge System (IBS) with Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) amounting to almost PhP 6M including its building renovation fully equipped with three (3) air-conditioned units. The IBS with GMDSS was composed of the following Instructor Station Console, Student Stations Console 1 and 2, GMDSS Instructor Station, GMDSS Student Stations 1 and 2, Koden RADAR DC Model MDS-52R, Nobeltic C Map admiral Max Pro with unlock code, Koden GPS Model KGP 913, Koden Echo Sounder, ICOM SSB Transreceiver Model IC 710, BNW HF Antenna, XAXERPA Weather Fax 2000 Software including USB/demodulator, 3 Channel visualization, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and RADAR/ARPA program capability with GMDSS. The Integrated Bridge System (IBS) with Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) was located at the Marine Engineering Laboratory Building adjacent to the SSC Guest House fronting the SSC Dormitory and Boys Trade Building at the Siquijor State College Main Campus, Larena, Siquijor. \n\nDr. Martinez noted that there was no permanent staff to manage the maritime programs because faculty members would only come and go when they returned to the maritime fleet and often merchant officers would no longer come back because they had already been employed by other maritime institutions with a higher pay. As he decided to apply for a government permit to conduct maritime programs, Dr. Roel D. Taroc-formerly Research Director was designated as Director for the Maritime Education Program  to run the Siquijor State College Maritime Education Program (SSC-MEP) on 15 October 2010 through Office Order No. 27 s. 2010. In addition, Capt. Margarito S. Sugabo was designated Acting Dean and later Capt. Samuel M. Daug took over as OIC Dean/BSMT Chair when the former returned to his shipping company. \n\nOn 21-22 October 2010, a team from the Office of Programs and Standards (OPS), in particular the Maritime Education Unit (MEU) of the Central Office of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) came to the SSC to conduct a monitoring and evaluation on the Nine (9) Areas of Evaluation on the existing course offerings of the SSC-MEP as one of the procedures in complying with the requirements of the International Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) '78, as amended in applying for the Permit Status for the courses namely: Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation (BSMT) and Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering (BSMarE) as stipulated in CMO #13, s. 2005. The Nine (9) Areas of Evaluation were as follows: Administration, Faculty, Physical Facilities, Laboratory Equipment, Library Holdings, Shipboard Training, Research and Development, Extension Services and Quality Standard System (QSS). Of the nine areas of evaluation only one area was complied that was on Physical Facilities. Due to this result, on 10 November 2010, a Matrix Plan was submitted to the OPS-MEU expressing its intention to comply with all the provisions of the STCW '78 as amended so that previous SSC graduates would be allowed to take the PRC Examination since SSC was has no government permit yet. \n\nOn 22 November 2010, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was drafted and in turn submitted to CHED Central Office on 03 December 2010 for approval. This MOA was between the University of Cebu-Maritime Education and Training Center (UC-METC) in Cebu City, a duly organized educational institution and duly authorized accredited Maritime Training Center in Central Visayas to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the required Basic Safety Courses in Fire Fighting and Fire Prevention, Medical Emergency, Personal Survival and Personal Safety and Social Responsibility (PSSSR), among other upgrading courses; and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses, in their desire to comply with curriculum requirements of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in its STCW 1995 and pursuant to the objectives of LOI 538, in improving the acceptability of Filipino Seafarers for employment on board vessels in domestic and foreign. \n\nMeanwhile, the Extension Activities of the SSC-MEP Re: Coastal Clean-up and Mangrove Planting were conducted on 27 November 2010. These activities were in collaboration with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), LGU-Larena headed by its Mayor, Sangguniang Bayan members of Larena and Barangay Council of Sandugan, Larena, Siquijor. \n\nSSC-MEP sent participants for the first time after reviving the maritime programs to attended the 36th PAMI (Philippine Association of Maritime Institutions) Annual Convention and General Assembly on 03-04 December 2010 that ensured the success of the event in pursuing its theme, \u201cPAMI: Meeting the Challenge of Global Standards in Maritime Education.\u201d This was hosted by the Mariners\u2019 Polytechnic Colleges Foundation (MPCF) Rawis, Legazpi City, Albay with Hon. Patricia B. Licuanan, Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker. \n\nIn order to provide for a functional Research & Development Program of the SSC Maritime Education Programs, a List of Research Studies to be undertaken was approved by the College President for its implementation based on the time frame. Hence, the Proposal Hearing was conducted on 16 December 2010 at the SSC Audio Visual Room. The Examining Tribunal was composed of Dr. Baldomero R. Martinez, Jr. as Chairman with Dr. Maria T. Jumawan, Dr. Vergie B. Miquiabas and Dr. Rosalina E. Catid as members. The Final Presentation was scheduled on 16 March 2011. \n\nWith the management of Dr. Taroc in the SSC-MEP, he was able to initiate and facilitate the conduct of the Training Course for Instructors (IMO Model Course 6.09) for Maritime Instructors and Trainers from 20-24 December 2010 and 17-21 January 2011 held at the SSC Audio-Visual Room. This was conducted by the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines with twenty-three (23) SSC-MEP faculty-trainees. This training course was in accordance with MTC Resolution # 3 s. 1996 and with CHED Memorandum Order # 13 s. 2005 Article VII Sections 19 and 20 and in compliance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended pursuant to Regulation I/6 and Section A-I/6. \n\nDr. Taroc successfully coordinated with Dr. Rodolfo P. Ceballos, the Graduate School Extension Coordinator of the John B. Lacson Foundation Maritime University (Arevalo), Inc., M. H. del Pilar St., Molo, Iloilo City on 04 January 2011 to facilitate the enrollment procedure of the Maritime Faculty Instructors to the different programs. In answer to the needs of an ever dynamic maritime environment and in response to the challenge of producing globally competitive seafarers, managers of maritime institutions and leaders in maritime education, the Graduate School of JBLFU (Arevalo) has established continually evolving and dynamic curricular programs.

Dr. Taroc decided to enroll the course leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maritime Education (Ph.D.M.E.) major in Curriculum Assessment in Summer 2012 at John B. Lacson Foundation Maritime University (Arevalo), Inc., M. H. del Pilar St., Molo, Iloilo City so that extension classes in Master in Maritime Education would be held in SSC so as to economize expenses of the maritime faculty. As a result, the following instructors finished the course in Master in Maritime Education (M.M.E.) major in Administration and Supervision in Summer 2012 to wit: Capt. Margarito S. Sugabo, Capt. Samuel M. Daug, Engr. Gilbert P. Sumalpong, and Mr. Ronald Alexis M. Tan. However, Mr. Tan continued his studies leading to the degree of Master in Maritime Education major in Science Teaching for his vertical alignment being a Physical Therapist Registered, Philippines (PTRP). \n\nOn 19 September 2012, SSC-MEP purchased the Engine Room Simulator ERS 5000 amounting to PhP 7M complete with accessories with an original license of the software including its Rehabilitation of the Existing Bridge Deck Simulator making both compatible. This was supplied by the Safety Utilities for Maritime and Computer Systems, Inc. (SUMACS) located at 5th Floor, Room 507 Victoria Bldg., 429 United Nation Avenue, Ermita, Manila. The ERS 5000 was specifically designed for the education, training and assessment of competence of engine department personnel including the engineer officer in charge of watch, senior engineering staff and ratings forming part of engineering watch. It covered the essential areas of maritime training in full compliance with the STCW \u201895 requirements, designed to meet the requirements of IMO conventions and Resolutions and IEC standards, approved by DNV (as per Standard for Certification of Maritime Simulators No. 2.14 October 2007). It has flexible solutions re: computer based training (SOLO), networked classes and full mission simulator. \n\nOn 22 October 2012, SSC-MEP purchased Two (2) units 20-kW with KVA or smaller 3-phase 50 Hz Marine Generating sets and One (1) unit Synchronizing Panel Board with Standard Marine Accessories amounting to PhP 795, 000.00 with complete accessories as follows: 4 strokes cycle engine, cylinder at 1500-1800 rpm, air start with air bottle for starting, cooling system, sea water coolant (preferably reconditioned) with brand new generator.

Sumalpong as Co-Chair-STO at the same time Assistant Head of the Engine Department. Capt. Daug, Acting Dean of MEP attended the Training Course for Simulator Instructors and Assessors (IMO Model Course 6.10) for Maritime Instructors and Assessors conducting Simulator Based Training and Assessment conducted from 26 November to 01 December 2012 held at the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines. This training course was in accordance with Sec. 12 of MTC Resolution # 5 s. 2010 and with CHED Memorandum Order # 13 s. 2005 Article VII Section 20.5 and in compliance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended pursuant to Regulation I/6 and Section A-I/6 paragraph 4.3. Furthermore, two (2) of the SSC-MEP Faculty members attended the Training Course for Instructors (IMO Model Course 3.12) from 03 to 14 December 2012 at the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) of Barangay Cabalawan, Tacloban City, Leyte, Philippines namely, Capt. Valdez and Engr. Sumalpong. \n\nOn 14-15 February 2013, a team from the Office of Programs and Standards (OPS) particularly the Maritime Education Unit (MEU) of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Central Office came to Siquijor State College again to determine the extent of compliance with the requirements of the International Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) \u201978, as amended. The team of evaluators was composed of the following: Capt. Eutiquio Reyes, Jr. (External Assessor), Chief Engineer John Buendia (External Assessor), Mr. Dante D. Cabunilas (CHEDRO VII), Mr. Jaginder Delina (OPS-MEU), and Engr. Sherwin C. Revereza as Team Leader. Out of nine areas, all areas were complied for both programs. SSC-MEP was supposed to be issued a permit status for operating maritime programs at this time based on CMO #13 s. 2005. However, its issuance of CHED's permit was overshadowed when a new guideline came out using an Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) Instrument. To this effect, all MHEIs would be subjected for a monitoring and evaluation using the said instrument. Drastically, all requirements were changed especially on the area of facilities and equipment, many were added on the previous listings. \n\nDuring the leadership of President Martinez, there was a tremendous increase in the SSC-MEP enrollment. It means that during his term as College President, it was very evident that he had supported the Maritime Education Program to comply the requirements mandated by CHED. He moved heaven and earth for its full compliance. This was his legacy of reviving the Maritime education Program. This was continued however during the reign of the fourth and first woman president-Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot. \n\nOn 27-28 May 2014, a Joint CHED-MARINA Monitoring and Evaluation using Outcomes-Based Education Team came to Siquijor State College to verify the continued compliance with the pertinent standards or degree of deviation from expected norms in the operation of BSMT and BSMarE programs. This monitoring and evaluation likewise ensured that defined program objectives in accordance with the STCW prescribed standards of competence were achieved. The team of evaluators was composed of the following: Capt. Danilo Arevalo and Chief Engineer Ferdinand Pascua as Technical Experts, Mr. Samuel Batalla and John Guardaya (Observer) from MARINA Central Office, Dr. Josefino Ronquillo (CHEDRO VII), and Engr. Sherwin C. Revereza (OPS-MEU) as Team Leader. Out of eleven areas, only two areas (I & IV) were fully complied. SSC-MEP got 8 Minor Nonconformance\u2019s (mNCs) from the following Areas to wit: Area II-Organization, Management, and Support (1mNC); Area III-Curriculum (1mNC); Area V-Examination and Assessment System (1mNC); Area VI-Staff on Instructors and Assessors (1mNC and 1 Observation); VIII-Onboard Training (1mNC); Area IX-Facilities and Equipment (2mNCs and 3 Observations); Area X-Research and Development (1mNC) and Area XI-Extension Services (1 Observation). To undertake corrective action for MINOR NCs-reasonable period this shall not exceed three (3) months, while OBSERVATIONS were to be addressed within a period of one (1) year.\n\nOn 12 March 2015, a CHED Memorandum from the Chairperson was issued pertaining to the conversion of BS Maritime Education Programs to the Enhanced Support Level Programs. These programs are especially designed to take into consideration the value added to the training of active Filipino seafarers-i.e. their exposure to general education and technical courses at the college level-in addition to compliance with the STCW requirements for certification as Ratings Forming Part of a Watch and Ratings as Able Seafarer. The programs aim to enhance the competitiveness of Filipino seafarers in the international maritime industry as they perform support level functions and responsibilities at the deck and engine departments of seagoing ships. For the deck department, the program shall be called the Enhanced Support Level Program for Marine Deck (ESLPMD) and Enhanced Support Level Program for Marine Engineering (ESLPME) for the engine department. In this memorandum, it was clarified that in order to address the concerns of the MHEIs that converted their BS programs into ESLP, they might continue to offer the BS programs to their incoming 2nd year, 3rd year and 4th year students. However, they were strongly urged to give students who prefer to work as ratings at the soonest possible time the freedom to shift to the ESLP (while crediting the courses they have taken). Moreover, even if they were not allowed to admit first year applicants, MHEIs were still expected to hone the competencies required of their 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students. Eventually, MARINA-STCW Office released the list of MHEIs that have expressed their interest to offer ratings (deck) and ratings (engine) programs where SSC was one of the recognized MHEIs to offer ESLP. \n\nOn 24 April 2015, a letter was submitted to CHED by SSC-MEP re: Corrective Action Report on the Minor Non-Conformances (mNCs) during the Joint CHED-MARINA Monitoring and Evaluation on 27-29 May 2014 presented in a Matrix Action Plan; ESLP Curriculum for Marine Deck (ESLPMD) and ESLP Curriculum for Marine Engineering (ESLPME) with \u201cTrack A\u201d and \u201cTrack B\u201d effective First Semester, School Year 2015-2016 per STCW Circular 2014-7; Revised BSMT and BSMarE Curricula for Second, Third, and Fourth Year Students, effective Second Semester, SY 2013-2014 per CMO # 31 & 32 s. 2013. On 19 June 2015, Hon. Maria Cynthia Rose B. Bautista- Oversight Commissioner for Maritime Education acknowledged receipt of the documents submitted by SSC-MEP for the Enhanced Support Level Program (ESLP) for Marine Deck and Engine to be offered first semester of Academic Year 2015-2016. Starting this time, SSC strictly followed the order from CHED not to accept first year applicants for BSMT and BSMarE programs until further notice. \n\nOn 10 July 2015, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was renewed between Cebu Reliable and Excellent Seafarers Training Center (CREST) with principal office at 4th Floor DG3 Corporation Bldg., 72 N Escario St., Capitol Site, Cebu City, a duly organized Maritime Education and Training provider duly accredited by the Maritime Training Council and duly certified by AJA Registrars, Inc to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the required Basic Safety Courses (Personal Survival Techniques, Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting, Elementary First Aid, and and Personal Safety and Social Responsibility), Ratings Forming Part of a Navigational Watch serving seagoing ship of 500 gross tonnage, Ratings Forming Part of a Watch in a Manned Engine-Room or Designated to Perform Duties in a Periodically Unmanned Engine-Room, Proficiency in Survival Craft  and Rescue Boats other than Fast Rescue Boat (PSCRB), Advanced Fire Fighting (AFF), and Medical First Aid (MFA); and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses. The first MOA was signed on 28 September 2012.\n\nLikewise on 22 July 2015,  a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was renewed between Philasia Maritime Services Training Center, Inc. with principal office at 2nd Floor, Cebu Lioc Kui Bldg., #6 J. L. Briones Avenue, North Reclamation, Cebu City, a duly recognized Maritime Training provider duly accredited by the Maritime Training Council and duly accredited by Bureau Veritas to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the required Basic Safety Courses (Personal Survival Techniques, Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting, Elementary First Aid, and and Personal Safety and Social Responsibility), Ratings Forming Part of a Navigational Watch (RFPNW), Ratings Forming Part of a Engineering Watch (RFPEW), Deck Watchkeeping, Engine Watchkeeping, Ship Security Awareness Training and Seafarer\u2019s with Designated Security Duties (SSAT-SDSD), Crowd and Crisis Management of Personnel Serving on Board Domestic Roro/Passenger/Cargo Passenger Ships, and Medical Emergency First Aid (MEFA); and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses. The first MOA was signed on 30 October 2014.\n\nOn 10 February 2016, SSC-MEP celebrated World Seafarers Day for the remaining students, in appreciation of the special and all too often ignored contribution to the public's well-being, to 1.5 million sailors worldwide. The Day of the Seafarers also offered the public an opportunity to learn about modern seafarers' problems as piracy. However, the most important thing was the occasion to say \u201cThank you, Seafarers.\u201d  The Ring Hop of the Third year BSMT and BSMarE ceremony and the ESLPMD and ESLPME students were highlighted. The affair was held at the Siquijor State College Gymnasium with Chief Engineer Nelson Ramirez, President of United Filipino Seafarers and Executive Editor & Founder of Tinig Marino of Ermita, Manila as Guest of Honor. It was participated in by SSC-MEP students, faculty and parents.\n\nIn addition, SSC-MEP availed for the first time the MARINA Mobile Processing of Seafarers Identification Record Book (SIRB) on 21 April 2016.  The Regional Office of Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) 7 headed by Ms. Remedios Cadungog, Engr. Jeff Badon and Mr Manuelito facilitated the undertaking. The mobile processing carried out by MARINA was used by 80 students.\n\nOn 08 August 2016, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between Oceanwide Maritime Services Corp., (OMSC), a Maritime Training Institution duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission No. CS201227376 and operating with the authority of the STCW office MARINA, with principal office at Room 307, 3rd Floor, Kang Ha Bldg., Osme\u00f1a St. Corner Lapu-Lapu St., Cebu City to undertake the upgraded training of Seafarers in the following courses: Safe Navigation & Collision Regulation, Deck Watchkeeping in the Domestic Trade, Engine Watchkeeping in the Domestic Trade, ISM Code Familiarization; and Siquijor State College, a duly established school offering Maritime-Oriented Courses.\n\nThe World Seafarers Day was celebrated again on 17 March 2017. The affair started with the Street Parade and Pass and Review. This event was highlighted by the Ring Hop Ceremony of the last batch of BSMT and BSMarE students with the Bon Voyage Ceremony of ESLPMD and ESLPME students. The invited guests included Capt. Emerico Gepilano, President and Founder of the CREST Review, Assessment and Training Center as Keynote Speaker and Chief Engineer Nikias Antonio Calledo as Guest of Honor. SSC-MEP students, faculty and parents also witnessed the event. \n\nIn view of the full implementation of the Senior High School-Maritime Program (SHS-MP) under the new basic education structure of the Department of Education (DepEd) which is the K to 12 Program, all concerned were hereby informed that effective 01 October 2017, the implementation of the Enhanced Support Level Program (ESLP) for Marine Deck and Marine Engineering was hereby suspended/terminated per STCW Advisory No. 2017-14. All MHEIs offering ESLP were hereby directed to cease and desist from accepting new or first year students under ESLP. Students who were currently enrolled and were already taken up the ESLP prior to 01 October 2017 shall be allowed to complete the academic requirements of the said program until 31 May 2019 and earned the required seagoing service not later than 31 December 2020 in order to be considered by MARINA for certification as Ratings Forming Part of a watch under STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, subject to compliance with all other requirements thereof. \n\nOn 15 December 2017, SSC-MEP sent a further letter of appeal to the CHED Central Office with supporting documents, which reiterated that the maritime programs had to be re-evaluated. To SSC-MEP's surprise, a result of the Documentary Analysis made by the Chair/members of the joint CHED-Technical Committee for Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering with inputs from the OPSD-Division of Programs with International Convention (DPIC) was released on 30 January 2018. The supporting documents attached to the letter of appeal were the ones evaluated by them. The evaluation of documents was actually conducted on 11-12 January 2018 headed by the CHED-Technical Committee for Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering composed of the following: For Marine Transportation: Capt. Michael S. Caris, Capt Luis Evidente; and for Marine Engineering: C/E Wilson P. Travi\u00f1a as Chair with Dr. Felicito P. Dalageute and Engr. Felix M. Oca as members. \n\nMoreover, the CHED-Technical Committee members were supported by the following CHED Personnel headed by Ms. Eleanor BA, Fernandez, Chief, Division of Programs with International Convention with the assistance of Ms. Elsa G. Florendo, Chief, Non-Conventional Higher Education Division (NHD), Mr. Roland Ni\u00f1o L. Agoncillo-Asst. Chief of NHD and Mutya L. Mangubat-EPS II, DPIC. The initial deficiencies noted on the documents submitted were indicated in the attached instruments for documentary analysis. Unlike other MHEIs, SSC has not been provided with tools for documentary analysis: Instrument I: Documentary Analysis (General Requirements), Instrument II: Documentary Analysis (Specific Requirements for Discipline), only the supporting documents attached to the letter of appeal have been assessed. However, SSC-MEP was never discouraged from complying instead with the initial deficiencies noted and was able to meet the deadline for submission of the required documents by CHED-OPSD on 15 February 2018. \n\nOn 15 May 2018, the CHED Evaluation Team headed by C/M Renante A. Garcia-CHED Technical Panel for Marine Transportation with C/E Charlie M. Pandongan-CHED Technical Panel for Marine Engineering, Mr. Richie S. De la Rosa-Education Program Specialist II of MEU, DPIC, OPSD-CHED Central Office and Dr. Dante D. Cabunilas-Supervisor-in-Charge of Maritime Education, CHEDRO 7 came to SSC to conduct an ocular visit of its application to operate maritime programs. The following deficiencies were noted: 1) No proof to show records of validation, testing of scenarios for both deck and engine department; 2) Only 3 chart tables were working; 3) Only 9 vises attached to work bench; 4) Chart room lacks 1 set of gnomonic, 1 set of Mercator plotting sheet from equator to 90 degrees latitude (9 degrees to 45 degrees available) and routing chart; 5) Navigation equipment was found to have defective pelorous/azimuth circle and signaling lamp and lacks international signal flags and morse light (simulator); 6) Marcom room lacks International Radio Laws (ITU) Part I and II, outdated Admiralty List of Radio Signals (Vol. I & II), outdated International Code of Signals, defective morse signaling apparatus, lacks semaphore flags and lacks single letter flags; 7) Seamanship room lacks hand scraper (angular), thread for canvass, computer based software on trim and stability, ship certificates (e.g. SOLAS etc.) and the anchor with chains have no markings; 8) Machine shop lacks inside micrometers, I unit pedestal grinder, washing facility, die nuts, and protractor (steel); 9) Auxiliary machinery lacks reciprocating driven pump; 10) Steam plant lacks boiler water test kit; 11) Refrigeration lacks expansion valves, open type refrigerating compressor (complete), thermostat, and pressure switch; 12) Electro technology lacks electrical training module for AC Circuits, electronic training module, motor control module, analog multi-tester, insulation tester, digital clamp meter, and live line tester; and 13) Automation lacks process simulator that contains process to be controlled, process transmitter/sensor, controller (PID, PI, PD), correcting elements/final control elements, thermistor, 100 ohm resistance bulb, U-tube manometer, and transmitters (pneumatic and electric). \n\nOn 29 May 2018, the CHED Commission en banc '' '''disapproved''' '' the SSC\u2019s application to operate the BSMT and BSMarE programs effective Academic Year 2018-2019. As such, SSC cannot accept enrollees into the said programs. In view of this, a letter of appeal was sent to CHED Commission en banc on 19 June 2018 that SSC would be given a chance to comply the deficiencies noted during the CHED Evaluation Team. \n\nOn 17 August 2018, another letter of appeal submitted to CHED for Re-Evaluation/Revisit SSC in connection with its application for government permit to operate maritime programs. SSC moved heaven and earth to comply the noted deficiencies noted on the previous CHED\u2019s Team evaluation. The efforts made by the SSC Faculty, Staff, Students, Alumni, Parents and Stakeholders to purchase such equipment and facilities were enough reasons for the offering of the maritime programs. In fact, the money used to purchase such equipment and facilities were donations to SSC from the SSC Alumni Association (PhP 900,000.00), and the Parents, Faculty and Students Association (PhP 250,000.00). \n\nOn 18 August 2018, a letter was received from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) through its OIC Chair, J. Prospero E. De Vera informing SSC that CHED and MARINA had an ongoing discussion regarding the implementation of the STCW Convention 1978 as amended. The discussion included the administration and supervision of maritime higher education institutions (MHEIs) including the reconstitution of the Technical Panel for Maritime Education (TPME). The CHED-MARINA discussion and agreements would be consolidated into an Executive Order to be signed by the President. In this regard, the processing of the SSC\u2019s appeal on the application to operate BSMT and BSMarE programs would be held in abeyance until the Executive Order (EO) had been finalized by CHED and MARINA and the TPME would be reconstituted and meet for this purpose. \n\nOn 21 September 2018, His Excellency, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, signed the Executive Order No. 63, \u201cFurther strengthening the Authority of the Maritime Industry Authority as the Single Maritime Administration for the Purpose of Implementing the 1978 International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, as Amended.\u201d To cite, Section 2 of this EO, the MARINA shall take the lead in the evaluation of requests of the following maritime education programs: BSMT, BSMarE, and other higher education programs that may be developed in the future which would require compliance with the STCW Convention. Moreover, the MARINA in coordination with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) shall evaluate and inspect all maritime higher education institutions to ensure that the maritime education programs being offered by said institutions comply with the minimum standards set under the STCW Convention.\n\nUpon the recommendation of the Technical Panel for Maritime Education, the Commission en banc during its meeting on 19 March 2019 '' '''approved''' '' the re-evaluation of the SSC\u2019s application to determine its eligibility to offer the BSMT and BSMarE programs for Academic Year 2019-2020. Consequently, the CHED Evaluation Team conducted the re-evaluation on 10-11 June 2019 to determine the SSC\u2019s compliance requirements of the existing policies, standards and guidelines (PSGs) and other rules and regulations relative to offer BSMT and BSMarE programs. \n\nConsequently on 31 July 2019, upon the recommendation of the Technical Panel for Maritime Education (TPME) and upon its discussion and agreement, the Commission en banc '' '''granted''' '' the SSC\u2019s request for reconsideration for the issuance of Government Permit to operate the first-year and second-year levels of BSMT and BSMarE programs effective Academic Year 2019-2020 in accordance with CMO Nos. 67, 70 and 71 series of 2017, without prejudice to evaluation/inspection and monitoring in accordance with the Joint CHED-MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 1, series of 2019. Relative to this, the Certificates of Government Permit would be issued by CHED to SSC. \n\nOn '' '''11 September 2019,''' '' in accordance with the pertinent provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 77222, otherwise known as the \u201cHigher Education Act of 1994,\u201d and virtue of Resolution No. 462-2019, of the Commission, the '' '''Government Permit (GP)''' '' was hereby '' '''granted''' '' to Siquijor State College, Larena, Siquijor to operate and conduct the '' '''First and Second Year Levels''' '' of the Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering and the Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation programs, respectively. This GP, however, would be valid effective Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 and shall be subjected to revocation if herein grantee fails to operate in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines and/or fails to maintain the prescribed standards of instruction and/or fails to comply with the rules and regulations pertaining to the organization, administration and supervision of private/public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines. This GP does not extend to any branch of the grantee, whether located in the same place or elsewhere. \n\nOn 19-22 November 2020, the Joint CHED-MARINA Evaluation/Inspection Team came to SSC to conduct evaluation/inspection in determining its compliance requirements of the Joint CHED-MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 1 series of 2019 or the \u201cPolicies, Standards and Guidelines (PSGs) for the Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation and Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering Programs\u201d. The team was headed Ms. Ma. Elizabeth I. Tejuco with C/E Jonathn A. Seguritan, Ms. Nora R. Acedera, Ms. Teresa V. Tulio, Capt. Danilo G. Arevalo-CHED Technical Evaluator, and Dr. Sotera C. Cagang-CHED Evaluator. \n\nDr. Taroc was named as the Acting Vice-President for Academic Affairs on 06 January 2020, and already has a broad range of functions with regards to the implementation of the educational policies and programs of the institution in terms of quality control, accreditation and adherence with CHED and MARINA requirements. He is responsible for the design, implementation and evaluation of educational initiatives and programs. \n\nOn 13 January 2020, PAMI appreciated the support given by SSC by sending representatives to attend and participate in all Association\u2019s workshops in the development of uniformed course syllabi. SSC was congratulated further for achieving the permit status from MARINA and CHED to be eligible in accepting 1st year enrollees in the BSMT and BSMarE Programs for Academic Year 2019-2020. In the meantime, PAMI reiterated its desire to invite Dr. Taroc as a member of the Philippine Association of Maritime Institutions (PAMI)'s Course Program Development Committee for Assessment (PCDC), which considers that the input of Dr Taroc will make such a significant contribution to improving maritime education. While PAMI invited Dr. Taroc on 28 July 2018 to join the Committee, President Quilicot declined the invitation, as SSC had no BSMT and BSMarE offerings yet at that time. Dr. Taroc finally received the College President's permission on 04 February 2020 to be a Member of the Committee spearheaded by Engr. Felix M. Oca-PAMI President. \n\nCurrently, Dr. Roel D. Taroc as MEP Director together with Engr. Gilbert P. Sumalpong as Dean and at the same time Head of the Engine Department are working hard to attain its '' '''Recognition Permit Status.''' '' It is expected therefore that anytime this year, SSC-MEP will be evaluated for its compliance to operate and conduct the '' '''Third and Fourth Year Levels''' '' of the BSMT and BSMarE programs. Assisting SSC-MEP in preparation for the evaluation and monitoring are Capt. Bertrand Y. Valdez as Head of the Deck Department and Assessor of the BSMT Classes as well as 2/E Hilario B. Ongue as On Board Training (OBT) Supervisor and Assessor of BSMarE classes. Moreover, the OBT staff and the Extension Chair, Bosun Arnold B. Apiag shall work hand-hand with Mr. John Anthony Y. Jimenez as the Student Placement Coordinator. In addition, Engr. Hermilita L. Paculba as Research Chair and at the same time Document Controller (DC) with Jonalyn L. Fuentes as the Internal Communication Officer (ICO) shall also prepare the necessary documents needed. To complete the Maritime Education Program set-up, the following personnel will also take part in this endeavor to wit: Mr. Ronald Alexis M. Tan as Laboratory Safety Officer, Mrs. Michelle M. Dagohoy as Laboratory Manager, Engr. Bryanpete R. Tabada as Calibration Officer, Engr. Victor B. Petere as Electro-Technology Laboratory-in-Charge, Mr. Masay T. Degrano as facilitator of MaShop with Mr. Limuel C. Salindo, as assistant facilitator of MaShop.\n\n==ISO Certification==\nDr. Roel D. Taroc was designated as Quality Management Representative (QMR) by President Martinez to take the lead in ISO certification on 26 October 2010 through Office Order No. 30 s. 2010. One of the main findings of the CHED monitoring and evaluation team on 21-22 October 2010 was that the Quality Management System (QMS) was not yet ISO Certified, which was a key requirement as set out in Annex IV of CMO # 13, series of 2005. It therefore invited Bersales Consultancy to take the lead in establishing, recording and implementing a QMS based on ISO 9001:2008 International Standard and its training criteria.\n\nSSC-MEP manifested its desire in T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines Inc. for the Management System Certification on 24 November 2010. T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines is a subsidiary of T\u00dcV S\u00dcD Management Service GmbH, the largest T\u00dcV S\u00dcD group. Every maritime school shall have a certified quality standards system in accordance with the provisions of the Rules for a Quality Standards System in Maritime Academies as contained in Annex IV of CMO # 13, s. 2005.\n\nOn 07-08 January 2011, SSC-MEP conducted a Seminar-Workshop on QMS Documentation and Training Course on ISO 9001:2008 at the SSC Function Room. The resource person was the SSC-MEP ISO Consultant-Engr. Luther D. Bersales, an ISO Management System Consultant and trainer of the Bersales Consultancy, MMB Compound, Kinalumsan Road, Canjulao, Lapu-lapu City.\n\nDr. Taroc recommended to the SUC President II of Siquijor State College the implementation of the Executive Order (EO) No. 605, \u201cInstitutionalizing the Structure, Mechanisms and Standards to implement the Government Quality Management Program on 8 March 2011. The said EO directs all government agencies to adopt the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System as part of a government-wide quality management program. To this effect, all remaining colleges were hereby enjoined to develop ISO-QMS and pursue certification. However, people assigned for the ISO SSC-MEP would be utilized to have uniformity of all documents namely: Quality Assurance Manager (QAM), Quality Management Representative (QMR), Document and Data Controllers (DDC) and Internal Communication Officer (ICO). It means that all remaining colleges of the institution would be working for its ISO 9001:2008 compliance effective April 2011 so that by next year all colleges would be all ISO certified to wit: 1) College of Business and Management: BSBA, BSHRM, and BS Tourism Programs; 2) College of Technology: BS Indu Tech and BS Info Tech Programs; 3) College of Teacher Education: BEED and BSED Programs; and 4) College Arts & Sciences: BS Crim Program.\n\nOn 11-15 April 2011, Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot-Vice-President for Academic Affairs and at the same time Lead Auditor took part in the ISO 9001:2008 QMS Auditor/Lead Auditor Training Course in Cebu City. Hong Kong Veritas Limited has provided the Certificate of Completion for Dr. Quilicot in partnership with T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines. \n\nA Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was drafted on 14 November 2011 between AJA Registrars, Inc. as certification body for ISO 9001:2008 and Siquijor State College since T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Philippines encountered a problem during the bidding process. Consequently, the MOA was signed and strongly enforced on 03 April 2012. AJA represents the main countries in the development and adoption of standards: Anglo (U.K.) Japanese American. The first locally based certification body (CB) to obtain International Accreditation thru JAS-ANZ. \n\nConsequently, AJA Registrars conducted the On-Site Stage 1 Audit and Document Review of the developed QMS of SSC-MEP for the Provision of Maritime Education under ISO 9001:2008 on 10 April 2012 with Mrs. Remedios Cagulada as Lead Auditor and Mr. Kevin T. Castillon as Audit Team member. There were 9 audit findings raised by the auditors and in turn submitted a proposed action for the issues raised on 11 April 2012. It then successfully hurdled the Stage 2 (Final Stage): Certification Audit of the developed QMS on 11 May 2012 held at the SSC Function Room with Capt. Virginio Aris as Lead Auditor and Mr. Kevin T. Castillon as Audit Team member. Eventually, the Registration Certificate for '''ISO 9001:2008''' was released for the first time on 16 October 2012 having an ANZIC Code of 8431 and Certificate Number of AJA 12.0689 whose expiry date on 11 May 2015. This effort was headed by Dr. Roel Taroc as its MEP Director and at the same time the '''QMR''' with Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot-then Vice-President for Academic Affairs and '''Lead auditor''' at the same time. \n\nSSC-MEP successfully passed the Surveillance Audit conducted by the AJA Registrars Inc. for the Provision of Maritime Education under ISO 9001:2008 on 06 May 2013 with Dr. Mark Vera as Lead Auditor. The audit findings raised by the auditors were as follows: 0 major nonconformance, 2 minor nonconformance and 7 observations and in turn the SSC ISO Committee submitted a proposed action for the issues raised on 10 May 2013. To this effect, Dr. Taroc attended the IRCA-Approved ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Lead Auditor Training Course conducted by AJA Registrar's Incorporated on 01-05 July 2013 held at the Marco Polo Plaza Hotel, Cebu City. \n\nOn 06 May 2014, the Final Surveillance Audit for the Provision of Maritime Education under ISO 9001:2008 took place with Dr. Mark Vera as Lead Auditor. The audit findings raised by the auditors were as follows: 0 major nonconformance, 3 minor nonconformance and 5 observations and in turn the SSC ISO Committee submitted a proposed action for the issues raised on 10 May 2014. \n\nWhen Dr. Quilicot became the College President, the Lead Auditor position was vacated. So, Dr. Steven J. Sumaylo took over her place and served as Lead Auditor. In order to qualify himself as the new Lead Audtor, he was sent to attend the IRCA-Approved ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Lead Auditor Training Course on 23-27 June 2015 conducted by AJA Registrar's Incorporated held at the Marco Polo Plaza Hotel, Cebu City.\n\nThe ISO Certification of SSC-MEP was conducted by AJA Registrar's Incorporated as its Certifying Body with JAZ-ANZ as its Accreditation Body. ISO Certification's success has been attributed to support from the College President-Dr. R. Martinez Baldomero, Jr. It underwent another three consecutive years of monitoring audits and was re-registered on 01 July 2015 and with an expiry date of 11 May 2018.\n\nAlthough SSC-MEP was already re-registered for ISO 9001:2008, President Quilicot realized and decided to institutionalize the ISO certification in order for the school to be internationally competitive after two years of oversight audits. Accordingly, it underwent a surveillance audit to broaden its scope from 28 February to 01 March 2017, issued a Certificate of Attestation on 02 August 2017 and eventually, in September 2017, the Certificate of Registration and Scope of Registration for the '''Provision of Education Services covering Maritime and Non-Maritime''', ''(College of Education, Arts and Sciences, Business and Management, and College of Technology)'', and '''Graduate Education and General Administrative Services'''.\n\nThe specification for ISO 9001 has been updated to version 2015 due to the clientele's increasing demand for its approval. In addition, QMR has been modified to ISO Program Manager, and DDC has also been modified to Document Controller. With this progress, the College under the leadership of Dr. Roel D. Taroc as the ISO Program Manager toiled for its re-registration before its expiry date on 12 May 2018 and thus underwent a surveillance audit for '''ISO 9001:2015''' and was awarded certificate number AJA 12.0689 on 09 September 2018.\n\nThe quality of its ISO certification was achieved through the joint efforts of the SSC Administration led by the College President-Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot, members of IQA, all ISO Process Owners, ICO and DC, faculty and staff, students and stakeholders. As AJA Registrars' Incorporated is run by a new ISO Company, the official SSC Certifying Body is now '''SOCOTEC Certification Philippines, Incorporated'''. \n\nDr. Steven J. Sumaylo, Dr. Benita R. Padayhag and Dr. Marjorie P. Eslit resigned as Lead Auditor and IQA members, respectively on 13 February 2020. In order to avoid paralyzing the operation of the ISO Program, Dr. Dave S. Mamhot was recommended by the ISO Program Manager to take over the position of Dr. Sumaylo as Lead Auditor. In addition, additional IQA members have been added to ensure smooth operation of the ISO Certification.\n\nCurrently, the ISO Program Office as managed by Dr. Roel D. Taroc being the ISO Program Manager together with Engr. Hermilita L. Paculba as Document Controller (DC) and Mrs. Jonalyn L. Fuentes as the Internal Communication Officer (ICO) will be preparing for an internal and external audits to take place in May and another sometime in November of this year. The respective Deputy ISO Program Managers as well as the Deputy Document Controllers and Deputy ICOs of each Department as well as the General Administrative Services and other Key Personnel of the College will likewise prepare their respective ISO processes. This endeavor will be in collaboration with the Lead Auditor and IQA members for a smooth and effective ISO Program implementation.\n\n==Tri-Summer Physics Institute Program==\nFrom the renewed vitality of community life emerging from the 24th Annual National Physics Seminar-Workshop Convention of the Philippine Physics Society (PPS), an organization of physicists, physics professionals, physics teachers, physics students and physics enthusiasts which was hosted by Silliman University, a Regional Upgrading Seminar on Electricity, Optics and Modern Physics was held for the first time in SSC, Larena, Siquijor on 16-17 August 2002 with Mr. Roel D. Taroc as the Seminar Coordinator. This resulted in the formation of the PPS-Siquijor Chapter with its pioneer set of officers as follows: President-Roel D. Taroc of SSC, Vice-President-Nicarter B. Lomocso of DepEd-Siquijor, Secretary-Angeles Jra. J. Anoos of Siquijor Provincial Science High School, Treasurer-Marjorie P. Eslit of SSC, Auditor-Arthur P. Lagorra of Basac High School, Business Manager-Engr. Bryanpete R. Tabada of SSC, PRO-Oscar S. Moreno of Po-o High School and Engr. Lemuel D. Banglos of SSC .  \n\t\nThe idea of the Tri-Summer Institute degree program cropped up during a lunch at the residence of Superintendent Aleli Rojo-Abne in Banban, Siquijor, Siquijor on 17 August 2002. It all started when Dr. Gerardo C. Maxino, PPS National President and then Professor of Physics at Silliman University made a proposal to Dr. Dominador Q. Cabanganan, then SSC President to offer Master\u2019s degree program in Physics Teaching at Siquijor State College. He was seconded by his wife-Dr. Vicenta Cabahug-Maxino, PPS National Secretary, his sister-Dr. Hope Maxino-Bandal, Chairperson of the Physics Department of Silliman University. While Mr. Nicarter B. Lomocso, ES I (Science), Division of Siquijor, Mr. Roel D. Taroc, President of the PPS-Siquijor Chapter, Engr. Lauro Casocot and Engr. Raymund Vizacarra of Ateneo de Davao University, Clare Maxino of Ateneo de Manila University, Vanessa Bandal of Silliman University and Mrs. Angeles Jra. Anoos, Secretary of PPS-Siquijor Chapter readily and enthusiastically gave a positive response as a sign of their strong support to the proposed program. \n\nConsequently, President Cabanganan designated Mr. Roel D. Taroc as the MAST-Physics Program Coordinator to take charge of the program being the latter a holder of a Master of Arts in Science Teaching major in Physics degree at the University of San Carlos, Cebu City in 1999 where Dr. Ed van den Berg was his Thesis Adviser. The degree program was designed for a tri-summer institute program including thesis with a total units of 36 which means that a student would carry a load of 12 units per summer. The students would finish the crash program in just three summer terms. The curriculum was scrutinized by a group of Physics experts from the PPS before it was submitted to the SSC Board of Trustees for approval. It was approved during the 29th Regular Meeting of the SSC Board of Trustees on 26 February 2003 at Cebu Normal University (CNU), Cebu City. The program was offered by Siquijor State College in cooperation with the Philippine Physics Society (PPS) and the CHED Center of Development in Physics, Physics Department of Silliman University, Dumaguete City and Ateneo de Davao University, Davao City. The program was under the supervision of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs and assisted by the Program Coordinator and the Dean of the Graduate Studies. \n\nIn Summer 2003, Fr. Francisco Glover of Ateneo de Davao University, Davao City came to SSC to teach Mathematical Physics during the first summer term of the Tri-Summer Institute program. In fact, during his short stay in SSC, he was able to come up with the design of the General Physics and Natural Science Laboratories of Siquijor State College on 20 April 2003. The program has an initial enrolment of 18 students categorized as follows: 2 from Iloilo; 1 from Cagayan de Oro City; 5 from SSC; 1 from TESDA-LNAS; and 9 from DepEd Siquijor. In Summer 2004 the enrollment went down to 12. On 19 June 2005, a special graduation ceremony held at Siquijor State College granted the degree Master of Arts in Science Teaching (Physics) to ten of the participants and the degree Master in Teaching (Physics) to three of the participants with Dr. Enrique P. Grecia, Regional Director of CHEDRO VII as Commencement Speaker.\n\nWith the continued support of Siquijor State College to the PPS Community, SSC was chosen to host one annual convention. Eventually, SSC graciously hosted the 30th Annual National Physics Seminar-Workshop Convention, 21st National Physics Olympics & 16th National Physics Fair of the Philippine Physics Society during the PPS Jade Celebration on 02-05 April 2008 with the theme: \u201cPhysics and Magic, Mystics, and Wizardry.\u201d \n\nDue to the retirement of Dr. Gerardo C. Maxino, National President of the PPS and Physics Professor of Silliman University in 2006, he eventually opened the Maxino College at Bagacay, Dumaguete City in 2007. Hence, the office and publication of the PPS was then transferred officially at Maxino College. On 12 May 2010, Dr. Maxino visited SSC and presented the proposal to the new SSC College President, Dr. Baldomero R. Martinez, Jr. The latter agreed to offer the second batch of the Tri-Summer Institute Physics program at Siquijor State College starting Summer 2011 after informing the Board of Trustees of the schedule. This was the very reason why the second batch of the Tri-Summer Institute Physics program was a cooperative program among Siquijor State College, the Philippine Physics Society (PPS), and Maxino College, Dumaguete City and Ateneo de Davao Univeristy, Davao City.\n\nIn Summer 2011, the program has an initial enrolment of 13 students categorized as follows: 8 from Dumaguete City ( 6 from Maxino College, 1 from Silliman University and 1 from Junob HS); 3 from Cebu City (2 from Bethany Christian School); 1 from Siquijor State College, Larena, Siquijor, and 1 from Surigao State College of Technology, Surigao City. In Summer 2012, the enrollment went down to 9. On 26 July 2013, a special graduation ceremony held at Siquijor State College granted the degree Master of Science in Science Education major in Physics Teaching to eight of the participants and the degree Master in Teaching (Physics) to one of the participants with Dr. Marcelo T. Lopez, University President of Cebu Normal University as Commencement Speaker.\n\nThe third and final batch of the Tri-Summer Institute Physics program was reaffirmed per Board Resolution No. 17 s. 2017 during the 83rd Regular Meeting of the SSC Board of Trustees on 11 May 2017 at Coco Grove Beach Resort, San Juan, Siquijor. The MS Science Education major in Physics Teaching Program was offered at Siquijor State College in cooperation with the Philippine Physics Society, Maxino College, Dumaguete City and Ateneo de Davao University, Davao City that started in Summer 2015 and ended in Summer 2017. This program was under the leadership of the fourth and first woman president of Siquijor State College, SUC President II-Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot. \n\nOn 17 November 2017, a special graduation ceremony held at Siquijor State College granted the degree Master of Science in Science Education major in Physics Teaching to four (4) participants with Dr. Peter T. Dayot, Retired Physics Professor and OIC-President of Negros Oriental State University as the Commencement Speaker. The theme of the Special Graduation is \u201cPioneering an Innovative Physics Graduate Program for Scientific Manpower Essential to National Development.\u201d\n\n==Academic Programs==\n'''College of Arts, Engineering and Sciences (CAES)'''\n*Bachelor of Arts ''Major in English (AB-English)<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Arts ''Major in Filipino (AB-Filipino)<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science ''Major in Developmental Communication (BS Dev Com)<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science ''Major in Mathematics (BS Math)<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science ''Major in Political Science (BS Pol Sci)<br/>''\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering''' (BSCE)<br/>''\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering''' (BSEE)<br/>''\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering''' (BSME)<br/>''\n*Senior High School-''STEM Strand''\n\n'''College of Business and Management (CBM)'''\n*Master in Public Management ''(MPM) Level III Phase 1 qualifier<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Business Administration ''Major in General Management (BSBA-GM) Level III-AACCUP Re-Accredited''<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Business Administration ''Major in Human Resource Management (BSBA-HRM)''<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Business Administration ''Major in Marketing (BSBA-Marketing)''<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management ''(BSHM) Level III-AACCUP Re-Accredited<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Tourism ''(BSTM) Level III Phase 1 qualifier<br/>''\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness Management''' (BSAM)<br/>''\n*Senior High School-''ABM/Agribusiness/Tour Guiding Strands''\n\n'''College of Criminal Justice Education (CJE)'''\n*Bachelor of Science in Criminology ''(BS Crim) Level II-AACCUP Accredited<br/>''\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Science in Legal Management''' (BSLM)<br/>''\n*Senior High School-''HUMSS Strand''\n\n'''College of Education (COE)'''\n*Master in Educational Management ''(MEM) Level II-AACCUP Re-Accredited<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Elementary Education '' (BEED) Level III-AACCUP Re-Accredited<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Secondary Education ''Major in English (BSED-Eng) Level III-AACCUP Re-Accredited<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Secondary Education ''Major in Mathematics (BSED-Math) Level III-AACCUP Re-Accredited<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Secondary Education ''Major in Filipino (BSED-Fil) <br/>''\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Early Childhood Education''' (BECEd)<br/>''\n*Senior High School-''GAS Strand''\n*Junior High School\n\n''' College of Technology (COT) '''\n*Master of Arts in Industrial Education ''(MAIE)''<br/>\n*Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology ''Major in Electronics Technology (BS Indu Tech-Electronics) Level III Phase 1 qualifier<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology ''Major in Electricity Technology (BS Indu Tech-Electricity) Level III Phase 1 qualifier<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology ''Major in Mechanical Technology (BS Indu Tech-Mechanical) Level III Phase 1 qualifier<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology ''Major in Automotive Technology (BS Indu Tech-Automotive) Level III Phase 1 qualifier<br/>''\n*Bachelor of Science in Information Technology ''(BS Info Tech) Level II- AACCUP Re-Accredited<br/>''\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Library and Information System''' (BLIS)<br/>''\n*Senior High School-''TVL/Computer Programming Strand''\n\n''' Maritime Education Program (MEP)'''\n*Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation ''(BSMT)''<br/>\n*Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering ''(BSMarE)''<br/>\n*Enhanced Support Level Program for Marine Deck ''(ESLPMD)''<br/>\n*Enhanced Support Level Program for Marine Engineering ''(ESLPME)''<br/>\n*'''''+ Bachelor of Science in Cruise Ship Management''' (BSCSM)<br/>''\n*Senior High School-''Maritime Strand''\n\n'''Legend:<br/>'''\n'' '''+ The newly proposed courses''' as well as the '''opening of a separate department''' will be effective for the '''first semester of the school year 2020-2021'''  subject, however, to the approval of the members of the Board of Trustees.''\n\n==References==\n'''SUNRISE''', ''A Journal of the Secondary Education Department, College of Education Research and Development'', 1(1), June 2004-March 2005, ISSN 1908-7926, pp.&nbsp;11\u201314.\n\n'''SUNRISE''', ''A Journal of the Secondary Education Department, College of Education Research and Development'', 2(1), June 2005-December 2006, ISSN 1908-7926, pp.&nbsp;11\u201316.\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.siquijorstate.edu.ph\n{{coord missing|Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:State universities and colleges in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1920]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Siquijor]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siquijor_State_College"}
