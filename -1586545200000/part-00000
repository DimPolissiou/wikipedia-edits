The President and chairman of the zoo is Y. Bhg. Dato' Ismail Hutson.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Mycteria leucocephala -Zoo Negara-8a.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Milky stork]]\nIn 1957, the Malayan Agri-Horticultural Association (MAHA) opened a miniature zoo. After the creation of the mini-zoo, the idea of proper zoo gradually gained momentum, and the federal government chose a spot in [[Ulu Klang]], Selangor next to the border of [[Kuala Lumpur]]. In the 1960s, Ulu Klang was an undeveloped green area. In 1963, the first Prime Minister of Malaya (now Malaysia) YTM [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] opened the zoo to the public. Zoo Negara was known as the \"Zoo in the Jungle\" due to the greenery that surrounded the area.\n\nThe zoo welcomed its millionth visitor on 14 February 1966, just three years after opening, and by 1986, the zoo was welcoming over 1 million visitors per year.<ref name=\"zoo_history\"/>\n\nThe area surrounding the zoo was covered with thick vegetation until the late 1970s as [[Kuala Lumpur]] underwent an [[economic boom]]. Given Ulu Klang's close proximity with Kuala Lumpur, the area was opened for large scale development as a planned residential area in the 1980s. It has expanded in terms of population ever since. The development has caused the zoo's surrounding areas and also increases the land value where the zoo is located.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were plans to move the zoo to other locations in [[Selangor]]. However, the plans were largely unpopular among the public as it is seen as an effort by some developers to capitalise on the value of the zoo's large land. With the support from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the [Selangor] State Government, Zoo Negara will not be relocated.\n\n==Getting there==\n*Using [[Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2|Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2)]] \u2013 from Ampang, u-turn at the [[Taman Melawati]] exit and take the first left; from Gombak, take the first left after the [[Taman Melawati]] exit flyover.\n*Hop on the [[Metrobus Nationwide|Metrobus]] bus 16 from [[Central Market, Malaysia|Central Market]].

The tube contains [[ethanol|alcohol]] and is closed with a piece of cork. By heating the alcohol, the vapors fill in the space, increasing the pressure in the tube to the point of the cork popping out. (Warning: this experiment should only be performed with safety glasses on!)]]\n\n{{Use American English|date = September 2019}}\n\n'''Vapor pressure''' (or vapour pressure in [[British English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|see spelling differences]]) or '''equilibrium vapor pressure''' is defined as the [[pressure]] exerted by a [[vapor]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its [[Condensation|condensed]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a [[Thermodynamic system#Closed system|closed system]]. The equilibrium vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's [[evaporation]] rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as ''[[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]''. The pressure exhibited by vapor present above a liquid surface is known as vapor pressure. As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules transitioning into a vapor also increases, thereby increasing the vapor pressure.\n\nThe vapor pressure of any substance increases non-linearly with temperature according to the [[Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation]]. The [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome [[atmospheric pressure]] and lift the liquid to form vapor bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher temperature due to the higher fluid pressure, because fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases. More important at shallow depths is the higher temperature required to start bubble formation. The surface tension of the bubble wall leads to an overpressure in the very small, initial bubbles. \n\nThe vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure]]. For example, air at sea level, and saturated with water vapor at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, has partial pressures of about 2.3 kPa of water, 78 kPa of [[nitrogen]], 21 kPa of [[oxygen]] and 0.9 kPa of [[argon]], totaling 102.2 kPa, making the basis for [[atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheric pressure]].\n\n==Measurement and units==\nVapor pressure is measured in the standard units of [[pressure]]. The [[International System of Units]] (SI) recognizes pressure as a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] with the dimension of force per area and designates the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa) as its standard unit. One pascal is one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square meter]] (N\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup> or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>).\n\nExperimental measurement of vapor pressure is a simple procedure for common pressures between 1 and 200 kPa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |title=Vapor Pressure of Organic Compounds.

Procedures often consist of purifying the test substance, isolating it in a container, evacuating any foreign gas, then measuring the equilibrium pressure of the gaseous phase of the substance in the container at different temperatures. Better accuracy is achieved when care is taken to ensure that the entire substance and its vapor are at the prescribed temperature. This is often done, as with the use of an [[isoteniscope]], by submerging the containment area in a liquid bath.\n\nVery low vapor pressures of solids can be measured using the [[Knudsen effusion cell]] method.\n\nIn a medical context, vapor pressure is sometimes expressed in other units, specifically [[Millimeter of mercury|millimeters of mercury (mmHg)]]. This is important for [[volatile anesthetics]], most of which are liquids at body temperature, but with a relatively high vapor pressure. Anesthetics with a higher vapor pressure at body temperature will be excreted more quickly, as they are exhaled from the lungs.\n\n==Estimating vapor pressures with Antoine equation==\n\nThe [[Antoine equation]]<ref name=frostburg>[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/liquids/faq/antoine-vapor-pressure.shtml What is the Antoine Equation?] (Chemistry Department, [[Frostburg State University]], [[Maryland]])</ref><ref name=Sinnot>{{cite book|author=Sinnot, R.K.|title=Chemical Engineering Design]|edition=4th|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2005|page=331|isbn=978-0-7506-6538-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJaxUL3numgC&pg=PA331 }}</ref> is a pragmatic mathematical expression of the relation between the vapor pressure and the temperature of pure liquid or solid substances. It is obtained by curve-fitting and is adapted to the fact that vapor pressure is usually increasing and concave as a function of temperature. The basic form of the equation is:\n\n:<math>\\log P = A-\\frac{B}{C+T}</math>\n\nand it can be transformed into this temperature-explicit form:\n\n:<math>T = \\frac{B}{A-\\log P} - C</math>\n\nwhere:\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>P</math></span> is the absolute vapor pressure of a substance<br>\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:+15%;\"><span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>T</math></span> is the temperature of the substance</span>\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>A</math></span>, <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>B</math></span> and <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>C</math></span> are substance-specific coefficients (i.e., constants or parameters)\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:-30%;\"><math>\\log</math> is typically either <math>\\log_{10}</math> or <math>\\log_e</math></span><ref name=Sinnot/>\n\nA simpler form of the equation with only two coefficients is sometimes used:\n\n:<math>\\log P = A-\\frac{B}{T}</math>\n\nwhich can be transformed to:\n\n:<math>T = \\frac{B}{A-\\log P}</math>\n\nSublimations and vaporizations of the same substance have separate sets of Antoine coefficients, as do components in mixtures.<ref name=frostburg/> Each parameter set for a specific compound is only applicable over a specified temperature range. Generally, temperature ranges are chosen to maintain the equation's accuracy of a few up to 8\u201310 percent. For many volatile substances, several different sets of parameters are available and used for different temperature ranges. The Antoine equation has poor accuracy with any single parameter set when used from a compound's melting point to its critical temperature. Accuracy is also usually poor when vapor pressure is under 10 Torr because of the limitations of the apparatus{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} used to establish the Antoine parameter values.\n\nThe Wagner equation<ref>{{Citation|last= Wagner|first= W.|title= New vapour pressure measurements for argon and nitrogen and a new method for establishing rational vapour pressure equations|journal= Cryogenics|volume= 13|issue= 8|pages= 470\u2013482 |year= 1973|doi=  10.1016/0011-2275(73)90003-9|bibcode = 1973Cryo...13..470W }}</ref> gives \"one of the best\"<ref>Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 7th Ed. pp. 4\u201315</ref> fits to experimental data but is quite complex.

A nearly straight line is obtained when the logarithm of the vapor pressure is plotted against 1/(T + 230)<ref>{{cite news|author1=Dreisbach, R. R.  |author2=Spencer, R.

The vapor pressure of a liquid at its boiling point equals the pressure of its surrounding environment.\n\n==Liquid mixtures==\n[[Raoult's law]] gives an approximation to the vapor pressure of mixtures of liquids. It states that the activity (pressure or [[fugacity]]) of a single-phase mixture is equal to the mole-fraction-weighted sum of the components' vapor pressures:\n\n:<math> P_{\\rm tot} =\\sum_i P y_i = \\sum_i P_i^{\\rm sat} x_i \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>P_{\\rm tot}</math> is the mixture's vapor pressure, <math>x_i</math> is the [[mole fraction]] of component <math>i</math> in the liquid phase and <math>y\n_i</math> is the [[mole fraction]] of component <math>i</math> in the vapor phase respectively. <math>P_i^{\\rm sat}</math> is the vapor pressure of component <math>i</math>. Raoult's law is applicable only to non-electrolytes (uncharged species); it is most appropriate for non-polar molecules with only weak intermolecular attractions (such as [[London force]]s).\n\nSystems that have vapor pressures higher than indicated by the above formula are said to have positive deviations. Such a deviation suggests weaker intermolecular attraction than in the pure components, so that the molecules can be thought of as being \"held in\" the liquid phase less strongly than in the pure liquid. An example is the [[azeotrope]] of approximately 95% ethanol and water. Because the azeotrope's vapor pressure is higher than predicted by Raoult's law, it boils at a temperature below that of either pure component.\n\nThere are also systems with negative deviations that have vapor pressures that are lower than expected. Such a deviation is evidence for stronger intermolecular attraction between the constituents of the mixture than exists in the pure components. Thus, the molecules are \"held in\" the liquid more strongly when a second molecule is present. An example is a mixture of trichloromethane (chloroform) and 2-propanone (acetone), which boils above the boiling point of either pure component.\n\nThe negative and positive deviations can be used to determine [[thermodynamic activity]] coefficients of the components of mixtures.\n\n==Solids==\n[[Image:Vapor Pressure Curve of Liquid and Solid Benzene.png|thumb|300px|Vapor pressure of liquid and solid benzene]]\nEquilibrium vapor pressure can be defined as the pressure reached when a condensed phase is in equilibrium with its own vapor. In the case of an equilibrium solid, such as a [[crystal]], this can be defined as the pressure when the rate of [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of a solid matches the rate of deposition of its vapor phase. For most solids this pressure is very low, but some notable exceptions are [[naphthalene]], [[dry ice]] (the vapor pressure of dry ice is 5.73 MPa (831 psi, 56.5 atm) at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, which causes most sealed containers to rupture), and ice. All solid materials have a vapor pressure. However, due to their often extremely low values, measurement can be rather difficult. Typical techniques include the use of [[thermogravimetry]] and gas transpiration.\n\nThere are a number of methods for calculating the sublimation pressure (i.e., the vapor pressure) of a solid.

The equilibrium vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's [[evaporation]] rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as ''[[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]''. The pressure exhibited by vapor present above a liquid surface is known as vapor pressure. As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules transitioning into a vapor also increases, thereby increasing the vapor pressure.\n\nThe vapor pressure of any substance increases non-linearly with temperature according to the [[Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation]]. The [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome [[atmospheric pressure]] and lift the liquid to form vapor bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher temperature due to the higher fluid pressure, because fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases. More important at shallow depths is the higher temperature required to start bubble formation. The surface tension of the bubble wall leads to an overpressure in the very small, initial bubbles. \n\nThe vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure]]. For example, air at sea level, and saturated with water vapor at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, has partial pressures of about 2.3 kPa of water, 78 kPa of [[nitrogen]], 21 kPa of [[oxygen]] and 0.9 kPa of [[argon]], totaling 102.2 kPa, making the basis for [[atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheric pressure]].\n\n==Measurement and units==\nVapor pressure is measured in the standard units of [[pressure]]. The [[International System of Units]] (SI) recognizes pressure as a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] with the dimension of force per area and designates the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa) as its standard unit. One pascal is one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square meter]] (N\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup> or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>).\n\nExperimental measurement of vapor pressure is a simple procedure for common pressures between 1 and 200 kPa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |title=Vapor Pressure of Organic Compounds.

Procedures often consist of purifying the test substance, isolating it in a container, evacuating any foreign gas, then measuring the equilibrium pressure of the gaseous phase of the substance in the container at different temperatures. Better accuracy is achieved when care is taken to ensure that the entire substance and its vapor are at the prescribed temperature. This is often done, as with the use of an [[isoteniscope]], by submerging the containment area in a liquid bath.\n\nVery low vapor pressures of solids can be measured using the [[Knudsen effusion cell]] method.\n\nIn a medical context, vapor pressure is sometimes expressed in other units, specifically [[Millimeter of mercury|millimeters of mercury (mmHg)]]. This is important for [[volatile anesthetics]], most of which are liquids at body temperature, but with a relatively high vapor pressure. Anesthetics with a higher vapor pressure at body temperature will be excreted more quickly, as they are exhaled from the lungs.\n\n==Estimating vapor pressures with Antoine equation==\n\nThe [[Antoine equation]]<ref name=frostburg>[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/liquids/faq/antoine-vapor-pressure.shtml What is the Antoine Equation?] (Chemistry Department, [[Frostburg State University]], [[Maryland]])</ref><ref name=Sinnot>{{cite book|author=Sinnot, R.K.|title=Chemical Engineering Design]|edition=4th|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2005|page=331|isbn=978-0-7506-6538-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJaxUL3numgC&pg=PA331 }}</ref> is a pragmatic mathematical expression of the relation between the vapor pressure and the temperature of pure liquid or solid substances. It is obtained by curve-fitting and is adapted to the fact that vapor pressure is usually increasing and concave as a function of temperature. The basic form of the equation is:\n\n:<math>\\log P = A-\\frac{B}{C+T}</math>\n\nand it can be transformed into this temperature-explicit form:\n\n:<math>T = \\frac{B}{A-\\log P} - C</math>\n\nwhere:\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>P</math></span> is the absolute vapor pressure of a substance<br>\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:+15%;\"><span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>T</math></span> is the temperature of the substance</span>\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>A</math></span>, <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>B</math></span> and <span style=\"vertical-align:+12%;\"><math>C</math></span> are substance-specific coefficients (i.e., constants or parameters)\n: <span style=\"vertical-align:-30%;\"><math>\\log</math> is typically either <math>\\log_{10}</math> or <math>\\log_e</math></span><ref name=Sinnot/>\n\nA simpler form of the equation with only two coefficients is sometimes used:\n\n:<math>\\log P = A-\\frac{B}{T}</math>\n\nwhich can be transformed to:\n\n:<math>T = \\frac{B}{A-\\log P}</math>\n\nSublimations and vaporizations of the same substance have separate sets of Antoine coefficients, as do components in mixtures.<ref name=frostburg/> Each parameter set for a specific compound is only applicable over a specified temperature range. Generally, temperature ranges are chosen to maintain the equation's accuracy of a few up to 8\u201310 percent. For many volatile substances, several different sets of parameters are available and used for different temperature ranges. The Antoine equation has poor accuracy with any single parameter set when used from a compound's melting point to its critical temperature. Accuracy is also usually poor when vapor pressure is under 10 Torr because of the limitations of the apparatus{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} used to establish the Antoine parameter values.\n\nThe Wagner equation<ref>{{Citation|last= Wagner|first= W.|title= New vapour pressure measurements for argon and nitrogen and a new method for establishing rational vapour pressure equations|journal= Cryogenics|volume= 13|issue= 8|pages= 470\u2013482 |year= 1973|doi=  10.1016/0011-2275(73)90003-9|bibcode = 1973Cryo...13..470W }}</ref> gives \"one of the best\"<ref>Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 7th Ed. pp. 4\u201315</ref> fits to experimental data but is quite complex.

A nearly straight line is obtained when the logarithm of the vapor pressure is plotted against 1/(T + 230)<ref>{{cite news|author1=Dreisbach, R. R.  |author2=Spencer, R.

The vapor pressure of a liquid at its boiling point equals the pressure of its surrounding environment.\n\n==Liquid mixtures==\n[[Raoult's law]] gives an approximation to the vapor pressure of mixtures of liquids. It states that the activity (pressure or [[fugacity]]) of a single-phase mixture is equal to the mole-fraction-weighted sum of the components' vapor pressures:\n\n:<math> P_{\\rm tot} =\\sum_i P y_i = \\sum_i P_i^{\\rm sat} x_i \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>P_{\\rm tot}</math> is the mixture's vapor pressure, <math>x_i</math> is the [[mole fraction]] of component <math>i</math> in the liquid phase and <math>y\n_i</math> is the [[mole fraction]] of component <math>i</math> in the vapor phase respectively. <math>P_i^{\\rm sat}</math> is the vapor pressure of component <math>i</math>. Raoult's law is applicable only to non-electrolytes (uncharged species); it is most appropriate for non-polar molecules with only weak intermolecular attractions (such as [[London force]]s).\n\nSystems that have vapor pressures higher than indicated by the above formula are said to have positive deviations. Such a deviation suggests weaker intermolecular attraction than in the pure components, so that the molecules can be thought of as being \"held in\" the liquid phase less strongly than in the pure liquid. An example is the [[azeotrope]] of approximately 95% ethanol and water. Because the azeotrope's vapor pressure is higher than predicted by Raoult's law, it boils at a temperature below that of either pure component.\n\nThere are also systems with negative deviations that have vapor pressures that are lower than expected. Such a deviation is evidence for stronger intermolecular attraction between the constituents of the mixture than exists in the pure components. Thus, the molecules are \"held in\" the liquid more strongly when a second molecule is present. An example is a mixture of trichloromethane (chloroform) and 2-propanone (acetone), which boils above the boiling point of either pure component.\n\nThe negative and positive deviations can be used to determine [[thermodynamic activity]] coefficients of the components of mixtures.\n\n==Solids==\n[[Image:Vapor Pressure Curve of Liquid and Solid Benzene.png|thumb|300px|Vapor pressure of liquid and solid benzene]]\nEquilibrium vapor pressure can be defined as the pressure reached when a condensed phase is in equilibrium with its own vapor. In the case of an equilibrium solid, such as a [[crystal]], this can be defined as the pressure when the rate of [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of a solid matches the rate of deposition of its vapor phase. For most solids this pressure is very low, but some notable exceptions are [[naphthalene]], [[dry ice]] (the vapor pressure of dry ice is 5.73 MPa (831 psi, 56.5 atm) at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, which causes most sealed containers to rupture), and ice. All solid materials have a vapor pressure. However, due to their often extremely low values, measurement can be rather difficult. Typical techniques include the use of [[thermogravimetry]] and gas transpiration.\n\nThere are a number of methods for calculating the sublimation pressure (i.e., the vapor pressure) of a solid. One method is to estimate the sublimation pressure from extrapolated liquid vapor pressures (of the supercooled liquid), if the [[Enthalpy of fusion|heat of fusion]] is known, by using this particular form of the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation:<ref name=\"Moller\">{{cite journal|author1=Moller B. |author2=Rarey J. |author3=Ramjugernath D. |title=Estimation of the vapour pressure of non-electrolyte organic compounds via group contributions and group interactions|journal=Journal of Molecular Liquids|volume=143|pages=52\u201363|doi=10.1016/j.molliq.2008.04.020 |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\ln\\,P^{\\rm sub}_{\\rm s} = \\ln\\,P^{\\rm sub}_{\\rm l} - \\frac{\\Delta_{\\rm fus}H}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\rm sub}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\rm fus}} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n* <math>P^{\\rm sub}_{\\rm s}</math> is the sublimation pressure of the solid component at the temperature <math> T_{\\rm sub} < T_{\\rm fus} </math>.\n* <math> P^{\\rm sub}_{\\rm l}</math> is the extrapolated vapor pressure of the liquid component at the temperature <math> T_{\\rm sub} < T_{\\rm fus} </math>.\n* <math>\\Delta_{\\rm fus}H </math> is the heat of fusion.\n* <math>R</math> is the [[gas constant]].\n* <math>T_{\\rm sub}</math> is the sublimation temperature.\n* <math>T_{\\rm fus}</math> is the melting point temperature.\n\nThis method assumes that the heat of fusion is temperature-independent, ignores additional transition temperatures between different solid phases, and it gives a fair estimation for temperatures not too far from the melting point.

The movement's slogan \"Home of the global revolution in Ottawa\" refers to its inspiration by, and association with, the [[Arab Spring]], [[Occupy Wall Street]] and the global [[Occupy movement|Occupy Movement]], which protests growing economic inequality, corporate greed, and the influence of corporations and lobbyists on electoral politics and government. Occupy Ottawa seeks global economic, social, political and [[environmental justice]].\n\nAs of June 2012, Occupy Ottawa had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.occupyottawa.org/calendar | title=Occupy Ottawa: Official Calendar | publisher=Occupy-ottawa.org | accessdate=March 5, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310051701/http://www.occupyottawa.org/calendar | archivedate=March 10, 2012 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{History of Ottawa}}\n\n==Global Day of Action==\nOn October 15, 2011, the Global Day of Action, over 700 demonstrators gathered around \"Freedom Fountain\" in Confederation Park for the movement's launch for its inaugural [[General assembly (Occupy movement)|General Assembly]]. Founding facilitators Ben Powless (Mohawk, Six Nations, Ontario) and Brigette \"the Rogue Page\" Depape discussed the Occupy Movement's trademark consensus-based democratic processes of deciding and debating issues and protest actions. They discussed the Occupy movement's overriding commitment to [[participatory democracy]], [[direct democracy]], \"majority consensus\", and stressed the importance of a peaceful demonstration. They also voted to occupy Confederation Park indefinitely. Prominent Canadian public figures among the crowd that day include Green Party leader and Federal [[House of Commons of Canada|MP]], [[Elizabeth May]] and activist Brigette DePape, a former [[Canadian Senate Page Program]], who famously held up a \"Stop [[Stephen Harper|Harper]]!\" protest sign during the [[throne speech]] of the [[Government of Canada]] in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in the summer of 2011.\n\n==Encampment==\nImmediately after the General Assembly, activists set up tents on the northeast corner of the park at the intersection of Laurier Avenue and Elgin Street. Within two weeks, the movement's \"tent city\" comprised more than 60 tents and tarp-covered shelters, including a kitchen, donations tent and media tent. Somewhere between 75 and 100 people consistently slept in the park. The kitchen, sustained through generous in-kind and cash donations from the public, served activists, visitors and the city's homeless.\n\n==Protest actions==\n[[File:Occupy Ottawa Occupons Ottawa (2).jpg|thumb|An Occupy Ottawa gathering]]\n\nOccupy Ottawa or its allies in the capital region organized a series of high-impact public actions. For the most part the movement focused on the issues at the heart of the Occupy movement. However, Occupy Ottawa also undertook actions targeting the national legislative agenda. In fact, some of the actions raised the question whether the movement intends to eventually become political. For example, during its December 3 General Assembly, the movement approved the creation of a \"Political Action Committee\". The committee's mandate was to create a \"political mandate\", and spearhead political actions, for the movement.\n\n===Second global day of action===\nOn November 17, Occupy Ottawa activists held simultaneous marches on four key and politically charged Ottawa landmarks. One group marched on the [[Canadian Tribute to Human Rights|Human Rights Monument]] to highlight the movement's unequivocal commitment to [[human rights]]. The second marched on Sparks Street Mall, Ottawa's corporate and media hub. The group sought to restate the Occupy movement's expressed stance against unfettered [[corporate greed]], growing [[economic inequality]] and the perceived [[mainstream media]] collusion with the dominant political and economic forces.\n\nThe third group targeted two landmarks. First, it marched on the city's Novotel Hotel to protest the hotel's efforts to squash workers' rights too unionize. From there, the group marched through the [[Rideau Centre]], the [[Byward Market]]. It finally converged on the [[Embassy of the United States, Ottawa|United States Embassy]] on [[Sussex Drive]] to express solidarity with [[Occupy Wall Street]], and protest the eviction and police brutality the movement faced at the time.\n\nLater, the three groups later converged on [[Parliament Hill]].\n\n===Omnibus crime bill C-10===\nOn Saturday, November 26, an estimated 300 activists turned up to peacefully protest the controversial Conservative government's bill, which was currently under debate in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The protest was organized under the aegis of the \"Occupy Ottawa Coalition to End Crime Bill C-10\". The nine speakers of the day included Angus Toulouse, the regional Chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]], [[Francoise Boivin|Fran\u00e7oise Boivin]], an MP from the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), [[Landon Pearson]], a former Senator, and representatives of the [[John Howard Society|John Howard Society of Canada]], Odawa Native Friendship Centre and Muslims for Progressive Values.\n\n===Solidarity actions===\nAs the crackdown on Occupy camps across Canada intensified, Occupy Ottawa seemed to expand its focus and reach.\n\n====Solidarity visit to Occupy Kingston====\nTuesday, December 6, 2011, was a crucial day for Occupy Kingston. It was the day the [[Kingston City Council]] voted to evict the occupiers, who had been encamped in Confederation Park since October 15. Occupy Ottawa activists visited their fellow occupiers and were present in the council chambers when the council voted 7-6 against Occupy Kingston.\n\n====Solidarity with Syria and Egypt====\nOn Thursday, December 8, Occupy Ottawa activists participate in a march in support of the struggle for democracy and political change in [[2011-2012 Syrian uprising|Syria]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]].\n\n====Perth visit====\nOn Sunday, December 11, Occupy Ottawa speakers visited [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]], 83&nbsp;km outside Ottawa to share their collective and personal experiences with the locals. Over 100 people packed a local pub, O'Reilly's, to hear the speakers. Following the visit, a new Occupy movement, Occupy Lanark County, emerged.\n\n==Controversies==\nOccupy Ottawa was initially met by a positive public-perception. Some citizens turned against the movement after issues were raised concerning hygiene, environmental impacts on the city park, drug use, and claims and complaints of rape and assault.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Parking+noise+drug+Occupy+Ottawa+beefs/6182599/story.html | title=Parking, noise, drug use top Occupy Ottawa beefs | publisher=Ottawa Citizen | date=February 21, 2012 | accessdate=March 18, 2012 |author1=Cockburn, Neco |author2=Brownlee, Mark }}</ref>\n\n==Public response==\nOccupy Ottawa's occupation of Confederation Park was largely peaceful with a commitment to nonviolence throughout numerous protest actions.\n\n==Eviction and defiance==\nAfter weeks of uncertainty, Occupy Ottawa's fate on Confederation Park was decided on the morning of November 21, 2011. The [[National Capital Commission]] (NCC), the [[Canadian Crown Corporation]] responsible for the park, served the movement with the notice of eviction. More than 300 people gathered for the movement's 6.30pm General Assembly, which unanimously voted to peacefully resist the eviction. In a statement, the movement said:\n\n<blockquote>We began this movement because we want positive change and we know that the old ways of political participation aren't working. These officials are doing the bidding of the 1%. They don't want to listen or engage in dialogue with us because they know we are already changing the conversation in this city, in this country and globally. We will offer dignified and principled resistance to those who try to force us out of public space.</blockquote>\n\nEight protesters vowed to stay on the park and make a last, peaceful, stand. The rest vowed to stick around and support them. The deadline came and passed without any action from the authorities. Still, up to 100 protesters remained on the park throughout most of the night and waited. However, by the end of the next day, signs of fatigue began to appear. The numbers dwindled. Some of the protesters suggested that the authorities were playing mind games and sought to wear the protesters out. There is some truth to the allegation. By evening, the numbers had dwindled to less than 30.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, November 23, 2011, around 2.00am, an estimated 150 officers from the [[Ottawa Police]] moved into the park and arrested the defiant protesters. While five of the protesters complied with the police order to willingly leave the park, three made another last stand and chained themselves together in a tent inside the fountain. The police dragged them out of the park. One of the protesters ended up in hospital. All were served $65 [[Trespassing|trespass]] tickets and released.\n\n==After eviction==\nBefore the eviction, there had been predictions that the harsh Canadian winter would drive Occupy Ottawa out of Confederation Park. But, after losing the park, and the generous [[media coverage]] that came with it, Occupy Ottawa seems to have gained new strength. The numbers have dwindled but the movement still holds two to three General Assemblies a week. New committees, working groups or initiatives emerged in December 2011 and January 2012, including a Political Action Committee and \"InterOccupy\" and \"Threads of Occupation\" working groups. The committees and working groups meet regularly during the week and constantly engage in [[direct actions]]. Assisting these efforts is a robust media apparatus that includes a communally edited website that features a Community News page, Forums, Facebook Page, Facebook Groups, Twitter Profile and YouTube account. On March 1, 2012, Occupy Ottawa launched a blog that summarizes the movement's monthly news and events.<ref>{{cite web | last =Kraus | first =Krystalline | title =Activist Communique: occupy Ottawa launches news blog| work = | publisher =Rabble.ca | date = | url =http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/krystalline-kraus/2012/03/activist-communiqu%C3%A9-occupy-ottawa-launches-new-blog | format = | doi = | accessdate =16 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nApproximately a year after the initial occupation, the group changed its name to Occupied Ottawa.<ref>[http://www.occupiedottawa.org Occupied Ottawa homepage]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arab Spring]]\n* [[Corporatocracy]]\n* [[Federal political financing in Canada|Federal Political Financing in Canada]]\n* [[List of Occupy movement protest locations]]\n* [[Occupy Canada]]\n* [[Shock doctrine|The Shock Doctrine]]\n* [[Voter turnout in Canada]]\n* [[We are the 99%|We Are The 99%]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Subject bar|portal1=Society|portal3=Politics|portal4=Business and economics|portal5=Canada}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* News, The Ottawa Citizen (October 31, 2011).

The movement's slogan \"Home of the global revolution in Ottawa\" refers to its inspiration by, and association with, the [[Arab Spring]], [[Occupy Wall Street]] and the global [[Occupy movement|Occupy Movement]], which protests growing economic inequality, corporate greed, and the influence of corporations and lobbyists on electoral politics and government. Occupy Ottawa seeks global economic, social, political and environmental justice.\n\nAs of June 2012, Occupy Ottawa had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.occupyottawa.org/calendar | title=Occupy Ottawa: Official Calendar | publisher=Occupy-ottawa.org | accessdate=March 5, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310051701/http://www.occupyottawa.org/calendar | archivedate=March 10, 2012 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{History of Ottawa}}\n\n==Global Day of Action==\nOn October 15, 2011, the Global Day of Action, over 700 demonstrators gathered around \"Freedom Fountain\" in Confederation Park for the movement's launch for its inaugural [[General assembly (Occupy movement)|General Assembly]]. Founding facilitators Ben Powless (Mohawk, Six Nations, Ontario) and Brigette \"the Rogue Page\" Depape discussed the Occupy Movement's trademark consensus-based democratic processes of deciding and debating issues and protest actions. They discussed the Occupy movement's overriding commitment to [[participatory democracy]], [[direct democracy]], \"majority consensus\", and stressed the importance of a peaceful demonstration. They also voted to occupy Confederation Park indefinitely. Prominent Canadian public figures among the crowd that day include Green Party leader and Federal [[House of Commons of Canada|MP]], [[Elizabeth May]] and activist Brigette DePape, a former [[Canadian Senate Page Program]], who famously held up a \"Stop [[Stephen Harper|Harper]]!\" protest sign during the [[throne speech]] of the [[Government of Canada]] in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in the summer of 2011.\n\n==Encampment==\nImmediately after the General Assembly, activists set up tents on the northeast corner of the park at the intersection of Laurier Avenue and Elgin Street. Within two weeks, the movement's \"tent city\" comprised more than 60 tents and tarp-covered shelters, including a kitchen, donations tent and media tent. Somewhere between 75 and 100 people consistently slept in the park. The kitchen, sustained through generous in-kind and cash donations from the public, served activists, visitors and the city's homeless.\n\n==Protest actions==\n[[File:Occupy Ottawa Occupons Ottawa (2).jpg|thumb|An Occupy Ottawa gathering]]\n\nOccupy Ottawa or its allies in the capital region organized a series of high-impact public actions. For the most part the movement focused on the issues at the heart of the Occupy movement. However, Occupy Ottawa also undertook actions targeting the national legislative agenda. In fact, some of the actions raised the question whether the movement intends to eventually become political. For example, during its December 3 General Assembly, the movement approved the creation of a \"Political Action Committee\". The committee's mandate was to create a \"political mandate\", and spearhead political actions, for the movement.\n\n===Second global day of action===\nOn November 17, Occupy Ottawa activists held simultaneous marches on four key and politically charged Ottawa landmarks. One group marched on the [[Canadian Tribute to Human Rights|Human Rights Monument]] to highlight the movement's unequivocal commitment to [[human rights]]. The second marched on Sparks Street Mall, Ottawa's corporate and media hub. The group sought to restate the Occupy movement's expressed stance against unfettered [[corporate greed]], growing [[economic inequality]] and the perceived [[mainstream media]] collusion with the dominant political and economic forces.\n\nThe third group targeted two landmarks. First, it marched on the city's Novotel Hotel to protest the hotel's efforts to squash workers' rights too unionize. From there, the group marched through the [[Rideau Centre]], the [[Byward Market]]. It finally converged on the [[Embassy of the United States, Ottawa|United States Embassy]] on [[Sussex Drive]] to express solidarity with [[Occupy Wall Street]], and protest the eviction and police brutality the movement faced at the time.\n\nLater, the three groups later converged on [[Parliament Hill]].\n\n===Omnibus crime bill C-10===\nOn Saturday, November 26, an estimated 300 activists turned up to peacefully protest the controversial Conservative government's bill, which was currently under debate in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The protest was organized under the aegis of the \"Occupy Ottawa Coalition to End Crime Bill C-10\". The nine speakers of the day included Angus Toulouse, the regional Chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]], [[Francoise Boivin|Fran\u00e7oise Boivin]], an MP from the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), [[Landon Pearson]], a former Senator, and representatives of the [[John Howard Society|John Howard Society of Canada]], Odawa Native Friendship Centre and Muslims for Progressive Values.\n\n===Solidarity actions===\nAs the crackdown on Occupy camps across Canada intensified, Occupy Ottawa seemed to expand its focus and reach.\n\n====Solidarity visit to Occupy Kingston====\nTuesday, December 6, 2011, was a crucial day for Occupy Kingston. It was the day the [[Kingston City Council]] voted to evict the occupiers, who had been encamped in Confederation Park since October 15. Occupy Ottawa activists visited their fellow occupiers and were present in the council chambers when the council voted 7-6 against Occupy Kingston.\n\n====Solidarity with Syria and Egypt====\nOn Thursday, December 8, Occupy Ottawa activists participate in a march in support of the struggle for democracy and political change in [[2011-2012 Syrian uprising|Syria]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]].\n\n====Perth visit====\nOn Sunday, December 11, Occupy Ottawa speakers visited [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]], 83&nbsp;km outside Ottawa to share their collective and personal experiences with the locals. Over 100 people packed a local pub, O'Reilly's, to hear the speakers. Following the visit, a new Occupy movement, Occupy Lanark County, emerged.\n\n==Controversies==\nOccupy Ottawa was initially met by a positive public-perception. Some citizens turned against the movement after issues were raised concerning hygiene, environmental impacts on the city park, drug use, and claims and complaints of rape and assault.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Parking+noise+drug+Occupy+Ottawa+beefs/6182599/story.html | title=Parking, noise, drug use top Occupy Ottawa beefs | publisher=Ottawa Citizen | date=February 21, 2012 | accessdate=March 18, 2012 |author1=Cockburn, Neco |author2=Brownlee, Mark }}</ref>\n\n==Public response==\nOccupy Ottawa's occupation of Confederation Park was largely peaceful with a commitment to nonviolence throughout numerous protest actions.\n\n==Eviction and defiance==\nAfter weeks of uncertainty, Occupy Ottawa's fate on Confederation Park was decided on the morning of November 21, 2011. The [[National Capital Commission]] (NCC), the [[Canadian Crown Corporation]] responsible for the park, served the movement with the notice of eviction. More than 300 people gathered for the movement's 6.30pm General Assembly, which unanimously voted to peacefully resist the eviction. In a statement, the movement said:\n\n<blockquote>We began this movement because we want positive change and we know that the old ways of political participation aren't working. These officials are doing the bidding of the 1%. They don't want to listen or engage in dialogue with us because they know we are already changing the conversation in this city, in this country and globally. We will offer dignified and principled resistance to those who try to force us out of public space.</blockquote>\n\nEight protesters vowed to stay on the park and make a last, peaceful, stand. The rest vowed to stick around and support them. The deadline came and passed without any action from the authorities. Still, up to 100 protesters remained on the park throughout most of the night and waited. However, by the end of the next day, signs of fatigue began to appear. The numbers dwindled. Some of the protesters suggested that the authorities were playing mind games and sought to wear the protesters out. There is some truth to the allegation. By evening, the numbers had dwindled to less than 30.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, November 23, 2011, around 2.00am, an estimated 150 officers from the [[Ottawa Police]] moved into the park and arrested the defiant protesters. While five of the protesters complied with the police order to willingly leave the park, three made another last stand and chained themselves together in a tent inside the fountain. The police dragged them out of the park. One of the protesters ended up in hospital. All were served $65 [[Trespassing|trespass]] tickets and released.\n\n==After eviction==\nBefore the eviction, there had been predictions that the harsh Canadian winter would drive Occupy Ottawa out of Confederation Park. But, after losing the park, and the generous [[media coverage]] that came with it, Occupy Ottawa seems to have gained new strength. The numbers have dwindled but the movement still holds two to three General Assemblies a week. New committees, working groups or initiatives emerged in December 2011 and January 2012, including a Political Action Committee and \"InterOccupy\" and \"Threads of Occupation\" working groups. The committees and working groups meet regularly during the week and constantly engage in [[direct actions]]. Assisting these efforts is a robust media apparatus that includes a communally edited website that features a Community News page, Forums, Facebook Page, Facebook Groups, Twitter Profile and YouTube account. On March 1, 2012, Occupy Ottawa launched a blog that summarizes the movement's monthly news and events.<ref>{{cite web | last =Kraus | first =Krystalline | title =Activist Communique: occupy Ottawa launches news blog| work = | publisher =Rabble.ca | date = | url =http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/krystalline-kraus/2012/03/activist-communiqu%C3%A9-occupy-ottawa-launches-new-blog | format = | doi = | accessdate =16 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nApproximately a year after the initial occupation, the group changed its name to Occupied Ottawa.<ref>[http://www.occupiedottawa.org Occupied Ottawa homepage]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arab Spring]]\n* [[Corporatocracy]]\n* [[Federal political financing in Canada|Federal Political Financing in Canada]]\n* [[List of Occupy movement protest locations]]\n* [[Occupy Canada]]\n* [[Shock doctrine|The Shock Doctrine]]\n* [[Voter turnout in Canada]]\n* [[We are the 99%|We Are The 99%]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Subject bar|portal1=Society|portal3=Politics|portal4=Business and economics|portal5=Canada}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* News, The Ottawa Citizen (October 31, 2011).
