The book was written in AD 1194 (590 AH) in the Ev\u0113la form of the [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|Divehi akuru]], during the reign of [[Dhinei of the Maldives|Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja)]].]]\n\nDespite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400-year-long Buddhist period has foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture which survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.'' Orient Longman</ref>\n\nBuddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.\n\nBuddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped. They are oriented according to the four cardinal points with the main gate facing east. Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.\n\n===Islamic period===\n\n{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of sultans of the Maldives}}\nThe importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]], converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.\n\n[[Somalis|Somali]] Muslim Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, also known as [[Aw Barkhadle]], is traditionally credited for this conversion.

Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.\n\nCompared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Q\u0101sim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh\u2014perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.\n\nMiddle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]\u2014widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast\u2014and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal\u2013Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9789004253995}}</ref>\n\nThe other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in the Maldives was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]].]]\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Maldivans.jpg|thumb|16th-century Portuguese illustration from the [[C\u00f3dice Casanatense]], depicting workers]]\n[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by [[Pierre Mortier]] from the [[Netherlands]], depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]\nIn 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'u\u1e93am]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.\n\nThe British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].\n\nIn the British period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.\n\nMaldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Mal\u00e9 eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945 CF620.jpg|thumb|An [[RAF]] [[Short Sunderland]] moored in the lagoon at Addu Atoll, during WWII]]\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Mal\u00e9 with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of \u00a3750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name=\"gan.philliptsmall.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Independence and republic===\n\n[[File:Flag of the Sultan of the Maldives.png|thumb|Flag of the [[List of sultans of the Maldives|Sultan of the Maldives]]]]\n\nIn line with the broader British policy of decolonisation, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]]. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi|Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King upon independence.\n\nOn 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.\n\n[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the Maldives.<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives \u2013 Population\". Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>\n\nPolitical infighting during the 1970s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export.  With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.\n\n[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.<ref name=\"cnn_sinking\">{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT</ref>\n\nA series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80 strong mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Mal\u00e9]] restored order.\n\nA November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman.

It lies between latitudes [[1st parallel south|1\u00b0S]] and [[8th parallel north|8\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian east|72\u00b0]] and [[74th meridian east|74\u00b0E]]. The atolls are composed of live [[coral reef]]s and [[sand bar]]s, situated atop a submarine ridge {{convert|960|km}} long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.\n\nOnly near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes, the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 [[Administrative divisions of the Maldives|administrative divisions]]. The largest island of Maldives is that of [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan]], which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In [[Addu Atoll]], the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef (collectively called Link Road) and the total length of the road is {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nMaldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only {{convert|2.4|m}} and {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level, respectively. In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 per cent of the country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/06/201062915490741700.html |title=Entire Maldives cabinet resigns |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> As a result, the Maldives are at high risk of being submerged due to [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]].

Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms.\n\nThe shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|254|cm}} in the north and {{convert|381|cm}} in the south.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maldives \u2013 Atlapedia

The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAs a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints. In 2019, Maldives signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner. Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarisation and handling of such hazardous situations.\n\n===Human rights===\n{{main|Human rights in the Maldives}}\nHuman rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.\n\nIn addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"[[Haa Alif]]\" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo.  Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee</ref>\n\nThe introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name.

The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as [[coir]] rope, [[ambergris]] (Maavaharu), and [[coco de mer]] (Tavakkaashi) with neighboring countries and [[East Asian]] countries.\n\nThe Maldivian government began a largely successful [[economic reform]] programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At the time [[tourism]] sector which would play a significant role in the nation's development was at its infant stage.\n\nAgriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in the Maldives|Diving in the Maldives|List of mosques in the Maldives}}\n\n[[File:Filitheyo bar.jpg|thumb|left|Filitheyo island beach with tall palm trees and blue fresh lagoons]]\n\nThe Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s.

Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.\n\nThe development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the [[Economy of the Maldives|country's economy]]. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/coup-what-coup-tourists-ignore-maldives-turmoil-20120213-1t0wi.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Coup?

In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\nThe [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Male-total.jpg|thumb|[[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives]]\n\n[[File:Population estimates of Maldives.png|thumb|Demographics of the Maldives, from 2000 to 2012]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\" |Population{{UN_Population|ref}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Census population by Sex and Sex ratio, 1911 \u2013 2014 |url=http://statisticsmaldives.gov.mv/yearbook/statisticalarchive/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/table2.1.pdf |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics, Maldives.}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Thousands\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1911 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|72\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1966 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|100\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|270\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2019 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|533\n|}\n\nThe largest ethnic group is [[Dhivehis|Dhivehin]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India.

As such, the Maldives are quite similar to the countries in the Gulf region (cf. Randall & Samimi, 2010; Boyle, 2012). The nation is undergoing vast societal change, and English is part of this.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meierkord|first=Christiane|date=March 2018|title=English in paradise: the Maldives: English is rapidly establishing itself as a second language in a society transforming from fishing to tourism and trade|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/english-in-paradise-the-maldives/84E0B35287213D3E1A7645FFD32BC16D|journal=English Today|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2\u201311|doi=10.1017/S0266078417000475|issn=0266-0784}}</ref>\n\n===Population by locality===\n{{Largest cities of the Maldives}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of the Maldives}}\n\n{{see also|Maldivian cuisine|Maldivian folklore}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\n\n[[File:Maahefun Fuvahmulah.JPG|thumb|Maahefun Festival in [[Fuvahmulah]]]]\n\nThe culture of the Maldives is influenced by the cultures of the people of different ethnicities who have settled on the islands\u00a0throughout the times.\n\nSince the 12th century AD there were also influences from [[Arabia]] in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean. This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.\n\nReflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.<ref>Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

International travel is available on Government owned [[Island Aviation Services]] (branded as Maldivian) operates to nearly all Maldives domestic airports with several [[Bombardier Dash 8]] aircraft and one [[A320]] with international service to India, Bangladesh, China and Thailand.\n\nIn Maldives there are three main ways to travel between islands: by domestic flight, by [[seaplane]] or by boat.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218100252/http://www.elitedivingagency.com/maldives/ Maldives \u2013 \u00c9lite Diving Agency].

Retrieved on 29 January 2014.</ref> For several years there were two seaplane companies operating: TMA ([[Trans Maldivian Airways]]) and [[Maldivian Air Taxi]], but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s. There is also another airline, [[Flyme (Villa Air)|Flyme]], which operates using [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] planes to domestic airports, principally [[Villa International Airport|Maamigili]], [[Dharavandhoo Airport|Dharavandhoo]] and some others. [[Manta Air]] begins its first scheduled seaplane service. Its seaplane fleet is made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]] aircraft. In addition to the seaplane service, [[Manta Air]] utilizes [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR 72-600]] aircraft to operate domestic flights to [[Dhaalu Airport]], [[Dharavandhoo Airport]] and [[Kooddoo Airport]] from the main [[Velana International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Manta Air begins its first scheduled seaplane service |url=https://corporatemaldives.com/manta-air-begins-its-first-scheduled-seaplane-service/ |website=corporatemaldives.com |accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> Depending on the distance of the destination island from the airport, resorts organise [[speedboat]] transfers or [[seaplane]] flights directly to the resort island jetty for their guests. Several daily flights operate from [[Velana International Airport]] to the 12 domestic and international airports in the country. Scheduled ferries also operate from [[Mal\u00e9]] to many of the atolls. The traditional Maldivian boat is called [[dhoni]]. Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive, while travel by dhoni, although slower, is relatively cheaper and convenient.\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Maldives National University]] is one of the country's three institutions of higher education. Its mission statement is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>To create, discover, preserve and disseminate knowledge that are necessary to enhance the lives and livelihoods of people and essential for the cultural, social and economic development of the society so that this nation shall remain free and Islamic forever.<ref name=MNU>{{cite web|url=http://mnu.edu.mv/vision-mission/|title=The Maldives National University|website=mnu.edu.mv}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health. The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades. In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry. In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services. In 1998, the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded. The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999. In 2000 the college launched its first degree programme: Bachelor of Arts. On 17 January 2011 the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives; The Maldives National University was named on 15 February 2011.<ref name=MNU />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Index of Maldives-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Maldives]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* ''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''.

It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture which survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.'' Orient Longman</ref>\n\nBuddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.\n\nBuddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped. They are oriented according to the four cardinal points with the main gate facing east. Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.\n\n===Islamic period===\n\n{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of sultans of the Maldives}}\nThe importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]], converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.\n\n[[Somalis|Somali]] Muslim Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, also known as [[Aw Barkhadle]], is traditionally credited for this conversion.

Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.\n\nCompared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Q\u0101sim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh\u2014perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.\n\nMiddle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]\u2014widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast\u2014and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal\u2013Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9789004253995}}</ref>\n\nThe other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in the Maldives was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]].]]\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Maldivans.jpg|thumb|16th-century Portuguese illustration from the [[C\u00f3dice Casanatense]], depicting workers]]\n[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by [[Pierre Mortier]] from the [[Netherlands]], depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]\nIn 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'u\u1e93am]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.\n\nThe British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].\n\nIn the British period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.\n\nMaldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Mal\u00e9 eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945 CF620.jpg|thumb|An [[RAF]] [[Short Sunderland]] moored in the lagoon at Addu Atoll, during WWII]]\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Mal\u00e9 with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of \u00a3750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name=\"gan.philliptsmall.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Independence and republic===\n\n[[File:Flag of the Sultan of the Maldives.png|thumb|Flag of the [[List of sultans of the Maldives|Sultan of the Maldives]]]]\n\nIn line with the broader British policy of decolonisation, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]]. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi|Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King upon independence.\n\nOn 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.\n\n[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the Maldives.<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives \u2013 Population\". Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>\n\nPolitical infighting during the 1970s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export.  With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.\n\n[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.<ref name=\"cnn_sinking\">{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT</ref>\n\nA series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80 strong mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Mal\u00e9]] restored order.\n\nA November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman.

Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms.\n\nThe shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia.

The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAs a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints. In 2019, Maldives signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.\n\nIn addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"[[Haa Alif]]\" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo.  Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee</ref>\n\nThe introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\nThe [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Male-total.jpg|thumb|[[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives]]\n\n[[File:Population estimates of Maldives.png|thumb|Demographics of the Maldives, from 2000 to 2012]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\" |Population{{UN_Population|ref}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Census population by Sex and Sex ratio, 1911 \u2013 2014 |url=http://statisticsmaldives.gov.mv/yearbook/statisticalarchive/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/table2.1.pdf |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics, Maldives.}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Thousands\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1911 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|72\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1966 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|100\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|270\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2019 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|533\n|}\n\nThe largest ethnic group is [[Dhivehis|Dhivehin]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India. They share the same culture and speak the [[Dhivehi language]]. They are principally an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] people, having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] and African genes in the population.\n\nIn the past there was also a small [[Tamils|Tamil]] population known as the [[Giraavaru people]].

It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties. Instead of a complex [[caste]] system, there was merely a distinction between noble (b\u0113fulhu) and common people in the Maldives.

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of Maldives's [[cultural heritage]].\n\nOther aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu ([[Mawlid]])\u2014the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone\u2014existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.\n\nAccording to Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from [[Morocco]]. He is also referred to as [[Tabrizugefaanu]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or [[Mal\u00e9 Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Mal\u00e9.

The first known script used to write Dhivehi is the ''[[eveyla akuru]]'' script, which is found in historical recording of kings (''raadhavalhi''). Later a script called ''[[dhives akuru]]'' was used for a long period. The present-day script is called [[Thaana]] and is written from right to left. Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Mohamed Thakurufaanu]].\n\nEnglish is widely spoken by the locals of the Maldives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maldives.tourism-srilanka.com/travel-tips/language.html|title=Maldives Languages \u2013 Languages of Maldives \u2013 Language Spoken In Maldives|website=maldives.tourism-srilanka.com}}</ref> Following the nation's opening to the outside world, the introduction of English as a medium of instruction at secondary and tertiary level of education, and its government's recognition of the opportunities offered through tourism, English has now firmly established itself in the country.

This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.\n\nReflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.<ref>Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

Nevertheless, although Finland was considered neutral, the [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948]] significantly limited the freedom of operation in Finnish foreign policy. It required Finland to defend the Soviet Union from attacks through its territory, which in practice prevented Finland from joining [[NATO]] and effectively gave the Soviet Union a veto in Finnish foreign policy.

For instance, one might be referred to as ''Tovarisch Plekhanov'' or ''Tovarisch Chairman'', or simply as ''Tovarisch''. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], translations of the term in different languages were adopted by [[Communist]]s worldwide. However, due to its common usage in stereotypical portrayals of the Soviet Union in Cold War films and books, the term became most strongly associated in public consciousness with [[Communism]] as known in the Soviet Union, even though many other socialists would continue to use \"Comrade\" among themselves (e.g., German and Austrian social-democrats and, to this day, members of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn the early years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks used \"Tovarisch\" when addressing or referring to people assumed sympathetic to the revolution and to the Soviet state, such as members of the Communist party (and originally of other pro-revolution leftist formations such as the [[Left SR]]) and people from the \"working masses\". The more neutral republican form of address would translate as \"Citizen\". Accordingly, supporters of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] would use \"Tovarisch\" mockingly as a derogatory term for their enemies&nbsp;\u2013 although at the same time, the various socialist anti-Bolshevik forces such as the [[Socialist Revolutionaries]] and the [[Mensheviks]] also used \"Tovarisch\" among themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nBy the mid-1920s, the form of address \"Tovarisch\" became so commonplace in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Union]] that it was used indiscriminately in essentially the same way as terms like \"Mister\" and \"Sir\" are employed in English. That use persisted until the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. Still, the original meaning partly re-surfaced in some contexts: criminals and suspects were only addressed as \"Citizens\" and not as \"Tovarischi\", and expressly refusing to address someone as \"Tovarisch\" would generally be perceived as a hostile act or, in [[Stalinist]] times, even as an accusation of being \"[[Anti-Soviet]]\".<ref>\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0418.\u0421. \u041e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435 / \u0418.\u0421.\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 // \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f: \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f 200-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044e \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c, 4-6 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2004 \u0433.): \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b: / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u0449. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041a.\u0420.\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430.\u2013 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2004.\u2013 C.211-212.[http://www.ksu.ru/f10/publications/2004/articles_1_1.php?id=8&num=9000000]</ref>\n\nThe term \"Comrade\" is not used in Russian society, and the term \"Tovarisch\" is not often used in contemporary society, but it is still the standard form of address in the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|armed forces]] and [[Russian Police|police]], where officers and soldiers are normally addressed as \"Tovarisch Colonel\", \"Tovarisch General\", \"Tovarisch Sergeant\", or the like.

It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in [[mainland China]] after the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded. For example, women were ''n\u00fc tongzhi'' (female comrade), children were ''xiao tongzhi'' (little comrade) and seniors were ''lao tongzhi'' (old comrade). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese and members of the Communist Party of China. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as ''t\u00f3ng zh\u00ec'' is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAt party or civil meetings, the usage of the term has been retained.

The term predates modern political usage, and is an Arabic male proper name. [[Iran]]ian communists use the same term. In [[Pakistan]], the term is sometimes used to refer to Islamist members of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and [[Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba]] (the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami).\n*The [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word for comrade is \u0568\u0576\u056f\u0565\u0580 (unger) for boys and men and \u0568\u0576\u056f\u0565\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0570\u056b (ungerouhi) for girls and women. This word literally translates as \"friend\". It is used by members of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], [[Ramgavar]] and [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] when addressing other members of the party. The term is also used by the [[Armenian Communist Party]].\n*The [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] word for comrade is ''Yolda\u015f'' (literally \"co-traveller\").\n*In [[Balochistan]], the term comrade can be translated as ''Sangat'' (in Balochi and Brahvi), and is often used by left-wing political activists and guerillas who are waging war against the Pakistani state.\n*The [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] word for comrade is ''\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0448'' (tavary\u0161), with the same origin as the Russian word. It is usually used only with a political or historical meaning in connection with the Communists.\n*The [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word ''\u0995\u09ae\u09b0\u09c7\u09a1'' (Komred) is used by all leftist groups especially by the [[Communist Party of Bangladesh]] (\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09ae\u09bf\u0989\u09a8\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u099f\u09bf-\u09b8\u09bf\u09aa\u09bf\u09ac\u09bf), [[Communist Party of India]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] and other Communist Parties in [[India]] (especially in the States of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]]) and [[Socialist Party of Bangladesh]]-SPB, [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal-JSD]] ([[Bangladesh]]) etc.\n*The [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] word ''drug'' is used as an equivalent to comrade. For females, ''drugarica'' is used. It is also used commonly for as a word for friend.\n*The [[Burmese language|Burmese]] word ''y\u00e8baw'' is used in the [[Communist Party of Burma]].\n*The [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] word for comrade is ''\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440'' (drugar), female ''\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430'' (drugarka). It translates as friend or colleague. In Communist times, it was the general form of address, also used in reference to schoolteachers etc.\n*In [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the word for comrade is ''company'' for males, ''companya'' for females. It is still in widespread use among communist and anarchist organisations, but it also occurs often in everyday speech to refer to neutral relationships such as classmates or flatmates with no political connotation.\n*In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the word \u540c\u5fd7 (pinyin: T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec) is used. The meaning of the word refers to a like-minded person. It is, through usage, associated with Communism, however, it may be used as a friendly epithet between friends or colleagues, mostly of the older generation. It is still currently used in Chinese state media to address top party and state leaders such as [[Xi Jinping]] as well as within the [[People\u2019s Liberation Army]] to address soldiers and officers.\n*The [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equivalent to comrade is ''drug'' for males and ''drugarica'' for females. In the period between World War II and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s death in socialist [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] it was applied to almost everybody: teachers, officials, etc. Today it is not used commonly. It may be used with the meaning of ''friend'' as in Serbian, but this use is far less frequent in Croatian. It is still used among far left organization members, and calling someone ''drug/drugarica'' may also be used ironically to denote someone's perceived radical leftism.\n*The [[Czech language|Czech]] word for comrade is ''soudruh'' (m.) and ''soudru\u017eka'' (f.). In 19th century Czech, it was a poetic word, meaning \"fellow\". As elsewhere in Europe, the term was originally introduced by the Czech Social Democrats and subsequently carried over to Czech Communists as well when these split off from the Social Democrats. After the Communist Party gained power in 1948, the word displaced all prior titles like ''pan'', ''pan\u00ed'' (\"Mister\", \"Madam\") and became the title used generally for everyone. Nowadays, it is used only in (actual or, more often, ironic) Communist context. After the [[Velvet Revolution]], an attempt was made in the [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] to replace ''soudruh'' with ''p\u0159\u00edtel'' (\"friend\") as a form of an address, but it didn't catch on.<!--see refs in Czech wiki article--> A cognate to English word \"comrade\", ''kamar\u00e1d'', means \"friend\" in Czech. It is a very commonly used word and it has no political connotations. A cognate (now obsolete) to the Russian word ''tovarishch'', ''tovary\u0161'', means \"[[journeyman]]\" in Czech and has no political connotations (cf. [[Society of Jesus|''Tovary\u0161stvo Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ovo'']], lit. \"Jesus' Journeymen\").\n*The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word is ''kameraad''. In [[Dutch Language Union|Common Dutch]] the word is mostly reminiscent of communists{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}, whereas in informal speech and dialects it can be used to indicate friends or acquaintances. It was used as a form of address in the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]], as well as in the pre-war [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]], the latter also using the female neologism ''kameraadske''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verzetsmuseum.org/tweede-wereldoorlog/nl/achtergrond/achtergrond,nsb|title=Verzetsmuseum - NSB, Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging|work=verzetsmuseum.org}}</ref> The pseudo-[[Russian language|Russian]] word ''kameraadski'' is used informally as a [[sobriquet]] for a person with leftist sympathies.\n*The [[Danish language|Danish]] word is ''kammerat'' (plural ''kammerater'') which literally translates as \"[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]],\" or \"[[:wikt:buddy|buddy]]\". It is normally used to refer to someone's childhood friend or friends, but can also be used interchangeably with ''ven'', which means ''friend''.\n*The [[Esperanto]] word for comrade is ''kamarado'' either in the sense of a friend or a political fellow-traveller. In the latter case, when used in writing, it is often abbreviated to ''K-do''. It is the preferred form of address among members of [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]]. The word ''samideano'', literally \"same-thinker\", usually refers to a fellow Esperantist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.btclick.com/ukc802510745/eo/vortlist/gcselist.htm|title=Esperanto GCSE Wordlist|work=btclick.com|access-date=2008-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531104608/http://home.btclick.com/ukc802510745/eo/vortlist/gcselist.htm|archive-date=2017-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*The [[Estonian language|Estonian]] word is ''seltsimees'' which originally comes from German ''Geselle''. Having initially a neutral meaning, the term was later adapted by local communists. Today it has an ironical meaning, referring to Soviet times.\n*The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word is ''toveri'' which literally translates as \"[[:wikt:companion|companion]]\".\n*The [[French language|French]] word is ''camarade''. It is mainly used by communists and can apply to classmates or friends.\n*The [[Georgian language|Georgian]] word is ''\u10d0\u10db\u10ee\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10d2\u10d8'' ''amkhanagi''.\n*In [[German language|German]], the word is ''Kamerad'' for a male, or ''Kameradin'' for a female. The meaning is that of a fellow, a companion or an associate. Since 'Kamerad' is the usual term for a fellow soldier in German military language, the word is associated with right-wing rather than left-wing groups. Communists and socialists, especially party members of the [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands|SED]] and [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]] use the word ''Genosse'' (fem. ''Genossin'') (ie. \"partner\", in the sense of a fellow member of a [[co-operative]]) with the socialist association that 'comrade' has in English.\n*The [[Greek language|Greek]] word is ''\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2'' (syntrophos, m.) and ''\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1'' (syntrophissa, f.), used by communists, socialists and other left-wing groups. Other meanings of this word are: mate, pal, friend, companion, even partner or associate etc.\n* The [[Hebrew]] equivalent is ''Chaver'' (\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8), a word which can mean both \"friend\" and \"member\" (of a group or organization). During the time of [[Socialist Zionist]] political and ideological dominance of the 1930s to the 1960s, the word in a sense similar to English \"comrade\" was in widespread use, in the [[Kibbutz]] movement, the [[Histadrut]] trade unions, the driver-owned bus companies etc. At present, its political use is considered old-fashioned, mainly restricted to Israeli Communists; the same word exists also in [[Yiddish]], which is one possible origin of the colloquial [[Australia]]n word \"[[wikt:cobber|cobber]]\".) The Hebrew ''Chaver'' and the female ''Chavera'' are still widely used in a non-political sense, as meaning simply \"friend\" (in certain contexts also meaning \"boyfriend/girlfriend\").\n* The [[Hindi]] equivalent for comrade or \"Saghave\" is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940). It is widely used among all leftist (communist) parties of India, e.g., [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], [[Communist Party of India]], [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)]], [[Forward Bloc]] and others.\n*The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word for comrade is ''elvt\u00e1rs''. ''elv'' means \"[[principle]]\" or \"[[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]\" while ''t\u00e1rs'' means \"fellow\". As the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] gradually gained power after the [[Second World War]], the word displaced all prior titles like ''\u00far'' (\"Mister\") and became the title used generally for everyone except for people who were obviously not \"tenet fellows\" e.g. those who committed [[political crime]] against the socialist state. After the democratic transition the word became obsolete and it is used derogatorily to address politicians on the [[political left]].\n*The [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word for comrade is ''f\u00e9lagi''. It is used as a less intimate alternative to ''vinur'' (friend). It is also the word used for a \"member\" of club or association. When used as a title to precede a name (i.e., ''f\u00e9lagi T\u00edt\u00f3'' or ''f\u00e9lagi Dimitroff'') it has a communist implication.\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'', or ''Kamerad'' are used by [[Communist Party of Indonesia|communist]], socialist, and nationalist political parties.\n*In [[Irish Language|Irish]] the word for comrade is ''comr\u00e1da\u00ed'', with ''a chara'' (friend) used as a term of address. Both expressions are used largely by [[Irish Republicans]], [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalism]], [[:Category:Communism in Ireland|Communists]], and [[:Category:Socialism in Ireland|Socialists]].\n*The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for comrade is ''compagno'' (male) or ''compagna'' (female), meaning \"companion\". This word is in widespread use among left-wing circles, including not just communists but also many socialists. The literal translation of the word comrade is ''camerata'', with the specific meaning of \"comrade-in-arms\" or \"fellow soldier\": it is used by nationalist and militarist right-wing groups. Using one word or the other is a quick way to announce one's political views.\n*The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for comrade is \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u5fd7}} (''d\u014dshi'')\", using the same Han characters as in Chinese.  The word is used to refer to like-minded persons and the usage is not necessarily limited to Communists, though the word is to some extent associated with Communism.  The word should not be confused with a homonym \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u58eb}}\", which is a more commonly used postfix to show people sharing a certain property.\n*In [[Kannada]], the word \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf\u0cb0\u0cc7, \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf (Geleya) is used among communist people's while addressing its people.\n*In [[Khmer people|Khmer]], the word \"comrade\" ({{lang-km|\u179f\u1798\u1798\u17b7\u178f\u17d2\u178f}} ''Samakmit'') was used by members of the [[Khmer Rouge]] during the [[Democratic Kampuchea|communist rule]] of [[Pol Pot]] in 1975\u20131979 and by the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] during the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] era. \n*In [[Korean language|Korean]], a good equivalent of the word would be \"\ub3d9\ubb34\" (''tongmu'') or \"\ub3d9\uc9c0\" (''tongji'', senior comrade). Although the word was originally used by Korean people all over the [[Korean Peninsula]], people living south of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]] began avoiding using the word after a [[communist state]] was set up in the north. In [[North Korea]], the word ''tongmu'' replaced all prior social titles and earned a new meaning as \"a fellow man fighting for the revolution\". The word originally meant \u201cfriend\u201d. On the other hand, the word \u201c\ub3d9\uc9c0\u201d (''tongji'') is frequently used in North Korean state media to address senior state and party leaders such as [[Kim Jong-un]]. \n*In [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], the word ''[[Heval]]'' (\"friend\" or \"companion on a long journey\") is widely used among Kurdish political parties and organizations.\n*In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], the word is ''biedrs'' for males and ''biedre'' or ''biedrene'' for females.\n*In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], the word is ''draugas'' for males and ''draug\u0117'' for females; both of which originally meant \"friend\".\n*In [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], the word is \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440 (''drugar'') for males and \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440ka (''drugarka'') for females.\n*In [[Malay language|Malay]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'' and ''Sahabat'' are used among socialist organizations.\n*In [[Malayalam]],  the word \u0d38\u0d16\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d (''sakhavu'') is used among communist organizations while addressing fellow members.\n*In [[Mexico]], the word is ''camarada'' (''camrade'') and ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n*In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the word is ''\u043d\u04e9\u0445\u04e9\u0440'' (n\u00f6kh\u00f6r). It is still in use but less than before.\n*The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] equivalent for comrade is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940) as in Hindi. It is used by communists in Nepal such as the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist)]], [[Janamorcha Nepal]] and others.\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the word is ''kamerat''. It can be associated with communist usage, but more commonly refers simply to an associate, a co-worker (''arbeidskamerat''), or a classmate in school (''klassekamerat'' or ''skolekamerat''). In everyday use, the word ''kamerat'' on its own is considered a masculine term, referring to boys/men. For girls/women, the term ''venninne'' (female form of ''venn'' friend) is used instead. When joined with other words, such as ''klassekamerat'', the word is gender neutral. (Although Norwegians would understand what is meant by ''klassevenninne'', it would also sound awkward and somewhat archaic.)\n*In the [[Philippines]], communist and left-leaning activists prefer the term ''kasama'' (roughly, companion), and the short form, ''Ka'' before the name (e.g. [[Crispin Beltran|''Ka'' Bel]]). [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestant]] (usually [[Evangelical Protestantism|Evangelical]]) clerics and members of the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] also use ''Ka'' before names or [[nicknames]], but as a contraction of ''kapat\u00edd'' (\"brother\"/\"sister\"), denoting spiritual brotherhood. Practitioners of law informally use the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] term ''compa\u00f1ero''/''compa\u00f1era'' when referring to each other, albeit without any socio-political connotation.\n*In the [[Pashto language]], the word for comrade is ''malgury''. It is used by and refers to communists, socialists, or supporters of the communist system across the [[Durand Line]] (i.e. in Afghanistan and Pakistan) by Pashto speakers. For the last decade or so it has also been used by the nationalists. The word is also used by common people both male and female for a very close friend.\n*In [[Poland]], the word is ''[[towarzysz]]'', which has the same origin as the Russian word. In non-political sense, it means \"companion\".\n*In [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], the word is ''camarada'', now being commonly employed to refer to communists or supporters of the communist system (result of the overusage of the term in the [[Carnation Revolution|post-revolutionary]] society). It is also prevalent in the army, and has been gaining popularity among nationalist movements. The term used among socialist activists nowadays tends to be ''companheiro'' / ''companheira'' although in Portugal ''camarada'' is still commonly used. Brazilian president Lula is widely known for addressing his political mates and supporters as ''companheiro'', however this decreased during the last years of his presidential term, while it was very popular during the elections, often imitated by comedians who satirized Lula's idiosyncratic manners. The terms ''camarada'' and ''companheiro(s)''/''companheira(s)'' are also used without political connotations, meaning ''mate'', ''partner'', ''fella''.\n*In the [[Punjabi language]] the word for comrade is ''Saathi'' (\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a25\u0a40). However, the word \"Comrade\" itself, or \u0a15\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a30\u0a47\u0a21, is used to refer to a communist or communist party member, and is often used as a more linguistically acceptable replacement for the word \"communist,\" with the communist party often being called \"The Comrades\" or communist thought being called \"''Comrade Sochni.\"''\n*In the [[Romani language]] the word for comrade is ''Dosti'' as seen in the phrase ''Te vestinel o dosti Tito, te vestinena o jugoslovenske manusha'' or ''Long live comrade Tito and long live the Yugoslav people''.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]] the exact translation is ''camarad'', a [[neologism]] introduced from [[French language|French]] in the 19th century,  which does not bear a political connotation, referring mainly to wartime allies and friends. During the communist era an older term, ''tovar\u0103\u0219'', derived from a Slavic source, was used to convey the political meaning.\n*The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] word for comrade is ''drug'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433) for males and ''drugarica'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430) for females; it's also a regular word for 'friend'. However, during the period of [[Josip Broz Tito]] ruled [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the leading [[Yugoslav Communist League]] promoted the use of the term between the members and generally among the society. It was not unusual to hear political leaders referring to their audience as \"''drugarice i drugovi''\" a tendency kept during the era of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] later during the 1980s and 1990s. Its intention was to emphasize empathy and equalty, and it is still used by the most fervocious adherents of leftist ideologies.\n*The [[Slovak language|Slovak]] word for comrade is ''s\u00fadruh'' (m.) and ''s\u00fadru\u017eka'' (f.). The term ''kamar\u00e1t'' is used too, but it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] word for comrade is ''tovari\u0161'' (m.) and ''tovari\u0161ica'' (f.), first attested in the 16th century. After the Second World War it was also colloquially used for 'teacher' (as an elliptical form of the official ''tovari\u0161 u\u010ditelj'' (m.), ''tovari\u0161ica u\u010diteljica'' (f.) 'comrade teacher'). After 1991 it rapidly fell out of use as a general term of address, but is still used when expressing ''comradeship'' among individuals.\n*The [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] word for comrade is ''Sangat'' '''\u0633\u0646\u06af\u062a'''; it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Somali language|Somali]] word for comrade is ''jaalle''; it is normally translated as friend. It was widely used by the erstwhile [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (1969-1991). The word fell out of use after the fall of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party.\n*In [[Spain]], the word is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'' (\"companion\"); the term ''camarada'' (\"comrade\") has also been used, but it is more associated with the communist and [[Falange]] tradition. In [[Spain]] the word ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n**The standard form in [[Cuba]] is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'', as it was in socialist [[Nicaragua]] and [[Chile]]. In some parts of Latin America, ''camarada'' is the more frequent word, except in [[Peru]], where the term is commonly associated with the [[nom de guerre]] of members of [[far left]] groups ''[[Shining Path]]'' and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], while members of the social-democrat party [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] as well as other left parties or left-leaning organizations employ ''compa\u00f1ero'' to refer to fellow members. The term ''camarada'' is the more normal among [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communists]].\n* In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], the word is \u0dc3\u0dc4\u0ddd\u0daf\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf saho\u00f0arayaa, which means brother. It is also a condescending term used by the elite (usually academics) to lure the underprivileged into the cause.\n*In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the equivalent word is ''ndugu'' for brother-in-arms, or ''dada'' for a female comrade. The word ''ndugu'' is still used in formerly socialist Tanzania as a way of showing (political) solidarity.\n*The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word is ''kamrat''. Although it can be associated with communist usage, it can equally well refer simply to a friend, a co-worker (''arbetskamrat''), or a classmate in school (''klasskamrat'' or ''skolkamrat''). Unlike the corresponding [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word, the term is commonly used for both boys and girls in non-communist usage. See also [[Idrottsf\u00f6reningen Kamraterna]]\n*The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for comrade is ''Thozhar'' (\u0ba4\u0bcb\u0bb4\u0bb0\u0bcd) and is a regular word for 'friend'.\n*In [[Tetum|Tetun]], the national language of Timor Leste, the word ''camarada'' is used&nbsp;\u2013 a direct loan from the language of the former colonial power, Portugal. During the '70s the word was a common term of address within the left leaning Fretilin party, and after the Indonesian invasion, continued to be used by the Fretilin associated guerillas waging a war of resistance in the jungle. Though largely falling out of use since 1999 Fretilin politicians and veterans of the guerillas struggle continue to use the term to refer to each other.\n*The [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''sahai'' (\u0e2a\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22) was used in the communist movement.\n*The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''Yolda\u015f'' (literally co-traveller) has become used within the communist movement, 'yol' meaning 'way' and 'cause'. [[Janissaries]] used to call each other ''yolda\u015f'' (''comrade'') or ''yolda\u015f\u00e2n'' (''pl. 'comrades' '').<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tarihtarih.com/?Syf=26&Syz=381889 | title=Garp Ocaklar\u0131nda T\u00fcrk Varl\u0131\u011f\u0131 / Prof. Dr. Atilla \u00c7etin}}</ref> Turkish communists, being morally affected by [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] values of the older era, adopted this term.

However it is still used as an informal form of address among some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members, and in a more serious manner by many smaller parties of the left. Use of the term is generally restricted to people with whom the speaker agrees politically. It is usually written in full, the abbreviation \"Cde\" being associated with southern African usage. The honorific terms \"sister\" and \"brother\", also declining in usage, are more politically inclusive, encompassing everyone from the centre-left to the far-left, without necessarily indicating complete political agreement. All three terms are occasionally used in a mocking or patronising manner by political opponents. On the far right, \"comrade\" was the standard form of address between members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and featured widely in their publications and marching songs.\n*In the [[United States]], the word \"comrade\" carries a strong connotation with Communism, [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and the former Soviet Union. Especially during the [[Cold War]], to address someone as \"comrade\" marked either the speaker, person addressed, or both as suspected communist sympathizers. It is frequently used ironically in that way. In addition, it is still used in its generic context{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} by some American socialists.  Despite this, it has been adopted into the U.S. Army Soldier's Creed in the statement \"I will never leave a fallen comrade\".  It is also used at meetings of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to address a fellow member.\n*The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] word is ''\u0111\u1ed3ng ch\u00ed'', which is derived from Chinese \u540c\u5fd7. Due to the influence of Chinese revolutionary groups during the early 20th century on the Vietnamese independence movement, its usage was first seen among members of the KMT-backed [[VNQD\u0110|Vietnamese Nationalist Party]] and then later spread to members of the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. It is still being used openly in public to address state and Communist Party leaders as well as among soldiers and military officers in the [[Vietnam People\u2019s Army]].\n\n== In literature ==\n\nIn [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'', the animals all refer to each other as comrade, as the story is a satirical look at the Russian Revolution. Also in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', party members in [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] refer to each other as comrade.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |title = The Soldiers Creed and Army Values |url = http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |work=Rhode Island National Guard |publisher=Rhode Island National Guard |accessdate = 2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100404045913/http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |archivedate = 2010-04-04 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Term meaning friend, colleague or ally, with political connotations}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2015}}\n[[File:\"I summon you to comradeship in the Red Cross\" - Woodrow Wilson LCCN2002712070.tif|thumb|[[World War I]] poster in the [[Library of Congress]]]]\nThe term '''''comrade''''' is used to mean \"mate\", \"colleague\", or \"ally\", and derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''camarada'',<ref>[http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/generic/cherche.exe?15;s=785465025;; Camarade - Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> literally meaning \"chamber mate\", from Latin ''camera'' \"chamber\" or \"room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=comrade|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}</ref> Political use of the term was inspired by the [[French Revolution]], after which it grew into a [[form of address]] between socialists and workers.

For instance, one might be referred to as ''Tovarisch Plekhanov'' or ''Tovarisch Chairman'', or simply as ''Tovarisch''. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], translations of the term in different languages were adopted by [[Communist]]s worldwide. However, due to its common usage in stereotypical portrayals of the Soviet Union in Cold War films and books, the term became most strongly associated in public consciousness with [[Communism]] as known in the Soviet Union, even though many other socialists would continue to use \"Comrade\" among themselves (e.g., German and Austrian social-democrats and, to this day, members of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn the early years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks used \"Tovarisch\" when addressing or referring to people assumed sympathetic to the revolution and to the Soviet state, such as members of the Communist party (and originally of other pro-revolution leftist formations such as the [[Left SR]]) and people from the \"working masses\". The more neutral republican form of address would translate as \"Citizen\". Accordingly, supporters of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] would use \"Tovarisch\" mockingly as a derogatory term for their enemies&nbsp;\u2013 although at the same time, the various socialist anti-Bolshevik forces such as the [[Socialist Revolutionaries]] and the [[Mensheviks]] also used \"Tovarisch\" among themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nBy the mid-1920s, the form of address \"Tovarisch\" became so commonplace in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Union]] that it was used indiscriminately in essentially the same way as terms like \"Mister\" and \"Sir\" are employed in English. That use persisted until the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. Still, the original meaning partly re-surfaced in some contexts: criminals and suspects were only addressed as \"Citizens\" and not as \"Tovarischi\", and expressly refusing to address someone as \"Tovarisch\" would generally be perceived as a hostile act or, in [[Stalinist]] times, even as an accusation of being \"[[Anti-Soviet]]\".<ref>\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0418.\u0421. \u041e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435 / \u0418.\u0421.\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 // \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f: \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f 200-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044e \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c, 4-6 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2004 \u0433.): \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b: / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u0449. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041a.\u0420.\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430.\u2013 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2004.\u2013 C.211-212.[http://www.ksu.ru/f10/publications/2004/articles_1_1.php?id=8&num=9000000]</ref>\n\nThe term \"Comrade\" is not used in Russian society, and the term \"Tovarisch\" is not often used in contemporary society, but it is still the standard form of address in the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|armed forces]] and [[Russian Police|police]], where officers and soldiers are normally addressed as \"Tovarisch Colonel\", \"Tovarisch General\", \"Tovarisch Sergeant\", or the like.

The term predates modern political usage, and is an Arabic male proper name. [[Iran]]ian communists use the same term. In [[Pakistan]], the term is sometimes used to refer to Islamist members of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and [[Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba]] (the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami).\n*The [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word for comrade is \u0568\u0576\u056f\u0565\u0580 (unger) for boys and men and \u0568\u0576\u056f\u0565\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0570\u056b (ungerouhi) for girls and women. This word literally translates as \"friend\". It is used by members of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], [[Ramgavar]] and [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] when addressing other members of the party. The term is also used by the [[Armenian Communist Party]].\n*The [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] word for comrade is ''Yolda\u015f'' (literally \"co-traveller\").\n*In [[Balochistan]], the term comrade can be translated as ''Sangat'' (in Balochi and Brahvi), and is often used by left-wing political activists and guerillas who are waging war against the Pakistani state.\n*The [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] word for comrade is ''\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0448'' (tavary\u0161), with the same origin as the Russian word. It is usually used only with a political or historical meaning in connection with the Communists.\n*The [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word ''\u0995\u09ae\u09b0\u09c7\u09a1'' (Komred) is used by all leftist groups especially by the [[Communist Party of Bangladesh]] (\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09ae\u09bf\u0989\u09a8\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u099f\u09bf-\u09b8\u09bf\u09aa\u09bf\u09ac\u09bf), [[Communist Party of India]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] and other Communist Parties in [[India]] (especially in the States of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]]) and [[Socialist Party of Bangladesh]]-SPB, [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal-JSD]] ([[Bangladesh]]) etc.\n*The [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] word ''drug'' is used as an equivalent to comrade. For females, ''drugarica'' is used. It is also used commonly for as a word for friend.\n*The [[Burmese language|Burmese]] word ''y\u00e8baw'' is used in the [[Communist Party of Burma]].\n*The [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] word for comrade is ''\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440'' (drugar), female ''\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430'' (drugarka). It translates as friend or colleague. In Communist times, it was the general form of address, also used in reference to schoolteachers etc.\n*In [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the word for comrade is ''company'' for males, ''companya'' for females. It is still in widespread use among communist and anarchist organisations, but it also occurs often in everyday speech to refer to neutral relationships such as classmates or flatmates with no political connotation.\n*In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the word \u540c\u5fd7 (pinyin: T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec) is used. The meaning of the word refers to a like-minded person. It is, through usage, associated with Communism, however, it may be used as a friendly epithet between friends or colleagues, mostly of the older generation. It is still currently used in Chinese state media to address top party and state leaders such as [[Xi Jinping]] as well as within the [[People\u2019s Liberation Army]] to address soldiers and officers.\n*The [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equivalent to comrade is ''drug'' for males and ''drugarica'' for females. In the period between World War II and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s death in socialist [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] it was applied to almost everybody: teachers, officials, etc. Today it is not used commonly. It may be used with the meaning of ''friend'' as in Serbian, but this use is far less frequent in Croatian. It is still used among far left organization members, and calling someone ''drug/drugarica'' may also be used ironically to denote someone's perceived radical leftism.\n*The [[Czech language|Czech]] word for comrade is ''soudruh'' (m.) and ''soudru\u017eka'' (f.). In 19th century Czech, it was a poetic word, meaning \"fellow\". As elsewhere in Europe, the term was originally introduced by the Czech Social Democrats and subsequently carried over to Czech Communists as well when these split off from the Social Democrats. After the Communist Party gained power in 1948, the word displaced all prior titles like ''pan'', ''pan\u00ed'' (\"Mister\", \"Madam\") and became the title used generally for everyone. Nowadays, it is used only in (actual or, more often, ironic) Communist context. After the [[Velvet Revolution]], an attempt was made in the [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] to replace ''soudruh'' with ''p\u0159\u00edtel'' (\"friend\") as a form of an address, but it didn't catch on.<!--see refs in Czech wiki article--> A cognate to English word \"comrade\", ''kamar\u00e1d'', means \"friend\" in Czech. It is a very commonly used word and it has no political connotations. A cognate (now obsolete) to the Russian word ''tovarishch'', ''tovary\u0161'', means \"[[journeyman]]\" in Czech and has no political connotations (cf. [[Society of Jesus|''Tovary\u0161stvo Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ovo'']], lit. \"Jesus' Journeymen\").\n*The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word is ''kameraad''. In [[Dutch Language Union|Common Dutch]] the word is mostly reminiscent of communists{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}, whereas in informal speech and dialects it can be used to indicate friends or acquaintances. It was used as a form of address in the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]], as well as in the pre-war [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]], the latter also using the female neologism ''kameraadske''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verzetsmuseum.org/tweede-wereldoorlog/nl/achtergrond/achtergrond,nsb|title=Verzetsmuseum - NSB, Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging|work=verzetsmuseum.org}}</ref> The pseudo-[[Russian language|Russian]] word ''kameraadski'' is used informally as a [[sobriquet]] for a person with leftist sympathies.\n*The [[Danish language|Danish]] word is ''kammerat'' (plural ''kammerater'') which literally translates as \"[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]],\" or \"[[:wikt:buddy|buddy]]\". It is normally used to refer to someone's childhood friend or friends, but can also be used interchangeably with ''ven'', which means ''friend''.\n*The [[Esperanto]] word for comrade is ''kamarado'' either in the sense of a friend or a political fellow-traveller. In the latter case, when used in writing, it is often abbreviated to ''K-do''. It is the preferred form of address among members of [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]]. The word ''samideano'', literally \"same-thinker\", usually refers to a fellow Esperantist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.btclick.com/ukc802510745/eo/vortlist/gcselist.htm|title=Esperanto GCSE Wordlist|work=btclick.com|access-date=2008-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531104608/http://home.btclick.com/ukc802510745/eo/vortlist/gcselist.htm|archive-date=2017-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*The [[Estonian language|Estonian]] word is ''seltsimees'' which originally comes from German ''Geselle''. Having initially a neutral meaning, the term was later adapted by local communists. Today it has an ironical meaning, referring to Soviet times.\n*The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word is ''toveri'' which literally translates as \"[[:wikt:companion|companion]]\".\n*The [[French language|French]] word is ''camarade''. It is mainly used by communists and can apply to classmates or friends.\n*The [[Georgian language|Georgian]] word is ''\u10d0\u10db\u10ee\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10d2\u10d8'' ''amkhanagi''.\n*In [[German language|German]], the word is ''Kamerad'' for a male, or ''Kameradin'' for a female. The meaning is that of a fellow, a companion or an associate. Since 'Kamerad' is the usual term for a fellow soldier in German military language, the word is associated with right-wing rather than left-wing groups. Communists and socialists, especially party members of the [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands|SED]] and [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]] use the word ''Genosse'' (fem. ''Genossin'') (ie. \"partner\", in the sense of a fellow member of a [[co-operative]]) with the socialist association that 'comrade' has in English.\n*The [[Greek language|Greek]] word is ''\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2'' (syntrophos, m.) and ''\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1'' (syntrophissa, f.), used by communists, socialists and other left-wing groups. Other meanings of this word are: mate, pal, friend, companion, even partner or associate etc.\n* The [[Hebrew]] equivalent is ''Chaver'' (\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8), a word which can mean both \"friend\" and \"member\" (of a group or organization). During the time of [[Socialist Zionist]] political and ideological dominance of the 1930s to the 1960s, the word in a sense similar to English \"comrade\" was in widespread use, in the [[Kibbutz]] movement, the [[Histadrut]] trade unions, the driver-owned bus companies etc. At present, its political use is considered old-fashioned, mainly restricted to Israeli Communists; the same word exists also in [[Yiddish]], which is one possible origin of the colloquial [[Australia]]n word \"[[wikt:cobber|cobber]]\".) The Hebrew ''Chaver'' and the female ''Chavera'' are still widely used in a non-political sense, as meaning simply \"friend\" (in certain contexts also meaning \"boyfriend/girlfriend\").\n* The [[Hindi]] equivalent for comrade or \"Saghave\" is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940). It is widely used among all leftist (communist) parties of India, e.g., [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], [[Communist Party of India]], [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)]], [[Forward Bloc]] and others.\n*The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word for comrade is ''elvt\u00e1rs''. ''elv'' means \"[[principle]]\" or \"[[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]\" while ''t\u00e1rs'' means \"fellow\". As the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] gradually gained power after the [[Second World War]], the word displaced all prior titles like ''\u00far'' (\"Mister\") and became the title used generally for everyone except for people who were obviously not \"tenet fellows\" e.g. those who committed [[political crime]] against the socialist state. After the democratic transition the word became obsolete and it is used derogatorily to address politicians on the [[political left]].\n*The [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word for comrade is ''f\u00e9lagi''. It is used as a less intimate alternative to ''vinur'' (friend). It is also the word used for a \"member\" of club or association. When used as a title to precede a name (i.e., ''f\u00e9lagi T\u00edt\u00f3'' or ''f\u00e9lagi Dimitroff'') it has a communist implication.\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'', or ''Kamerad'' are used by [[Communist Party of Indonesia|communist]], socialist, and nationalist political parties.\n*In [[Irish Language|Irish]] the word for comrade is ''comr\u00e1da\u00ed'', with ''a chara'' (friend) used as a term of address. Both expressions are used largely by [[Irish Republicans]], [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalism]], [[:Category:Communism in Ireland|Communists]], and [[:Category:Socialism in Ireland|Socialists]].\n*The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for comrade is ''compagno'' (male) or ''compagna'' (female), meaning \"companion\". This word is in widespread use among left-wing circles, including not just communists but also many socialists. The literal translation of the word comrade is ''camerata'', with the specific meaning of \"comrade-in-arms\" or \"fellow soldier\": it is used by nationalist and militarist right-wing groups. Using one word or the other is a quick way to announce one's political views.\n*The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for comrade is \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u5fd7}} (''d\u014dshi'')\", using the same Han characters as in Chinese.  The word is used to refer to like-minded persons and the usage is not necessarily limited to Communists, though the word is to some extent associated with Communism.  The word should not be confused with a homonym \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u58eb}}\", which is a more commonly used postfix to show people sharing a certain property.\n*In [[Kannada]], the word \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf\u0cb0\u0cc7, \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf (Geleya) is used among communist people's while addressing its people.\n*In [[Khmer people|Khmer]], the word \"comrade\" ({{lang-km|\u179f\u1798\u1798\u17b7\u178f\u17d2\u178f}} ''Samakmit'') was used by members of the [[Khmer Rouge]] during the [[Democratic Kampuchea|communist rule]] of [[Pol Pot]] in 1975\u20131979 and by the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] during the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] era. \n*In [[Korean language|Korean]], a good equivalent of the word would be \"\ub3d9\ubb34\" (''tongmu'') or \"\ub3d9\uc9c0\" (''tongji'', senior comrade). Although the word was originally used by Korean people all over the [[Korean Peninsula]], people living south of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]] began avoiding using the word after a [[communist state]] was set up in the north. In [[North Korea]], the word ''tongmu'' replaced all prior social titles and earned a new meaning as \"a fellow man fighting for the revolution\". The word originally meant \u201cfriend\u201d. On the other hand, the word \u201c\ub3d9\uc9c0\u201d (''tongji'') is frequently used in North Korean state media to address senior state and party leaders such as [[Kim Jong-un]]. \n*In [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], the word ''[[Heval]]'' (\"friend\" or \"companion on a long journey\") is widely used among Kurdish political parties and organizations.\n*In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], the word is ''biedrs'' for males and ''biedre'' or ''biedrene'' for females.\n*In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], the word is ''draugas'' for males and ''draug\u0117'' for females; both of which originally meant \"friend\".\n*In [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], the word is \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440 (''drugar'') for males and \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440ka (''drugarka'') for females.\n*In [[Malay language|Malay]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'' and ''Sahabat'' are used among socialist organizations.\n*In [[Malayalam]],  the word \u0d38\u0d16\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d (''sakhavu'') is used among communist organizations while addressing fellow members.\n*In [[Mexico]], the word is ''camarada'' (''camrade'') and ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n*In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the word is ''\u043d\u04e9\u0445\u04e9\u0440'' (n\u00f6kh\u00f6r). It is still in use but less than before.\n*The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] equivalent for comrade is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940) as in Hindi. It is used by communists in Nepal such as the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist)]], [[Janamorcha Nepal]] and others.\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the word is ''kamerat''. It can be associated with communist usage, but more commonly refers simply to an associate, a co-worker (''arbeidskamerat''), or a classmate in school (''klassekamerat'' or ''skolekamerat''). In everyday use, the word ''kamerat'' on its own is considered a masculine term, referring to boys/men. For girls/women, the term ''venninne'' (female form of ''venn'' friend) is used instead. When joined with other words, such as ''klassekamerat'', the word is gender neutral. (Although Norwegians would understand what is meant by ''klassevenninne'', it would also sound awkward and somewhat archaic.)\n*In the [[Philippines]], communist and left-leaning activists prefer the term ''kasama'' (roughly, companion), and the short form, ''Ka'' before the name (e.g. [[Crispin Beltran|''Ka'' Bel]]). [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestant]] (usually [[Evangelical Protestantism|Evangelical]]) clerics and members of the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] also use ''Ka'' before names or [[nicknames]], but as a contraction of ''kapat\u00edd'' (\"brother\"/\"sister\"), denoting spiritual brotherhood. Practitioners of law informally use the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] term ''compa\u00f1ero''/''compa\u00f1era'' when referring to each other, albeit without any socio-political connotation.\n*In the [[Pashto language]], the word for comrade is ''malgury''. It is used by and refers to communists, socialists, or supporters of the communist system across the [[Durand Line]] (i.e. in Afghanistan and Pakistan) by Pashto speakers. For the last decade or so it has also been used by the nationalists. The word is also used by common people both male and female for a very close friend.\n*In [[Poland]], the word is ''[[towarzysz]]'', which has the same origin as the Russian word. In non-political sense, it means \"companion\".\n*In [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], the word is ''camarada'', now being commonly employed to refer to communists or supporters of the communist system (result of the overusage of the term in the [[Carnation Revolution|post-revolutionary]] society). It is also prevalent in the army, and has been gaining popularity among nationalist movements. The term used among socialist activists nowadays tends to be ''companheiro'' / ''companheira'' although in Portugal ''camarada'' is still commonly used. Brazilian president Lula is widely known for addressing his political mates and supporters as ''companheiro'', however this decreased during the last years of his presidential term, while it was very popular during the elections, often imitated by comedians who satirized Lula's idiosyncratic manners. The terms ''camarada'' and ''companheiro(s)''/''companheira(s)'' are also used without political connotations, meaning ''mate'', ''partner'', ''fella''.\n*In the [[Punjabi language]] the word for comrade is ''Saathi'' (\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a25\u0a40). However, the word \"Comrade\" itself, or \u0a15\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a30\u0a47\u0a21, is used to refer to a communist or communist party member, and is often used as a more linguistically acceptable replacement for the word \"communist,\" with the communist party often being called \"The Comrades\" or communist thought being called \"''Comrade Sochni.\"''\n*In the [[Romani language]] the word for comrade is ''Dosti'' as seen in the phrase ''Te vestinel o dosti Tito, te vestinena o jugoslovenske manusha'' or ''Long live comrade Tito and long live the Yugoslav people''.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]] the exact translation is ''camarad'', a [[neologism]] introduced from [[French language|French]] in the 19th century,  which does not bear a political connotation, referring mainly to wartime allies and friends. During the communist era an older term, ''tovar\u0103\u0219'', derived from a Slavic source, was used to convey the political meaning.\n*The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] word for comrade is ''drug'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433) for males and ''drugarica'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430) for females; it's also a regular word for 'friend'. However, during the period of [[Josip Broz Tito]] ruled [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the leading [[Yugoslav Communist League]] promoted the use of the term between the members and generally among the society. It was not unusual to hear political leaders referring to their audience as \"''drugarice i drugovi''\" a tendency kept during the era of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] later during the 1980s and 1990s. Its intention was to emphasize empathy and equalty, and it is still used by the most fervocious adherents of leftist ideologies.\n*The [[Slovak language|Slovak]] word for comrade is ''s\u00fadruh'' (m.) and ''s\u00fadru\u017eka'' (f.). The term ''kamar\u00e1t'' is used too, but it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] word for comrade is ''tovari\u0161'' (m.) and ''tovari\u0161ica'' (f.), first attested in the 16th century. After the Second World War it was also colloquially used for 'teacher' (as an elliptical form of the official ''tovari\u0161 u\u010ditelj'' (m.), ''tovari\u0161ica u\u010diteljica'' (f.) 'comrade teacher'). After 1991 it rapidly fell out of use as a general term of address, but is still used when expressing ''comradeship'' among individuals.\n*The [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] word for comrade is ''Sangat'' '''\u0633\u0646\u06af\u062a'''; it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Somali language|Somali]] word for comrade is ''jaalle''; it is normally translated as friend. It was widely used by the erstwhile [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (1969-1991). The word fell out of use after the fall of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party.\n*In [[Spain]], the word is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'' (\"companion\"); the term ''camarada'' (\"comrade\") has also been used, but it is more associated with the communist and [[Falange]] tradition. In [[Spain]] the word ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n**The standard form in [[Cuba]] is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'', as it was in socialist [[Nicaragua]] and [[Chile]]. In some parts of Latin America, ''camarada'' is the more frequent word, except in [[Peru]], where the term is commonly associated with the [[nom de guerre]] of members of [[far left]] groups ''[[Shining Path]]'' and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], while members of the social-democrat party [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] as well as other left parties or left-leaning organizations employ ''compa\u00f1ero'' to refer to fellow members. The term ''camarada'' is the more normal among [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communists]].\n* In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], the word is \u0dc3\u0dc4\u0ddd\u0daf\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf saho\u00f0arayaa, which means brother. It is also a condescending term used by the elite (usually academics) to lure the underprivileged into the cause.\n*In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the equivalent word is ''ndugu'' for brother-in-arms, or ''dada'' for a female comrade. The word ''ndugu'' is still used in formerly socialist Tanzania as a way of showing (political) solidarity.\n*The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word is ''kamrat''. Although it can be associated with communist usage, it can equally well refer simply to a friend, a co-worker (''arbetskamrat''), or a classmate in school (''klasskamrat'' or ''skolkamrat''). Unlike the corresponding [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word, the term is commonly used for both boys and girls in non-communist usage. See also [[Idrottsf\u00f6reningen Kamraterna]]\n*The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for comrade is ''Thozhar'' (\u0ba4\u0bcb\u0bb4\u0bb0\u0bcd) and is a regular word for 'friend'.\n*In [[Tetum|Tetun]], the national language of Timor Leste, the word ''camarada'' is used&nbsp;\u2013 a direct loan from the language of the former colonial power, Portugal. During the '70s the word was a common term of address within the left leaning Fretilin party, and after the Indonesian invasion, continued to be used by the Fretilin associated guerillas waging a war of resistance in the jungle. Though largely falling out of use since 1999 Fretilin politicians and veterans of the guerillas struggle continue to use the term to refer to each other.\n*The [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''sahai'' (\u0e2a\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22) was used in the communist movement.\n*The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''Yolda\u015f'' (literally co-traveller) has become used within the communist movement, 'yol' meaning 'way' and 'cause'. [[Janissaries]] used to call each other ''yolda\u015f'' (''comrade'') or ''yolda\u015f\u00e2n'' (''pl. 'comrades' '').<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tarihtarih.com/?Syf=26&Syz=381889 | title=Garp Ocaklar\u0131nda T\u00fcrk Varl\u0131\u011f\u0131 / Prof. Dr. Atilla \u00c7etin}}</ref> Turkish communists, being morally affected by [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] values of the older era, adopted this term. In the climate of harsh anticommunist repression the word largely disappeared from common usage. \"Yolda\u015f\" is also a male name in Turkish.\n*In [[Ukraine]] ''comrade'' was still the standard form of address in the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|armed forces]] and [[National Police of Ukraine|police]] until in October 2018 it was changed by law into (the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] word) ''\u043f\u0430\u043d'' (pan; translated: \"sir\").<ref>[https://www.unian.info/politics/10285848-ukraine-s-parliament-approves-new-army-police-greeting.html Ukraine's parliament approves new army, police greeting], [[UNIAN]] (4 October 2018)</ref><ref>[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/535728.html Rada approves salute 'Glory to Ukraine' in Ukrainian army], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 October 2018)</ref>\n*In the [[United Kingdom]], political use of the term ''comrade'' is strongly associated with both Communism and, historically, Fascism. However it is still used as an informal form of address among some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members, and in a more serious manner by many smaller parties of the left. Use of the term is generally restricted to people with whom the speaker agrees politically. It is usually written in full, the abbreviation \"Cde\" being associated with southern African usage. The honorific terms \"sister\" and \"brother\", also declining in usage, are more politically inclusive, encompassing everyone from the centre-left to the far-left, without necessarily indicating complete political agreement. All three terms are occasionally used in a mocking or patronising manner by political opponents. On the far right, \"comrade\" was the standard form of address between members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and featured widely in their publications and marching songs.\n*In the [[United States]], the word \"comrade\" carries a strong connotation with Communism, [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and the former Soviet Union. Especially during the [[Cold War]], to address someone as \"comrade\" marked either the speaker, person addressed, or both as suspected communist sympathizers. It is frequently used ironically in that way. In addition, it is still used in its generic context{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} by some American socialists.  Despite this, it has been adopted into the U.S. Army Soldier's Creed in the statement \"I will never leave a fallen comrade\".  It is also used at meetings of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to address a fellow member.\n*The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] word is ''\u0111\u1ed3ng ch\u00ed'', which is derived from Chinese \u540c\u5fd7. Due to the influence of Chinese revolutionary groups during the early 20th century on the Vietnamese independence movement, its usage was first seen among members of the KMT-backed [[VNQD\u0110|Vietnamese Nationalist Party]] and then later spread to members of the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. It is still being used openly in public to address state and Communist Party leaders as well as among soldiers and military officers in the [[Vietnam People\u2019s Army]].\n\n== In literature ==\n\nIn [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'', the animals all refer to each other as comrade, as the story is a satirical look at the Russian Revolution. Also in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', party members in [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] refer to each other as comrade.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |title = The Soldiers Creed and Army Values |url = http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |work=Rhode Island National Guard |publisher=Rhode Island National Guard |accessdate = 2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100404045913/http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |archivedate = 2010-04-04 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n", "name_user": "203.99.48.181", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBackground)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrade"}

[[Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter]] embodies a \"Declaration on Non-Self-Governing Territories\" which declares that the interests of the occupants of dependent territories are paramount and requires [[member states of the United Nations]] in control of non-self-governing territories to submit annual information reports concerning the development of those territories. Since 1946, the General Assembly has maintained a list of non-self governing territories under member states' control. Since its inception, dozens of territories have been removed from the list, typically when they attained [[independence]] or internal self-government, while other territories have been added as new administering countries joined the United Nations or the General Assembly reassessed the status of certain territories.\n\n==History==\nThe United Nations Charter contains a Declaration Concerning Non-Self-Governing Territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/dicc/dicc.html |title=The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> In Chapter XI of said charter, the \"Declaration Regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories\", specifically the Article 73 point \"e\" in the Charter, it states that all member States agree to report to the United Nations, annually, on the development of non-self-governing territories under their control. {{cn span|The initial List of Non-Self-Governing Territories was created by compiling lists of dependent territories submitted by the administering States themselves. In several instances, administering States were later allowed to remove dependent territories from the list, either unilaterally (as in the case of many French overseas departments and territories),|date=February 2019}} or by vote of the General Assembly (as in the cases of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Greenland]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[Suriname]]).\n[[File:UN-Non-Self-Governing Territories.svg|thumb|left|200px|Map of territories on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.]]\nThe list draws its origins from the period of [[colonialism]] and the [[Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter|Charter's concept of non-self-governing territories]]. As an increasing number of formerly colonized countries became UN members, the General Assembly increasingly asserted its authority to place additional territories on the List and repeatedly declared that only the General Assembly had the authority to authorize a territory's being removed from the list upon attainment of any status other than full independence. For example, when Portugal joined the United Nations it contended that it controlled no non-self-governing territories, claiming that areas such as [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] were an integral part of the Portuguese state, but the General Assembly rejected this position. Similarly, [[Western Sahara]] was added in 1963 when it was a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colony. The same can be said about the situation of [[Namibia]] (removed upon its independence in 1990), which was seen, due to its former status as a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory, as a vestige of [[German colonial empire|German colonial legacy]] in Africa. A set of criteria for determining whether a territory is to be considered \"non-self-governing\" was established in General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV) of 1960.<!--Criticism of these criteria is to be found in [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories#Criticism]]--><ref>i.e. extenuating circumstance, historical control, longstanding/stagnated issue, etc.</ref>\nAlso in 1960, the General Assembly adopted [[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|Resolution 1514 (XV)]], promulgating the \"Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples\", which declared that all remaining non-self-governing territories and [[United Nations Trust Territories|trust territories]] were entitled to [[self-determination]] and [[independence]].  The following year, the General Assembly established the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples (sometimes referred to as the Special Committee on Decolonization, or the \"[[Committee of 24]]\" because for much of its history the committee was composed of 24 members), which reviews the situation in non-self-governing territories each year and reports to the General Assembly.\n\n==Resolutions adopted==\n\n===1946===\n* United Nations General Assembly Resolution 64(I) regarding

for controversy is that the list includes some dependencies that have democratically chosen to maintain their current status, or have had a referendum in which there were not enough votes for a change of status, or in some cases (such as United States Virgin Islands) simply had an insufficient number of voters participate.\n\n====Gibraltar====\n[[Gibraltar]] is a prime example of residents' preferences to retain the [[status quo]]. It is a largely self-governing British territory on the tip of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] whose territory is claimed by Spain. It has twice held a referendum to resolve its status. In the first referendum, held in 1967, the choices in the ballot were to retain their current status or to become part of Spain. The status quo was favoured by 12,138 votes to 44. In the second referendum, held in 2002, a proposal for a joint British\u2013Spanish administration of the territory was voted down by 17,900 votes to 187. (The \"no\" vote accounted for more than 85% of Gibraltar's entire electorate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2400673.stm |title=Q&A: Gibraltar's referendum |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> In neither case did the United Nations recognise the referendum: the 1967 referendum was declared to be in contravention of previous UN resolutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/236/88/IMG/NR023688.pdf?OpenElement |title=Resolution 2353 |date=19 December 1967 |publisher=[[UN]] |accessdate=28 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818005914/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/236/88/IMG/NR023688.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=18 August 2013 }}</ref> The Spanish government does not recognize any right of the current Gibraltar inhabitants to self-determination, on the grounds that they are not the original population of the territory, but residents transferred by the colonial power, the United Kingdom.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/selfdeterminatio00anto/page/209 <!-- quote=gibraltar artificial population spain. --> ''Self-Determination of Peoples: A Legal Reappraisal''], Antonio Cassese, Cambridge University Press, 1995, page 209</ref>\n\n====Tokelau====\nThe territory of [[Tokelau]] divides political opinion in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/election-2011/policies/7 Election 2011], [[Radio New Zealand]]</ref> In response to attempts at decolonizing Tokelau, New Zealand journalist Michael Field wrote in 2004: \"The UN ... is anxious to rid the world of the last remaining vestiges of colonialism by the end of the decade.

However, the terms of the referendum required a two-thirds majority to vote in favor of self-government. A [[2007 Tokelauan self-determination referendum|second referendum]] was held in 2007, in which 64.40% of Tokelauans supported self-government, falling short of the two-thirds majority by 16 votes. This led New Zealand politician and former diplomat [[John Hayes (New Zealand politician)|John Hayes]], on behalf of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], to state that \"Tokelau did the right thing to resist pressure from [the New Zealand government] and the United Nations to pursue self-government\".<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0710/S00525.htm \"Congratulations Tokelau\"], National Party press release, 26 October 2007</ref> In May 2008, the United Nations' Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] urged colonial powers \"to complete the decolonization process in every one of the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/sgsm11568.doc.htm \"Colonialism has no place in today's world,\" says Secretary General in message to Decolonization Seminar in Indonesia\"].

In past years, there were ongoing disputes between some administering powers and the Decolonization Committee over whether territories such as pre-independence [[Brunei]] and the [[West Indies Associated States]] should still be considered \"non-self-governing\", particularly in instances where the administering country was prepared to grant full independence whenever the territory requested it. These disputes became moot as those territories eventually received full independence.\n\n===Removed under other circumstances===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2013}}\nTerritories that have achieved a status described by the administering countries as internally self-governing \u2013 such as [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and the [[Cook Islands]] \u2013 have been removed from the list by vote of the General Assembly,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} often under pressure of the administering countries.\n\nSome territories that have been [[annexation|annexed]] and incorporated into the legal framework of the controlling state (such as the [[overseas departments of France]]) are considered by the UN to have been decolonized, since they then no longer constitute \"non-self-governing\" entities; their populations are assumed to have agreed to [[political union|merge]] with the former parent state. However, in 1961, the General Assembly voted to end this treatment for the \"overseas provinces\" of Portugal such as [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], which were active foci of United Nations attention until they attained independence in the mid-1970s.\n\nTerritories have also been removed for other reasons. In 1972, for example, [[Hong Kong]] (then administered by the United Kingdom) and [[Macau]] (then administered by Portugal) were removed from the list at the request of the [[People's Republic of China]], which had just been recognized as holding China's seat at the United Nations due to the PRC's belief that their status should be resolved by bilateral negotiations.<ref name=HK />\n\n===Change of status===\nOn 2 December 1986, [[New Caledonia]], an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory of France]], was reinstated on the list of non-self-governing territories, an action to which France objected. Within France it has had the status of a ''collectivit\u00e9 sui generis'', or a one-of-a-kind community, since 1999. Under the 1998 [[Noum\u00e9a Accord]], its Territorial Congress has the right to call for a referendum on independence between 2014 and 2018. [[2018 New Caledonian independence referendum|This referendum was held on 4th November 2018]], with independence being rejected.\n\nFrench Polynesia was also reinstated on the list on 17 May 2013, in somewhat contentious circumstances. Having been re-elected [[President of French Polynesia]] in 2011 (leader of local government), [[Oscar Temaru]] asked for it to be re-inscribed on the list; it had been removed in 1947. (French Polynesia is categorised by France as an [[Overseas country of France|overseas country]], in recognition of its self-governing status.) During the year 2012, Oscar Temaru engaged in intense lobbying with the micro-states of Oceania, many of which, the Solomon Islands, Nauru and Tuvalu, submitted to the UN General Assembly a draft of  resolution to affirm \"the inalienable right of the population of French Polynesia to self-determination and independence\".\n\nOn 5 May 2013, Temaru's [[Union for Democracy]] party lost the [[2013 French Polynesian legislative election|legislative election]] to [[Gaston Flosse]]'s pro-autonomy but anti-independence [[Tahoera'a Huiraatira]] party; obtaining only 11 seats against the party of Gaston Flosse, with 38 seats, and the autonomist party A Ti'a Porinetia with 8 seats.\n\nAt this stage, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] was due to discuss French Polynesia's re-inscription on the list twelve days later, in accordance with a motion tabled by the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[Nauru]]. On 16 May, the [[Assembly of French Polynesia]], with its new anti-independence majority, adopted a motion asking the United Nations not to restore the country to the list. On 17 May, despite French Polynesia's opposition, and France's, the country was restored to the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Temaru was present for the vote, on the final day of his mandate as President. The United Nations affirmed \"the inalienable right of the people of French Polynesia to self-determination and independence\".\n\nA few hours before the UN review of the resolution, during its first meeting, the new Territorial Assembly adopted by 46 votes to 10 a \"resolution\" expressing the desire of Polynesians to maintain their autonomy within the French Republic.  In spite of this resolution adopted by the parties representing 70% of the Polynesian voters, the UN General Assembly inscribed French Polynesia on the list of the territories to be decolonized during its plenary assembly of May 17, 2013. France did not take part in this session while the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom disassociated themselves from this resolution.<ref>[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=76104 \"Tahiti assembly votes against UN decolonisation bid\"], Radio New Zealand International, 17 May 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2013/05/17/la-france-ne-participera-pas-au-vote-a-l-onu-sur-la-decolonisation-de-la-polynesie_3280743_823448.html \"L'ONU adopte une r\u00e9solution sur la d\u00e9colonisation de la Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise\"].

Of these that joined the UN between 1960 and 2008, 11 were independent before 1960 and 71 were included on the list (some as a group). Twenty new UN countries resulted from breakup of [[Second World]] states: six were part of [[Yugoslavia]], two were part of [[Czechoslovakia]], and 12 were part of the [[Soviet Union]] (Ukraine and Belarus already had UN seats before the dissolution of the USSR, whose seat was reused by the Russian Federation without acceding anew). Out of the other nine, seven{{which|date=June 2017}} (mostly Arab) were colonies or protectorates of the \"Western\" countries, and one each was a non-self-governing part of Ethiopia (later independent Eritrea) and Pakistan (East Pakistan, later independent Bangladesh).

[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution]] A/RES/66 (I) dated 14 January 1946\n}}\nThe '''United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories''' is a list of places that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] deems to be \"non-self-governing\" and subject to the [[decolonization]] process. [[Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter]] embodies a \"Declaration on Non-Self-Governing Territories\" which declares that the interests of the occupants of dependent territories are paramount and requires [[member states of the United Nations]] in control of non-self-governing territories to submit annual information reports concerning the development of those territories. Since 1946, the General Assembly has maintained a list of non-self governing territories under member states' control. Since its inception, dozens of territories have been removed from the list, typically when they attained [[independence]] or internal self-government, while other territories have been added as new administering countries joined the United Nations or the General Assembly reassessed the status of certain territories.\n\n==History==\nThe United Nations Charter contains a Declaration Concerning Non-Self-Governing Territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/dicc/dicc.html |title=The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> In Chapter XI of said charter, the \"Declaration Regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories\", specifically the Article 73 point \"e\" in the Charter, it states that all member States agree to report to the United Nations, annually, on the development of non-self-governing territories under their control. {{cn span|The initial List of Non-Self-Governing Territories was created by compiling lists of dependent territories submitted by the administering States themselves. In several instances, administering States were later allowed to remove dependent territories from the list, either unilaterally (as in the case of many French overseas departments and territories),|date=February 2019}} or by vote of the General Assembly (as in the cases of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Greenland]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[Suriname]]).\n[[File:UN-Non-Self-Governing Territories.svg|thumb|left|200px|Map of territories on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.]]\nThe list draws its origins from the period of [[colonialism]] and the [[Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter|Charter's concept of non-self-governing territories]]. As an increasing number of formerly colonized countries became UN members, the General Assembly increasingly asserted its authority to place additional territories on the List and repeatedly declared that only the General Assembly had the authority to authorize a territory's being removed from the list upon attainment of any status other than full independence. For example, when Portugal joined the United Nations it contended that it controlled no non-self-governing territories, claiming that areas such as [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] were an integral part of the Portuguese state, but the General Assembly rejected this position. Similarly, [[Western Sahara]] was added in 1963 when it was a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colony. The same can be said about the situation of [[Namibia]] (removed upon its independence in 1990), which was seen, due to its former status as a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory, as a vestige of [[German colonial empire|German colonial legacy]] in Africa. A set of criteria for determining whether a territory is to be considered \"non-self-governing\" was established in General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV) of 1960.<!--Criticism of these criteria is to be found in [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories#Criticism]]--><ref>i.e. extenuating circumstance, historical control, longstanding/stagnated issue, etc.</ref>\nAlso in 1960, the General Assembly adopted [[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|Resolution 1514 (XV)]], promulgating the \"Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples\", which declared that all remaining non-self-governing territories and [[United Nations Trust Territories|trust territories]] were entitled to [[self-determination]] and [[independence]].  The following year, the General Assembly established the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples (sometimes referred to as the Special Committee on Decolonization, or the \"[[Committee of 24]]\" because for much of its history the committee was composed of 24 members), which reviews the situation in non-self-governing territories each year and reports to the General Assembly.\n\n==Resolutions adopted==\n\n===1946===\n* United Nations General Assembly Resolution 64(I) regarding

for controversy is that the list includes some dependencies that have democratically chosen to maintain their current status, or have had a referendum in which there were not enough votes for a change of status, or in some cases (such as United States Virgin Islands) simply had an insufficient number of voters participate.\n\n====Gibraltar====\n[[Gibraltar]] is a prime example of residents' preferences to retain the [[status quo]]. It is a largely self-governing British territory on the tip of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] whose territory is claimed by Spain. It has twice held a referendum to resolve its status. In the first referendum, held in 1967, the choices in the ballot were to retain their current status or to become part of Spain. The status quo was favoured by 12,138 votes to 44. In the second referendum, held in 2002, a proposal for a joint British\u2013Spanish administration of the territory was voted down by 17,900 votes to 187. (The \"no\" vote accounted for more than 85% of Gibraltar's entire electorate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2400673.stm |title=Q&A: Gibraltar's referendum |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> In neither case did the United Nations recognise the referendum: the 1967 referendum was declared to be in contravention of previous UN resolutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/236/88/IMG/NR023688.pdf?OpenElement |title=Resolution 2353 |date=19 December 1967 |publisher=[[UN]] |accessdate=28 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818005914/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/236/88/IMG/NR023688.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=18 August 2013 }}</ref> The Spanish government does not recognize any right of the current Gibraltar inhabitants to self-determination, on the grounds that they are not the original population of the territory, but residents transferred by the colonial power, the United Kingdom.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/selfdeterminatio00anto/page/209 <!-- quote=gibraltar artificial population spain. --> ''Self-Determination of Peoples: A Legal Reappraisal''], Antonio Cassese, Cambridge University Press, 1995, page 209</ref>\n\n====Tokelau====\nThe territory of [[Tokelau]] divides political opinion in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/election-2011/policies/7 Election 2011], [[Radio New Zealand]]</ref> In response to attempts at decolonizing Tokelau, New Zealand journalist Michael Field wrote in 2004: \"The UN ... is anxious to rid the world of the last remaining vestiges of colonialism by the end of the decade.

However, the terms of the referendum required a two-thirds majority to vote in favor of self-government. A [[2007 Tokelauan self-determination referendum|second referendum]] was held in 2007, in which 64.40% of Tokelauans supported self-government, falling short of the two-thirds majority by 16 votes. This led New Zealand politician and former diplomat [[John Hayes (New Zealand politician)|John Hayes]], on behalf of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], to state that \"Tokelau did the right thing to resist pressure from [the New Zealand government] and the United Nations to pursue self-government\".<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0710/S00525.htm \"Congratulations Tokelau\"], National Party press release, 26 October 2007</ref> In May 2008, the United Nations' Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] urged colonial powers \"to complete the decolonization process in every one of the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/sgsm11568.doc.htm \"Colonialism has no place in today's world,\" says Secretary General in message to Decolonization Seminar in Indonesia\"].

In past years, there were ongoing disputes between some administering powers and the Decolonization Committee over whether territories such as pre-independence [[Brunei]] and the [[West Indies Associated States]] should still be considered \"non-self-governing\", particularly in instances where the administering country was prepared to grant full independence whenever the territory requested it. These disputes became moot as those territories eventually received full independence.\n\n===Removed under other circumstances===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2013}}\nTerritories that have achieved a status described by the administering countries as internally self-governing \u2013 such as [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and the [[Cook Islands]] \u2013 have been removed from the list by vote of the General Assembly,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} often under pressure of the administering countries. \n\nSome territories that have been [[annexation|annexed]] and incorporated into the legal framework of the controlling state (such as the [[overseas departments of France]]) are considered by the UN to have been decolonized, since they then no longer constitute \"non-self-governing\" entities; their populations are assumed to have agreed to [[political union|merge]] with the former parent state. However, in 1961, the General Assembly voted to end this treatment for the \"overseas provinces\" of Portugal such as [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], which were active foci of United Nations attention until they attained independence in the mid-1970s.\n\nTerritories have also been removed for other reasons. In 1972, for example, [[Hong Kong]] (then administered by the United Kingdom) and [[Macau]] (then administered by Portugal) were removed from the list at the request of the [[People's Republic of China]], which had just been recognized as holding China's seat at the United Nations due to the PRC's belief that their status should be resolved by bilateral negotations.<ref name=HK />\n\n===Change of status===\nOn 2 December 1986, [[New Caledonia]], an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory of France]], was reinstated on the list of non-self-governing territories, an action to which France objected. Within France it has had the status of a ''collectivit\u00e9 sui generis'', or a one-of-a-kind community, since 1999. Under the 1998 [[Noum\u00e9a Accord]], its Territorial Congress has the right to call for a referendum on independence between 2014 and 2018. [[2018 New Caledonian independence referendum|This referendum was held on 4th November 2018]], with independence being rejected.\n\nFrench Polynesia was also reinstated on the list on 17 May 2013, in somewhat contentious circumstances. Having been re-elected [[President of French Polynesia]] in 2011 (leader of local government), [[Oscar Temaru]] asked for it to be re-inscribed on the list; it had been removed in 1947. (French Polynesia is categorised by France as an [[Overseas country of France|overseas country]], in recognition of its self-governing status.) During the year 2012, Oscar Temaru engaged in intense lobbying with the micro-states of Oceania, many of which, the Solomon Islands, Nauru and Tuvalu, submitted to the UN General Assembly a draft of  resolution to affirm \"the inalienable right of the population of French Polynesia to self-determination and independence\". \n\nOn 5 May 2013, Temaru's [[Union for Democracy]] party lost the [[2013 French Polynesian legislative election|legislative election]] to [[Gaston Flosse]]'s pro-autonomy but anti-independence [[Tahoera'a Huiraatira]] party; obtaining only 11 seats against the party of Gaston Flosse, with 38 seats, and the autonomist party A Ti'a Porinetia with 8 seats. \n\nAt this stage, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] was due to discuss French Polynesia's re-inscription on the list twelve days later, in accordance with a motion tabled by the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[Nauru]]. On 16 May, the [[Assembly of French Polynesia]], with its new anti-independence majority, adopted a motion asking the United Nations not to restore the country to the list. On 17 May, despite French Polynesia's opposition, and France's, the country was restored to the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Temaru was present for the vote, on the final day of his mandate as President. The United Nations affirmed \"the inalienable right of the people of French Polynesia to self-determination and independence\".\n\nA few hours before the UN review of the resolution, during its first meeting, the new Territorial Assembly adopted by 46 votes to 10 a \"resolution\" expressing the desire of Polynesians to maintain their autonomy within the French Republic.  In spite of this resolution adopted by the parties representing 70% of the Polynesian voters, the UN General Assembly inscribed French Polynesia on the list of the territories to be decolonized during its plenary assembly of May 17, 2013. France did not take part in this session while the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom disassociated themselves from this resolution.<ref>[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=76104 \"Tahiti assembly votes against UN decolonisation bid\"], Radio New Zealand International, 17 May 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2013/05/17/la-france-ne-participera-pas-au-vote-a-l-onu-sur-la-decolonisation-de-la-polynesie_3280743_823448.html \"L'ONU adopte une r\u00e9solution sur la d\u00e9colonisation de la Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise\"].

Out of the other nine, seven{{which|date=June 2017}} (mostly Arab) were colonies or protectorates of the \"Western\" countries, and one each was a non-self-governing part of Ethiopia (later independent Eritrea) and Pakistan (East Pakistan, later independent Bangladesh).

He has worked on comedy television programmes including ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', ''[[Spitting Image]]'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'' and ''[[QI]]''. He is currently the presenter of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]''.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLloyd was born in [[Dover]], England. His father, H. L. 'Harpy' Lloyd, was an [[Anglo-Irish]] captain with the [[Royal Navy]]. As a child Lloyd lived in several different places, owing to his father's job. This led him to attend school properly only at the age of 9\u00bd. He was educated at [[West Hill Park School]] in [[Titchfield]], [[Hampshire]], a place where he claims bullying was \"endemic\",<ref name=\"bosses-rejected\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9685029/TV-bosses-rejected-Spitting-Image-as-kids-stuff-before-hit-show-aired.html |title=TV bosses rejected Spitting Image as 'kid\u2019s stuff' before hit show aired |last=Nikkhah |first=Roya |date=18 November 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> and later at [[The King's School, Canterbury]].<ref name=\"bosses-rejected\"/> He read Law at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was a member of the [[Cambridge Footlights|Footlights]]. There he befriended [[Douglas Adams]], with whom he later shared a [[Apartment|flat]].\n\nLloyd is the great nephew of the soldier [[John Hardress Lloyd]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/donkey/hardresslloyd.htm |title=John Hardress-Lloyd (1874-1952) |last=Hammond |first=Bryn |website=Centre for First World War Studies |publisher=[[University of Birmingham]] |access-date=12 October 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040826045904/http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/donkey/hardresslloyd.htm |archive-date=26 August 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nLloyd worked as a radio producer at the [[BBC]] between 1974 and 1978 and created ''[[The News Quiz]]'', ''[[The News Huddlines]]'', ''[[To The Manor Born]]'' (with Peter Spence) and ''[[Quote... Unquote]]'' (with Nigel Rees). He wrote ''[[Hordes of the Things (radio series)|Hordes of the Things]]'' (as J. H. W. Lloyd) with [[Andrew Marshall (writer)|Andrew Marshall]], co-authored two episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'' with Douglas Adams, and went on to co-write the fifth and sixth episodes of the first radio series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' with Adams (Douglas Adams wrote all the previous and subsequent episodes solo, as well as the television adaptation \u2013 though Lloyd was involved in the TV series as associate producer). He wrote a lengthy storyline for season 17 of ''Doctor Who'' which was script edited by Adams. He also produced ''[[The Burkiss Way]]''.\n\nLloyd then worked as a TV producer at both the [[BBC]], producing ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'',  and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] 1979\u20131989, where he created ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' (with Sean Hardie) --dropping his writing for ''Doctor Who'' at the time-- and ''[[Spitting Image]]'' (with Peter Fluck and Roger Law). He also produced all four ''[[Blackadder]]'' series. Lloyd was originally to have been the host of BBC topical news quiz ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', with the programme initially intended to be called ''John Lloyd's Newsround''.\n\nA pilot episode of the show was recorded under this name in mid-1990, with Lloyd hosting alongside team captains [[Ian Hislop]] and [[Paul Merton]]. Lloyd subsequently decided to pull out of hosting the programme full-time and the pilot episode was never broadcast. Lloyd was replaced by [[Angus Deayton]] as host and the show was renamed ''Have I Got News for You'' in time for its debut on BBC2 later that year.\n\n==Recent work==\nLloyd married Sarah Wallace in 1989, with whom he has three children <ref>{{cite web |url=http://qi.com/people/qi-central/sarah-lloyd |title=QI Central: Sarah Lloyd |date=1 November 2012 |website=QI |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121164234/http://qi.com/people/qi-central/sarah-lloyd |archive-date=21 November 2012}}</ref>, one of whom is Harry Lloyd (christened Hardress Llewellyn Lloyd), frontman and singer-songwriter of the band Waiting For Smith.\n\nHe has worked as a TV commercials director on and off since 1987. His first new TV series for 14 years, ''[[QI]]'' starring [[Stephen Fry]] ([[Sandi Toksvig]] from 2016) and [[Alan Davies]], began on 11 September 2003 at 10pm on [[BBC Two]] for a run of 12 episodes. In its eighth series, which started on [[BBC One]] in September 2010, Lloyd appeared as a panellist in one of the episodes.

{{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 30 September 1951) is an English television producer, writer. He has worked on comedy television programmes including ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', ''[[Spitting Image]]'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'' and ''[[QI]]''. He is currently the presenter of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]''.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLloyd was born in [[Dover]], England. His father, H. L. 'Harpy' Lloyd, was an [[Anglo-Irish]] captain with the [[Royal Navy]]. As a child Lloyd lived in several different places, owing to his father's job. This led him to attend school properly only at the age of 9\u00bd. He was educated at [[West Hill Park School]] in [[Titchfield]], [[Hampshire]], a place where he claims bullying was \"endemic\",<ref name=\"bosses-rejected\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9685029/TV-bosses-rejected-Spitting-Image-as-kids-stuff-before-hit-show-aired.html |title=TV bosses rejected Spitting Image as 'kid\u2019s stuff' before hit show aired |last=Nikkhah |first=Roya |date=18 November 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> and later at [[The King's School, Canterbury]].<ref name=\"bosses-rejected\"/> He read Law at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was a member of the [[Cambridge Footlights|Footlights]]. There he befriended [[Douglas Adams]], with whom he later shared a [[Apartment|flat]].\n\nLloyd is the great nephew of the soldier [[John Hardress Lloyd]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/donkey/hardresslloyd.htm |title=John Hardress-Lloyd (1874-1952) |last=Hammond |first=Bryn |website=Centre for First World War Studies |publisher=[[University of Birmingham]] |access-date=12 October 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040826045904/http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/donkey/hardresslloyd.htm |archive-date=26 August 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nLloyd worked as a radio producer at the [[BBC]] between 1974 and 1978 and created ''[[The News Quiz]]'', ''[[The News Huddlines]]'', ''[[To The Manor Born]]'' (with Peter Spence) and ''[[Quote... Unquote]]'' (with Nigel Rees). He wrote ''[[Hordes of the Things (radio series)|Hordes of the Things]]'' (as J. H. W. Lloyd) with [[Andrew Marshall (writer)|Andrew Marshall]], co-authored two episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'' with Douglas Adams, and went on to co-write the fifth and sixth episodes of the first radio series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' with Adams (Douglas Adams wrote all the previous and subsequent episodes solo, as well as the television adaptation \u2013 though Lloyd was involved in the TV series as associate producer). He wrote a lengthy storyline for season 17 of ''Doctor Who'' which was script edited by Adams. He also produced ''[[The Burkiss Way]]''.\n\nLloyd then worked as a TV producer at both the [[BBC]], producing ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'',  and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] 1979\u20131989, where he created ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' (with Sean Hardie) --dropping his writing for ''Doctor Who'' at the time-- and ''[[Spitting Image]]'' (with Peter Fluck and Roger Law). He also produced all four ''[[Blackadder]]'' series. Lloyd was originally to have been the host of BBC topical news quiz ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', with the programme initially intended to be called ''John Lloyd's Newsround''.\n\nA pilot episode of the show was recorded under this name in mid-1990, with Lloyd hosting alongside team captains [[Ian Hislop]] and [[Paul Merton]]. Lloyd subsequently decided to pull out of hosting the programme full-time and the pilot episode was never broadcast. Lloyd was replaced by [[Angus Deayton]] as host and the show was renamed ''Have I Got News for You'' in time for its debut on BBC2 later that year.\n\n==Recent work==\nLloyd married Sarah Wallace in 1989, with whom he has three children <ref>{{cite web |url=http://qi.com/people/qi-central/sarah-lloyd |title=QI Central: Sarah Lloyd |date=1 November 2012 |website=QI |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121164234/http://qi.com/people/qi-central/sarah-lloyd |archive-date=21 November 2012}}</ref>, one of whom is Harry Lloyd (christened Hardress Llewellyn Lloyd), frontman and singer-songwriter of the band Waiting For Smith.\n\nHe has worked as a TV commercials director on and off since 1987. His first new TV series for 14 years, ''[[QI]]'' starring [[Stephen Fry]] ([[Sandi Toksvig]] from 2016) and [[Alan Davies]], began on 11 September 2003 at 10pm on [[BBC Two]] for a run of 12 episodes. In its eighth series, which started on [[BBC One]] in September 2010, Lloyd appeared as a panellist in one of the episodes. All episodes of ''QI'' (including the pilot) have been directed by Ian Lorimer. Lloyd currently presents the radio series ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]'' (2011), which he co-created with producers [[Richard Turner (producer)|Richard Turner]] and [[Dan Schreiber (producer)|Dan Schreiber]] and former co-host [[Bill Bailey]]. In December 2011, Lloyd appeared as captain of the winning [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], team on the ''[[Christmas University Challenge]]''.\n\nLloyd was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2011 [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Year Honours]] for services to broadcasting.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59647 |date=31 December 2010 |page=8 |supp=y}}</ref> Lloyd was also awarded an honorary degree from [[Southampton Solent University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solent.ac.uk/news/news-articles/2012/john-lloyd-hondoc.aspx |title=John Lloyd CBE receives honorary degree |date=2012 |website=Southampton Solent University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929082451/http://www.solent.ac.uk/news/news-articles/2012/john-lloyd-hondoc.aspx |archivedate=29 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2014, Lloyd was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on that issue]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland \u2013 full text and list of signatories |date=7 August 2014 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nHis most recent work, ''1,411 Quite Interesting Facts to Knock You Sideways'', a collaboration with [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]] and [[James Harkin (podcaster)|James Harkin]], was published in 2014 by [[Faber and Faber]].\n\n==Influences==\n\nIn a 2016 interview with the [[spirituality|spiritual]] ''Beshara Magazine'', Lloyd talked about the process of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], and explained his interest in the Indian [[guru]], [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]]'s book ''I Am That'', and in [[Sufism|Sufi]] mysticism, particularly the works of the writer, thinker and Sufi teacher, [[Idries Shah]].<ref name=\"Interesting education\">{{cite interview |url=https://besharamagazine.org/arts-literature/a-quite-interesting-approach-to-education/ |last=Lloyd |first=John |interviewer=Jane Clark and Hilary Papworth |title=A 'Quite Interesting' Approach To Education |publisher=The Beshara Trust |location=United Kingdom |date=2016 |work=Beshara Magazine |access-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921095129/https://besharamagazine.org/arts-literature/a-quite-interesting-approach-to-education/ |archive-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n\n{{-}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!
