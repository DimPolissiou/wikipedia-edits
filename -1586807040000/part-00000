Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.\n\n== History ==\n\n===20th century===\n\n====The Babson Institute====\nOn September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.\n\nBabson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.\n\nThe institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline \u2013 Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Three College Collaboration====\nBabson is involved in a three college collaboration with [[Olin College]] and [[Wellesley College]] (a collaboration often referred to as BOW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/|title=Babson 100|website=Babson Centennial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bow3colleges.org/|title=Babson/Olin/Wellesley {{!}} Three College Collaboration|website=bow3colleges.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Wellesley Main Campus===\nThe main residential campus of Babson College is {{convert|350|acre|km2}} and located in the \"Babson Park\" section of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], just fifteen miles west of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/About/ |title=About Babson |work=babson.edu |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227181958/http://www3.babson.edu/About/| archivedate= December 27, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[Franklin W.

Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.\n\n== History ==\n\n===20th century===\n\n====The Babson Institute====\nOn September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.\n\nBabson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.\n\nThe institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline \u2013 Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Three College Collaboration====\nBabson is involved in a three college collaboration with [[Olin College]] and [[Wellesley College]] (a collaboration often referred to as BOW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/|title=Babson 100|website=Babson Centennial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bow3colleges.org/|title=Babson/Olin/Wellesley {{!}} Three College Collaboration|website=bow3colleges.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Wellesley Main Campus===\nThe main residential campus of Babson College is {{convert|350|acre|km2}} and located in the \"Babson Park\" section of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], just fifteen miles west of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/About/ |title=About Babson |work=babson.edu |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227181958/http://www3.babson.edu/About/| archivedate= December 27, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[Franklin W.

The assassination of these military leaders was part of [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|escalating tensions between the US and Iran]] and the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|American-led intervention in Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Qassem Suleimani: 'Death to America' chants at Baghdad funeral procession | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/huge-crowds-expected-in-baghdad-for-funeral-of-iranian-general-killed-by-us | first=Ghait|last=Abdul-Ahat|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date= January 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Iran Says It Has Decided How to React to U.S. Strike That Killed Soleimani | url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/four-rockets-hit-military-base-near-baghdad-airport-report-says-1.8350357 | first=Amos|last=Harel|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date= January 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===As a tool of insurgents===\nInsurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.\n\nThe [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919\u201321 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit \u2013 [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] \u2013 for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.\n\nThis tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969\u20131998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|Unionist]] politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.\n\n[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.\n\nThe [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' \u2013 Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>\n\n==Psychology==\nA major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\nHowever, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\n==Techniques==\n\n===Modern methods===\n\nWith the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival since they could quickly flee the scene.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.\n\nExplosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' \u2013 [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004</ref> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.\n\n[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]\n[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\nA [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain pragmatic difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.<ref name=\"Austria\">''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' \u2013 [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007</ref>\n\nDespite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\nIn the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella]. [[BBC]] World Service, 2007.</ref> The [[CIA]] made several [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro]], many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, KGB assassin [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders [[Lev Rebet]] and [[Stepan Bandera]] with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed [[cyanide]] ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks.<ref>Christopher Andrew and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]].

To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.\n\nNotable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]\u2014though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.\n\nThis bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).\n\nAnother notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.\n\n===Modern strategies===\n[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nWith the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.\n\nAs the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them.

Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coups d'\u00e9tat]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]].\n\n[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil]]\nThe methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[MRAP]]-like [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.<ref name=\"Report\"/>\n\nOther potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.<ref name=\"FOX\">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden&nbsp;... or Is It? |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans |access-date=December 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130250/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[United States Secret Service]] protective agents receive training in the psychology of assassins.<ref>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Pelley |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/14/60II/main171812.shtml |title=Mind of the Assassin |publisher= CBS 60&nbsp;Minutes II |date=August 15, 2000 |accessdate= March 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Assassinations in fiction]]\n* [[Contract killing]]\n* [[History of assassination]]\n* [[List of assassinations]]\n* [[List of people who survived assassination attempts]]\n* [[List of assassinated and executed heads of state and government]]\n* [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]\n* [[List of assassinations by firearm]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ayton, Mel  '' Plotting to Kill the President: Assassination Attempts from Washington to Hoover'' (Potomac Books, 2017), United States\n* {{cite book |last=Clarke |first=James W. |year=2006 |title=Defining Danger: American Assassins and the New Domestic Terrorists}}\n* {{cite book |last=Clarke |first=James W. |date=January 28, 2011 |title=America's History of Crazy Political Assassins Didn't Begin with Loughner|publisher=History News Network'}}\n* {{cite book |last=Porter |first=Lindsay |title=Assassination: a History of Political Murder |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]]  |year=2010}} [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7545208/Assassination-A-History-of-Political-Murder-by-Lindsay-Porter.html Review] [[The Daily Telegraph]], April 3, 2010.\n* {{cite book| chapter=Section B.

Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also advises rulers to assassinate enemies whenever possible so they won't pose a threat.<ref>Machiavelli, Niccol\u00f2 (1985), The Prince, University of Chicago Press. Translated by Harvey Mansfield</ref> An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.\n\nFor similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of [[foreign policy]].  The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.<ref name=\"iraja\">{{cite journal | title=Decision Making in Using Assassinations in International Relations | url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19545 | journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] | volume=131| issue=3 | date=Fall 2016 | pages= 503\u2013539 | last=Schilling | first=Warner R. | authorlink=Warner R.

Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a tool:\n\n* The [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]] in Prague on May 27, 1942 by the British and Czechoslovak government-in-exile.  This case illustrates the difficulty of comparing the benefits of a foreign policy goal (strengthening the legitimacy and influence of the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] in London) against the possible costs resulting from an assassination (the [[Lidice massacre]]).<ref name=\"iraja\"/>\n* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.\n* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as \"The Desert Fox\").<ref name=\"Skor\">''Commando Extraordinary'' \u2013 Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155</ref>\n\nUse of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:\n* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] in order to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and it killed between 6,000 and 41,000 people, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* With the [[2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike|Baghdad International Airport airstrike]] the US assassinated the commander of Iran's [[Quds Force]] General [[Qasem Soleimani]] and the commander of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]] along with 8 other high-ranking military personnel. The assassination of these military leaders was part of [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|escalating tensions between the US and Iran]] and the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|American-led intervention in Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Qassem Suleimani: 'Death to America' chants at Baghdad funeral procession | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/huge-crowds-expected-in-baghdad-for-funeral-of-iranian-general-killed-by-us | first=Ghait|last=Abdul-Ahat|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date= January 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Iran Says It Has Decided How to React to U.S. Strike That Killed Soleimani | url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/four-rockets-hit-military-base-near-baghdad-airport-report-says-1.8350357 | first=Amos|last=Harel|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date= January 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===As a tool of insurgents===\nInsurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.\n\nThe [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919\u201321 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit \u2013 [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] \u2013 for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.\n\nThis tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969\u20131998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|Unionist]] politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.\n\n[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.\n\nThe [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' \u2013 Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>\n\n==Psychology==\nA major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\nHowever, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\n==Techniques==\n\n===Modern methods===\n\nWith the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival since they could quickly flee the scene.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.\n\nExplosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' \u2013 [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004</ref> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.\n\n[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]\n[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\nA [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain pragmatic difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.<ref name=\"Austria\">''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' \u2013 [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007</ref>\n\nDespite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name=\"SS\"/>\n\nIn the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella].

Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way\u2014both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,<ref name=\"SS\">''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620171200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf |date=June 20, 2006 }}'' \u2013 Fein, Robert A. & Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999</ref><ref>[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] \u2013 Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.\n\nNotable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]\u2014though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.\n\nThis bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).\n\nAnother notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.\n\n===Modern strategies===\n[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nWith the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.\n\nAs the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].<ref>''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071805/http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php |date=January 3, 2007 }}'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)</ref> [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  \u2013 so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.\n\nAccess to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;<ref name=\"Report\">[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] \u2013 Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].\n\nMost modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coups d'\u00e9tat]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]].\n\n[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil]]\nThe methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[MRAP]]-like [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.<ref name=\"Report\"/>\n\nOther potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.<ref name=\"FOX\">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden&nbsp;... or Is It? |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans |access-date=December 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130250/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[United States Secret Service]] protective agents receive training in the psychology of assassins.<ref>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Pelley |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/14/60II/main171812.shtml |title=Mind of the Assassin |publisher= CBS 60&nbsp;Minutes II |date=August 15, 2000 |accessdate= March 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Assassinations in fiction]]\n* [[Contract killing]]\n* [[History of assassination]]\n* [[List of assassinations]]\n* [[List of people who survived assassination attempts]]\n* [[List of assassinated and executed heads of state and government]]\n* [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]\n* [[List of assassinations by firearm]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ayton, Mel  '' Plotting to Kill the President: Assassination Attempts from Washington to Hoover'' (Potomac Books, 2017), United States\n* {{cite book |last=Clarke |first=James W. |year=2006 |title=Defining Danger: American Assassins and the New Domestic Terrorists}}\n* {{cite book |last=Clarke |first=James W. |date=January 28, 2011 |title=America's History of Crazy Political Assassins Didn't Begin with Loughner|publisher=History News Network'}}\n* {{cite book |last=Porter |first=Lindsay |title=Assassination: a History of Political Murder |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]]  |year=2010}} [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7545208/Assassination-A-History-of-Political-Murder-by-Lindsay-Porter.html Review] [[The Daily Telegraph]], April 3, 2010.\n* {{cite book| chapter=Section B.

{"title_page": "Window function", "text_new": "{{Short description|function used in signal processing}}\n{{For|the term used in SQL statements|Window function (SQL)}}\n[[File:Hanning.png|thumb|A popular window function, the [[#Hann and Hamming windows|Hann window]].  Most popular window functions are similar bell-shaped curves.]]\n\nIn [[signal processing]] and [[statistics]], a '''window function''' (also known as an '''apodization function''' or '''tapering function'''<ref name=Weisstein/>) is a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] that is zero-valued outside of some chosen [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], normally symmetric around the middle of the interval, usually near a maximum in the middle, and usually tapering away from the middle. Mathematically, when another function or waveform/data-sequence is \"multiplied\" by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap, the \"view through the window\".  Equivalently, and in actual practice, the segment of data within the window is first isolated, and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values.  Thus, [[Tapering (mathematics)|tapering]], not segmentation, is the main purpose of window functions.\n\nThe reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra.  The duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution.  But that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called [[spectral leakage]].  Window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways, according to the needs of the particular application.  There are many choices detailed in this article, but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice.\n\nIn typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, \"bell-shaped\" curves.<ref name=Roads/> Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used.  A rectangular window does not modify the data segment at all.  It's only for modelling purposes that we say it multiplies by 1 inside the window and by 0 outside.  A more general definition of window functions does not require them to be identically zero outside an interval, as long as the product of the window multiplied by its argument is [[square integrable]], and, more specifically, that the function goes sufficiently rapidly toward zero.<ref name=Cattani/>\n\n== Applications ==\n\nWindow functions are used in spectral [[frequency spectrum#spectral analysis|analysis]]/modification/[[Overlap\u2013add method#resynthesis|resynthesis]],<ref name=OLA/> the design of [[finite impulse response]] filters, as well as [[beamforming]] and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] design.\n\n=== Spectral analysis ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nThe [[Fourier transform]] of the function cos&nbsp;''\u03c9t'' is zero, except at frequency&nbsp;\u00b1''\u03c9''.  However, many other functions and waveforms do not have convenient closed-form transforms. Alternatively, one might be interested in their spectral content only during a certain time period.\n\nIn either case, the Fourier transform (or a similar transform) can be applied on one or more finite intervals of the waveform.  In general, the transform is applied to the product of the waveform and a window function.  Any window (including rectangular) affects the spectral estimate computed by this method.\n\n[[File:Spectral_leakage_caused_by_%22windowing%22.svg|thumb|351px|Figure 2: Windowing a sinusoid causes spectral leakage. The same amount of leakage occurs whether there are an integer (blue) or non-integer (red) number of cycles within the window (rows 1 and 2). When the sinusoid is sampled and windowed, its discrete-time Fourier transform also exhibits the same leakage pattern (rows 3 and 4). But when the DTFT is only sparsely sampled, at a certain interval, it is possible (depending on your point of view) to: (1) avoid the leakage, or (2) create the illusion of no leakage. For the case of the blue DTFT, those samples are the outputs of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The red DTFT has the same interval of zero-crossings, but the DFT samples fall in-between them, and the leakage is revealed.]]\n\n==== Choice of window function ====\n\nWindowing of a simple waveform like cos&nbsp;''\u03c9t'' causes its Fourier transform to develop non-zero values (commonly called [[spectral leakage]]) at frequencies other than ''\u03c9''. The leakage tends to be worst (highest) near ''\u03c9'' and least at frequencies farthest from&nbsp;''\u03c9''.\n\nIf the waveform under analysis comprises two sinusoids of different frequencies, leakage can interfere with our ability to distinguish them spectrally. Possible types of interference are often broken down into two opposing classes as follows: If the component frequencies are dissimilar and one component is weaker, then leakage from the stronger component can obscure the weaker one's presence. But if the frequencies are too similar, leakage can render them ''unresolvable'' even when the sinusoids are of equal strength. Windows that are effective against the first type of interference, namely where components have dissimilar frequencies and amplitudes, are called ''high [[dynamic range]]''. Conversely, windows that can distinguish components with similar frequencies and amplitudes are called ''high resolution''.\n\nThe rectangular window is an example of a window that is ''high resolution'' but ''low dynamic range'', meaning it is good for distinguishing components of similar amplitude even when the frequencies are also close, but poor at distinguishing components of different amplitude even when the frequencies are far away. High-resolution, low-dynamic-range windows such as the rectangular window also have the property of high '''''sensitivity''''', which is the ability to reveal relatively weak sinusoids in the presence of additive random noise. That is because the noise produces a stronger response with high-dynamic-range windows than with high-resolution windows.\n\nAt the other extreme of the range of window types are windows with high dynamic range but low resolution and sensitivity. High-dynamic-range windows are most often justified in ''wideband applications'', where the spectrum being analyzed is expected to contain many different components of various amplitudes.\n\nIn between the extremes are moderate windows, such as [[#Hann and Hamming windows|Hamming]] and [[#Hann and Hamming windows|Hann]]. They are commonly used in ''narrowband applications'', such as the spectrum of a telephone channel.\n\nIn summary, spectral analysis involves a trade-off between resolving comparable strength components with similar frequencies (''high resolution / sensitivity'') and resolving disparate strength components with dissimilar frequencies (''high dynamic range''). That trade-off occurs when the window function is chosen.{{efn-la\n|[[#refNuttall|Nuttall 1981]], p 90}}\n\n==== Discrete-time signals ====\n\nWhen the input waveform is time-sampled, instead of continuous, the analysis is usually done by applying a window function and then a [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT). But the DFT provides only a sparse sampling of the actual [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT) spectrum. Figure 2, row 3 shows a DTFT for a rectangularly-windowed sinusoid. The actual frequency of the sinusoid is indicated as \"13\" on the horizontal axis. Everything else is leakage, exaggerated by the use of a logarithmic presentation. The unit of frequency is \"DFT bins\"; that is, the integer values on the frequency axis correspond to the frequencies sampled by the DFT.  So the figure depicts a case where the actual frequency of the sinusoid coincides with a DFT sample, and the maximum value of the spectrum is accurately measured by that sample.  In row 4, it misses the maximum value by \u00bd bin, and the resultant measurement error is referred to as '''''scalloping loss''''' (inspired by the shape of the peak).  For a known frequency, such as a musical note or a sinusoidal test signal, matching the frequency to a DFT bin can be prearranged by choices of a sampling rate and a window length that results in an integer number of cycles within the window.\n\n[[File:Processing losses for 3 window functions.svg|thumb|400px|Figure 3: This figure compares the processing losses of three window functions for sinusoidal inputs, with both minimum and maximum scalloping loss.]]\n\n==== Noise bandwidth ====\n\nThe concepts of resolution and dynamic range tend to be somewhat subjective, depending on what the user is actually trying to do.  But they also tend to be highly correlated with the total leakage, which is quantifiable.  It is usually expressed as an equivalent bandwidth, B.  It can be thought of as redistributing the DTFT into a rectangular shape with height equal to the spectral maximum and width B.{{efn-ua\n|name=noise bandwidth|1=Mathematically, the noise equivalent bandwidth of transfer function ''H'' is the bandwidth of an ideal rectangular filter with the same peak gain as ''H'' that would pass the same power with [[white noise]] input.  In the units of frequency ''f'' (e.g. [[hertz]]), it is given by''':'''\n\n:<math> B_{\\text{noise}} = \\frac{1}{|H(f)|^2_{\\max}} \\int_0^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 df.</math>\n}}<ref name=Carlson/>  The more the leakage, the greater the bandwidth.  It is sometimes called ''noise equivalent bandwidth'' or ''equivalent noise bandwidth'', because it is proportional to the average power that will be registered by each DFT bin when the input signal contains a random noise component (or '''is''' just random noise).  A graph of the [[power spectrum]], averaged over time, typically reveals a flat ''[[noise floor]]'', caused by this effect.  The height of the noise floor is proportional to B.  So two different window functions can produce different noise floors.\n\n==== Processing gain and losses ====\nIn [[signal processing]], operations are chosen to improve some aspect of quality of a signal by exploiting the differences between the signal and the corrupting influences.  When the signal is a sinusoid corrupted by additive random noise, spectral analysis distributes the signal and noise components differently, often making it easier to detect the signal's presence or measure certain characteristics, such as amplitude and frequency.  Effectively, the [[signal to noise ratio]] (SNR) is improved by distributing the noise uniformly, while concentrating most of the sinusoid's energy around one frequency.  ''Processing gain'' is a term often used to describe an SNR improvement.  The processing gain of spectral analysis depends on the window function, both its noise bandwidth (B) and its potential scalloping loss.  These effects partially offset, because windows with the least scalloping naturally have the most leakage.\n\nFigure 3 depicts the effects of three different window functions on the same data set, comprising two equal strength sinusoids in additive noise.  The frequencies of the sinusoids are chosen such that one encounters no scalloping and the other encounters maximum scalloping.  Both sinusoids suffer less SNR loss under the Hann window than under the [[Ralph Beebe Blackman|Blackman]]\u2013[[Fredric J. Harris|Harris]] window.  In general (as mentioned earlier), this is a deterrent to using high-dynamic-range windows in low-dynamic-range applications.\n\n=== Filter design ===\n\n{{Main|Filter design}}\n\nWindows are sometimes used in the design of [[digital filters]], in particular to convert an \"ideal\" impulse response of infinite duration, such as a [[sinc function]], to a [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filter design.  That is called the [[Finite impulse response#Window design method|''window method'']].<ref name=Oppenheim/><ref name=FIRfilters/><ref name=Tuwien/>\n\n=== Statistics and curve fitting ===\n\n{{Main|kernel (statistics)}}\n\nWindow functions are sometimes used in the field of [[statistics|statistical analysis]] to restrict the set of data being analyzed to a range near a given point, with a [[Weighting | weighting factor]] that diminishes the effect of points farther away from the portion of the curve being fit. In the field of  Bayesian analysis and [[curve fitting]], this is often referred to as the [[kernel (statistics)|kernel]].\n\n=== Rectangular window applications ===\n\n==== Analysis of transients ====\n\nWhen analyzing a transient signal in [[modal analysis]], such as an impulse, a shock response, a sine burst, a chirp burst, or noise burst, where the energy vs time distribution is extremely uneven, the rectangular window may be most appropriate.  For instance, when most of the energy is located at the beginning of the recording, a non-rectangular window attenuates most of the energy, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio.<ref name=HPmemory/>\n\n==== Harmonic analysis ====\n\nOne might wish to measure the harmonic content of a musical note from a particular instrument or the harmonic distortion of an amplifier at a given frequency.  Referring again to '''Figure 2''', we can observe that there is no leakage at a discrete set of harmonically-related frequencies sampled by the DFT.  (The spectral nulls are actually zero-crossings, which cannot be shown on a logarithmic scale such as this.)  This property is unique to the rectangular window, and it must be appropriately configured for the signal frequency, as described above.\n\n[[File:Two 8-point Gaussian window functions.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 4: Two different ways to generate an 8-point Gaussian window sequence (\u03c3=0.4) for spectral analysis applications. MATLAB calls them \"symmetric\" and \"periodic\". The latter is also historically called ''DFT-even''.]]\n\n[[File:Spectral_leakage_from_two_8-point_Gaussian_windows.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5: Spectral leakage characteristics of the functions in Figure 4]]\n\n<!-- Probably too much information, too soon.\n[[File:Comparison of symmetric and periodic Gaussian windows.svg|thumb|300px|Figures 6a and 6b: Comparison of symmetric and periodic Gaussian windows]]\n-->\n\n===Symmetry===\n\nThe formulas provided in this article produce discrete sequences, as if a continuous window function has been \"sampled\". (see an example at [[Kaiser window]])&nbsp; Window sequences can be either '''symmetric''' or 1-sample short of symmetric (called '''asymmetric''' or '''periodic''').<ref name=MWhann/><ref name=MWwindow/>{{efn-ua\n|1=''Periodic'' is an oblique reference to the fact that symmetry around the n=0 axis is restored when the sequence is viewed as one full cycle of a periodic sequence.\n}}&nbsp; For instance, a symmetric sequence, with its maximum at a single center-point, is generated by the [[MATLAB]] function <code>hann(9,'symmetric')</code>.  Deleting the last sample produces a sequence identical to <code>hann(8,'periodic')</code>.  An even-length symmetric sequence has two equal center-points, but most window functions used in practice have a single peak value, whether they are symmetric or asymmetric.\n\nSome functions have one or two zero-valued end-points, which are unnecessary in most applications.  Deleting a zero-valued end-point has no effect on its DTFT (spectral leakage).  But the function designed for {{mvar|N}}+1 or {{mvar|N}}+2 samples, in anticipation of deleting one or both end points, typically has a slightly narrower main lobe, slightly higher sidelobes, and a slightly lower noise bandwidth.\n\n====DFT-even====\nThe terminology ''DFT-even'' ([[#refHarris|Harris 1978]], p 52) <!--{{efn-la|[[#refHarris|f.harris 1978]], p 52.}}--> describes a subclass of ''periodic'' (or ''asymmetric'') windows, characterized by only even-length sequences.  Some potential advantages (application-dependent) for spectral analysis (DFT) are:\n\n*Efficiency:  FFT algorithms are most efficient when the sequence length is an integer power-of-two.\n\n*Zero-valued DFT coefficients:  The DFT-even subset of [[#Cosine-sum windows]], including [[#Rectangular window]], have very few non-zero DFT coefficients.  We see the rectangular window effect in the third row of '''Figure 2'''.&nbsp; A cosine-sum example is [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/DFT-even_Hann_window_%26_spectral_leakage.png  figure '''DFT-even Hann window'''], which shows that the {{mvar|N}}-point DFT of the sequence generated by hann({{mvar|N}},'periodic') has only 3 non-zero values.  All the other samples coincide with zero-crossings of the [[DTFT]].{{efn-ua\n|The sparse sampling of a DTFT only reveals the leakage into the DFT bins from a sinusoid whose frequency is also an integer DFT bin. The unseen sidelobes reveal the leakage to expect from sinusoids at other frequencies.{{efn-la\n|[[#refHarris|f.harris 1978]], fig 10, p 57.}} Thus, when choosing a window function, it is usually important to sample the DTFT more densely (as we do in the next section) and choose a window that suppresses the sidelobes to an acceptable level.\n}}  Besides the application already described at [[#Harmonic analysis]], this property is useful for real-time applications that require both windowed and non-windowed (rectangularly windowed) transforms,<ref name=Carlin/> because the windowed transforms can be  efficiently derived from the non-windowed transforms by [[Discrete Fourier transform#Convolution theorem duality|convolution]].{{efn-la\n|[[#refNuttall|Nuttall 1981]], p 85\n}}  In that application, real-valued DFT coefficients (next bullet) is also an efficiency multiplier.\n\n*Real-valued DFT coefficients:  [[#refHarris|Harris (1978)]] cites this as the DFT equivalent of earlier work, where windows for the DFT's predecessor ([[finite Fourier transform]]) are \"always an odd number of points and exhibit even symmetry about the origin\", which results in an entirely real-valued DTFT.\n\nThe [[DTFT]] is a continuous function of frequency <math>(f),</math> and the DFT is a method of sampling it.  But as Harris points out, the DFT requires an implied shift of the symmetric sequence from a domain {{nowrap|[\u2212''M'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 ''M''],}} known as a ''finite Fourier transform data window'', into {{nowrap|[0 \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 2''M''],}} a ''DFT data window''.  Effectively, the real-valued function being sampled is multiplied by a complex-valued phase function:  <math>e^{-i2\\pi f M}.</math>&nbsp;  Therefore, a straightforward DFT of length 2M+1 would sample at frequency intervals of 1/(2M+1), and the samples would be complex-valued, whereas samples at intervals of 1/(2M) are all real, although the odd-numbered ones are negated relative to the original DTFT.  To compute samples at intervals of 1/(2M), using a DFT, its length must be 2M.  Two methods available are simple truncation (deleting the last sample) and [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#L=N+1|''periodic summation'']] (combining the first and last samples by addition).  Both result in a sequence length of 2M, to which a '''DFT-even''' window can be applied.  The difference is that truncation affects the DTFT function being sampled, and periodic summation affects only the sampling intervals.\n\n*In both cases, only the window function itself will have real-valued DTFT samples.  Windowed data will generally lack the symmetry to preserve that characteristic.  But other than the predictable sign reversals, the phase component of the DTFT will be representative of the data, not the window function.\n\n*Truncation affects only the real components of the DTFT samples.  The imaginary ones remain zero-valued.  Harris attributes this effect to what he calls ''DFT-even symmetry''.  [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Sampling_the_Discrete-time_Fourier_transform.svg Figure '''Sampling the DTFT'''] is an exaggerated example{{efn-ua\n|An abnormally wide and short Gaussian window is used.\n}} of both methods, also showing how real-valued samples are obtained from the complex DTFT.\n\n*The effect of truncation on spectral leakage is best understood in terms of the magnitude of the DTFT, shown in decibels.  At [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Comparison_of_symmetric_and_periodic_Gaussian_windows.svg figure '''Gaussian windows'''], the graph labeled ''DTFT periodic8'' is the DTFT of the truncated window labeled ''periodic DFT-even'' (both blue).  The green graph labeled ''DTFT symmetric9'' corresponds to the same window with its symmetry restored.  The DTFT samples, labeled ''DFT8 periodic summation'', are an example of using periodic summation to sample it at the same frequencies as the blue graph.\n\n== A list of window functions ==\n\nConventions''':'''\n\n*<math>w_0(x)</math> is a zero-phase function (symmetrical about x=0)<ref name=Zphase/>, continuous for <math>x \\in [-N/2, N/2],</math> where N is a positive integer (even or odd).<ref name=Rorabaugh/>\n\n*The sequence &nbsp;<math>\\{w[n] = w_0(n-N/2),\\quad 0\\le n \\le N\\}</math>&nbsp; is ''symmetric'', of length <math>N+1.</math>\n\n*<math>\\{w[n],\\quad 0\\le n \\le N-1\\}</math>&nbsp; is ''asymmetric'', of length <math>N.</math>{{efn-ua\n|Some authors limit their attention to this important subset and to even values of N.<ref name=f.harris/><ref name=Heinzel2002/>  But the window coefficient formulas are still the ones presented here.}}\n\n*The parameter '''B''' displayed on each spectral plot is the function's noise equivalent bandwidth metric, in units of ''DFT bins''.\n\n=== Rectangular window ===\n<!-- [[Boxcar window]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Window function and frequency response - Rectangular.svg|thumb|480px|right|Rectangular window]]\n\nThe rectangular window (sometimes known as the '''[[Boxcar function|boxcar]]''' or '''[[Dirichlet kernel|Dirichlet]] window''') is the simplest window, equivalent to replacing all but ''N'' values of a data sequence by zeros, making it appear as though the waveform suddenly turns on and off:\n\n:<math>w[n] = 1.</math>\n\nOther windows are designed to moderate these sudden changes, which reduces scalloping loss and improves dynamic range, as described above ({{slink||Spectral analysis}}).\n\nThe rectangular window is the 1st order ''B''-spline window as well as the 0th power [[#Power-of-sine/cosine_windows|Power-of-sine window]].\n{{clear}}\n\n=== ''B''-spline windows ===\n\n''B''-spline windows can be obtained as ''k''-fold convolutions of the rectangular window.

The frequency axis has units of FFT \"bins\" when the window of length N is applied to data and a transform of length N is computed.  For instance, the value at frequency \u00bd \"bin\" (third tick mark) is the response that would be measured in bins k and k+1 to a sinusoidal signal at frequency k+\u00bd.  It is relative to the maximum possible response, which occurs when the signal frequency is an integer number of bins.  The value at frequency \u00bd is referred to as the maximum ''scalloping loss'' of the window, which is one metric used to compare windows.  The rectangular window is noticeably worse than the others in terms of that metric.\n\nOther metrics that can be seen are the width of the main lobe and the peak level of the sidelobes, which respectively determine the ability to resolve comparable strength signals and disparate strength signals.  The rectangular window (for instance) is the best choice for the former and the worst choice for the latter.  What cannot be seen from the graphs is that the rectangular window has the best noise bandwidth, which makes it a good candidate for detecting low-level sinusoids in an otherwise [[white noise]] environment.  Interpolation techniques, such as [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#L\u2264N|zero-padding]] and frequency-shifting, are available to mitigate its potential scalloping loss. {{clear}}\n\n== Overlapping windows ==\n\nWhen the length of a data set to be transformed is larger than necessary to provide the desired frequency resolution, a common practice is to subdivide it into smaller sets and window them individually.  To mitigate the \"loss\" at the edges of the window, the individual sets may overlap in time.  See [[Welch method]] of power spectral analysis and the [[modified discrete cosine transform]].\n\n== Two-dimensional windows ==\nTwo-dimensional windows are commonly used in image processing to reduce unwanted high-frequencies in the image Fourier transform.<ref name=Hovden/> They can be constructed from one-dimensional windows in either of two forms.<ref name=Bernstein/> The separable form, <math>W(m,n)=w(m)w(n)</math> is trivial to compute.

Only the [[#Gaussian_window|Gaussian]] function is both separable and isotropic.<ref name=Awad/> The separable forms of all other window functions have corners that depend on the choice of the coordinate axes. The isotropy/[[anisotropy]] of a two-dimensional window function is shared by its two-dimensional Fourier transform. The difference between the separable and radial forms is akin to the result of [[diffraction]] from rectangular vs. circular appertures, which can be visualized in terms of the product of two [[sinc function]]s vs. an [[Airy function]], respectively.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Window function}}\n* [[Spectral leakage]]\n* [[Multitaper]]\n* [[Apodization]]\n* [[Welch method]]\n* [[Short-time Fourier transform]]\n* [[Window design method]]\n* [[Kolmogorov\u2013Zurbenko filter]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== Page citations==\n{{notelist-la}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1|refs=\n<ref name=Oppenheim>\n{{Cite book\n |ref=refOppenheim\n |last=Oppenheim\n |first=Alan V.\n |authorlink=Alan V.

Most popular window functions are similar bell-shaped curves.]]\n\nIn [[signal processing]] and [[statistics]], a '''window function''' (also known as an '''apodization function''' or '''tapering function'''<ref name=Weisstein/>) is a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] that is zero-valued outside of some chosen [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], normally symmetric around the middle of the interval, usually near a maximum in the middle, and usually tapering away from the middle. Mathematically, when another function or waveform/data-sequence is \"multiplied\" by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap, the \"view through the window\".  Equivalently, and in actual practice, the segment of data within the window is first isolated, and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values.  Thus, [[Tapering (mathematics)|tapering]], not segmentation, is the main purpose of window functions.\n\nThe reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra.  The duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution.  But that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called [[spectral leakage]].  Window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways, according to the needs of the particular application.  There are many choices detailed in this article, but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice.\n\nIn typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, \"bell-shaped\" curves.<ref name=Roads/> Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used.  A rectangular window does not modify the data segment at all.  It's only for modelling purposes that we say it multiplies by 1 inside the window and by 0 outside.  A more general definition of window functions does not require them to be identically zero outside an interval, as long as the product of the window multiplied by its argument is [[square integrable]], and, more specifically, that the function goes sufficiently rapidly toward zero.<ref name=Cattani/>\n\n== Applications ==\n\nWindow functions are used in spectral [[frequency spectrum#spectral analysis|analysis]]/modification/[[Overlap\u2013add method#resynthesis|resynthesis]],<ref name=OLA/> the design of [[finite impulse response]] filters, as well as [[beamforming]] and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] design.\n\n=== Spectral analysis ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nThe [[Fourier transform]] of the function cos&nbsp;''\u03c9t'' is zero, except at frequency&nbsp;\u00b1''\u03c9''.  However, many other functions and waveforms do not have convenient closed-form transforms. Alternatively, one might be interested in their spectral content only during a certain time period.\n\nIn either case, the Fourier transform (or a similar transform) can be applied on one or more finite intervals of the waveform.  In general, the transform is applied to the product of the waveform and a window function.  Any window (including rectangular) affects the spectral estimate computed by this method.\n\n[[File:Spectral_leakage_caused_by_%22windowing%22.svg|thumb|351px|Figure 2: Windowing a sinusoid causes spectral leakage. The same amount of leakage occurs whether there are an integer (blue) or non-integer (red) number of cycles within the window (rows 1 and 2). When the sinusoid is sampled and windowed, its discrete-time Fourier transform also exhibits the same leakage pattern (rows 3 and 4). But when the DTFT is only sparsely sampled, at a certain interval, it is possible (depending on your point of view) to: (1) avoid the leakage, or (2) create the illusion of no leakage. For the case of the blue DTFT, those samples are the outputs of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The red DTFT has the same interval of zero-crossings, but the DFT samples fall in-between them, and the leakage is revealed.]]\n\n==== Choice of window function ====\n\nWindowing of a simple waveform like cos&nbsp;''\u03c9t'' causes its Fourier transform to develop non-zero values (commonly called [[spectral leakage]]) at frequencies other than ''\u03c9''. The leakage tends to be worst (highest) near ''\u03c9'' and least at frequencies farthest from&nbsp;''\u03c9''.\n\nIf the waveform under analysis comprises two sinusoids of different frequencies, leakage can interfere with our ability to distinguish them spectrally. Possible types of interference are often broken down into two opposing classes as follows: If the component frequencies are dissimilar and one component is weaker, then leakage from the stronger component can obscure the weaker one's presence. But if the frequencies are too similar, leakage can render them ''unresolvable'' even when the sinusoids are of equal strength. Windows that are effective against the first type of interference, namely where components have dissimilar frequencies and amplitudes, are called ''high [[dynamic range]]''. Conversely, windows that can distinguish components with similar frequencies and amplitudes are called ''high resolution''.\n\nThe rectangular window is an example of a window that is ''high resolution'' but ''low dynamic range'', meaning it is good for distinguishing components of similar amplitude even when the frequencies are also close, but poor at distinguishing components of different amplitude even when the frequencies are far away. High-resolution, low-dynamic-range windows such as the rectangular window also have the property of high '''''sensitivity''''', which is the ability to reveal relatively weak sinusoids in the presence of additive random noise. That is because the noise produces a stronger response with high-dynamic-range windows than with high-resolution windows.\n\nAt the other extreme of the range of window types are windows with high dynamic range but low resolution and sensitivity. High-dynamic-range windows are most often justified in ''wideband applications'', where the spectrum being analyzed is expected to contain many different components of various amplitudes.\n\nIn between the extremes are moderate windows, such as [[#Hann and Hamming windows|Hamming]] and [[#Hann and Hamming windows|Hann]]. They are commonly used in ''narrowband applications'', such as the spectrum of a telephone channel.\n\nIn summary, spectral analysis involves a trade-off between resolving comparable strength components with similar frequencies (''high resolution / sensitivity'') and resolving disparate strength components with dissimilar frequencies (''high dynamic range''). That trade-off occurs when the window function is chosen.{{efn-la\n|[[#refNuttall|Nuttall 1981]], p 90}}\n\n==== Discrete-time signals ====\n\nWhen the input waveform is time-sampled, instead of continuous, the analysis is usually done by applying a window function and then a [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT). But the DFT provides only a sparse sampling of the actual [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT) spectrum. Figure 2, row 3 shows a DTFT for a rectangularly-windowed sinusoid. The actual frequency of the sinusoid is indicated as \"13\" on the horizontal axis. Everything else is leakage, exaggerated by the use of a logarithmic presentation. The unit of frequency is \"DFT bins\"; that is, the integer values on the frequency axis correspond to the frequencies sampled by the DFT.  So the figure depicts a case where the actual frequency of the sinusoid coincides with a DFT sample, and the maximum value of the spectrum is accurately measured by that sample.  In row 4, it misses the maximum value by \u00bd bin, and the resultant measurement error is referred to as '''''scalloping loss''''' (inspired by the shape of the peak).  For a known frequency, such as a musical note or a sinusoidal test signal, matching the frequency to a DFT bin can be prearranged by choices of a sampling rate and a window length that results in an integer number of cycles within the window.\n\n[[File:Processing losses for 3 window functions.svg|thumb|400px|Figure 3: This figure compares the processing losses of three window functions for sinusoidal inputs, with both minimum and maximum scalloping loss.]]\n\n==== Noise bandwidth ====\n\nThe concepts of resolution and dynamic range tend to be somewhat subjective, depending on what the user is actually trying to do.  But they also tend to be highly correlated with the total leakage, which is quantifiable.  It is usually expressed as an equivalent bandwidth, B.  It can be thought of as redistributing the DTFT into a rectangular shape with height equal to the spectral maximum and width B.{{efn-ua\n|name=noise bandwidth|1=Mathematically, the noise equivalent bandwidth of transfer function ''H'' is the bandwidth of an ideal rectangular filter with the same peak gain as ''H'' that would pass the same power with [[white noise]] input.  In the units of frequency ''f'' (e.g. [[hertz]]), it is given by''':'''\n\n:<math> B_{\\text{noise}} = \\frac{1}{|H(f)|^2_{\\max}} \\int_0^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 df.</math>\n}}<ref name=Carlson/>  The more the leakage, the greater the bandwidth.  It is sometimes called ''noise equivalent bandwidth'' or ''equivalent noise bandwidth'', because it is proportional to the average power that will be registered by each DFT bin when the input signal contains a random noise component (or '''is''' just random noise).  A graph of the [[power spectrum]], averaged over time, typically reveals a flat ''[[noise floor]]'', caused by this effect.  The height of the noise floor is proportional to B.  So two different window functions can produce different noise floors.\n\n==== Processing gain and losses ====\nIn [[signal processing]], operations are chosen to improve some aspect of quality of a signal by exploiting the differences between the signal and the corrupting influences.  When the signal is a sinusoid corrupted by additive random noise, spectral analysis distributes the signal and noise components differently, often making it easier to detect the signal's presence or measure certain characteristics, such as amplitude and frequency.  Effectively, the [[signal to noise ratio]] (SNR) is improved by distributing the noise uniformly, while concentrating most of the sinusoid's energy around one frequency.  ''Processing gain'' is a term often used to describe an SNR improvement.  The processing gain of spectral analysis depends on the window function, both its noise bandwidth (B) and its potential scalloping loss.  These effects partially offset, because windows with the least scalloping naturally have the most leakage.\n\nFigure 3 depicts the effects of three different window functions on the same data set, comprising two equal strength sinusoids in additive noise.  The frequencies of the sinusoids are chosen such that one encounters no scalloping and the other encounters maximum scalloping.  Both sinusoids suffer less SNR loss under the Hann window than under the [[Ralph Beebe Blackman|Blackman]]\u2013[[Fredric J. Harris|Harris]] window.  In general (as mentioned earlier), this is a deterrent to using high-dynamic-range windows in low-dynamic-range applications.\n\n=== Filter design ===\n\n{{Main|Filter design}}\n\nWindows are sometimes used in the design of [[digital filters]], in particular to convert an \"ideal\" impulse response of infinite duration, such as a [[sinc function]], to a [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filter design.  That is called the [[Finite impulse response#Window design method|''window method'']].<ref name=Oppenheim/><ref name=FIRfilters/><ref name=Tuwien/>\n\n=== Statistics and curve fitting ===\n\n{{Main|kernel (statistics)}}\n\nWindow functions are sometimes used in the field of [[statistics|statistical analysis]] to restrict the set of data being analyzed to a range near a given point, with a [[Weighting | weighting factor]] that diminishes the effect of points farther away from the portion of the curve being fit. In the field of  Bayesian analysis and [[curve fitting]], this is often referred to as the [[kernel (statistics)|kernel]].\n\n=== Rectangular window applications ===\n\n==== Analysis of transients ====\n\nWhen analyzing a transient signal in [[modal analysis]], such as an impulse, a shock response, a sine burst, a chirp burst, or noise burst, where the energy vs time distribution is extremely uneven, the rectangular window may be most appropriate.  For instance, when most of the energy is located at the beginning of the recording, a non-rectangular window attenuates most of the energy, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio.<ref name=HPmemory/>\n\n==== Harmonic analysis ====\n\nOne might wish to measure the harmonic content of a musical note from a particular instrument or the harmonic distortion of an amplifier at a given frequency.  Referring again to '''Figure 2''', we can observe that there is no leakage at a discrete set of harmonically-related frequencies sampled by the DFT.  (The spectral nulls are actually zero-crossings, which cannot be shown on a logarithmic scale such as this.)  This property is unique to the rectangular window, and it must be appropriately configured for the signal frequency, as described above.\n\n[[File:Two 8-point Gaussian window functions.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 4: Two different ways to generate an 8-point Gaussian window sequence (\u03c3=0.4) for spectral analysis applications. MATLAB calls them \"symmetric\" and \"periodic\". The latter is also historically called ''DFT-even''.]]\n\n[[File:Spectral_leakage_from_two_8-point_Gaussian_windows.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5: Spectral leakage characteristics of the functions in Figure 4]]\n\n<!-- Probably too much information, too soon.\n[[File:Comparison of symmetric and periodic Gaussian windows.svg|thumb|300px|Figures 6a and 6b: Comparison of symmetric and periodic Gaussian windows]]\n-->\n\n===Symmetry===\n\nThe formulas provided in this article produce discrete sequences, as if a continuous window function has been \"sampled\". (see an example at [[Kaiser window]])&nbsp; Window sequences can be either '''symmetric''' or 1-sample short of symmetric (called '''asymmetric''' or '''periodic''').<ref name=MWhann/><ref name=MWwindow/>{{efn-ua\n|1=''Periodic'' is an oblique reference to the fact that symmetry around the n=0 axis is restored when the sequence is viewed as one full cycle of a periodic sequence.\n}}&nbsp; For instance, a symmetric sequence, with its maximum at a single center-point, is generated by the [[MATLAB]] function <code>hann(9,'symmetric')</code>.  Deleting the last sample produces a sequence identical to <code>hann(8,'periodic')</code>.  An even-length symmetric sequence has two equal center-points, but most window functions used in practice have a single peak value, whether they are symmetric or asymmetric.\n\nSome functions have one or two zero-valued end-points, which are unnecessary in most applications.  Deleting a zero-valued end-point has no effect on its DTFT (spectral leakage).  But the function designed for {{mvar|N}}+1 or {{mvar|N}}+2 samples, in anticipation of deleting one or both end points, typically has a slightly narrower main lobe, slightly higher sidelobes, and a slightly lower noise bandwidth.\n\n====DFT-even====\nThe terminology ''DFT-even'' ([[#refHarris|Harris 1978]], p 52) <!--{{efn-la|[[#refHarris|f.harris 1978]], p 52.}}--> describes a subclass of ''periodic'' (or ''asymmetric'') windows, characterized by only even-length sequences.  Some potential advantages (application-dependent) for spectral analysis (DFT) are:\n\n*Efficiency:  FFT algorithms are most efficient when the sequence length is an integer power-of-two.\n\n*Zero-valued DFT coefficients:  The DFT-even subset of [[#Cosine-sum windows]], including [[#Rectangular window]], have very few non-zero DFT coefficients.  We see the rectangular window effect in the third row of '''Figure 2'''.&nbsp; A cosine-sum example is [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/DFT-even_Hann_window_%26_spectral_leakage.png  figure '''DFT-even Hann window'''], which shows that the {{mvar|N}}-point DFT of the sequence generated by hann({{mvar|N}},'periodic') has only 3 non-zero values.  All the other samples coincide with zero-crossings of the [[DTFT]].{{efn-ua\n|The sparse sampling of a DTFT only reveals the leakage into the DFT bins from a sinusoid whose frequency is also an integer DFT bin. The unseen sidelobes reveal the leakage to expect from sinusoids at other frequencies.{{efn-la\n|[[#refHarris|f.harris 1978]], fig 10, p 57.}} Thus, when choosing a window function, it is usually important to sample the DTFT more densely (as we do in the next section) and choose a window that suppresses the sidelobes to an acceptable level.\n}}  Besides the application already described at [[#Harmonic analysis]], this property is useful for real-time applications that require both windowed and non-windowed (rectangularly windowed) transforms,<ref name=Carlin/> because the windowed transforms can be  efficiently derived from the non-windowed transforms by [[Discrete Fourier transform#Convolution theorem duality|convolution]].{{efn-la\n|[[#refNuttall|Nuttall 1981]], p 85\n}}  In that application, real-valued DFT coefficients (next bullet) is also an efficiency multiplier.\n\n*Real-valued DFT coefficients:  [[#refHarris|Harris (1978)]] cites this as the DFT equivalent of earlier work, where windows for the DFT's predecessor ([[finite Fourier transform]]) are \"always an odd number of points and exhibit even symmetry about the origin\", which results in an entirely real-valued DTFT.\n\nThe [[DTFT]] is a continuous function of frequency <math>(f),</math> and the DFT is a method of sampling it.  But as Harris points out, the DFT requires an implied shift of the symmetric sequence from a domain {{nowrap|[\u2212''M'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 ''M''],}} known as a ''finite Fourier transform data window'', into {{nowrap|[0 \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 2''M''],}} a ''DFT data window''.  Effectively, the real-valued function being sampled is multiplied by a complex-valued phase function:  <math>e^{-i2\\pi f M}.</math>&nbsp;  Therefore, a straightforward DFT of length 2M+1 would sample at frequency intervals of 1/(2M+1), and the samples would be complex-valued, whereas samples at intervals of 1/(2M) are all real, although the odd-numbered ones are negated relative to the original DTFT.  To compute samples at intervals of 1/(2M), using a DFT, its length must be 2M.  Two methods available are simple truncation (deleting the last sample) and [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#L=N+1|''periodic summation'']] (combining the first and last samples by addition).  Both result in a sequence length of 2M, to which a '''DFT-even''' window can be applied.  The difference is that truncation affects the DTFT function being sampled, and periodic summation affects only the sampling intervals.\n\n*In both cases, only the window function itself will have real-valued DTFT samples.  Windowed data will generally lack the symmetry to preserve that characteristic.  But other than the predictable sign reversals, the phase component of the DTFT will be representative of the data, not the window function.\n\n*Truncation affects only the real components of the DTFT samples.  The imaginary ones remain zero-valued.  Harris attributes this effect to what he calls ''DFT-even symmetry''.  [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Sampling_the_Discrete-time_Fourier_transform.svg Figure '''Sampling the DTFT'''] is an exaggerated example{{efn-ua\n|An abnormally wide and short Gaussian window is used.\n}} of both methods, also showing how real-valued samples are obtained from the complex DTFT.\n\n*The effect of truncation on spectral leakage is best understood in terms of the magnitude of the real component, shown in decibels.  At [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Comparison_of_symmetric_and_periodic_Gaussian_windows.svg figure '''Gaussian windows'''], the graph labeled ''DTFT periodic8'' is the DTFT of the truncated window labeled ''periodic DFT-even'' (both blue).  The green graph labeled ''DTFT symmetric9'' corresponds to the same window with its symmetry restored.  The DTFT samples, labeled ''DFT8 periodic summation'', are an example of using periodic summation to sample it at the same frequencies as the blue graph.\n\n== A list of window functions ==\n\nConventions''':'''\n\n*<math>w_0(x)</math> is a zero-phase function (symmetrical about x=0)<ref name=Zphase/>, continuous for <math>x \\in [-N/2, N/2],</math> where N is a positive integer (even or odd).<ref name=Rorabaugh/>\n\n*The sequence &nbsp;<math>\\{w[n] = w_0(n-N/2),\\quad 0\\le n \\le N\\}</math>&nbsp; is ''symmetric'', of length <math>N+1.</math>\n\n*<math>\\{w[n],\\quad 0\\le n \\le N-1\\}</math>&nbsp; is ''asymmetric'', of length <math>N.</math>{{efn-ua\n|Some authors limit their attention to this important subset and to even values of N.<ref name=f.harris/><ref name=Heinzel2002/>  But the window coefficient formulas are still the ones presented here.}}\n\n*The parameter '''B''' displayed on each spectral plot is the function's noise equivalent bandwidth metric, in units of ''DFT bins''.\n\n=== Rectangular window ===\n<!-- [[Boxcar window]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Window function and frequency response - Rectangular.svg|thumb|480px|right|Rectangular window]]\n\nThe rectangular window (sometimes known as the '''[[Boxcar function|boxcar]]''' or '''[[Dirichlet kernel|Dirichlet]] window''') is the simplest window, equivalent to replacing all but ''N'' values of a data sequence by zeros, making it appear as though the waveform suddenly turns on and off:\n\n:<math>w[n] = 1.</math>\n\nOther windows are designed to moderate these sudden changes, which reduces scalloping loss and improves dynamic range, as described above ({{slink||Spectral analysis}}).\n\nThe rectangular window is the 1st order ''B''-spline window as well as the 0th power [[#Power-of-sine/cosine_windows|Power-of-sine window]].\n{{clear}}\n\n=== ''B''-spline windows ===\n\n''B''-spline windows can be obtained as ''k''-fold convolutions of the rectangular window.

The frequency axis has units of FFT \"bins\" when the window of length N is applied to data and a transform of length N is computed.  For instance, the value at frequency \u00bd \"bin\" (third tick mark) is the response that would be measured in bins k and k+1 to a sinusoidal signal at frequency k+\u00bd.  It is relative to the maximum possible response, which occurs when the signal frequency is an integer number of bins.  The value at frequency \u00bd is referred to as the maximum ''scalloping loss'' of the window, which is one metric used to compare windows.  The rectangular window is noticeably worse than the others in terms of that metric.\n\nOther metrics that can be seen are the width of the main lobe and the peak level of the sidelobes, which respectively determine the ability to resolve comparable strength signals and disparate strength signals.  The rectangular window (for instance) is the best choice for the former and the worst choice for the latter.  What cannot be seen from the graphs is that the rectangular window has the best noise bandwidth, which makes it a good candidate for detecting low-level sinusoids in an otherwise [[white noise]] environment.  Interpolation techniques, such as [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#L\u2264N|zero-padding]] and frequency-shifting, are available to mitigate its potential scalloping loss. {{clear}}\n\n== Overlapping windows ==\n\nWhen the length of a data set to be transformed is larger than necessary to provide the desired frequency resolution, a common practice is to subdivide it into smaller sets and window them individually.  To mitigate the \"loss\" at the edges of the window, the individual sets may overlap in time.  See [[Welch method]] of power spectral analysis and the [[modified discrete cosine transform]].\n\n== Two-dimensional windows ==\nTwo-dimensional windows are commonly used in image processing to reduce unwanted high-frequencies in the image Fourier transform.<ref name=Hovden/> They can be constructed from one-dimensional windows in either of two forms.<ref name=Bernstein/> The separable form, <math>W(m,n)=w(m)w(n)</math> is trivial to compute. The [[Radial function|radial]] form, <math>W(m,n)=w(r)</math>, which involves the radius <math>r=\\sqrt{(m-M/2)^2+(n-N/2)^2}</math>, is [[Isotropy|isotropic]], independent on the orientation of the coordinate axes. Only the [[#Gaussian_window|Gaussian]] function is both separable and isotropic.<ref name=Awad/> The separable forms of all other window functions have corners that depend on the choice of the coordinate axes. The isotropy/[[anisotropy]] of a two-dimensional window function is shared by its two-dimensional Fourier transform. The difference between the separable and radial forms is akin to the result of [[diffraction]] from rectangular vs. circular appertures, which can be visualized in terms of the product of two [[sinc function]]s vs. an [[Airy function]], respectively.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Window function}}\n* [[Spectral leakage]]\n* [[Multitaper]]\n* [[Apodization]]\n* [[Welch method]]\n* [[Short-time Fourier transform]]\n* [[Window design method]]\n* [[Kolmogorov\u2013Zurbenko filter]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== Page citations==\n{{notelist-la}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1|refs=\n<ref name=Oppenheim>\n{{Cite book\n |ref=refOppenheim\n |last=Oppenheim\n |first=Alan V.\n |authorlink=Alan V.

The magazine lasted for 85 issues and ended in 1987.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the scene rebounded after the blow it had suffered from the 1972 tax law<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=429075|title=Mirko, Slavko i Kekec|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> which targeted not only the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]] but also comics.

Published by Forum in [[Novi Sad]], ''Panorama'' was eventually transformed into ''[[Stripoteka]]'', which reached issue 1000 in 2004<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://happynovisad.com/strip/stripoteka-broj-1000.270.html|title=STRIPOTEKA broj 1000!|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> and still comes out today. [[Dnevnik (Serbia)|Dnevnik]] launched ''Zlatna serija'' and ''Lunov magnus strip'', featuring [[Italian comics|Italian comic books]] like [[Tex Willer|''Tex'']] and ''[[Zagor]]''. In the 1980s Kerac spearheaded teams of writers and artists working on [[Licensed production|licensed]] [[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]] and [[Il Grande Blek|Blek]] comics for these two publishers. The list included artists [[Branko Plav\u0161i\u0107]], [[Goran \u0110uki\u0107 Gorski (artist)|Goran \u0110uki\u0107]], [[Miodrag Ivanovi\u0107 Mikica|Miodrag Ivanovi\u0107]], [[Pavel Koza]], [[Marinko Lebovi\u0107]], [[Petar Meseld\u017eija]], Milan Mileti\u0107, [[Sibin Slavkovi\u0107]] and [[Dragan Stoki\u0107 Raja\u010dki]]. The [[Ninja (comic book)|Ninja]] and [[Mitar Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Lun kralj pono\u0107i]] comics were similarly manufactured, but were based on the Yugoslav pulp novels of the same names.\n\nUntil 1991 Serbian comics were part of Yugoslav comics. Distributed via newsstands, most comics were sold throughout Yugoslavia, written by and large in the common [[Shtokavian]] dialect and often printed in the Latin alphabet. \n\nPublications from other republics, especially Croatia, from Plavi Vjesnik to ''[[Alan Ford (comics)|Alan Ford]]'', had a great influence on creators and readers in Serbia. A [[Play (theatre)|play]] titled ''Alan Ford'' written by Mirjana Lazi\u0107 and directed by Kokan Mladenovi\u0107 was staged at Teatar T in Belgrade in 1994. [[Radio Belgrade]] produced a [[radio drama]] based on the play in 2002. \n\nAlso, authors worked for publishers outside Serbia, e.g. artists Du\u0161an Relji\u0107, Bojan \u0110uki\u0107, Ratomir Petrovi\u0107, [[Zdravko Zupan]], [[Nikola Maslovara]] and Zoran Kova\u010devi\u0107, as well as writer Lazar Odanovi\u0107 collaborated on the licensed [[Tom and Jerry]] comics for ''[[Vjesnik]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/60godina/60gstripa_10.html|title=Slobodan Ivkov: 60 godina stripa u Srbiji|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> Finally, artists exhibited at the joint Yugoslav Comics Festival in [[Vinkovci]] (Salon jugoslovenskog stripa).\n\nThe local comic book industry collapsed with the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n=== 1991 - present ===\n\n[[File:Treci_argument_cover.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic novel ''Tre\u0107i argument'' (''[[The Third Argument]]''), drawn by Zoran Tuci\u0107 and written by [[Zoran Stefanovi\u0107]], was based on the works of writer [[Milorad Pavi\u0107]].]]In the 1990s dozens of Serbian artists turned to foreign publishers.

Disparate companies of [[English people|English]] [[Militia|militiamen]] from nearby settlements marched to the town's defense, two of which were drawn into Native ambushes and suffered heavy losses. The battle was the last major Native American victory in King Philip's War before their final defeat in southern [[New England]] in August 1676.   \n== Background ==\nThe winter of 1676 brought a lull in the fighting of King Philip's War in eastern [[Massachusetts]], but come spring Native American forces resumed their raids on the area's [[Puritans|Puritan]] towns. The Native coalition attacked the strategically significant fort at [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on both March 16 and April 7, destroying most of the settlement and forcing a partial evacuation of its residents. In response to these attacks, as well as the recent abandonment of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], the colonial Council of War dispatched Captain Samuel Wadsworth and fifty men to Marlborough to reinforce the frontier.

{"title_page": "British Poetry Revival", "text_new": "{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}\n\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIf the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.\n\nThese poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> \n\nThese poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nA number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).\n\n==London==\n\nThanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.\n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).\n\nThe anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.\n\nInto the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n*[[Black Mountain poets]]\n*[[Language poetry]]\n*[[movement (literature)|The Movement]]\n*[[Situationist International|Situationism]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20011110105655/http://www.netkonect.net/~athelstan/links.html List of related links]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130021251/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/english.html The English Intelligencer Archive]\n*[http://www.mordentower.org/ The Morden Tower]\n*[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-irish-poets.html Archives of the British and Irish poetry discussion list]\n*[http://www.jeff-nuttall.co.uk The Life and Works of Jeff Nuttall]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080225010840/http://www.fucine.com/network/fucinemute/core/print.php?url=archivio%2Ffm87%2Fhugill.htm&id=1374 Piers Hugill on British Poetry since 1977]\n\n{{Schools of poetry}}\n\n[[Category:Literary movements]]\n[[Category:British poetry]]\n[[Category:British literary movements]]\n[[Category:British Poetry Revival| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}\n\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.

Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.\n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).\n\nThe anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.\n\nInto the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n*[[Black Mountain poets]]\n*[[Language poetry]]\n*[[movement (literature)|The Movement]]\n*[[Situationist International|Situationism]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20011110105655/http://www.netkonect.net/~athelstan/links.html List of related links]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130021251/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/english.html The English Intelligencer Archive]\n*[http://www.mordentower.org/ The Morden Tower]\n*[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-irish-poets.html Archives of the British and Irish poetry discussion list]\n*[http://www.jeff-nuttall.co.uk The Life and Works of Jeff Nuttall]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080225010840/http://www.fucine.com/network/fucinemute/core/print.php?url=archivio%2Ffm87%2Fhugill.htm&id=1374 Piers Hugill on British Poetry since 1977]\n\n{{Schools of poetry}}\n\n[[Category:Literary movements]]\n[[Category:British poetry]]\n[[Category:British literary movements]]\n[[Category:British Poetry Revival| ]]\n", "name_user": "Jemima Melville", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLondon", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Poetry_Revival"}
