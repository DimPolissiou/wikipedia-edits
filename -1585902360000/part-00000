Rebellion is studied, in Theda Skocpol's words, by analyzing \"objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations, rather than the interests, outlooks, or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=291}}\n\n==== Marxist insight ====\n[[Karl Marx]]'s analysis of revolutions sees such expression of [[political violence]] not as anomic, episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class-based relations of power. Indeed, the central tenet of Marxist philosophy, as expressed in [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]], is the analysis of society's mode of production (technology and labor) concomitant with the ownership of productive institutions and the division of profit. Marx writes about \"the hidden structure of society\" that must be elucidated through an examination of \"the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers\". The mismatch, between one mode of production, between the social forces and the social ownership of the production, is at the origin of the revolution.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=7}} The inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization, such as capitalism within feudalism, or more appropriately socialism within capitalism. The dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary. For example, the development of the bourgeoisie class went from oppressed merchant class to urban independence, eventually gaining enough power to represent the state as a whole. Social movements, thus, are determined by an exogenous set of circumstances. The proletariat must also, according to Marx, go through the same process of self-determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie. In Marx's theory revolutions are the \"locomotives of history\", it is because rebellion has for ultimate goal to overthrow the ruling class and its antiquated mode of production. Later, rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy, one that is better suited to the new ruling class, thus enabling societal progress. The cycle of rebellion, thus, replaces one mode of production by another through the constant class friction.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=8}}\n\n==== Ted Gurr: Roots of political violence ====\nIn his book ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr|Ted Gurr]] looks at the roots of political violence itself applied to a rebellion framework. He defines political violence as: \"all collective attacks within a political community against the political [[Political regime|regime]], its actors [...] or its policies. The concept represents a set of events, a common property of which is the actual or threatened use of violence\".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=3}} Gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order. More precisely, individuals become angry when they feel what Gurr labels as [[Relative deprivation thesis|relative deprivation]], meaning the feeling of getting less than one is entitled to. He labels it formally as the \"perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities\".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=37}} Gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation:\n# ''Decremental deprivation'': one's capacities' decrease when expectations remain high. One example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of  the value of higher education.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=47}}\n# ''Aspirational Deprivation'': one's capacities stay the same when expectations rise. An example would be a first generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better-prepared colleagues bypass her.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=52}}\n# ''Progressive deprivation'': expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up. A good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatisation of the assembly line.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=53}}\nAnger is thus comparative. One of his key insight is that \"The potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity\".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=24}} This means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on their particular internalization of their situation. As such, Gurr differentiates between three types of political violence:{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=11}}\n# ''Turmoil'' when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation;\n# ''Conspiracy'' when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation;\n# ''Internal War'', which includes revolution. In this case, the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil, and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society, unlike the conspiracy.\n\n==== Charles Tilly: Centrality of collective action ====\nIn ''From Mobilization to Revolution'', [[Charles Tilly]] argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society. \"Collective violence\", Tilly writes, \"is the product of just normal processes of competition among groups in order to obtain the power and implicitly to fulfill their desires\u201d.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=54}} He proposes two models to analyze political violence:\n# The ''polity'' model takes into account government and groups jockeying for control over power. Thus, both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch3}} Tilly labels those two groups \"members\" and \"challengers\". \n# The ''mobilization'' model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power. Tilly further divides the model in two sub-categories, one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group, and the other that is concerned with the \"external relations\" of the entity with other organizations and/or the government. According to Tilly, the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization. Thus, to answer Gurr, anger alone does not automatically create political violence. Political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite. It is far from irrational and spontaneous.\nRevolutions are included in this theory, although they remain for Tilly particularly extreme since the challenger(s) aim for nothing less than full control over power.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch7}} The \"revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero-sum game. This is what Tilly calls \"multiple sovereignty\".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}} The success of a revolutionary movement hinges on \"the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over Government.\".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}}\n\n==== Chalmers Johnson and societal values ====\nFor Chalmers Johnson, rebellions are not so much the product of political violence or collective action but in \"the analysis of viable, functioning societies\".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=3}} In a quasi-biological manner, Johnson sees revolutions as symptoms of pathologies within the societal fabric. A healthy society, meaning a \"value-coordinated social system\"{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=36}} does not experience political violence. Johnson's equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values. The legitimacy of a political order, he posits, relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change. Rigidity is, in other words, inadmissible. Johnson writes \"to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change; more exactly, it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure\".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=57}} The aim of a revolution is to re-align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process. Rebellions automatically must face a certain amount of coercion because by becoming \"de-synchronized\", the now illegitimate political order will have to use coercion to maintain its position. A simplified example would be the French Revolution when the Parisian Bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the King as synchronized with its own orientations. More than the King itself, what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class. Johnson emphasizes \"the necessity of investigating a system's value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way\".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=32}}\n\n==== Theda Skocpol and the Autonomy of the State ====\nSkocpol introduces the concept of the social revolution, to be contrasted with a political revolution. While the later aims to change the polity, the former is \"rapid, basic transformations of a society's state and class structures; and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=4}} Social revolutions are grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power, they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society. As a corollary, this means that some \"revolutions\" may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society. Her analysis is limited to studying the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. Skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases (which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized), each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action. \n# ''The Collapse of the Old-Regime State'': this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions. She highlights the importance of international military and economic competition as well as the pressure of the misfunctioning of domestic affairs. More precisely, she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors, the \"landed upper class\" and the \"imperial state\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=49}} Both could be considered as \"partners in exploitation\" but in reality competed for resources: the state (monarchs) seek to build up military and economic power to ascertain their geopolitical influence. The upper class works in a logic of [[profit maximization]], meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources. All three revolutions occurred, Skocpol argues, because states failed to be able to \"mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} The apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization. \"Revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the Bourbon, Romanov, and Manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures.\"{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} Skocpol further concludes \"the upshot was the disintegration of centralized administrative and military machineries that had theretofore provided the sole unified bulwark of social and political order\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=51}}\n# ''Peasant Uprisings'': more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context, the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall. These uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures ''per se'' but at the upper class itself, so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well. Skocpol quotes Barrington Moore who famously wrote: \"peasants [...] provided the dynamite to bring down the old building\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=112}} Peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions: the level of autonomy (from both an economic and political point of view) peasant communities enjoy, and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics. In other words, peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel. If the coercive structures of the state and/or the landowners keep a very close check on peasant activity, then there is no space to forment dissent. \n# ''Societal Transformation'': this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords. The paradox of the three revolutions Skocpol studies is that stronger centralized and bureaucratic states emerge after the revolts.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=162}} The exact parameters depend, again, on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors: in Russia, the new state found most support in the industrial base, rooting itself in cities. In China, most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside, thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas. In France, the peasantry was not organized enough, and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything, partially explaining its artificiality. \nHere is a summary of the causes and consequences of social revolutions in these three countries, according to Skocpol:{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=155}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Conditions for Political Crises (A)\n|-\n!\n!''Power Structure''\n!''State of Agrarian Economy''\n!''International Pressures''\n|-\n!France\n|Landed-commercial upper class has moderate influence on the absolutist monarchy via bureaucracy\n|Moderate growth\n|Moderate, pressure from England\n|-\n!Russia\n|Landed nobility has no influence in absolutist state\n|Extensive growth, geographically unbalanced\n|Extreme, string of defeats culminating with WW1\n|-\n!China\n|Landed-commercial upper class has moderate influence on absolutist state via bureaucracy\n|Slow growth\n|Strong, imperialist intrusions\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Conditions for Peasant Insurrections (B)\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Organization of Agrarian Communities''\n!''Autonomy of Agrarian Communities''\n|-\n!France\n| colspan=\"2\" |Peasants own 30-40% of the land own and must pay tribute to the feudal landlord\n|Relatively autonomous, distant control from royal officials\n|-\n!Russia\n| colspan=\"2\" |Peasants own 60% of the land, pay rent to landowners that are part of the community\n|Sovereign, supervised by the bureaucracy\n|-\n!China\n| colspan=\"2\" |Peasants own 50% of the land and pay rent to the landowners, work exclusively on small plots, no real peasant community\n|Landlords dominate local politics under the supervision of Imperial officials\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Societal Transformations (A + B)\n|-\n!France\n| colspan=\"3\" |Breakdown of absolutist state, important peasant revolts against feudal system\n|-\n!Russia\n| colspan=\"3\" |Failure of top-down bureaucratic reforms, eventual dissolution of the state and widespread peasant revolts against all privately owned land\n|-\n!China\n| colspan=\"3\" |Breakdown of absolutist state, disorganized peasant upheavals but no autonomous revolts against landowners\n|}\n\n=== Microfoundational evidence on causes ===\nThe following theories are all based on [[Mancur Olson]]'s work in ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]]'', a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent [[Tragedy of the commons|problem]] with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits. In this case, the benefits of rebellion are seen as a [[Public good (economics)|public good]], meaning one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=9}}  Indeed, the political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful, not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself. Olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for [[Collective action theory|collective action]]. In fact, he argues the \"[[Free rider problem|free rider]]\" possibility, a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price, will deter rational individuals from collective action. That is, unless there is a clear benefit, a rebellion will not happen en masse. Thus, Olson shows that \"selective incentives\", only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort, can solve the free rider problem.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=76}}\n\n==== ''The Rational Peasant'' ====\n{{Main article|The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam}}\n\nSamuel L. Popkin builds on Olson's argument in ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam.'' His theory is based on the figure of a hyper rational peasant that bases his decision to join (or not) a rebellion uniquely on a cost-benefit analysis. This formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self-interest: a peasant, according to Popkin, will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him. According to Popkin, peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability. Social norms, he writes, are \"malleable, renegotiated, and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals\"{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=22}} Indeed, the constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition, due to the peculiar nature of the patron-client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner, forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make. Popkin argues that peasants rely on their \"private, family investment for their long run security and that they will be interested in short term gain vis-\u00e0-vis the village. They will attempt to improve their long-run security by moving to a position with higher income and less variance\".{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=23}} Popkin stresses this \"investor logic\" that one may not expect in agrarian societies, usually seen as pre-capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital. Yet, the selfish determinants of collective action are, according to Popkin, a direct product of the inherent instability of peasant life. The goal of a laborer, for example, will be to move to a tenant position, then smallholder, then landlord; where there is less variance and more income. Voluntarism is thus non-existent in such communities.\n\nPopkin singles out four variables that impact individual participation:\n# Contribution to the expenditure of resources: collective action has a cost in terms of contribution, and especially if it fails (an important consideration with regards to rebellion) \n# Rewards : the direct (more income) and indirect (less oppressive central state) rewards for collective action \n# Marginal impact of the peasant's contribution to the success of collective action\n# Leadership \"viability and trust\" : to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used.\nWithout any moral commitment to the community, this situation will engineer free riders. Popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem.{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=34}}\n\n===== Opportunity cost of rebellion =====\nPolitical Scientist Christopher Blattman and World Bank economist Laura Alston identify rebellious activity as an \"occupational choice\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=22}} They draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion, arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities. In both cases, only a selected few reap important benefits, while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} The choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost, namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel. Thus, the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision. Blattman and Alston, however, recognize that \"a poor person's best strategy\" might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} Individuals, they argue, can often have a varied \"portofolio\" of activities, suggesting that they all operate on a rational, profit maximizing logic. The authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost, both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}}\n\n===== Selective incentives based on group membership =====\nThe decision to join a rebellion can be based on the prestige and social status associated with membership in the rebellious group. More than material incentives for the individual, rebellions offer their members [[club good]]s, [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s that are reserved only for the members inside that group. Economist [[Eli Berman]] and Political Scientist David D. Laitin's study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership. Berman and Laitin discuss [[Suicide attack|suicide]] operations, meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual. They find that in such a framework, the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection. Furthermore, the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1965}} Berman and Laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety, basic infrastructure, access to utilities, or schooling.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1944}} Suicide operations \"can be explained as a costly signal of \u201ccommitment\u201d to the community\".{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1943}} They further note \"Groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment (sacrifices) may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility.\"{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1954}} Thus, rebellious groups can organize themselves to ''ask'' of members proof of commitment to the cause. Club goods serve not so much to coax individuals into joining but to prevent defection.\n\n===== Greed vs grievance model =====\n{{Main article|Greed versus grievance}}\nWorld Bank economists [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives:\n# [[Greed]] rebellion: \"motivated by predation of the rents from primary commodity exports, subject to an economic calculus of costs and a military survival constraint\".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}}\n# [[Grievance]] rebellion: \"motivated by hatreds which might be intrinsic to ethnic and religious differences, or reflected objective resentments such as domination by an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] majority, political repression, or [[economic inequality]]\".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} The two main sources of grievance are political exclusion and inequality.\nVollier and Hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts, while the model based on greed performs well. The authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model: individuals are fundamentally risk-averse. However, they allow that conflicts create grievances, which in turn can become risk factors. Contrary to established beliefs, they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer, since individuals will be automatically more cautious, at the opposite of the grievance model predictions.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} Finally, the authors also note that the grievances expressed by members of the [[diaspora]] of a community in turmoil has an important on the continuation of violence.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=27}} Both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection.\n\n==== ''The Moral Economy of the Peasant'' ====\n{{Main article|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia}}\n\nSpearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist [[James C. Scott]] in his  book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant]]'', the [[moral economy]] school considers moral variables such as social norms, moral values, interpretation of justice, and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel. This perspective still adheres to Olson's framework, but it considers different variables to enter the cost/benefit analysis: the individual is still believed to be rational, albeit not on material but moral grounds.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=6}}\n\n===== Early conceptualization: E. P. Thompson and bread riots in England =====\nBefore being fully conceptualized by Scott, British historian [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]] was the first to use the term \"moral economy\" in ''Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1971-01-01|title=The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=650244|journal=Past & Present|issue=50|pages=76\u2013136}}</ref> In this work, he discussed English bread riots, regular, localized form of rebellion by English peasants all through the 18th century. Such events, Thompson argues, have been routinely dismissed as \"riotous\", with the connotation of being disorganized, spontaneous, undirected, and undisciplined. In other words, anecdotal. The reality, he suggests, was otherwise: such riots involved a coordinated peasant action, from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops. Here, while a scholar such as Popkin would have argued that the peasants were trying to gain material benefits (crudely: more food), Thompson sees a legitimization factor, meaning \"a belief that [the peasants] were defending traditional rights and customs\".  Thompson goes on to write: \"[the riots were] legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people\". Later, reflecting on this work, Thompson would also write: \"My object of analysis was the ''mentalit\u00e9'', or, as I would prefer, the political culture, the expectations, traditions, and indeed, superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Customs in Common: Studies in Traditional Popular Culture|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1993-08-01|publisher=The New Press|isbn=9781565840744|language=English}}</ref> The opposition between a traditional, paternalist, and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal, capitalist, and market-derived ethics is central to explain rebellion.\n\n===== James C. Scott and the formalization of the moral economy argument=====\nIn [[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia]], James C. Scott looks at the impact of exogenous economic and political shocks on peasant communities in Southeast Asia. Scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=15}} Therefore, any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium. He labels this phenomenon the \"subsistence ethic\".{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=13}} A landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant's subsistence over his constant benefit. According to Scott, the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies. Rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief, a moral outrage.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=193}}\n\n===== Other non-material incentives=====\n[[Chris Blattman|Blattman]] and Ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives, such as anger, outrage, and injustice (\"grievance\") in the roots of rebellions. These variables, they argue, are far from being irrational, as they are sometimes presented. They identify three main types of grievance arguments:\n# ''Intrinsic [[incentive]]s'' holds that \"[[injustice]] or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}} More than material rewards, individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged. The [[ultimatum game]] is an excellent illustration: player one receives $10 and must split it with another player who doesn't get the chance to determine how much he receives, but only if the deal is made or not (if he refuses, everyone loses their money). Rationally, player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term ($1 more remains $1 more). However, player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars, meaning that they are willing to pay a-$2 for justice to be respected. This game, according to Blattman and Ralston, represents \"the expressive pleasure people gain from punishing an injustice\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}}\n# ''[[Loss aversion]]'' holds that \"people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point, and that they are 'loss adverse\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} Individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains. There is a substantial [[Subjectivity|subjective]] part to this, however, as some may realize alone and decide that they are comparatively less well off than a neighbor, for example. To \"fix\" this gap, individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}}\n# ''Frustration-aggression'': this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any \"direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} There are limits to this theory: violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of [[preference]]s.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=26}} Yet, this approach shows that contextual elements like economic precarity have a non-negligible impact on the conditions of the decisions to rebel at minimum.\n\n== Recruitment ==\nStathis N. Kalyvas, a political science professor at Yale University, argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio-economic factors, from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Rebellion, or any sort of political violence, are not binary conflicts but must be understood as interactions between public and private identities and actions. The \"convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives\" make studying and theorizing rebellion a very complex affair, at the intersection between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=475}}\nKalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms:\n# The idea that political violence, and more specifically rebellion, is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state. This is inspired by Thomas Hobbes' views. The approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot, using violence to break down the power structures of society.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}\n# The idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs, \"whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Violence is thus not a \"man to man\" affair as much as a :state to state\" struggle, if not an \"idea vs idea\" conflict.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}\nKalyvas' key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts. Any individual actor, Kalyvas posits, enters into a calculated ''alliance'' with the collective.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories, nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological, religious, ethnic, or class cleavage. The agency is located both within the collective and in the individual, in the universal and the local.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Kalyvas writes: \"Alliance entails a ''transaction'' between supralocal and local actors, whereby the former supply the later with external muscle, thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage, in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control, resources, and information- even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage, while the collective actors will aim to gain power. Violence is a mean as opposed to a goal, according to Kalyvas.\n\nThe greater takeaway from this central/local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology, but a conversation between the two. Rebellions are \"concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages, more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Any pre-conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation, lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre-conceived idea. Kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse, decisions, or ideologies from the \"center\" of collective action. Instead, the focus must be on \"local cleavages and intracommunity dynamics\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Furthermore, rebellion is not \"a mere mechanism that opens up the floodgates to random and anarchical private violence\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Rather, it is the result of a careful and precarious alliance between local motivations and collective vectors to help the individual cause.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Scott |first=James C. |title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia |date=November 16, 1976 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Kalyvas|first=Stathis N.|date=2003-01-01|title=The Ontology of \"Political Violence\": Action and Identity in Civil Wars|jstor=3688707|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=1|issue=3|pages=475\u2013494|ref=harv|doi=10.1017/s1537592703000355|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6177a1353177eaa1cd9db0933111a7a8f493c0cf}}\n*{{Cite book|title=States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 1979|location=Cambridge|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Capital vol.3: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole|last=Marx|first=Karl|publisher=International Publishers|year=1967|location=New York|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Why Men Rebel|last=Gurr|first=Ted Robert|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1970|isbn=978-0691075280|location=Princeton|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whymenrebel00gurr}}\n*{{Cite book|title=From Mobilization to Revolution|last=Tilly|first=Charles|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1978|isbn=978-0201075717|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/frommobilization00till}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Revolutionary Change|last=Johnson|first=Chalmers|publisher=Little Brown|year= 1966|location=Boston|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Popkin |first=Samuel L.. |title=The Rational Peasant:the Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam |date=1976|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Mancur |title=The Logic of Collective Action:Public Groups and Theories of Groups|publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1965|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Eli|last2=Laitin|first2=David|title=Religion, terrorism and public goods: Testing the club model|journal=Journal of Public Economics|date=2008|volume=92|issue=10\u201311|pages=1942\u20131967|url=http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~elib/tc.pdf|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2008.03.007|citeseerx=10.1.1.178.8147}}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Blattman|first1=Christopher|last2=Ralston|first2=Laura|title=Generating employment in Poor and Fragile States: Evidence from labor market and entrepreneurship programs|journal=World Bank Development Impact Evaluation (DIME)|date=2015|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Collier |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Collier |first2=Anke |last2=Hoeffler |year=2002 |title=Greed and Grievance in Civil War |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/17/000094946_00060205420011/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |series=The World Bank Policy Research Working Paper |volume=2355 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Conformity}}\n\n[[Category:Rebellion| ]]\n[[Category:Peace and conflict studies]]\n[[Category:Political science theories]]\n[[Category:Causes of war]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Refusal of obedience or order}}\n{{about|civil disorder}}\n{{redirect-multi|3|Revolt|Insurrection|Uprising}}\n{{For|other analysis of political violence|Political violence|Ethnic conflict}}\n{{Revolution sidebar}}\n\n'''Rebellion''', '''uprising''', or '''insurrection''' is a refusal of obedience or order.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cyclopedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political ... |last=Lalor |first=John Joseph |authorlink= |year=1884 |publisher=Rand, McNally |location= |isbn= |pages=632 }}</ref> It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established [[authority]]. \n\nA rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation.

Rebellion is studied, in Theda Skocpol's words, by analyzing \"objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations, rather than the interests, outlooks, or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=291}}\n\n==== Marxist insight ====\n[[Karl Marx]]'s analysis of revolutions sees such expression of [[political violence]] not as anomic, episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class-based relations of power. Indeed, the central tenet of Marxist philosophy, as expressed in [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]], is the analysis of society's mode of production (technology and labor) concomitant with the ownership of productive institutions and the division of profit. Marx writes about \"the hidden structure of society\" that must be elucidated through an examination of \"the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers\". The mismatch, between one mode of production, between the social forces and the social ownership of the production, is at the origin of the revolution.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=7}} The inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization, such as capitalism within feudalism, or more appropriately socialism within capitalism. The dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary. For example, the development of the bourgeoisie class went from oppressed merchant class to urban independence, eventually gaining enough power to represent the state as a whole. Social movements, thus, are determined by an exogenous set of circumstances. The proletariat must also, according to Marx, go through the same process of self-determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie. In Marx's theory revolutions are the \"locomotives of history\", it is because rebellion has for ultimate goal to overthrow the ruling class and its antiquated mode of production. Later, rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy, one that is better suited to the new ruling class, thus enabling societal progress. The cycle of rebellion, thus, replaces one mode of production by another through the constant class friction.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=8}}\n\n==== Ted Gurr: Roots of political violence ====\nIn his book ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr|Ted Gurr]] looks at the roots of political violence itself applied to a rebellion framework. He defines political violence as: \"all collective attacks within a political community against the political [[Political regime|regime]], its actors [...] or its policies. The concept represents a set of events, a common property of which is the actual or threatened use of violence\".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=3}} Gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order. More precisely, individuals become angry when they feel what Gurr labels as [[Relative deprivation thesis|relative deprivation]], meaning the feeling of getting less than one is entitled to. He labels it formally as the \"perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities\".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=37}} Gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation:\n# ''Decremental deprivation'': one's capacities' decrease when expectations remain high. One example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of  the value of higher education.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=47}}\n# ''Aspirational Deprivation'': one's capacities stay the same when expectations rise. An example would be a first generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better-prepared colleagues bypass her.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=52}}\n# ''Progressive deprivation'': expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up. A good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatisation of the assembly line.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=53}}\nAnger is thus comparative. One of his key insight is that \"The potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity\".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=24}} This means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on their particular internalization of their situation. As such, Gurr differentiates between three types of political violence:{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=11}}\n# ''Turmoil'' when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation;\n# ''Conspiracy'' when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation;\n# ''Internal War'', which includes revolution. In this case, the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil, and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society, unlike the conspiracy.\n\n==== Charles Tilly: Centrality of collective action ====\nIn ''From Mobilization to Revolution'', [[Charles Tilly]] argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society. \"Collective violence\", Tilly writes, \"is the product of just normal processes of competition among groups in order to obtain the power and implicitly to fulfill their desires\u201d.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=54}} He proposes two models to analyze political violence:\n# The ''polity'' model takes into account government and groups jockeying for control over power. Thus, both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch3}} Tilly labels those two groups \"members\" and \"challengers\". \n# The ''mobilization'' model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power. Tilly further divides the model in two sub-categories, one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group, and the other that is concerned with the \"external relations\" of the entity with other organizations and/or the government. According to Tilly, the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization. Thus, to answer Gurr, anger alone does not automatically create political violence. Political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite. It is far from irrational and spontaneous.\nRevolutions are included in this theory, although they remain for Tilly particularly extreme since the challenger(s) aim for nothing less than full control over power.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch7}} The \"revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero-sum game. This is what Tilly calls \"multiple sovereignty\".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}} The success of a revolutionary movement hinges on \"the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over Government.\".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}}\n\n==== Chalmers Johnson and societal values ====\nFor Chalmers Johnson, rebellions are not so much the product of political violence or collective action but in \"the analysis of viable, functioning societies\".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=3}} In a quasi-biological manner, Johnson sees revolutions as symptoms of pathologies within the societal fabric. A healthy society, meaning a \"value-coordinated social system\"{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=36}} does not experience political violence. Johnson's equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values. The legitimacy of a political order, he posits, relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change. Rigidity is, in other words, inadmissible. Johnson writes \"to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change; more exactly, it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure\".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=57}} The aim of a revolution is to re-align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process. Rebellions automatically must face a certain amount of coercion because by becoming \"de-synchronized\", the now illegitimate political order will have to use coercion to maintain its position. A simplified example would be the French Revolution when the Parisian Bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the King as synchronized with its own orientations. More than the King itself, what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class. Johnson emphasizes \"the necessity of investigating a system's value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way\".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=32}}\n\n==== Theda Skocpol and the Autonomy of the State ====\nSkocpol introduces the concept of the social revolution, to be contrasted with a political revolution. While the later aims to change the polity, the former is \"rapid, basic transformations of a society's state and class structures; and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=4}} Social revolutions are grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power, they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society. As a corollary, this means that some \"revolutions\" may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society. Her analysis is limited to studying the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. Skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases (which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized), each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action. \n# ''The Collapse of the Old-Regime State'': this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions. She highlights the importance of international military and economic competition as well as the pressure of the misfunctioning of domestic affairs. More precisely, she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors, the \"landed upper class\" and the \"imperial state\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=49}} Both could be considered as \"partners in exploitation\" but in reality competed for resources: the state (monarchs) seek to build up military and economic power to ascertain their geopolitical influence. The upper class works in a logic of [[profit maximization]], meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources. All three revolutions occurred, Skocpol argues, because states failed to be able to \"mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} The apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization. \"Revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the Bourbon, Romanov, and Manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures.\"{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} Skocpol further concludes \"the upshot was the disintegration of centralized administrative and military machineries that had theretofore provided the sole unified bulwark of social and political order\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=51}}\n# ''Peasant Uprisings'': more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context, the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall. These uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures ''per se'' but at the upper class itself, so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well. Skocpol quotes Barrington Moore who famously wrote: \"peasants [...] provided the dynamite to bring down the old building\".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=112}} Peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions: the level of autonomy (from both an economic and political point of view) peasant communities enjoy, and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics. In other words, peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel. If the coercive structures of the state and/or the landowners keep a very close check on peasant activity, then there is no space to forment dissent. \n# ''Societal Transformation'': this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords. The paradox of the three revolutions Skocpol studies is that stronger centralized and bureaucratic states emerge after the revolts.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=162}} The exact parameters depend, again, on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors: in Russia, the new state found most support in the industrial base, rooting itself in cities. In China, most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside, thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas. In France, the peasantry was not organized enough, and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything, partially explaining its artificiality. \nHere is a summary of the causes and consequences of social revolutions in these three countries, according to Skocpol:{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=155}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Conditions for Political Crises (A)\n|-\n!\n!''Power Structure''\n!''State of Agrarian Economy''\n!''International Pressures''\n|-\n!France\n|Landed-commercial upper class has moderate influence on the absolutist monarchy via bureaucracy\n|Moderate growth\n|Moderate, pressure from England\n|-\n!Russia\n|Landed nobility has no influence in absolutist state\n|Extensive growth, geographically unbalanced\n|Extreme, string of defeats culminating with WW1\n|-\n!China\n|Landed-commercial upper class has moderate influence on absolutist state via bureaucracy\n|Slow growth\n|Strong, imperialist intrusions\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Conditions for Peasant Insurrections (B)\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Organization of Agrarian Communities''\n!''Autonomy of Agrarian Communities''\n|-\n!France\n| colspan=\"2\" |Peasants own 30-40% of the land own and must pay tribute to the feudal landlord\n|Relatively autonomous, distant control from royal officials\n|-\n!Russia\n| colspan=\"2\" |Peasants own 60% of the land, pay rent to landowners that are part of the community\n|Sovereign, supervised by the bureaucracy\n|-\n!China\n| colspan=\"2\" |Peasants own 50% of the land and pay rent to the landowners, work exclusively on small plots, no real peasant community\n|Landlords dominate local politics under the supervision of Imperial officials\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Societal Transformations (A + B)\n|-\n!France\n| colspan=\"3\" |Breakdown of absolutist state, important peasant revolts against feudal system\n|-\n!Russia\n| colspan=\"3\" |Failure of top-down bureaucratic reforms, eventual dissolution of the state and widespread peasant revolts against all privately owned land\n|-\n!China\n| colspan=\"3\" |Breakdown of absolutist state, disorganized peasant upheavals but no autonomous revolts against landowners\n|}\n\n=== Microfoundational evidence on causes ===\nThe following theories are all based on [[Mancur Olson]]'s work in ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]]'', a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent [[Tragedy of the commons|problem]] with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits. In this case, the benefits of rebellion are seen as a [[Public good (economics)|public good]], meaning one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=9}}  Indeed, the political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful, not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself. Olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for [[Collective action theory|collective action]]. In fact, he argues the \"[[Free rider problem|free rider]]\" possibility, a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price, will deter rational individuals from collective action. That is, unless there is a clear benefit, a rebellion will not happen en masse. Thus, Olson shows that \"selective incentives\", only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort, can solve the free rider problem.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=76}}\n\n==== ''The Rational Peasant'' ====\n{{Main article|The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam}}\n\nSamuel L. Popkin builds on Olson's argument in ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam.'' His theory is based on the figure of a hyper rational peasant that bases his decision to join (or not) a rebellion uniquely on a cost-benefit analysis. This formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self-interest: a peasant, according to Popkin, will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him. According to Popkin, peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability. Social norms, he writes, are \"malleable, renegotiated, and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals\"{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=22}} Indeed, the constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition, due to the peculiar nature of the patron-client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner, forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make. Popkin argues that peasants rely on their \"private, family investment for their long run security and that they will be interested in short term gain vis-\u00e0-vis the village. They will attempt to improve their long-run security by moving to a position with higher income and less variance\".{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=23}} Popkin stresses this \"investor logic\" that one may not expect in agrarian societies, usually seen as pre-capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital. Yet, the selfish determinants of collective action are, according to Popkin, a direct product of the inherent instability of peasant life. The goal of a laborer, for example, will be to move to a tenant position, then smallholder, then landlord; where there is less variance and more income. Voluntarism is thus non-existent in such communities.\n\nPopkin singles out four variables that impact individual participation:\n# Contribution to the expenditure of resources: collective action has a cost in terms of contribution, and especially if it fails (an important consideration with regards to rebellion) \n# Rewards : the direct (more income) and indirect (less oppressive central state) rewards for collective action \n# Marginal impact of the peasant's contribution to the success of collective action\n# Leadership \"viability and trust\" : to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used.\nWithout any moral commitment to the community, this situation will engineer free riders. Popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem.{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=34}}\n\n===== Opportunity cost of rebellion =====\nPolitical Scientist Christopher Blattman and World Bank economist Laura Alston identify rebellious activity as an \"occupational choice\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=22}} They draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion, arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities. In both cases, only a selected few reap important benefits, while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} The choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost, namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel. Thus, the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision. Blattman and Alston, however, recognize that \"a poor person's best strategy\" might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} Individuals, they argue, can often have a varied \"portofolio\" of activities, suggesting that they all operate on a rational, profit maximizing logic. The authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost, both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}}\n\n===== Selective incentives based on group membership =====\nThe decision to join a rebellion can be based on the prestige and social status associated with membership in the rebellious group. More than material incentives for the individual, rebellions offer their members [[club good]]s, [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s that are reserved only for the members inside that group. Economist [[Eli Berman]] and Political Scientist David D. Laitin's study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership. Berman and Laitin discuss [[Suicide attack|suicide]] operations, meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual. They find that in such a framework, the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection. Furthermore, the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1965}} Berman and Laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety, basic infrastructure, access to utilities, or schooling.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1944}} Suicide operations \"can be explained as a costly signal of \u201ccommitment\u201d to the community\".{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1943}} They further note \"Groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment (sacrifices) may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility.\"{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1954}} Thus, rebellious groups can organize themselves to ''ask'' of members proof of commitment to the cause. Club goods serve not so much to coax individuals into joining but to prevent defection.\n\n===== Greed vs grievance model =====\n{{Main article|Greed versus grievance}}\nWorld Bank economists [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives:\n# [[Greed]] rebellion: \"motivated by predation of the rents from primary commodity exports, subject to an economic calculus of costs and a military survival constraint\".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}}\n# [[Grievance]] rebellion: \"motivated by hatreds which might be intrinsic to ethnic and religious differences, or reflected objective resentments such as domination by an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] majority, political repression, or [[economic inequality]]\".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} The two main sources of grievance are political exclusion and inequality.\nVollier and Hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts, while the model based on greed performs well. The authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model: individuals are fundamentally risk-adverse. However, they allow that conflicts create grievances, which in turn can become risk factors. Contrary to established beliefs, they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer, since individuals will be automatically more cautious, at the opposite of the grievance model predictions.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} Finally, the authors also note that the grievances expressed by members of the [[diaspora]] of a community in turmoil has an important on the continuation of violence.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=27}} Both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection.\n\n==== ''The Moral Economy of the Peasant'' ====\n{{Main article|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia}}\n\nSpearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist [[James C. Scott]] in his  book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant]]'', the [[moral economy]] school considers moral variables such as social norms, moral values, interpretation of justice, and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel. This perspective still adheres to Olson's framework, but it considers different variables to enter the cost/benefit analysis: the individual is still believed to be rational, albeit not on material but moral grounds.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=6}}\n\n===== Early conceptualization: E. P. Thompson and bread riots in England =====\nBefore being fully conceptualized by Scott, British historian [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]] was the first to use the term \"moral economy\" in ''Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1971-01-01|title=The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=650244|journal=Past & Present|issue=50|pages=76\u2013136}}</ref> In this work, he discussed English bread riots, regular, localized form of rebellion by English peasants all through the 18th century. Such events, Thompson argues, have been routinely dismissed as \"riotous\", with the connotation of being disorganized, spontaneous, undirected, and undisciplined. In other words, anecdotal. The reality, he suggests, was otherwise: such riots involved a coordinated peasant action, from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops. Here, while a scholar such as Popkin would have argued that the peasants were trying to gain material benefits (crudely: more food), Thompson sees a legitimization factor, meaning \"a belief that [the peasants] were defending traditional rights and customs\".  Thompson goes on to write: \"[the riots were] legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people\". Later, reflecting on this work, Thompson would also write: \"My object of analysis was the ''mentalit\u00e9'', or, as I would prefer, the political culture, the expectations, traditions, and indeed, superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Customs in Common: Studies in Traditional Popular Culture|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1993-08-01|publisher=The New Press|isbn=9781565840744|language=English}}</ref> The opposition between a traditional, paternalist, and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal, capitalist, and market-derived ethics is central to explain rebellion.\n\n===== James C. Scott and the formalization of the moral economy argument=====\nIn [[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia]], James C. Scott looks at the impact of exogenous economic and political shocks on peasant communities in Southeast Asia. Scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=15}} Therefore, any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium. He labels this phenomenon the \"subsistence ethic\".{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=13}} A landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant's subsistence over his constant benefit. According to Scott, the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies. Rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief, a moral outrage.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=193}}\n\n===== Other non-material incentives=====\n[[Chris Blattman|Blattman]] and Ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives, such as anger, outrage, and injustice (\"grievance\") in the roots of rebellions. These variables, they argue, are far from being irrational, as they are sometimes presented. They identify three main types of grievance arguments:\n# ''Intrinsic [[incentive]]s'' holds that \"[[injustice]] or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}} More than material rewards, individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged. The [[ultimatum game]] is an excellent illustration: player one receives $10 and must split it with another player who doesn't get the chance to determine how much he receives, but only if the deal is made or not (if he refuses, everyone loses their money). Rationally, player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term ($1 more remains $1 more). However, player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars, meaning that they are willing to pay a-$2 for justice to be respected. This game, according to Blattman and Ralston, represents \"the expressive pleasure people gain from punishing an injustice\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}}\n# ''[[Loss aversion]]'' holds that \"people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point, and that they are 'loss adverse\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} Individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains. There is a substantial [[Subjectivity|subjective]] part to this, however, as some may realize alone and decide that they are comparatively less well off than a neighbor, for example. To \"fix\" this gap, individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}}\n# ''Frustration-aggression'': this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any \"direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat\".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} There are limits to this theory: violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of [[preference]]s.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=26}} Yet, this approach shows that contextual elements like economic precarity have a non-negligible impact on the conditions of the decisions to rebel at minimum.\n\n== Recruitment ==\nStathis N. Kalyvas, a political science professor at Yale University, argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio-economic factors, from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Rebellion, or any sort of political violence, are not binary conflicts but must be understood as interactions between public and private identities and actions. The \"convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives\" make studying and theorizing rebellion a very complex affair, at the intersection between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=475}}\nKalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms:\n# The idea that political violence, and more specifically rebellion, is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state. This is inspired by Thomas Hobbes' views. The approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot, using violence to break down the power structures of society.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}\n# The idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs, \"whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Violence is thus not a \"man to man\" affair as much as a :state to state\" struggle, if not an \"idea vs idea\" conflict.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}\nKalyvas' key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts. Any individual actor, Kalyvas posits, enters into a calculated ''alliance'' with the collective.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories, nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological, religious, ethnic, or class cleavage. The agency is located both within the collective and in the individual, in the universal and the local.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Kalyvas writes: \"Alliance entails a ''transaction'' between supralocal and local actors, whereby the former supply the later with external muscle, thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage, in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control, resources, and information- even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage, while the collective actors will aim to gain power. Violence is a mean as opposed to a goal, according to Kalyvas.\n\nThe greater takeaway from this central/local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology, but a conversation between the two. Rebellions are \"concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages, more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage\".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Any pre-conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation, lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre-conceived idea. Kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse, decisions, or ideologies from the \"center\" of collective action.

Arguably one of the most consequential amendments to this day, the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law and was proposed in response to issues related to [[Freedman#United States|former slaves]] following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, and also those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such officials.\n\nThe amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since  the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.\n\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled this clause makes most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]] as it is to the federal government, as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to \"rebellion, or other crime\" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by \"appropriate legislation\"; however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n{{anchor|Section 2}}'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\n'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n'''Section 5.'''

Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name=\"Stromberg111\">Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199\u2013200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}</ref>\n\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=250\u2013251}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70}}</ref> Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71}}</ref> Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey.

The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3, and 4 were adopted on June 8, 1866, and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote (5 absent, not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138\u201336 vote (10 not voting).

Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.<ref name=\"bonfield\">{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nTwo solutions were considered:\n\n* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)\n* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote\n\nOn January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used \"race or color\" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.\n\nThe effect of Section 2 was twofold:\n\n* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section 2 \"abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]\".\n* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime.

Arguably one of the most consequential amendments to this day, the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law and was proposed in response to issues related to [[Freedman#United States|former slaves]] following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, and also those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such officials.\n\nThe amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since  the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.\n\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled this clause makes most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]] as it is to the federal government, as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to \"rebellion, or other crime\" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by \"appropriate legislation\"; however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n{{anchor|Section 2}}'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\n'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n'''Section 5.''' The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html |title=Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11\u201327 |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |archivedate=May 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526170111/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html |url-status=live  }}</ref>}}\n\n==Adoption==\n===Proposal by Congress===\n{{see also|Presidency of Andrew Johnson}}\n\nIn the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name=\"Stromberg111\">Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199\u2013200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}</ref>\n\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=250\u2013251}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70}}</ref> Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71}}</ref> Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey.

Bingham]] of Ohio, which would enable Congress to safeguard \"equal protection of life, liberty, and property\" of all citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} In April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex-Confederates.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} The House of Representatives passed ''House Resolution 127, 39th Congress'' several weeks later and sent to the Senate for action. The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3, and 4 were adopted on June 8, 1866, and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote (5 absent, not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138\u201336 vote (10 not voting). A concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal to the executives of the several states was passed by both houses of Congress on June 18.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States and Amendments Thereto|year=1961|publisher=Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government|page=44|editor=James J.

The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Jackson v.

Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.<ref name=\"bonfield\">{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nTwo solutions were considered:\n\n* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)\n* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote\n\nOn January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used \"race or color\" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.\n\nThe effect of Section 2 was twofold:\n\n* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section 2 \"abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]\".\n* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so\u2014something that it was thought the states would not accept.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/>\n\n===Enforcement===\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]]. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that {{quote|should any state, after the passage of this Act, deny or abridge the right of any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, to vote at any election named in the amendments to the Constitution, article fourteen, section two, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the number of Representatives apportioned in this act to such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall have to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=17&page=29#|title=\"An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives to Congress among the States according to the ninth Census\", Forty-Second Congress, Sess. ii, Ch. xi, section 6.

Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of appropriate management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of [[monitoring control and surveillance]]. A popular approach is the ecosystem approach to fisheries management.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4773e.pdf]</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The ecosystem approach to fisheries.

Updated 2 March 2009. Retrieved 22 February 2011.</ref> Starting in the 18th century attempts were made to regulate fishing in the [[Nord-Norge|North Norwegian]] fishery. This resulted in the enactment of a law in 1816 on the [[Lofoten]] fishery, which established in some measure what has come to be known as territorial use rights.<ref>Christy FT (1983) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/T0507E/T0507E00.htm ''Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries: Definitions and Conditions''] FAO Fisheries, Technical Paper No. 227, Rome. {{ISBN|978-92-5-101269-7}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The fishing banks were divided into areas belonging to the nearest fishing base on land and further subdivided into fields where the boats were allowed to fish.

In 1957 British fisheries researchers [[Ray Beverton]] and [[Sidney Holt]] published a seminal work on [[North Sea]] commercial fisheries dynamics.<ref name=\"Beverton and Holt, 1957\">{{harvnb|Beverton|Holt|1957}}</ref> In the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for North European management schemes.\n\nAfter some years away from the field of fisheries management, Beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first World Fisheries Congress in Athens in 1992. \"The Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations\" expressed his concerns, including the way his and Sidney Holt's work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Beverton|1992}}</ref> Nevertheless, the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] was founded to set standards for [[sustainable fishing]]. In 2010, the [[Aquaculture Stewardship Council]] was created to do the same for [[aquaculture]].\n\nA report by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]' International Sustainability Unit, the New York-based [[Environmental Defense Fund]] and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by  an extra amount of as much as $50 billion.<ref name=\"GlobalFisheries\">{{cite news|title=Prince Charles calls for greater sustainability in fisheries|url=http://www.londonmercury.com/index.php/sid/223769121/scat/415361b06433ee08/ht/Prince-Charles-calls-for-greater-sustainability-in-fisheries|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=London Mercury|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150815/http://www.londonmercury.com/index.php/sid/223769121/scat/415361b06433ee08/ht/Prince-Charles-calls-for-greater-sustainability-in-fisheries|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Political objectives==\nAccording to the [[FAO]], fisheries management should be based explicitly on political objectives, ideally with transparent priorities.<ref name=\"FAOGuidebook\">{{cite book|last1=Cochrane|first1=Kevern L.|last2=Garcia|first2=Serge M.|title=A Fishery Manager's Guidebook|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wIEtBDxOxZUC|page=91}}|date=22 June 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7085-7|pages=91\u2013}}</ref> Typical political objectives when exploiting a fish resource are to:<ref name=Duzgunes/>\n* [[maximum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable biomass yield]]\n* [[optimum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable economic yield]]\n* secure and increase employment\n* secure protein production and food supplies\n* increase export income\n\nSuch political goals can also be a weak part of fisheries management, since the objectives can conflict with each other.<ref name=Duzgunes>{{cite journal |last1=Erdogan |first1=Naciye |last2=Duzgunes |first2=Ertug |title=Fisheries Management in the Black Sea Countries |journal=Turkish Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |date=1 January 2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=181\u2013192 |url=http://www.trjfas.org/abstract.php?lang=en&id=608 }}</ref>\n\n==International objectives==\nFisheries objectives need to be expressed in concrete management rules. In most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed, though non-binding, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,<ref>[http://www.fao.org/fi/agreem/codecond/ficonde.asp Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries]</ref> agreed at a meeting of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization [[FAO]] session in 1995. The [[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]] it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], maximum fishing mortality rates, etc. In 2005 the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world's major fishing nations against the Code.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitcher|Kalikoski|Pramod|2006}}</ref>\n\nInternational agreements are required in order to regulate fisheries in international waters. The desire for agreement on this and other maritime issues led to three conferences on the Law of the Sea, and ultimately to the treaty known as the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). Concepts such as [[exclusive economic zone]]s (EEZ, extending {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from a nation's coasts) allocate certain sovereign rights and responsibilities for resource management to individual countries.\n\nOther situations need additional intergovernmental coordination. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea and other relatively narrow bodies of water, EEZ of {{convert|200|nmi|km}} are irrelevant.<!--why?--> International waters beyond {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} from shore require explicit agreements.\n\n[[Straddling stocks|Straddling fish stocks]], which [[Fish migration|migrate]] through more than one EEZ also present challenges. Here sovereign responsibility must be agreed with neighbouring [[coastal states]] and fishing entities. Usually this is done through the medium of a regional organisation set up for the purpose of [[Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement|coordinating the management]] of that stock.\n\nUNCLOS does not prescribe precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed. Several new fisheries (such as high seas [[bottom trawling]] fisheries) are not (yet) subject to international agreement across their entire range. In November 2004 the [[UN General Assembly]] issued a resolution on Fisheries that prepared for further development of international fisheries management law.\n\n==Management mechanisms==\nMany countries have set up Ministries/Government Departments, named \"[[Ministry of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Ministry of Fisheries]]\" or similar, controlling aspects of fisheries within their [[exclusive economic zones]].\nFour categories of management means have been devised, regulating either input/investment, or output, and operating either directly or indirectly:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!!!Inputs!!Outputs\n|-\n|Indirect\n|Vessel licensing\n|Catching techniques\n|-\n|Direct\n|Limited entry\n|[[IFQ|Catch quota]] and technical regulation\n|}\n\nTechnical means may include:\n* prohibiting devices such as bows and arrows, and spears, or firearms\n* prohibiting nets\n* setting minimum mesh sizes\n* limiting the average potential catch of a vessel in the fleet (vessel and crew size, gear, electronic gear and other physical \"inputs\".<ref>Sustainable Fishery system, Charles, A.

Frid adds, \u201cFish communities can be altered in a number of ways, for example they can decrease if particular sized individuals of a species are targeted, as this affects [[Population dynamics of fisheries#Predator-prey equations|predator and prey dynamics]].

Most marine fish produce huge numbers of eggs. The assumption was that younger spawners would produce plenty of viable [[larvae]].<ref name=\"ASSS 2005\">[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] (2005) [http://www.compassonline.org/pdf_files/PR_2005_2_19a.pdf ''New Science Sheds Light on Rebuilding Fisheries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217092613/http://www.compassonline.org/pdf_files/PR_2005_2_19a.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, 2005 research on [[Sebastes|rockfish]] shows that large, elderly females are far more important than younger fish in maintaining productive fisheries. The larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster, survive starvation better, and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish. Failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major US West Coast fisheries. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades. One way to prevent such collapses is to establish marine reserves, where fishing is not allowed and fish populations age naturally.<ref name=\"ASSS 2005\"/>\n\n==Data quality==\nAccording to fisheries scientist Milo Adkison, the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is the absence of quality data. Fisheries management decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be effective. He asserts that scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 |title=Adkison advocates increased fisheries data gathering |access-date=14 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711045411/http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 |archive-date=11 July 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe most reliable source for summary statistics is the [[FAO]] Fisheries Department.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/FIELD/006/Y3354M/Y3354M00.HTM Fishery statistics: Reliability and policy implications]</ref>\n\n==Ecopath==\n[[Ecopath]], with [[Ecosim]] (EwE), is an [[ecosystem]] modelling [[software suite]]. It was initially a [[NOAA]] initiative led by Jeffrey Polovina, later primarily developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The citation states that Ecopath \"revolutionized scientists\u2019 ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems\". Behind this lies two decades of development work by [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s. As of 2010 there are 6000 registered users in 155 countries. Ecopath is widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.\n\n==Human factors==\nManaging fisheries is about managing people and businesses, and not about managing fish. Fish populations are managed by regulating the actions of people.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|McConney|2004}}</ref> If fisheries management is to be successful, then associated human factors, such as the reactions of fishermen, are of key importance, and need to be understood.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Hilborn |first=R |year=2007 |title=Managing fisheries is managing people: what has been learned? |journal=Fish and Fisheries |volume=8 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2007.00263_2.x |pages=285\u2013296\n|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nManagement regulations must also consider the implications for stakeholders. Commercial fishermen rely on catches to provide for their families just as farmers rely on crops. Commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation. Most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry; regulation changes can impact an entire town's economy. Cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry.<ref>{{harvnb|Elder|2006}}</ref>\n\nEffective management of fisheries includes involving all stakeholders in the fishery. To do this successfully, stakeholders need to feel empowered enough to make meaningful contributions to the management process.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jentoft|first=Svein|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nEmpowerment has a wide application but in this context it refers to a tool that gives people within the fishing communities an opportunity to shape their own future in order to cope with the impacts from large-scale commercial fishing, competition of resources, and other threats that impact fishing communities.<ref name=\"svein1\">{{Cite journal|last=Svein|first=Jentoft|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are limits to empowerment in the fisheries management process. Empowerment maintains an involvement on the part of the state in fisheries management and no matter how empowered the other stakeholders are, the success of fisheries isn't possible without the legislative powers, financial resources, educational support, and research the government provides.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nThis concept is not accepted by all, as some communities and individuals argue that the state should withdraw completely and let the local communities handle their own fishery management based on cultural traditions and established practices.<ref name=\"svein1\"/> Additionally, others have argued that co-management only empowers the wealthy and powerful which in turn solidifies and validates the already existing inequalities of fisheries management.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nEmpowerment working as a function of co-management, carried out correctly, will not only enable but it will authorize individuals and communities to make meaningful contributions to fisheries management. It is a mechanism that works in a loop, where an individual gains empowerment and encouragement from being a part of the group and the collective action is only successful because of its empowered individuals.<ref name=\":1\" /> In order to effectively and successfully use empowerment as co-management, it is imperative that study programs, guidelines, reading materials, manuals, and checklists are developed and incorporated into all fisheries management.\n\n==Performance==\nThe [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of certain global [[fish stock]]s have been allowed to run down.  The biomass of many species have now diminished to the point where it is no longer possible to [[Maximum sustainable yield|sustainably]] catch the amount of fish that could be caught. According to a 2008 UN report, titled ''[[The Sunken Billions|The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform]]'', the world's [[fishing fleet]]s incur a \"$US 50 billion annual economic loss\" through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the [[World Bank]] and the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), asserts that half the world's [[fishing fleet]] could be scrapped with no change in catch.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"By improving governance of marine fisheries, society could capture a substantial part of this $50 billion annual economic loss. Through comprehensive reform, the fisheries sector could become a basis for economic growth and the creation of alternative livelihoods in many countries. At the same time, a nation\u2019s natural capital in the form of fish stocks could be greatly increased and the negative impacts of the fisheries on the marine environment reduced.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Arnason|Kelleher|Willmann|2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe most prominent failure of fisheries management in recent times has perhaps been the events that lead to the collapse of the [[Cod fisheries#Collapse of the northern cod fishery|northern cod fisheries]]. More recently, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] produced a series of journalistic investigations called ''[[Looting the seas]]''.

In 1957 British fisheries researchers [[Ray Beverton]] and [[Sidney Holt]] published a seminal work on [[North Sea]] commercial fisheries dynamics.<ref name=\"Beverton and Holt, 1957\">{{harvnb|Beverton|Holt|1957}}</ref> In the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for North European management schemes.\n\nAfter some years away from the field of fisheries management, Beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first World Fisheries Congress in Athens in 1992. \"The Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations\" expressed his concerns, including the way his and Sidney Holt's work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Beverton|1992}}</ref> Nevertheless, the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] was founded to set standards for [[sustainable fishing]]. In 2010, the [[Aquaculture Stewardship Council]] was created to do the same for [[aquaculture]].\n\nA report by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]' International Sustainability Unit, the New York-based [[Environmental Defense Fund]] and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by  an extra amount of as much as $50 billion.<ref name=\"GlobalFisheries\">{{cite news|title=Prince Charles calls for greater sustainability in fisheries|url=http://www.londonmercury.com/index.php/sid/223769121/scat/415361b06433ee08/ht/Prince-Charles-calls-for-greater-sustainability-in-fisheries|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=London Mercury|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150815/http://www.londonmercury.com/index.php/sid/223769121/scat/415361b06433ee08/ht/Prince-Charles-calls-for-greater-sustainability-in-fisheries|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Political objectives==\nAccording to the [[FAO]], fisheries management should be based explicitly on political objectives, ideally with transparent priorities.<ref name=\"FAOGuidebook\">{{cite book|last1=Cochrane|first1=Kevern L.|last2=Garcia|first2=Serge M.|title=A Fishery Manager's Guidebook|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wIEtBDxOxZUC|page=91}}|date=22 June 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7085-7|pages=91\u2013}}</ref> Typical political objectives when exploiting a fish resource are to:<ref name=Duzgunes/>\n* [[maximum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable biomass yield]]\n* [[optimum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable economic yield]]\n* secure and increase employment\n* secure protein production and food supplies\n* increase export income\n\nSuch political goals can also be a weak part of fisheries management, since the objectives can conflict with each other.<ref name=Duzgunes>{{cite journal |last1=Erdogan |first1=Naciye |last2=Duzgunes |first2=Ertug |title=Fisheries Management in the Black Sea Countries |journal=Turkish Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |date=1 January 2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=181\u2013192 |url=http://www.trjfas.org/abstract.php?lang=en&id=608 }}</ref>\n\n==International objectives==\nFisheries objectives need to be expressed in concrete management rules. In most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed, though non-binding, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,<ref>[http://www.fao.org/fi/agreem/codecond/ficonde.asp Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries]</ref> agreed at a meeting of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization [[FAO]] session in 1995. The [[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]] it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], maximum fishing mortality rates, etc. In 2005 the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world's major fishing nations against the Code.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitcher|Kalikoski|Pramod|2006}}</ref>\n\nInternational agreements are required in order to regulate fisheries in international waters. The desire for agreement on this and other maritime issues led to three conferences on the Law of the Sea, and ultimately to the treaty known as the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). Concepts such as [[exclusive economic zone]]s (EEZ, extending {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from a nation's coasts) allocate certain sovereign rights and responsibilities for resource management to individual countries.\n\nOther situations need additional intergovernmental coordination. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea and other relatively narrow bodies of water, EEZ of {{convert|200|nmi|km}} are irrelevant.<!--why?--> International waters beyond {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} from shore require explicit agreements.\n\n[[Straddling stocks|Straddling fish stocks]], which [[Fish migration|migrate]] through more than one EEZ also present challenges. Here sovereign responsibility must be agreed with neighbouring [[coastal states]] and fishing entities. Usually this is done through the medium of a regional organisation set up for the purpose of [[Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement|coordinating the management]] of that stock.\n\nUNCLOS does not prescribe precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed. Several new fisheries (such as high seas [[bottom trawling]] fisheries) are not (yet) subject to international agreement across their entire range. In November 2004 the [[UN General Assembly]] issued a resolution on Fisheries that prepared for further development of international fisheries management law.\n\n==Management mechanisms==\nMany countries have set up Ministries/Government Departments, named \"[[Ministry of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Ministry of Fisheries]]\" or similar, controlling aspects of fisheries within their [[exclusive economic zones]].\nFour categories of management means have been devised, regulating either input/investment, or output, and operating either directly or indirectly:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!!!Inputs!!Outputs\n|-\n|Indirect\n|Vessel licensing\n|Catching techniques\n|-\n|Direct\n|Limited entry\n|[[IFQ|Catch quota]] and technical regulation\n|}\n\nTechnical means may include:\n* prohibiting devices such as bows and arrows, and spears, or firearms\n* prohibiting nets\n* setting minimum mesh sizes\n* limiting the average potential catch of a vessel in the fleet (vessel and crew size, gear, electronic gear and other physical \"inputs\".<ref>Sustainable Fishery system, Charles, A.

The larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster, survive starvation better, and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish.

It was initially a [[NOAA]] initiative led by Jeffrey Polovina, later primarily developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The citation states that Ecopath \"revolutionized scientists\u2019 ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems\". Behind this lies two decades of development work by [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s. As of 2010 there are 6000 registered users in 155 countries. Ecopath is widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.\n\n==Human factors==\nManaging fisheries is about managing people and businesses, and not about managing fish. Fish populations are managed by regulating the actions of people.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|McConney|2004}}</ref> If fisheries management is to be successful, then associated human factors, such as the reactions of fishermen, are of key importance, and need to be understood.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Hilborn |first=R |year=2007 |title=Managing fisheries is managing people: what has been learned? |journal=Fish and Fisheries |volume=8 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2007.00263_2.x |pages=285\u2013296\n|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nManagement regulations must also consider the implications for stakeholders. Commercial fishermen rely on catches to provide for their families just as farmers rely on crops. Commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation. Most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry; regulation changes can impact an entire town's economy. Cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry.<ref>{{harvnb|Elder|2006}}</ref>\n\nEffective management of fisheries includes involving all stakeholders in the fishery. To do this successfully, stakeholders need to feel empowered enough to make meaningful contributions to the management process.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jentoft|first=Svein|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nEmpowerment has a wide application but in this context it refers to a tool that gives people within the fishing communities an opportunity to shape their own future in order to cope with the impacts from large-scale commercial fishing, competition of resources, and other threats that impact fishing communities.<ref name=\"svein1\">{{Cite journal|last=Svein|first=Jentoft|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are limits to empowerment in the fisheries management process. Empowerment maintains an involvement on the part of the state in fisheries management and no matter how empowered the other stakeholders are, the success of fisheries isn't possible without the legislative powers, financial resources, educational support, and research the government provides.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nThis concept is not accepted by all, as some communities and individuals argue that the state should withdraw completely and let the local communities handle their own fishery management based on cultural traditions and established practices.<ref name=\"svein1\"/> Additionally, others have argued that co-management only empowers the wealthy and powerful which in turn solidifies and validates the already existing inequalities of fisheries management.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nEmpowerment working as a function of co-management, carried out correctly, will not only enable but it will authorize individuals and communities to make meaningful contributions to fisheries management. It is a mechanism that works in a loop, where an individual gains empowerment and encouragement from being a part of the group and the collective action is only successful because of its empowered individuals.<ref name=\":1\" /> In order to effectively and successfully use empowerment as co-management, it is imperative that study programs, guidelines, reading materials, manuals, and checklists are developed and incorporated into all fisheries management.\n\n==Performance==\nThe [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of certain global [[fish stock]]s have been allowed to run down.  The biomass of many species have now diminished to the point where it is no longer possible to [[Maximum sustainable yield|sustainably]] catch the amount of fish that could be caught. According to a 2008 UN report, titled ''[[The Sunken Billions|The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform]]'', the world's [[fishing fleet]]s incur a \"$US 50 billion annual economic loss\" through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the [[World Bank]] and the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), asserts that half the world's [[fishing fleet]] could be scrapped with no change in catch.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"By improving governance of marine fisheries, society could capture a substantial part of this $50 billion annual economic loss. Through comprehensive reform, the fisheries sector could become a basis for economic growth and the creation of alternative livelihoods in many countries. At the same time, a nation\u2019s natural capital in the form of fish stocks could be greatly increased and the negative impacts of the fisheries on the marine environment reduced.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Arnason|Kelleher|Willmann|2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe most prominent failure of fisheries management in recent times has perhaps been the events that lead to the collapse of the [[Cod fisheries#Collapse of the northern cod fishery|northern cod fisheries]]. More recently, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] produced a series of journalistic investigations called ''[[Looting the seas]]''. These detail investigations into the black market for [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]], the subsidies propping up the Spanish fishing industry, and the overfishing of the [[Chilean jack mackerel]].<ref>[http://www.iwatchnews.org/environment/natural-resources/looting-seas Looting the Seas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304215856/http://www.iwatchnews.org/environment/natural-resources/looting-seas |date=4 March 2012 }} ''iWatch News'', 17 March 2012.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Too many see alsos|date=October 2015}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Age class structure]]\n* [[Beverton\u2013Holt model]]\n* [[Community supported fishery]]\n* [[Fisheries Law Centre]]\n* [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing]]\n* [[International inspection pennant]]\n* [[List of harvested aquatic animals by weight]]\n* [[Marine conservation]]\n* [[Marine Protected Area]]\n* [[Marine Conservation Cambodia|MFMA implementation in Cambodia]]\n* [[Maximum sustainable yield]]\n* [[North Pacific Fishery Management Council]]\n* [[Regional Fisheries Management Organisation]]\n* [[Sustainable fisheries]]\n* [[The Sunken Billions]]\n* [[The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat|The End of the Line]] \u2013 documentary\n* [[U.S. Regional Fishery Management Councils]]\n* [[Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arnason |first1=R |last2=Kelleher |first2=K |last3=Willmann |first3=R |year=2008 |url=http://go.worldbank.org/MGUTHSY7U0 |archive-url=https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100504080401/http://go.worldbank.org/MGUTHSY7U0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-05-04 |title=The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform'' |publisher=[[World Bank]] and [[FAO]] |isbn=978-0-8213-7790-1 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Beverton\n | first = R.
