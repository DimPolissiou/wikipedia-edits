He sought to approach astrology as a science, and the controversy over his assertion of the existence of Trans-Neptunian objects other than Pluto led to widespread ridicule and rejection during his later years.\n\n== Groups of Alfred Witte's Astrology (\"Uranians\") ==\n* Astrologenverein \"Hamburger Schule\", Hamburg, est. 1925\n* \"Witte-Studiengemeinschaft D\u00fcsseldorf\", D\u00fcsseldorf, est. 1932\n* \"Astrologische Studiengesellschaft (Hamburger Schule)\", Hamburg, est. 1947\n* The \"Bangkok Astrological School\", Bangkok, Thailand, est. 1972 \n* The \"[http://uraniansociety.com/ Uranian Society]\", New York City, USA, est. 1985 \n* \"Uranian Astrologers Club Thailand\" (UACT), Bangkok, Thailand, est. 2001\n* The \"[http://i-u-f.org International Uranian Fellowship]\", The Hague, Netherlands, est. 2007\n\n==Trans-Neptunian hypothesis==\nIn Wiite's times, many astronomers proposed hypothetical [[Trans-Neptunian objects]]. So Witte proposed the existence of several hypothetical Trans-Neptunian objects, too.  While modern technology has verified the existence of thousands of Trans-Neptunian objects, the specific Trans-Neptunian objects that are used by the Hamburg School and Uranian astrology have not yet been validated or disproven as of September 2011.  Some members of the Hamburg School have for a number of years asserted that some of Witte's Trans-Neptunians may actually be the [[Center of mass|barycenters]] of clusters of Trans-Neptunian objects, and shun both the labels \"planet\" and \"object\" for this reason.
