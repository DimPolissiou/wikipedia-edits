More recently, Hughes has also written stories set during or after the change in the mode of [[Dying Earth genre]]. The stories and characters of the Archonate reflect Hughes's interest in [[crime fiction]]: he has described himself as \"a hard-boiled crime writer working in a science-fictional mode.\"<ref name=\"Lightspeed Author Spotlight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-matthew-hughes/| title=Author Spotlight: Matthew Hughes|last=Stephens|first=Patrick J.|date=September 2013|work=[[Lightspeed (magazine)|Lightspeed]]| accessdate=16 February 2020| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Filidor Vesh====\nThe two Filidor Vesh books follow the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] adventures of the title character, nephew and apprentice to the ruling Archon of Old Earth. \n*''Fools Errant'' (1994)\n**\"From the Discourses and Edifications of Liw Osfeo\" (Excerpt and variant of the Liw Osfeo sections from ''Fools Errant'', first published in the limited edition of ''The Gist Hunter and Other Stories'', August 2005)\n*''Fool Me Twice'' (2001)\n**''Gullible's Travels'' (SFBC omnibus of ''Fools Errant'' and ''Fool Me Twice'', 2001)\n\n====The Commons====\nThe stories concerned with the Commons were originally intended to form one long novel. As this book did not meet the word limits imposed by [[Tor Books]], Hughes published the shortened novel as ''Black Brillion'' and turned the excised material into a series of six short stories about Guth Bandar, a scholar dedicated to exploring humanity's [[collective unconscious]].<ref name=\"James Nicoll Commons\">{{cite web|url=https://jamesdavisnicoll.com/review/a-tale-of-the-commons-part-one| title=A Tale of the Commons, Part One |last=Nicoll|first=James|date=24 February 2015|work=James Nicoll Reviews| accessdate=6 March 2020| url-status=live}}</ref> Hughes sold these stories to [[Gordon Van Gelder]] at ''The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction''; the first three were collected in 2005 as part of ''The Gist Hunter and Other Stories'' and [[Robert J.
