The only son of country music singers [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Jessi Colter]], he has been active since 1996, releasing seven albums and numerous EPs. He also has made some appearances and cameos in films. Jennings is active mainly in [[outlaw country]] and [[Southern rock]] genres.\n\nJennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' on  [[Universal South Records|Universal South]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;22 on the Billboard country charts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Shooter Jennings - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/279176/shooter-jennings/chart?f=320|website = www.billboard.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref> Jennings has since followed with six more full-length studio albums: ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' (2006), ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' (2007), ''[[Black Ribbons]]'' (2009), ''Family Man'' (2012), ''The Other Life'' (2013) and ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'' (2016), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous [[Extended play|EPs]].\n\nIn 2018 Jennings released his eighth album called ''Shooter'', under [[Dave Cobb]]\u2019s [[Low Country Sound]] imprint label.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/lists/2018-country-music-preview-30-most-anticipated-albums-tours-w514999/shooter-jennings-shooter-w515082|title= 30 Most Anticipated Albums Shooter Jennings\u2019s Shooter|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Musical career ==\n=== Early life ===\nJennings was born in Nashville, Tennessee on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname \"Shooter\". His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. \u201cI love my mom,\u201d says Jennings, \u201cbut I like Dad\u2019s version better. And I believe it\u2019s true. He didn\u2019t make [stuff] like that up.\"\n\nHe lived the first few years of his life in a crib on his parents' tour bus surrounded by the likes of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. By age five, he was playing drums. At 8 years old, he began taking piano lessons. He started playing guitar at fourteen and on occasion he'd play percussion in his father's band.\n\nIn high school Jennings fronted an industrial rock band called KilRaven for his high school's talent show. In 2011, he released the KilRaven track \"Only You\" on the album \"Missed The Boat\".\n\nIn 1996, Jennings and his father recorded an album together. They called it ''Fenixon'' (a play on the words \"phoenix\" and \"sun\") but could not find a label to distribute it.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Waylon and Son, Reunited on Disc|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471459623460261|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-21|issn = 0099-9660|first = Jim|last = Fusilli}}</ref> Some of the material was remastered and used for the album ''Waylon Forever''. The full ''Fenixon'' recording was finally released by Jennings' label Black Country Rock in 2014.\n\n=== Stargunn ===\nIn 2001, Jennings left [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to seek his fortunes in [[Los Angeles]]. He assembled and performed with Stargunn, a [[rock music|rock]] band. The band featured Jennings on piano and lead vocals, Carter Falco, and Kevin Sciou on guitar and background vocals, Curtis Roach on bass, and Lex Lipsitz on drums.\n\nTowards the end of 2001, Stargunn released their first album ''The Only Way Up Is Down'' and toured with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], Mark Ford and others in support of the album. That same year ''Music Connection'' magazine listed Stargunn as one of the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists of 2001.\n\nIn 2002 Stargunn was featured on ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', and the soundtrack to the [[Vince Vaughn]] film ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] licensed the song \"White Lines N Black Ties\" for the film ''[[The Crew (2000 film)|The Crew]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]].\n\nStargunn performed together for three years, built an avid following, and earned praise from the local music press. On March 30, 2003, Jennings dissolved Stargunn and began working on his solo career.\n\n\nAfter the band's breakup, Jennings was twice presented with the opportunity to front the hard rock supergroup [[Velvet Revolver]], but chose instead to pursue a career in country music.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SHOOTER JENNINGS Claims He Was Offered VELVET REVOLVER Job Twice|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shooter-jennings-claims-he-was-offered-velvet-revolver-job-twice/|website = BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date = 2009-03-19|accessdate = 2015-11-21|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Jennings' label Black Country Rock released Stargunn's debut album \"The Only Way Up Is Down\" on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.\n\n=== ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'' ===\nHe returned to Los Angeles in 2004 to begin working on new material. In 2005 Jennings signed his first recording contract, with [[Universal South Records]], releasing his debut album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' that same year.\n\n\"Put the \"O\" Back in Country\" produced his only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in its lead-off single \"Fourth of July\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22. The album version of this song features a cameo appearance by George Jones, who sings the chorus to his signature song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" at the end; this guest appearance was removed from the song's radio edit. Despite the edit, Jones was credited on the Billboard charts. The album featured his new band The .357's, which consisted of Leroy Powell on guitar, Bryan Keeling on drums, [[Ted Russell Kamp|Ted Kamp]] on bass with [[Robby Turner]] on steel, and backing vocals by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].\n\nLater that year his song \"Busted In Baylor County\" was then featured in the 2005 film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', furthermore Jennings portrayed his father in the [[Johnny Cash]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Walk the Line]]'' alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]. His rendition of his father's song \"Long Way From Home\" was featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\n=== ''Electric Rodeo'' and ''The Wolf'' ===\nThough recorded before ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'', released on April 4, 2006,{{clarify|reason=is this the release date of Put the O Back in Country or the release date of Electric Rodeo?|date=April 2017}} ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' was released as Jennings's second solo album. Sonically, ''Electric Rodeo'' is louder, rawer, more upfront rock and roll than its predecessor.\n\n''Electric Rodeo'' was followed by ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' on October 23, 2007. The album varied from his previous records in that the .357s had opted for a decidedly 1970s feel to the instrumentals. It featured collaborations with [[Doug Kershaw]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], as well as a cover of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Walk of Life]]\".\n\nThat same year Jennings was featured on a duet of \"[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]\" on [[Deana Carter]]'s sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''.\n\n=== Departure from Universal ===\nIn 2009, Jennings, having issues with his label and wanting out of his four-album contract released his first compilation album, ''[[Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's]]''. The album featured four new tracks; live versions of \"Lonesome Blues\", and \"Daddy's Farm\", as well as covers of his father's \"Lonesome, Onry and Mean\", and the [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] song \"Living Proof\".\n\nAfter the release of ''Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's'', having fulfilled his four-album contract; Jennings parted ways with Universal records.\n\nOn March 23, 2009 Jennings took part in ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', a television show in which two musicians are paired with one another and perform a small concert together for an intimate crowd. The episode paired Jennings with close friend and fellow musician [[Jamey Johnson]]. The evening's set list consisted entirely of duets, including a cover of \"Outlaw Shit\" from the ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' album, two songs from Jennings' discography; \"God Bless Alabama\", \"It Ain't Easy\". As well as four songs from Johnson's album ''[[That Lonesome Song]]''; \"High Cost Of Living\", \"Mowing Down The Roses\", \"Between Jennings and Jones\" and \"In Color\".\n\n=== ''Black Ribbons'' ===\nHaving left Universal, Jennings changed the name of his backing band from The .357's to Hierophant. With the news that he and his band would be joining the likes of [[Paramore]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Jefree Star]], and various other popular rock bands on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]] it became apparent that Jennings next album would differ drastically from his previous efforts.\n\nIn February 2009, it was announced that the album would be titled ''[[Black Ribbons]]''. It was also announced that it would be a dystopian concept rock opera and that writer [[Stephen King]] would play a major role in the album as Will O' The Wisp.\n\nIt was released independently on March 2, 2010 through Black Country Rock Records, and although it was seen as a complete departure from his country sound, the album showed off the diversity as an artist and gained him much critical acclaim, as well as a brand new underground following.\n\nOn May 1, 2010, Jennings announced \"Black Ribbons: The Living Album\" on his Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShooterJennings |title=Shooter Jennings (ShooterJennings) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2014-06-03 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref> The \"Living Album\" includes the full studio record and live shows with [[Hierophant]] on a [[USB flash drive]] shaped like a tarot card.\nTowards the end of 2010, Jennings with the help of various other artists launched the \"XXX\" movement to help musicians who struggle to receive mainstream recognition.\n\n=== ''Family Man'' ===\nIn 2011, along with childhood friend and master pianist Erik Deutsch, Jennings formed The Triple Crown, a new backing band featuring Erik Deutsch on piano, Tony Leone on drums, Jeff Hill on bass, Jon Graboff on pedal steel, Eleanor Whitmore on fiddle and Chris Masterson on lead guitar.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, having signed a record deal with [[E1 Music]], and with The Triple Crown along for the ride, Jennings returned to his country roots with the release of the album ''Family Man'', his first self-produced outing. The album was originally meant to contain eighteen tracks, but was instead split into two albums: ''Family Man'' and 2013's ''The Other Life''.\n\nOn July 31, 2012 Jennings was featured in [[Bucky Covington]]'s debut single \"The Drinking Side of Country\" from the album ''Good Guys''.\n\nJennings took part in the February 25 Johnny Cash 80th Birthday Bash, in which he sang [[Cocaine Blues]] With [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Amy Nelson]]. The performance was released in a DVD/CD combo.\n\nIn October 2012 Jennings was one of six commentators for the Ovation mini-series ''Song By Song: Johnny Cash''.\n\n=== ''The Other Life'' ===\nWhile recording ''Family Man'', Jennings decided to cut the darker tracks from the album, and instead use them for the album's follow-up, ''The Other Life''.\n\n\"Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing ''Family Man'', and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records. ''The Other Life'' is representative of the other side of the coin from ''Family Man'' and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways, At first we were going to call it ''The Outsider'', but once we got into the film we thought, 'Well, it's like a mirror, a dark mirror of what ''Family Man'' was.'&thinsp;\" - Jennings told TheBoot.com.\n\nJennings premiered the track \"Wild & Lonesome\" (featuring [[Patti Griffin]]) on the 4th season of the FX original series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Followed by the release of first official single from the album \"The White Trash Song\" (featuring [[Scott H. Biram]]) which premiered on RollingStones.com along with the announcement that the album would be accompanied by a film.\n\nThe album featured seven new songs, as well as two cover songs ([[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"Flying Saucer song\" and [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s \"The White Trash song\") and \"Outlaw You\", which was put out in early 2012 as a digital release.\n\nJennings along with filmmaker Blake Judd released ''The Other Life'' film. Running at 32 minutes long, it utilizes six of the songs from the album as a sort of narration. The film is about a musician leaving his family to tour, but when he does so he finds the road is not the same, and becomes haunted by a mysterious woman. Throughout the film, the musician is forced to face his darker urges and deal with self-discovery, temptation, isolation and rebirth. The film closes with a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nThe Other Life went on to win Best Short Film at the 2013 Horror Hound Festival.\n\n=== Black Country Rock Media ===\n{{main|Black Country Rock Media}}\nOn October 2013, Jennings announced the formation of his new label and multi-format recording company, Black Country Rock. Their initial releases included: a remastered release of the [[Waylon Jennings]] album ''[[Right for the Time]]'', two live albums (one from [[Jessi Colter]] titled ''Live from Cain's Ballroom'', and one from Jennings titled ''The Other Live''), as well as a recording of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" featuring vocals from both [[Jamey Johnson]] and Jennings. All four were released on vinyl, cassette, CD, as well as digitally.\n\n=== ''The Magic'' ===\nOn February 27, 2014, Jennings revealed he would be releasing a spoken word follow-up to Hierophant's 2010 album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]'', titled ''The Magic'', inspired by first story in the controversially interactive horror series thirteen.\n\nIn addition to ''The Magic'' Jennings also announced, that after nearly a decade of waiting, he would be releasing the 1995 collaborative album,  ''Fenixon''.\n\nBoth projects were released during 2014's Record Store Day, and subsequently sold out.\n\n=== \"George/Giorgio\" releases ===\nTowards the end of May 2014, Jennings announced his intention to release two EP's later in the year. ''Don't Wait Up (for George)'' is a tribute to his close friend and mentor [[George Jones]], which was released in August 2014. Jennings' seventh studio album, ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'', was originally scheduled to be released in November 2014, but its release was delayed due to the sudden death of [[Jon Hensley (radio personality)|Jon Hensley]], Jennings' longtime manager and friend and Black Country Rock co-founder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-daft-punk-and-the-muppets-inspired-shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-6616503 |title=How Daft Punk and the Muppets Inspired Shooter Jennings' Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album |first=Daniel |last=Kohn |work=[[LA Weekly]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> A tribute to 1970s electronic-music pioneer and producer, [[Giorgio Moroder]], the album was released on February 26, 2016 and features guest vocals from [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6882805/shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-countach-david-bowie-interview |title=Shooter Jennings on Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album & How His David Bowie Cover 'Ended Up Meaning So Much More' |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Brandi Carlile]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/shooter-jennings-enlists-marilyn-manson-brandi-carlile-for-countach-20160104 |title=Shooter Jennings Enlists Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile for 'Countach' |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 4, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/02/marilyn-manson-covers-the-hell-out-of-david-bowies-cat-people-listen/ |title=Marilyn Manson covers the hell out of David Bowie's \"Cat People\" \u2014 listen |first=Ben |last=Kaye |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[Richard Garriott|Richard Garriott de Cayeux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/neon-noir-meets-outlaw-country-shooter-jennings-tr-230314 |title=Neon noir meets outlaw country in Shooter Jennings' tribute to Giorgio Moroder |first=Mike |last=Vanderbilt |work=[[The A.V.

Worst episode ever.is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. The only son of country music singers [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Jessi Colter]], he has been active since 1996, releasing seven albums and numerous EPs. He also has made some appearances and cameos in films. Jennings is active mainly in [[outlaw country]] and [[Southern rock]] genres.\n\nJennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' on  [[Universal South Records|Universal South]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;22 on the Billboard country charts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Shooter Jennings - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/279176/shooter-jennings/chart?f=320|website = www.billboard.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref> Jennings has since followed with six more full-length studio albums: ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' (2006), ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' (2007), ''[[Black Ribbons]]'' (2009), ''Family Man'' (2012), ''The Other Life'' (2013) and ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'' (2016), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous [[Extended play|EPs]].\n\nIn 2018 Jennings released his eighth album called ''Shooter'', under [[Dave Cobb]]\u2019s [[Low Country Sound]] imprint label.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/lists/2018-country-music-preview-30-most-anticipated-albums-tours-w514999/shooter-jennings-shooter-w515082|title= 30 Most Anticipated Albums Shooter Jennings\u2019s Shooter|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Musical career ==\n=== Early life ===\nJennings was born in Nashville, Tennessee on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname \"Shooter\". His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. \u201cI love my mom,\u201d says Jennings, \u201cbut I like Dad\u2019s version better. And I believe it\u2019s true. He didn\u2019t make [stuff] like that up.\"\n\nHe lived the first few years of his life in a crib on his parents' tour bus surrounded by the likes of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. By age five, he was playing drums. At 8 years old, he began taking piano lessons. He started playing guitar at fourteen and on occasion he'd play percussion in his father's band.\n\nIn high school Jennings fronted an industrial rock band called KilRaven for his high school's talent show. In 2011, he released the KilRaven track \"Only You\" on the album \"Missed The Boat\".\n\nIn 1996, Jennings and his father recorded an album together. They called it ''Fenixon'' (a play on the words \"phoenix\" and \"sun\") but could not find a label to distribute it.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Waylon and Son, Reunited on Disc|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471459623460261|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-21|issn = 0099-9660|first = Jim|last = Fusilli}}</ref> Some of the material was remastered and used for the album ''Waylon Forever''. The full ''Fenixon'' recording was finally released by Jennings' label Black Country Rock in 2014.\n\n=== Stargunn ===\nIn 2001, Jennings left [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to seek his fortunes in [[Los Angeles]]. He assembled and performed with Stargunn, a [[rock music|rock]] band. The band featured Jennings on piano and lead vocals, Carter Falco, and Kevin Sciou on guitar and background vocals, Curtis Roach on bass, and Lex Lipsitz on drums.\n\nTowards the end of 2001, Stargunn released their first album ''The Only Way Up Is Down'' and toured with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], Mark Ford and others in support of the album. That same year ''Music Connection'' magazine listed Stargunn as one of the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists of 2001.\n\nIn 2002 Stargunn was featured on ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', and the soundtrack to the [[Vince Vaughn]] film ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] licensed the song \"White Lines N Black Ties\" for the film ''[[The Crew (2000 film)|The Crew]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]].\n\nStargunn performed together for three years, built an avid following, and earned praise from the local music press. On March 30, 2003, Jennings dissolved Stargunn and began working on his solo career.\n\n\nAfter the band's breakup, Jennings was twice presented with the opportunity to front the hard rock supergroup [[Velvet Revolver]], but chose instead to pursue a career in country music.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SHOOTER JENNINGS Claims He Was Offered VELVET REVOLVER Job Twice|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shooter-jennings-claims-he-was-offered-velvet-revolver-job-twice/|website = BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date = 2009-03-19|accessdate = 2015-11-21|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Jennings' label Black Country Rock released Stargunn's debut album \"The Only Way Up Is Down\" on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.\n\n=== ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'' ===\nHe returned to Los Angeles in 2004 to begin working on new material. In 2005 Jennings signed his first recording contract, with [[Universal South Records]], releasing his debut album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' that same year.\n\n\"Put the \"O\" Back in Country\" produced his only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in its lead-off single \"Fourth of July\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22. The album version of this song features a cameo appearance by George Jones, who sings the chorus to his signature song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" at the end; this guest appearance was removed from the song's radio edit. Despite the edit, Jones was credited on the Billboard charts. The album featured his new band The .357's, which consisted of Leroy Powell on guitar, Bryan Keeling on drums, [[Ted Russell Kamp|Ted Kamp]] on bass with [[Robby Turner]] on steel, and backing vocals by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].\n\nLater that year his song \"Busted In Baylor County\" was then featured in the 2005 film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', furthermore Jennings portrayed his father in the [[Johnny Cash]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Walk the Line]]'' alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]. His rendition of his father's song \"Long Way From Home\" was featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\n=== ''Electric Rodeo'' and ''The Wolf'' ===\nThough recorded before ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'', released on April 4, 2006,{{clarify|reason=is this the release date of Put the O Back in Country or the release date of Electric Rodeo?|date=April 2017}} ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' was released as Jennings's second solo album. Sonically, ''Electric Rodeo'' is louder, rawer, more upfront rock and roll than its predecessor.\n\n''Electric Rodeo'' was followed by ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' on October 23, 2007. The album varied from his previous records in that the .357s had opted for a decidedly 1970s feel to the instrumentals. It featured collaborations with [[Doug Kershaw]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], as well as a cover of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Walk of Life]]\".\n\nThat same year Jennings was featured on a duet of \"[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]\" on [[Deana Carter]]'s sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''.\n\n=== Departure from Universal ===\nIn 2009, Jennings, having issues with his label and wanting out of his four-album contract released his first compilation album, ''[[Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's]]''. The album featured four new tracks; live versions of \"Lonesome Blues\", and \"Daddy's Farm\", as well as covers of his father's \"Lonesome, Onry and Mean\", and the [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] song \"Living Proof\".\n\nAfter the release of ''Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's'', having fulfilled his four-album contract; Jennings parted ways with Universal records.\n\nOn March 23, 2009 Jennings took part in ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', a television show in which two musicians are paired with one another and perform a small concert together for an intimate crowd. The episode paired Jennings with close friend and fellow musician [[Jamey Johnson]]. The evening's set list consisted entirely of duets, including a cover of \"Outlaw Shit\" from the ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' album, two songs from Jennings' discography; \"God Bless Alabama\", \"It Ain't Easy\". As well as four songs from Johnson's album ''[[That Lonesome Song]]''; \"High Cost Of Living\", \"Mowing Down The Roses\", \"Between Jennings and Jones\" and \"In Color\".\n\n=== ''Black Ribbons'' ===\nHaving left Universal, Jennings changed the name of his backing band from The .357's to Hierophant. With the news that he and his band would be joining the likes of [[Paramore]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Jefree Star]], and various other popular rock bands on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]] it became apparent that Jennings next album would differ drastically from his previous efforts.\n\nIn February 2009, it was announced that the album would be titled ''[[Black Ribbons]]''. It was also announced that it would be a dystopian concept rock opera and that writer [[Stephen King]] would play a major role in the album as Will O' The Wisp.\n\nIt was released independently on March 2, 2010 through Black Country Rock Records, and although it was seen as a complete departure from his country sound, the album showed off the diversity as an artist and gained him much critical acclaim, as well as a brand new underground following.\n\nOn May 1, 2010, Jennings announced \"Black Ribbons: The Living Album\" on his Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShooterJennings |title=Shooter Jennings (ShooterJennings) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2014-06-03 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref> The \"Living Album\" includes the full studio record and live shows with [[Hierophant]] on a [[USB flash drive]] shaped like a tarot card.\nTowards the end of 2010, Jennings with the help of various other artists launched the \"XXX\" movement to help musicians who struggle to receive mainstream recognition.\n\n=== ''Family Man'' ===\nIn 2011, along with childhood friend and master pianist Erik Deutsch, Jennings formed The Triple Crown, a new backing band featuring Erik Deutsch on piano, Tony Leone on drums, Jeff Hill on bass, Jon Graboff on pedal steel, Eleanor Whitmore on fiddle and Chris Masterson on lead guitar.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, having signed a record deal with [[E1 Music]], and with The Triple Crown along for the ride, Jennings returned to his country roots with the release of the album ''Family Man'', his first self-produced outing. The album was originally meant to contain eighteen tracks, but was instead split into two albums: ''Family Man'' and 2013's ''The Other Life''.\n\nOn July 31, 2012 Jennings was featured in [[Bucky Covington]]'s debut single \"The Drinking Side of Country\" from the album ''Good Guys''.\n\nJennings took part in the February 25 Johnny Cash 80th Birthday Bash, in which he sang [[Cocaine Blues]] With [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Amy Nelson]]. The performance was released in a DVD/CD combo.\n\nIn October 2012 Jennings was one of six commentators for the Ovation mini-series ''Song By Song: Johnny Cash''.\n\n=== ''The Other Life'' ===\nWhile recording ''Family Man'', Jennings decided to cut the darker tracks from the album, and instead use them for the album's follow-up, ''The Other Life''.\n\n\"Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing ''Family Man'', and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records. ''The Other Life'' is representative of the other side of the coin from ''Family Man'' and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways, At first we were going to call it ''The Outsider'', but once we got into the film we thought, 'Well, it's like a mirror, a dark mirror of what ''Family Man'' was.'&thinsp;\" - Jennings told TheBoot.com.\n\nJennings premiered the track \"Wild & Lonesome\" (featuring [[Patti Griffin]]) on the 4th season of the FX original series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Followed by the release of first official single from the album \"The White Trash Song\" (featuring [[Scott H. Biram]]) which premiered on RollingStones.com along with the announcement that the album would be accompanied by a film.\n\nThe album featured seven new songs, as well as two cover songs ([[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"Flying Saucer song\" and [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s \"The White Trash song\") and \"Outlaw You\", which was put out in early 2012 as a digital release.\n\nJennings along with filmmaker Blake Judd released ''The Other Life'' film. Running at 32 minutes long, it utilizes six of the songs from the album as a sort of narration. The film is about a musician leaving his family to tour, but when he does so he finds the road is not the same, and becomes haunted by a mysterious woman. Throughout the film, the musician is forced to face his darker urges and deal with self-discovery, temptation, isolation and rebirth. The film closes with a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nThe Other Life went on to win Best Short Film at the 2013 Horror Hound Festival.\n\n=== Black Country Rock Media ===\n{{main|Black Country Rock Media}}\nOn October 2013, Jennings announced the formation of his new label and multi-format recording company, Black Country Rock. Their initial releases included: a remastered release of the [[Waylon Jennings]] album ''[[Right for the Time]]'', two live albums (one from [[Jessi Colter]] titled ''Live from Cain's Ballroom'', and one from Jennings titled ''The Other Live''), as well as a recording of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" featuring vocals from both [[Jamey Johnson]] and Jennings. All four were released on vinyl, cassette, CD, as well as digitally.\n\n=== ''The Magic'' ===\nOn February 27, 2014, Jennings revealed he would be releasing a spoken word follow-up to Hierophant's 2010 album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]'', titled ''The Magic'', inspired by first story in the controversially interactive horror series thirteen.\n\nIn addition to ''The Magic'' Jennings also announced, that after nearly a decade of waiting, he would be releasing the 1995 collaborative album,  ''Fenixon''.\n\nBoth projects were released during 2014's Record Store Day, and subsequently sold out.\n\n=== \"George/Giorgio\" releases ===\nTowards the end of May 2014, Jennings announced his intention to release two EP's later in the year. ''Don't Wait Up (for George)'' is a tribute to his close friend and mentor [[George Jones]], which was released in August 2014. Jennings' seventh studio album, ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'', was originally scheduled to be released in November 2014, but its release was delayed due to the sudden death of [[Jon Hensley (radio personality)|Jon Hensley]], Jennings' longtime manager and friend and Black Country Rock co-founder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-daft-punk-and-the-muppets-inspired-shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-6616503 |title=How Daft Punk and the Muppets Inspired Shooter Jennings' Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album |first=Daniel |last=Kohn |work=[[LA Weekly]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> A tribute to 1970s electronic-music pioneer and producer, [[Giorgio Moroder]], the album was released on February 26, 2016 and features guest vocals from [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6882805/shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-countach-david-bowie-interview |title=Shooter Jennings on Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album & How His David Bowie Cover 'Ended Up Meaning So Much More' |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Brandi Carlile]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/shooter-jennings-enlists-marilyn-manson-brandi-carlile-for-countach-20160104 |title=Shooter Jennings Enlists Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile for 'Countach' |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 4, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/02/marilyn-manson-covers-the-hell-out-of-david-bowies-cat-people-listen/ |title=Marilyn Manson covers the hell out of David Bowie's \"Cat People\" \u2014 listen |first=Ben |last=Kaye |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[Richard Garriott|Richard Garriott de Cayeux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/neon-noir-meets-outlaw-country-shooter-jennings-tr-230314 |title=Neon noir meets outlaw country in Shooter Jennings' tribute to Giorgio Moroder |first=Mike |last=Vanderbilt |work=[[The A.V.

Born in the [[Allegheny West (Pittsburgh)|Allegheny West]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]] and raised in [[Oakland, California]], Stein moved to [[Paris]] in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]], where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[Henri Matisse]], would meet.<ref name=\"brbl-archive.library.yale.edu\">{{cite web |title=Extravagant Crowd: Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas |access-date=October 16, 2012 |url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/cvvpw/gallery/steintoklas1.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'', written in the voice of [[Alice B. Toklas]], her [[life partner]]. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web |title=The Stein Salon Was The First Museum of Modern Art |access-date=October 13, 2012 |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-salon.html |last=Mellow |first=James R. |work=New York Times |date=May 3, 1998}}</ref> Two quotes from her works have become widely known: \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]],\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw Cf. Natias Neutert about Gertrude Stein's Rose]</ref> and \"[[there is no there there]]\", with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland.\n\nHer books include ''Q.E.D.'' (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein's friends; ''Fernhurst'', a fictional story about a [[love triangle]]; ''[[Three Lives (book)|Three Lives]]'' (1905\u201306); and ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1902\u20131911). In ''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'' (1914), Stein commented on lesbian sexuality.<ref name=\"Blackmer\"/>\n\nHer activities during [[World War II]] have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in [[Nazi-occupied France]], Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of the powerful [[Vichy government]] official and Nazi collaborator [[Bernard Fa\u00ff]]. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader [[Marshal P\u00e9tain]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:GertrudeSteinBirthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|Gertrude Stein's birthplace and childhood home in [[Allegheny West (Pittsburgh)|Allegheny West]]]]\nStein, the youngest of a family of five children, was born on February 3, 1874, in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]] (which merged with [[Pittsburgh]] in 1907), to upper-middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] parents, Daniel and Amelia Stein.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/stein/bio.htm\n| title = Stein's Life and Career\n| website = www.english.illinois.edu\n| access-date = 2016-02-27\n| last = Wagner-Martin\n| first = Linda\n}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book\n| title = Notable American Women 1607\u20131950: A Biographical Dictionary\n| last = James\n| first = Edward T.\n| publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press\n| year = 1974\n| isbn = 978-0-674-62731-4\n| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts\n| pages = 356\n}}</ref> Her father was a wealthy businessman with real estate holdings.

In 1934, behavioral psychologist [[B.F.

Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in ''Things As They Are'', 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as \"Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Stein-gertrude |encyclopedia=Jewish Women Encyclopedia |last=Simon |first=Linda |title=Gertrude Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |magazine=Style Magazine |last=Rudacille |first=Deborah |title=Baltimore Blues |access-date=October 17, 2012 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528023126/http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |archive-date=May 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's \"controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty\" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAsked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled \"The Value of College Education for Women\", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:\n\n{{quote|\"average middle class woman [supported by] some male relative, a husband or father or brother,...[is] not worth her keep economically considered.

Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with [[Mary Bookstaver]] who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her \"erotic awakening\". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In 1902 Stein's brother [[Leo Stein]] left for [[London]], and Stein followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.<ref name=\"poetryfoundation\"/>\n\n==Art collection==\n[[File:Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpg|thumb|left|Gertrude and Leo Stein bought [[Henri Matisse]]'s, ''[[Woman with a Hat]]'', 1905, a portrait of the artist's wife, Amelia, now in the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]]]\n\n[[File:Leo, Gertrude, Michael Stein.jpg|thumb|Leo, Gertrude, and Michael Stein]]\nFrom 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the [[Luxembourg Gardens]] on the [[Left Bank]] of Paris in a two-story apartment (with adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at [[27 rue de Fleurus]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.\n\nThe gallery space was furnished with imposing [[Renaissance]]-era furniture from [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The paintings lined the walls in tiers trailing many feet to the ceiling. Initially illuminated by gaslight, the artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to [[World War I]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nLeo Stein cultivated important art world connections, enabling the Stein holdings to grow over time.

Where [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude's collection, the collection of Michael and [[Sarah Stein]] emphasized [[Matisse]].<ref>[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 28.</ref> In April 1914 Leo relocated to [[Settignano|Settignano, Italy, near Florence]], and the art collection was divided. The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:\n\n{{quote |The C\u00e9zanne apples have a unique importance to me that nothing can replace. The Picasso landscape is not important in any such sense. We are, as it seems to me on the whole, both so well off now that we needn't repine. The C\u00e9zannes had to be divided. I am willing to leave you the Picasso oeuvre, as you left me the Renoir, and you can have everything except that. I want to keep the few drawings that I have. This leaves no string for me, it is financially equable either way for estimates are only rough & ready methods, & I'm afraid you'll have to look upon the loss of the apples as an act of God. I have been anxious above all things that each should have in reason all that he wanted, and just as I was glad that Renoir was sufficiently indifferent to you so that you were ready to give them up, so I am glad that Pablo is sufficiently indifferent to me that I am willing to let you have all you want of it.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 207\u20138.</ref><ref>An image of \"the C\u00e9zanne apples\" appears in [[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], plate 19.</ref>}}\n\nLeo departed with sixteen Renoirs, and relinquishing the Picassos and most of Matisse to his sister, took only a portrait sketch Picasso had done of him. He remained dedicated to C\u00e9zanne, nonetheless, leaving all the artist's works with his sister, taking with him only a C\u00e9zanne painting of \"5 apples\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The split between brother and sister was acrimonious. Stein did not see Leo Stein again until after [[World War I]], and then through only a brief greeting on the street in Paris. After this accidental encounter, they never saw or spoke to each other again.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Steins' holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-family.html ''The Family Knew What It Liked'']. ''The New York Times'', 3 May 1998.</ref>\nAfter Stein's and Leo's households separated in 1914, she continued to collect examples of Picasso's art, which had turned to [[Cubism]], a style Leo did not appreciate. At her death, Gertrude's remaining collection emphasized the artwork of Picasso and [[Juan Gris]], most of her other pictures having been sold.<ref name=\"MoMA\">[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]]</ref>\n\nGertrude Stein's personality has dominated the provenance of the Stein art legacy. It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], said that between the years of 1905 and 1907, \"[Leo] was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of 20th century painting in the world.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and Her Family |author=Linda Wagner-Martin |page=67 |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2uyupUrgNkC&pg=PA67 |isbn=978-0-8135-2474-0 }}</ref> After the artworks were divided between the two Stein siblings, it was Gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the 1930s. She concentrated on the work of [[Juan Gris]], [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], and Sir [[Francis Cyril Rose|Francis Rose]]. In 1932, Stein asserted: \"painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nIn 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter [[Francisco Riba Rovira]] (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:<blockquote>I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what C\u00e9zanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that C\u00e9zanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.\n\nThe only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which C\u00e9zanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what C\u00e9zanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.<ref>Gertrude Stein. \"A la recherche d'un jeune peintre\", revue ''Fontaine'' no. 42, pp. 287\u2013288, 1945</ref><ref>Gertrude Stein. \"Looking for a young painter\" (Riba-Rovira) Yale University U.S.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon==\n[[File:Plaque Gertrude Stein, 27 rue de Fleurus, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[27 rue de Fleurus]]]]\nThe gatherings in the Stein home \"brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art\".

It was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room.\n\nGertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of C\u00e9zanne: \"Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 84.</ref>\n\nAmong Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]] (artist), [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] (artist), [[Max Jacob]] (poet), [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (poet), [[Marie Laurencin]] (artist, and Apollinaire's mistress), [[Henri Rousseau]] (painter), and [[Joseph Stella]].<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nHemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway \"yellow\" in ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.''<ref name=\":0\" /> Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child.<ref name=\"Meyers1\">Meyers, Jeffrey - ''Hemingway: A Biography'', Macmillan, New York, 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-333-42126-0}}</ref> While Stein has been credited with inventing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 273\u20134.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer [[Paul Bowles]] to go to [[Tangier]], where she and Alice had vacationed.\n\n==Literary style==\n[[File:Gertrude stein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Van Vechten]], ''Portrait of Gertrude Stein'', 1934]]\nStein's writing can be placed in three categories: \"hermetic\" works best illustrated by ''[[The Making of Americans]]: The Hersland Family''; popularized writing such as ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which ''[[Brewsie and Willie]]'' is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, [[libretti]] and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]\"; \"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle\"; about her childhood home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], \"There is no there there\"; and \"The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.\"\n\nThese [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as [[Cubism]], plasticity, and [[collage]]. Many of the experimental works such as ''Tender Buttons'' have since been interpreted by critics as a [[feminist]] reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on \"[[automatic writing]]\" with [[William James]], she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThough Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of [[C\u00e9zanne]]. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: \"the whole field of the canvas is important\" (p.&nbsp;8{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, \"Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.\" It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: \"The important thing is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.\"\n\nHer use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the \"bottom nature\" of her characters, such as in ''The Making of Americans'' where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as \"As I was saying\" and \"There will be now a history of her.\" Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with \"too much association\". Social judgment is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nStein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous present in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes \"play\" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: \"rather than the [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses ''play''.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 18.</ref> In addition Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly Grahn argues that one must \"''inster''stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 21.</ref> In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of ''The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook'', which was written by Toklas.\n\nSeveral of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including [[Virgil Thomson]]'s operas ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' and ''The Mother of Us All'', and [[James Tenney]]'s setting of ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose'' as a [[canon (music)|canon]] dedicated to [[Philip Corner]], beginning with \"a\" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. \"a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.\"\n\n==Literary career==\n[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Portrait of Gertrude Stein]]'', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.

Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was ''[[Three Lives (book)|Three Lives]]''. In 1911, [[Mildred Aldrich]] introduced Stein to [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.\n\nMabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication ''The Makings of Americans'' and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of ''Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia''.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/> Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Regiment]] [[Armory Show]] in 1913, \"the first avant-garde art exhibition in America\".<ref name=\"MoMA\"/>\n\nIn addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in \"Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose\", published in a special March 1913 publication of ''Arts and Decoration''.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\">[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 170.</ref> Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in \"Speculations\":\n\n{{quote |In Gertrude Stein's writing every word lives and, apart from concept, it is so exquisitely rhythmical and cadenced that if we read it aloud and receive it as pure sound, it is like a kind of sensuous music. Just as one may stop, for once, in a way, before a canvas of Picasso, and, letting one's reason sleep for an instant, may exclaim: \"It ''is'' a fine pattern!\" so, listening to Gertrude Stein's words and forgetting to try to understand what they mean, one submits to their gradual charm.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\"/>}}\n\nStein and [[Carl Van Vechten]], the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was \"Papa Woojums\", and Stein, \"Baby Woojums\". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.<ref name=\"brbl-archive.library.yale.edu\"/>\n\n===America (1934\u20131935)===\nIn October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in [[Times Square]] announced to all that \"Gertrude Stein Has Arrived\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-gertrude-stein-toured-america-105320781/ |title=When Gertrude Stein Toured America |date=October 14, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref> Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nStein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that \"Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures.\" Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a [[speech disorder]], [[palilalia]], which caused her \"to stutter over words and phrases\". The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who had the ability to hold listeners with the \"musicality of her language\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nIn Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President's wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In [[Beverly Hills]], California, she visited actor and filmmaker [[Charlie Chaplin]], who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from [[Random House]], who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref>[[#Jaillant|Jaillant (2015)]]</ref> The ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' wrote after Stein's return to Paris: \"No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\n===Books===\n====''Q.E.D''.====\nStein completed ''Q.E.D.'', her first novel, on October 24, 1903.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 53\u201358.</ref> One of the earliest [[coming out]] stories,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baughman|first1=Judith|title=Gertrude Stein|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=true&displayGroupName=Biographies&currPage=&scanId=&query=&source=&prodId=BIC1&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&mode=view&catId=&u=loym48904&limiter=&display-query=&displayGroups=&contentModules=&action=e&sortBy=&documentId=GALE%7CK1602000898&windowstate=normal&activityType=&failOverType=&commentary=true|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and [[Mary Bookstaver]], and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore.<ref name=\"Blackmer 1995 pp. 681\">[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]], pp. 681\u20136.</ref> <!-- This story is discussed more completely later in this article in the section on \"Lesbian relationships\". -->\n\n====''Fernhurst'' (1904)====\nIn 1904 Stein began ''Fernhurst'', a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean ([[M.

She credited this as a [[Revelation|revelatory moment]] in the evolution of her writing style. Stein described:\n\n{{cquote| that the stylistic method of ''(Three Lives)'' had been influenced by the C\u00e9zanne portrait under which she sat writing. The portrait of Madame C\u00e9zanne is one of the monumental examples of the artist's method, each exacting, carefully negotiated plane\u2014from the suave reds of the armchair and the gray blues of the sitter's jacket to the vaguely figured wallpaper of the background\u2014having been structured into existence, seeming to fix the subject for all eternity.

Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of ''Three Lives'', to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain.

Stein is credited with bringing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" into use.]]\nDuring the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass market publication of ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''. She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the [[Ain]] district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named \"Basket\" whose successor, \"Basket II\", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, [[Ain]], in the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] region. Gertrude and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to [[Bernard Fa\u00ff]] who was a collaborator with the [[Vichy regime]] and had connections to the [[Gestapo]], or possibly because Gertrude was an American and a famous author. Gertrude's book \"Wars I Have Seen\" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to [[Keystone cops]]. When Fa\u00ff was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Gertrude and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Fa\u00ff's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in [[Berchtesgaden]]. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: \"Off We All Went To See Germany.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103918/barbara-will-gertrude-stein-christopher-benfey |work=The New Republic |last=Benfey |first=Christopher |title=The Alibi of Ambiguity |date=June 28, 2012 |access-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, a cabinet in the [[Yale University]] [[Beinecke Library]], which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was \"Baby Precious\", in turn Stein was for Toklas, \"Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle\".<ref name=\"poetryfoundation\" />\n\n===Lesbian relationships===\nStein is the author of one of the earliest [[coming out]] stories, \"''Q.E.D.''\" (published in 1950 as ''Things as They Are''), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of [[romantic friendship]] as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested \"passion in its many disguised forms\". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with [[Mary Bookstaver]] (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.<ref name=\"Blackmer 1995 pp. 681\"/>\n\nStein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of [[Otto Weininger]]'s ''Sex and Character'' (1906). Weininger, though [[Jewish]] by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.<ref name=Ramsay>Ramsay, Tamara Ann (1998).

It appears in ''Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). \n\nStein wrote:\n\n{{quote |She took us to see her granddaughter who was teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael, we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not changed but Goat Island might just as well not have been there, anyway what was the use of my having come from Oakland it was not natural to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if I like but not there, there is no there there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stefan Metaal |url=http://members.chello.nl/smetaal/usu1.htm |title=No There there |publisher=Members.chello.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n...but not there, there is no there there. ...

There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance.

She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the [[industrial revolution]] had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline.

Stein had met Fa\u00ff in 1926, and he became her \"dearest friend during her life\", according to Alice B. Toklas. Fa\u00ff had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933\u201334 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, ''The Autobiography of Alice B.

In her introduction, Stein crafts an analogy between [[George Washington]] and P\u00e9tain. She writes of the high esteem in which P\u00e9tain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler.

Accustomed to a life of entitlement since birth, Stein may have been convinced her wealth and notoriety would exempt her from what had befallen other European Jews. In an essay written for the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in November, 1940, Stein had written about her decision not to leave France: \"it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food.\" Stein continued to praise P\u00e9tain after the war ended, this at a time when P\u00e9tain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAuthor [[Djuna Barnes]] provided a caustic assessment of Stein's book, ''Wars I Have Seen'':\n\n:\"You do not feel that she [Stein] is ever really worried about the sorrows of the people.

Writing in the June 2005 edition of ''The New Yorker'', Janet Malcolm describes:\n{{quote |On July 27, 1946, Stein was operated on for what proved to be inoperable stomach cancer and died before coming out of anesthesia.  In \"What Is Remembered,\" Toklas wrote of the \"troubled, confused and very uncertain\" afternoon of the surgery. \"I sat next to her and she said to me early in the afternoon, What is the answer? I was silent. In that case, she said, what is the question?\" However, in a letter to Van Vechten ten years earlier, Toklas had written:\n{{quote |About Baby's last words. She said upon waking from a sleep--What is the question. And I didn't answer thinking she was not completely awakened. Then she said again--What is the question and before I could speak she went on--If there is no question then there is no answer.}}\n\nStein's biographers have naturally selected the superior \"in that case what is the question?\" version. Strong narratives win out over weak ones when no obstacle of factuality stands in their way. What Stein actually said remains unknown. That Toklas cited the lesser version in a letter of 1953 is suggestive but not conclusive.<ref>Malcolm, Janet, \"Someone Says Yes to It,\" ''The New Yorker'' 81/17 (June 13, 2005): 148</ref>}} Stein named writer and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]] as her [[literary executor]], and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Here is one artist who has been able to accept ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half forgotten city.}}\n\nIn a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, \"As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.{{Sfn | Mellow | 1974 | p = 260}}\"\n\nOther critics took a more negative view of Stein's work. F. W. Dupee (1990, p.&nbsp;IX) defines \"Steinese\" as \"gnomic, repetitive, illogical, sparsely punctuated... a scandal and a delight, lending itself equally to derisory parody and fierce denunciation\".\n\nComposer Constant Lambert (1936) compares Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" in ''L'Histoire du Soldat'' to Gertrude Stein's in \"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\" (1922), specifically: \"[E]veryday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday.\" He writes that the \"effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\", apparently missing the pun frequently employed by Stein.\n\n[[James Thurber]] wrote:\n{{quote |Anyone who reads at all diversely during these bizarre 1920s cannot escape the conclusion that a number of crazy men and women are writing stuff which remarkably passes for important composition among certain persons who should know better. Stuart P. Sherman, however, refused to be numbered among those who stand in awe and admiration of one of the most eminent of the idiots, Gertrude Stein. He reviews her ''Geography and Plays'' in the August 11 issue of the ''Literary Review'' of the ''New York Evening Post'' and arrives at the conviction that it is a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all.<ref>{{Citation | first = James | last = Thurber | author-link = James Thurber | title = Collecting Himself | editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Rosen}}</ref>}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''\"The interesting writer is where there is an adversary, a problem.

Wilson deemed that Stein's technique was one of flawed methodology, using words analogous to the way [[Cubists]] manipulated abstract forms in their artworks. As Wilson wrote, unlike the [[plastic arts]], literature deals with\n\n:\"human speech [which] is a tissue of ideas.&nbsp;...

Born in the [[Allegheny West (Pittsburgh)|Allegheny West]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]] and raised in [[Oakland, California]], Stein moved to [[Paris]] in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]], where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F.

Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in ''Things As They Are'', 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as \"Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Stein-gertrude |encyclopedia=Jewish Women Encyclopedia |last=Simon |first=Linda |title=Gertrude Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |magazine=Style Magazine |last=Rudacille |first=Deborah |title=Baltimore Blues |access-date=October 17, 2012 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528023126/http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |archive-date=May 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's \"controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty\" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAsked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled \"The Value of College Education for Women\", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:\n\n{{quote|\"average middle class woman [supported by] some male relative, a husband or father or brother,...[is] not worth her keep economically considered.

Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with [[Mary Bookstaver]] who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her \"erotic awakening\". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In 1902 Stein's brother [[Leo Stein]] left for [[London]], and Stein followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.<ref name=\"poetryfoundation\"/>\n\n==Art collection==\n[[File:Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpg|thumb|left|Gertrude and Leo Stein bought [[Henri Matisse]]'s, ''[[Woman with a Hat]]'', 1905, a portrait of the artist's wife, Amelia, now in the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]]]\n\n[[File:Leo, Gertrude, Michael Stein.jpg|thumb|Leo, Gertrude, and Michael Stein]]\nFrom 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the [[Luxembourg Gardens]] on the [[Left Bank]] of Paris in a two-story apartment (with adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at [[27 rue de Fleurus]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.\n\nThe gallery space was furnished with imposing [[Renaissance]]-era furniture from [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:\n\n{{quote |The C\u00e9zanne apples have a unique importance to me that nothing can replace.

It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser.

When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that C\u00e9zanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.\n\nThe only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which C\u00e9zanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what C\u00e9zanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.<ref>Gertrude Stein. \"A la recherche d'un jeune peintre\", revue ''Fontaine'' no. 42, pp. 287\u2013288, 1945</ref><ref>Gertrude Stein. \"Looking for a young painter\" (Riba-Rovira) Yale University U.S.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon==\n[[File:Plaque Gertrude Stein, 27 rue de Fleurus, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[27 rue de Fleurus]]]]\nThe gatherings in the Stein home \"brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art\". Dedicated attendees included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Gavin Williamson (harpsichordist)|Gavin Williamson]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Francis Cyril Rose]], [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]], [[\u00c9lisabeth de Gramont]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Claribel Cone]], [[Mildred Aldrich]], [[Jane Peterson]], [[Carl Van Vechten]] and [[Henri Matisse]].<ref name=\"brbl-archive.library.yale.edu\"/> Saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so Stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors. It was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room.\n\nGertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of C\u00e9zanne: \"Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 84.</ref>\n\nAmong Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]] (artist), [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] (artist), [[Max Jacob]] (poet), [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (poet), [[Marie Laurencin]] (artist, and Apollinaire's mistress), [[Henri Rousseau]] (painter), and [[Joseph Stella]].<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nHemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway \"yellow\" in ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.''<ref name=\":0\" /> Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child.<ref name=\"Meyers1\">Meyers, Jeffrey - ''Hemingway: A Biography'', Macmillan, New York, 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-333-42126-0}}</ref> While Stein has been credited with inventing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 273\u20134.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer [[Paul Bowles]] to go to [[Tangier]], where she and Alice had vacationed.\n\n==Literary style==\n[[File:Gertrude stein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Van Vechten]], ''Portrait of Gertrude Stein'', 1934]]\nStein's writing can be placed in three categories: \"hermetic\" works best illustrated by ''[[The Making of Americans]]: The Hersland Family''; popularized writing such as ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which ''[[Brewsie and Willie]]'' is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, [[libretti]] and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]\"; \"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle\"; about her childhood home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], \"There is no there there\"; and \"The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.\"\n\nThese [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as [[Cubism]], plasticity, and [[collage]]. Many of the experimental works such as ''Tender Buttons'' have since been interpreted by critics as a [[feminist]] reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on \"[[automatic writing]]\" with [[William James]], she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThough Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of [[C\u00e9zanne]]. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: \"the whole field of the canvas is important\" (p.&nbsp;8{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, \"Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.\" It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: \"The important thing is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.\"\n\nHer use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the \"bottom nature\" of her characters, such as in ''The Making of Americans'' where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as \"As I was saying\" and \"There will be now a history of her.\" Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with \"too much association\". Social judgment is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nStein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous present in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes \"play\" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: \"rather than the [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses ''play''.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 18.</ref> In addition Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly Grahn argues that one must \"''inster''stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 21.</ref> In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of ''The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook'', which was written by Toklas.\n\nSeveral of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including [[Virgil Thomson]]'s operas ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' and ''The Mother of Us All'', and [[James Tenney]]'s setting of ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose'' as a [[canon (music)|canon]] dedicated to [[Philip Corner]], beginning with \"a\" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. \"a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.\"\n\n==Literary career==\n[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Portrait of Gertrude Stein]]'', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.

Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was ''[[Three Lives (book)|Three Lives]]''. In 1911, [[Mildred Aldrich]] introduced Stein to [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.\n\nMabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication ''The Makings of Americans'' and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of ''Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia''.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/> Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Regiment]] [[Armory Show]] in 1913, \"the first avant-garde art exhibition in America\".<ref name=\"MoMA\"/>\n\nIn addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in \"Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose\", published in a special March 1913 publication of ''Arts and Decoration''.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\">[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 170.</ref> Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in \"Speculations\":\n\n{{quote |In Gertrude Stein's writing every word lives and, apart from concept, it is so exquisitely rhythmical and cadenced that if we read it aloud and receive it as pure sound, it is like a kind of sensuous music. Just as one may stop, for once, in a way, before a canvas of Picasso, and, letting one's reason sleep for an instant, may exclaim: \"It ''is'' a fine pattern!\" so, listening to Gertrude Stein's words and forgetting to try to understand what they mean, one submits to their gradual charm.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\"/>}}\n\nStein and [[Carl Van Vechten]], the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was \"Papa Woojums\", and Stein, \"Baby Woojums\". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.<ref name=\"brbl-archive.library.yale.edu\"/>\n\n===America (1934\u20131935)===\nIn October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in [[Times Square]] announced to all that \"Gertrude Stein Has Arrived\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-gertrude-stein-toured-america-105320781/ |title=When Gertrude Stein Toured America |date=October 14, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref> Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nStein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that \"Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures.\" Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a [[speech disorder]], [[palilalia]], which caused her \"to stutter over words and phrases\". The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who had the ability to hold listeners with the \"musicality of her language\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nIn Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President's wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In [[Beverly Hills]], California, she visited actor and filmmaker [[Charlie Chaplin]], who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from [[Random House]], who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref>[[#Jaillant|Jaillant (2015)]]</ref> The ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' wrote after Stein's return to Paris: \"No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\n===Books===\n====''Q.E.D''.====\nStein completed ''Q.E.D.'', her first novel, on October 24, 1903.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 53\u201358.</ref> One of the earliest [[coming out]] stories,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baughman|first1=Judith|title=Gertrude Stein|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=true&displayGroupName=Biographies&currPage=&scanId=&query=&source=&prodId=BIC1&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&mode=view&catId=&u=loym48904&limiter=&display-query=&displayGroups=&contentModules=&action=e&sortBy=&documentId=GALE%7CK1602000898&windowstate=normal&activityType=&failOverType=&commentary=true|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and [[Mary Bookstaver]], and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore.<ref name=\"Blackmer 1995 pp. 681\">[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]], pp. 681\u20136.</ref> <!-- This story is discussed more completely later in this article in the section on \"Lesbian relationships\". -->\n\n====''Fernhurst'' (1904)====\nIn 1904 Stein began ''Fernhurst'', a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean ([[M.

Stein described:\n\n{{cquote| that the stylistic method of ''(Three Lives)'' had been influenced by the C\u00e9zanne portrait under which she sat writing. The portrait of Madame C\u00e9zanne is one of the monumental examples of the artist's method, each exacting, carefully negotiated plane\u2014from the suave reds of the armchair and the gray blues of the sitter's jacket to the vaguely figured wallpaper of the background\u2014having been structured into existence, seeming to fix the subject for all eternity.

Soon after she purchased them from [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s gallery,<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 209.</ref> the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of ''Three Lives'', to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 210\u20135.</ref> When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in England.

Stein is credited with bringing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" into use.]]\nDuring the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass market publication of ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''. She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the [[Ain]] district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named \"Basket\" whose successor, \"Basket II\", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, [[Ain]], in the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] region. Gertrude and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to [[Bernard Fa\u00ff]] who was a collaborator with the [[Vichy regime]] and had connections to the [[Gestapo]], or possibly because Gertrude was an American and a famous author. Gertrude's book \"Wars I Have Seen\" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to [[Keystone cops]]. When Fa\u00ff was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Gertrude and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Fa\u00ff's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in [[Berchtesgaden]]. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: \"Off We All Went To See Germany.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103918/barbara-will-gertrude-stein-christopher-benfey |work=The New Republic |last=Benfey |first=Christopher |title=The Alibi of Ambiguity |date=June 28, 2012 |access-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, a cabinet in the [[Yale University]] [[Beinecke Library]], which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was \"Baby Precious\", in turn Stein was for Toklas, \"Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle\".<ref name=\"poetryfoundation\" />\n\n===Lesbian relationships===\nStein is the author of one of the earliest [[coming out]] stories, \"''Q.E.D.''\" (published in 1950 as ''Things as They Are''), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of [[romantic friendship]] as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested \"passion in its many disguised forms\". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with [[Mary Bookstaver]] (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.<ref name=\"Blackmer 1995 pp. 681\"/>\n\nStein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of [[Otto Weininger]]'s ''Sex and Character'' (1906). Weininger, though [[Jewish]] by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.<ref name=Ramsay>Ramsay, Tamara Ann (1998).

Toklas]]. [[Ernest Hemingway]] describes how Alice was Gertrude's \"wife\" in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway's) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two \"wives\" to chat.<ref name=\"Grahn\">[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]]</ref>\n\nThe more affirming essay \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\" is one of the first [[lesbian literature|homosexual revelation stories]] to be published. The work, like ''Q.E.D.'', is informed by Stein's growing involvement with a homosexual community,<ref name=\"Grahn\"/> though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars.<ref name=\"Blackmer\">[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]]</ref> The work contains the word \"[[gay]]\" over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word \"gay\" in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them,<ref name = \"Blackmer\" /> and, thus, uninformed readers missed the lesbian content. A similar essay of homosexual men begins more obviously with the line \"Sometimes men are kissing\" but is less well known.<ref name=\"Blackmer\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Tender buttons: objects, food, rooms|Tender Buttons]]'' Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with \"highly condensed layers of public and private meanings\" created by wordplay including puns on the words \"box\", \"cow\", and in titles such as \"tender buttons\".<ref name=\"Blackmer\"/>\n\n{{anchor|nothere}}\n\n==\"There is no there there\"==\nAlong with Stein's widely known \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]\"<ref>Cf. Natias Neutert about Gertrude Stein's Rose\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw</ref> quotation, \"there is no there there\" is also one of her most famous. It appears in ''Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). \n\nStein wrote:\n\n{{quote |She took us to see her granddaughter who was teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael, we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not changed but Goat Island might just as well not have been there, anyway what was the use of my having come from Oakland it was not natural to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if I like but not there, there is no there there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stefan Metaal |url=http://members.chello.nl/smetaal/usu1.htm |title=No There there |publisher=Members.chello.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n...but not there, there is no there there. ...

When you live there you know it so well that it is like an identity a thing that is so much a thing that it could not ever be any other thing and then you live somewhere else and years later, the address that was so much an address that it was like your name and you said it as if it was not an address but something that was living and then years after you do not know what the address was and when you say it is not a name anymore but something you cannot remember.

We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant. The French may not like the competition of foreigners, but they let them in. They accept the challenge and derive the stimulus.

She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the [[industrial revolution]] had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline. Stein idealized the 18th century as the golden age of civilization, epitomized in America as the era of its founding fathers and what was in France, the glory of its pre-revolutionary [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last=Will |first=Barbara |journal=Humanities |title=The Strange Politics of Gertrude Stein |date=March\u2013April 2012 |volume=33 |number=2 |access-date=October 14, 2012 |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/marchapril/feature/the-strange-politics-gertrude-stein}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/gertrude-stein-why-her-fascist-politics-matter/ |last=Herschthal |first=Eric |title=Gertrude Stein: Why Her Fascist Politics Matter |work=The Jewish Week |date=April 24, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522043309/http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/gertrude-stein-why-her-fascist-politics-matter/ |archive-date=May 22, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the same time, she was pro-immigrant, pro-democratic, and anti-patriarchal.<ref>Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno, ''\"Courage to Be Courageous\": The Last Works and Days of Gertrude Stein'', from ''The Continual Pilgrimage: American Writers in Paris, 1944\u20131960''Grove Presm 1992</ref> Her last major work was the [[libretto]] of the feminist opera ''[[The Mother of Us All]]'' (1947) about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time, ''Brewsie and Willie'' (1946), expressed strong support for American G.I.s.\n\nA compendium of source material confirms that Stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful [[Vichy government]] official [[Bernard Fa\u00ff]]. Stein had met Fa\u00ff in 1926, and he became her \"dearest friend during her life\", according to Alice B. Toklas. Fa\u00ff had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933\u201334 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, ''The Autobiography of Alice B.

She writes of the high esteem in which P\u00e9tain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler.

Then she said again--What is the question and before I could speak she went on--If there is no question then there is no answer.}}\n\nStein's biographers have naturally selected the superior \"in that case what is the question?\" version. Strong narratives win out over weak ones when no obstacle of factuality stands in their way. What Stein actually said remains unknown. That Toklas cited the lesser version in a letter of 1953 is suggestive but not conclusive.<ref>Malcolm, Janet, \"Someone Says Yes to It,\" ''The New Yorker'' 81/17 (June 13, 2005): 148</ref>}} Stein named writer and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]] as her [[literary executor]], and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Here is one artist who has been able to accept ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half forgotten city.}}\n\nIn a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, \"As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.{{Sfn | Mellow | 1974 | p = 260}}\"\n\nOther critics took a more negative view of Stein's work. F. W. Dupee (1990, p.&nbsp;IX) defines \"Steinese\" as \"gnomic, repetitive, illogical, sparsely punctuated... a scandal and a delight, lending itself equally to derisory parody and fierce denunciation\".\n\nComposer Constant Lambert (1936) compares Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" in ''L'Histoire du Soldat'' to Gertrude Stein's in \"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\" (1922), specifically: \"[E]veryday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday.\" He writes that the \"effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\", apparently missing the pun frequently employed by Stein.\n\n[[James Thurber]] wrote:\n{{quote |Anyone who reads at all diversely during these bizarre 1920s cannot escape the conclusion that a number of crazy men and women are writing stuff which remarkably passes for important composition among certain persons who should know better. Stuart P. Sherman, however, refused to be numbered among those who stand in awe and admiration of one of the most eminent of the idiots, Gertrude Stein. He reviews her ''Geography and Plays'' in the August 11 issue of the ''Literary Review'' of the ''New York Evening Post'' and arrives at the conviction that it is a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all.<ref>{{Citation | first = James | last = Thurber | author-link = James Thurber | title = Collecting Himself | editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Rosen}}</ref>}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''\"The interesting writer is where there is an adversary, a problem.

Wilson deemed that Stein's technique was one of flawed methodology, using words analogous to the way [[Cubists]] manipulated abstract forms in their artworks. As Wilson wrote, unlike the [[plastic arts]], literature deals with\n\n:\"human speech [which] is a tissue of ideas.&nbsp;... Miss Stein no longer understands the conditions under which literary effects have to be produced&nbsp;... There is sometimes genuine music in the most baffling of her works, but there are rarely any communicated emotions.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879\">Wilson, Edmund, \"A Guide to Gertrude Stein\", ''Vanity Fair'', September 1923, ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s & 1930s'', Library of America, 2007, p. 878\u2013879</ref>\n\nAn elevated observer, perched high above everything below, he likened Stein to a self-conceived \"[[Buddha]]...registering impressions like some august seismograph\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879\"/>\n\nStein's literary output was a subject of amusement for her brother Leo Stein, who characterized her writing as an \"abomination\". Later detractors of Stein's work deemed her experimentation as the serendipitous result of her alleged inability to communicate through linguistic convention, deficient in the skills required \"to deal effectively with language, so that she made her greatest weakness into her most remarkable strength\".<ref name=\"Benstock, Shari 1987\"/>\n\nIn his 1938 biographical novel ''[[The Green Fool]],'' Irish poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]] describes the works of Gertrude Stein fondly as being \"like whisky to me; her strange rhythms broke up the clich\u00e9 formation of my thought.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kavanagh|first=Patrick|title=The Green Fool|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1975|isbn=0-14-004005-6|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|pages=244}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and commemoration==\nStein has been the subject of many artistic works.\n\nIn the 1998 Latin American literary classic ''Yo-Yo Boing!'', novelist [[Giannina Braschi]] pays homage to Stein as an imaginary mentor.\n\nIn 2005, playwright/actor [[Jade Esteban Estrada]] portrayed Stein in the solo musical ''ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1'' at [[Princeton University]].

These indigenous peoples have been more commonly recognized as the Yami people, following Japanese anthropologist [[Torii Ry\u016bz\u014d|Torii Ryuzo's]] coining of the name. However, as a collective, these Orchid Island inhabitants typically prefer \"Tao people\" as their group identifier. They are part of the Austronesian family, and designated members of the [[Taiwanese aborigines]]. Despite being linked to both indigenous Taiwanese and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] populations, the Tao people remain unique in their customs and cultural practices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dmtip.gov.tw/web/en/page/detail?nid=12|title=Tao|last=|first=|date=|website=Digital Museum of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nComposed of approximately 3,100 individuals, the island populace relies heavily on fishing for survival.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/254746735/|title = Surviving on Lanyu Island|last = Jennings|first = Ralph|date = June 2, 2007|work = The Windsor Star|access-date = April 2, 2015}}</ref> The Tao people's emphasis on fishing and ocean culture reflects their intense connection to the sea as being about much more than survival; they use fishing and the building of boats as an extension of themselves, and as a way to honor their spiritual beliefs. Their ways of life have been threatened by the continued emigration to the mainland of Taiwan in search of jobs and education. As a result, the continuation of past traditions has been hindered.\n\nCiting threats to their cultures and health concerns, the Tao people have been protesting the nuclear waste plant imposed on their island by the government in 1982 and advocating for its removal.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url = http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/31/taiwan-nuclear-waste-on-orchid-island/|title = Taiwan: Nuclear Waste on Orchid Island|date = March 31, 2011|accessdate = April 3, 2015|website = Global Voices|publisher = |last = Lin|first = I-fan}}</ref> \n\n== Origin ==\nThe origin of the Tao people is largely unknown.

Instead, their belief system is intermixed with components of Christianity and remnants of their beliefs past. Today, many Tao people have converted to a Christianity (especially branches of Catholicism and Protestantism).<ref name=\":0\" /> However, much of their traditional Christian ideologies are muddied with adherence to ancient superstitions. The Tao people greatly fear [[anito]], the collection of evil spirits, even more than they worship an omnipotent God.<ref name=\":1\" /> They believe that when an individual passes away, his or her soul travels to Malavang a Pongso, the White Island, while the rest of the minor souls from within become anito. As a result of this belief, they have an uncontrollable fear of the dead.<ref name=\":0\" /> When a Tao individual is near death, relatives and friends stand beside his or her deathbed in full battle regalia in order to fight off evil spirits. Once the funeral has commenced, attendees catch crab and fish to be cooked and eaten on that day in remembrance of the deceased.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere is no specific ceremony for the entrance into adulthood. A boy is considered an adult when he reaches the ages of 18 or 19, while a girl is considered an adult when she turns 16 or 17.<ref name=\":1\" /> A Tao man is deemed eligible for marriage when he participates in a fishing team, and can accomplish his fishing duties on his own. For women, they have to be proficient at [[taro]] cultivation and fabric weaving. Once the two parties are of marrying capabilities, relatives of both families formally propose to the woman's parents through the giving of presents. If her parents accept these offerings, they equivocally accept the proposal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Fishing and Ceremony ===\nThe Tao peoples divide their year into three separate fishing seasons: rayon, teyteyka, and amyan. Rayon is equivalent to spring, and spans from February to May. This is considered to be flying fish season, during which the men catch fish for ceremonial use. Teyteyka lasts from June to October, and signifies the end of the period of time in which flying fish can be caught on the surface. Finally, the amyan season signifies the time of year spent waiting for the flying fish to return. This season lasts from November to January. During the latter two seasons, fish cannot be caught for ceremonial use.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url = http://culture.teldap.tw/culture/index.php?option=com_content&id=1194%3Ayami-traditional-fishing-boats&Itemid=210|title = Yami Traditional Fishing Boats|date = 2011|accessdate = February 26, 2015|website = Digital Taiwan - Culture and Nature|publisher = Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program|last = |first = }}</ref> During these off seasons, the Tao people are charged with producing goods and recreation. Fishing is the main way in which Tao men can make a living on the island.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA crucial component of Tao life centers upon the building of their fishing boats. As a device used for their sole method of securing sustenance and monetary gain, they place great emphasis on the production of these boats. They make their boats using multiple wooden planks shaped with an ax. Due to their boats not being made from a single tree trunk or log, they cannot be considered canoes. They join the wooden planks together with dowels and rattan. Once they have successfully constructed the boat, they carve patterns and paint them using the traditional red, white, and black. They then adorn the bow and stern of the boat with chicken feather decorations. The hull of the boat typically consists of three main patterns: human figure, eye of the boat, and waves. The human figure symbolizes heroism through the representation of the earliest Tao man. They eye of the boat consists of a variety of concentric circles edged with triangles. Their composition represents the sun's rays, and is considered to ward off evil spirits that may cause disasters at sea.<ref name=\":3\" /> They typically make boats to seat 1-3 people, 6 people, 8 people, or 10 people. However, no matter the size of the boat, the shape remains consistent.<ref name=\":1\" /> The bow and the stern of the boat are both steep, upward arcs that allow for stability and sharp turns. They consider a boat an extension of man's body, and thus boat building is deemed a sacred mission. For the Tao, boat building is the ultimate creation of beauty.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOnce the building of the boat is completed, the boat's owner will host a large launching ceremony. To celebrate, Tao women wear their agate beads necklaces and octagonal wooden hats a few days prior to the actual event. On the actual day of the launching ceremony, the Tao people gather and slaughter pigs as sacrifice, and the boat owner offers meat and taro to all of the families in his community. The men, dressed in traditional garb, circle the launching boat performing ceremonial rituals to ward off evil spirits before sending it into the water. They also throw the boat in the air several times prior to launch. The ceremony is deemed complete once the boat has remained afloat.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Attire and Dress ===\nTraditional Tao garb consists of simple, uni-colored fabrics made of natural plant fibers.<ref name=\":1\" /> Due to the nature of their fishing tasks, men typically only wear a loincloth and collarless vest. This also helps them to better cope with the stifling heat. Women's dress typically consists of a cloth or short vest to cover their upper body, and an apron-like cloth to cover parts of their lower body. For special or ceremonial occasions, men and women wear blue and white vests in addition to vibrant accessories, such as an octagonal wooden hat for women, and silver helmets for men. During funerals and times of mourning, women wear their upper garments inside out, and men wear a piece of cloth, reverse side out, on their heads. It is also considered taboo to wear clothing with an odd number of blue or black stripes. Therefore, clothing patterns typically consist of 8 to 12 stripes.<ref name=\":3\" /> Neither in ritualistic or everyday situations do the Tao people wear shoes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Diet ==\nThe Tao peoples' production methods are divided into two primary categories: agriculture and fishing. Due to taro's ability to grow in a wide array of climates, it is a vital part of the Tao diet. The Tao people plant taro on the narrow coastal plains, and thus their diet consists of wetland taro and taro sweet potatoes. Their food is divided into two groups: kanen and yakan. Kanen is considered an entree similar to rice, while yakan is deemed a side dish. Women are charged the task of collecting and cooking the kanen, while men are supposed to search for the yakan.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA crucial aspect of the Tao daily diet is seafood. While men are primarily charged with fishing duties, women are responsible for gathering shells, seaweed, and smaller fish from holes along the shore. The men practice both spear and net fishing as means for sustenance. All fish is categorized as either rahed or oyod. Rahed fish is deemed bad, and thus only eaten by the men. While the oyod fish is considered the real fish and can be eaten by both men and women.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Government Relations ==\nThe Tao people are members of the [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]], a Taiwanese cabinet-level government body that serves the needs of the country's indigenous populations.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.apc.gov.tw/portal/docList.html?CID=8E2EA124127533A7|title = Yami|date = 2010|accessdate = April 12, 2015|website = Council of Indigenous Peoples|publisher = Council of Indigenous Peoples|last = |first = }}</ref> They are one of sixteen aborigine populations represented by the council. The Tao people have no formal hierarchical structure. When disputes arise, the involved families are called upon to resolve the situation. While social affairs are governed by the male heads of families and members of the fishing community.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn 1967, the Taiwanese government stepped in to provide the Tao people concrete homes, an act which the aboriginal community deemed an affront to their culture.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, most Tao live in these homes now with the addition of open-air pavilions.<ref name=\":7\" /> Due to the island's relative remoteness, it lacks the equivalent infrastructure in transportation, health care or education in comparison to the main island.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, in 2007 an official of the Council of Indigenous Peoples stated that it would raise its budget to help the aboriginal groups of Taiwan.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Nuclear waste ==\nThe [[Taiwan Power Company]] (Taipower) completed construction of Orchid Island's nuclear waste storage facility in 1982.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/02/21/2003525985/1|title = Tao protest against nuclear facility|last = lok-sin|first = Loa|date = February 21, 2012|work = Taipei Times|access-date = March 23, 2015}}</ref> The facility houses waste from Taiwan's three operating nuclear power plants.

As a result of this belief, they have an uncontrollable fear of the dead.<ref name=\":0\" /> When a Tao individual is near death, relatives and friends stand beside his or her deathbed in full battle regalia in order to fight off evil spirits. Once the funeral has commenced, attendees catch crab and fish to be cooked and eaten on that day in remembrance of the deceased.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere is no specific ceremony for the entrance into adulthood. A boy is considered an adult when he reaches the ages of 18 or 19, while a girl is considered an adult when she turns 16 or 17.<ref name=\":1\" /> A Tao man is deemed eligible for marriage when he participates in a fishing team, and can accomplish his fishing duties on his own. For women, they have to be proficient at [[taro]] cultivation and fabric weaving. Once the two parties are of marrying capabilities, relatives of both families formally propose to the woman's parents through the giving of presents. If her parents accept these offerings, they equivocally accept the proposal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Fishing and Ceremony ===\nThe Tao peoples divide their year into three separate fishing seasons: rayon, teyteyka, and amyan. Rayon is equivalent to spring, and spans from February to May. This is considered to be flying fish season, during which the men catch fish for ceremonial use. Teyteyka lasts from June to October, and signifies the end of the period of time in which flying fish can be caught on the surface. Finally, the amyan season signifies the time of year spent waiting for the flying fish to return. This season lasts from November to January. During the latter two seasons, fish cannot be caught for ceremonial use.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url = http://culture.teldap.tw/culture/index.php?option=com_content&id=1194%3Ayami-traditional-fishing-boats&Itemid=210|title = Yami Traditional Fishing Boats|date = 2011|accessdate = February 26, 2015|website = Digital Taiwan - Culture and Nature|publisher = Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program|last = |first = }}</ref> During these off seasons, the Tao people are charged with producing goods and recreation. Fishing is the main way in which Tao men can make a living on the island.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA crucial component of Tao life centers upon the building of their fishing boats. As a device used for their sole method of securing sustenance and monetary gain, they place great emphasis on the production of these boats. They make their boats using multiple wooden planks shaped with an ax. Due to their boats not being made from a single tree trunk or log, they cannot be considered canoes. They join the wooden planks together with dowels and rattan. Once they have successfully constructed the boat, they carve patterns and paint them using the traditional red, white, and black. They then adorn the bow and stern of the boat with chicken feather decorations. The hull of the boat typically consists of three main patterns: human figure, eye of the boat, and waves. The human figure symbolizes heroism through the representation of the earliest Tao man. They eye of the boat consists of a variety of concentric circles edged with triangles. Their composition represents the sun's rays, and is considered to ward off evil spirits that may cause disasters at sea.<ref name=\":3\" /> They typically make boats to seat 1-3 people, 6 people, 8 people, or 10 people. However, no matter the size of the boat, the shape remains consistent.<ref name=\":1\" /> The bow and the stern of the boat are both steep, upward arcs that allow for stability and sharp turns. They consider a boat an extension of man's body, and thus boat building is deemed a sacred mission. For the Tao, boat building is the ultimate creation of beauty.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOnce the building of the boat is completed, the boat's owner will host a large launching ceremony. To celebrate, Tao women wear their agate beads necklaces and octagonal wooden hats a few days prior to the actual event. On the actual day of the launching ceremony, the Tao people gather and slaughter pigs as sacrifice, and the boat owner offers meat and taro to all of the families in his community. The men, dressed in traditional garb, circle the launching boat performing ceremonial rituals to ward off evil spirits before sending it into the water. They also throw the boat in the air several times prior to launch. The ceremony is deemed complete once the boat has remained afloat.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Attire and Dress ===\nTraditional Tao garb consists of simple, uni-colored fabrics made of natural plant fibers.<ref name=\":1\" /> Due to the nature of their fishing tasks, men typically only wear a loincloth and collarless vest. This also helps them to better cope with the stifling heat. Women's dress typically consists of a cloth or short vest to cover their upper body, and an apron-like cloth to cover parts of their lower body. For special or ceremonial occasions, men and women wear blue and white vests in addition to vibrant accessories, such as an octagonal wooden hat for women, and silver helmets for men. During funerals and times of mourning, women wear their upper garments inside out, and men wear a piece of cloth, reverse side out, on their heads. It is also considered taboo to wear clothing with an odd number of blue or black stripes. Therefore, clothing patterns typically consist of 8 to 12 stripes.<ref name=\":3\" /> Neither in ritualistic or everyday situations do the Tao people wear shoes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Diet ==\nThe Tao peoples' production methods are divided into two primary categories: agriculture and fishing. Due to taro's ability to grow in a wide array of climates, it is a vital part of the Tao diet. The Tao people plant taro on the narrow coastal plains, and thus their diet consists of wetland taro and taro sweet potatoes. Their food is divided into two groups: kanen and yakan. Kanen is considered an entree similar to rice, while yakan is deemed a side dish. Women are charged the task of collecting and cooking the kanen, while men are supposed to search for the yakan.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA crucial aspect of the Tao daily diet is seafood. While men are primarily charged with fishing duties, women are responsible for gathering shells, seaweed, and smaller fish from holes along the shore. The men practice both spear and net fishing as means for sustenance. All fish is categorized as either rahed or oyod. Rahed fish is deemed bad, and thus only eaten by the men. While the oyod fish is considered the real fish and can be eaten by both men and women.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Government Relations ==\nThe Tao people are members of the [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]], a Taiwanese cabinet-level government body that serves the needs of the country's indigenous populations.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.apc.gov.tw/portal/docList.html?CID=8E2EA124127533A7|title = Yami|date = 2010|accessdate = April 12, 2015|website = Council of Indigenous Peoples|publisher = Council of Indigenous Peoples|last = |first = }}</ref> They are one of sixteen aborigine populations represented by the council. The Tao people have no formal hierarchical structure. When disputes arise, the involved families are called upon to resolve the situation. While social affairs are governed by the male heads of families and members of the fishing community.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn 1967, the Taiwanese government stepped in to provide the Tao people concrete homes, an act which the aboriginal community deemed an affront to their culture.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, most Tao live in these homes now with the addition of open-air pavilions.<ref name=\":7\" /> Due to the island's relative remoteness, it lacks the equivalent infrastructure in transportation, health care or education in comparison to the main island.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, in 2007 an official of the Council of Indigenous Peoples stated that it would raise its budget to help the aboriginal groups of Taiwan.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Nuclear waste ==\nThe [[Taiwan Power Company]] (Taipower) completed construction of Orchid Island's nuclear waste storage facility in 1982.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/02/21/2003525985/1|title = Tao protest against nuclear facility|last = lok-sin|first = Loa|date = February 21, 2012|work = Taipei Times|access-date = March 23, 2015}}</ref> The facility houses waste from Taiwan's three operating nuclear power plants.

Due to language barriers, the Tao people were not aware that a nuclear storage facility was being erected on their island. During its construction, workers told the islanders that they were building a food cannery that would help the local economy.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 1987, when the Tao people finally learned of the dangers of nuclear waste, they began protests that lasted for more than twenty years.

Anthony]] or [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (with whom she wrote ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]],{{sfn|Gordon|1990|p=499}} and Declaration of the Rights of Women'').{{sfn|Schenken|1999|p=287}} Along with Stanton, she was a vocal critic of the [[Christian Church]], which put her at odds with conservative suffragists such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. Rather than arguing that women deserved the vote because their feminine morality would then properly influence legislation (as the WCTU did), she argued that they deserved suffrage as a 'natural right'. Despite her opposition to the Church, Gage was in her own way deeply religious, and she joined Stanton's Revising Committee to write ''[[The Woman's Bible]]''.\n\n==Writer and editor==\nGage was well-educated and a prolific writer\u2014the most gifted and educated woman of her age, claimed her devoted son-in-law, [[L.

In 1878, she bought the ''Ballot Box'', the monthly journal of a [[Toledo, Ohio]], suffrage association, when its editor, Sarah R. L. Williams, decided to retire. Gage turned it into ''The National Citizen and Ballot Box'', explaining her intentions for the paper thus:\n\n{{quote|text=Its especial object will be to secure national protection to women citizens in the exercise of their rights to vote ... it will oppose Class Legislation of whatever form ...

Each edition bore the words '[[The pen is mightier than the sword|The Pen Is Mightier Than The Sword]]', and included regular columns about prominent women in history and female inventors. Gage wrote clearly, logically, and often with a dry wit and a well-honed sense of irony.

Gage ensured that every woman in her area ([[Fayetteville, New York]]) had the opportunity to vote by writing letters making them aware of their rights, and sitting at the polls making sure nobody was turned away. In 1871, Gage was part of a group of 10 women who attempted to vote. Reportedly, she stood by and argued with the polling officials on behalf of each individual woman. She supported [[Victoria Woodhull]] and (later) [[Ulysses S Grant]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1872|1872 presidential election]]. In 1873 she defended Susan B. Anthony when Anthony was placed on trial for having voted in that election, making compelling legal and moral arguments.<ref>United States. Circuit Court (New York : Northern District).

Susan B. Anthony who had helped to found the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), was primarily concerned with gaining the vote, an outlook which Gage found too narrow. Conservative suffragists were drawn into the suffrage movement believing women's vote would achieve temperance and Christian political goals. These women were not in support of general social reform. The [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)]], part of the conservative wing of the suffrage movement (and formerly at odds with the National), was open to the prospect of merging with the NWSA under Anthony, while Anthony was working toward unifying the suffrage movement under the single goal of gaining the vote. The merger of the two organizations, pushed through by [[Lucy Stone]], [[Alice Stone Blackwell]] and Anthony, produced the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) in 1890. Stanton and Gage maintained their radical positions and opposed the merger of the two suffrage associations because they believed it was a threat to separation of church and state. The successful merger of the two suffrage groups prompted Gage to establish the [[Woman's National Liberal Union]] (WNLU) in 1890, of which she was president until her death (by stroke) in 1898. Attracting more radical members than NAWSA, the WNLU became the platform for radical and liberal ideas of the time. Gage became the editor of the official journal of the WNLU, ''The Liberal Thinker''.\n\nGage was an avid opponent of the Christian church as controlled by men, having analyzed centuries of Christian practices as degrading and oppressive to women.{{sfn|Clark|1986|p=394}}{{sfn|Harrison|2007|pp=278-9}}{{sfn|Hamlin|2014|p=49}} She saw the Christian church as central to the process of men subjugating women, a process in which church doctrine and authority were used to portray women as morally inferior and inherently sinful. She strongly supported the [[separation of church and state]], believing \"that the greatest injury to women arose from theological laws that subjugated woman to man.\" She wrote in October 1881:\n\n{{quote|text=Believing this country to be a political and not a religious organisation ... the editor of the ''National Citizen'' will use all her influence of voice and pen against \"Sabbath Laws\", the uses of the \"Bible in School\", and pre-eminently against an amendment which shall introduce \"God in the Constitution\".|title=\"God in the Constitution\"|source=page 2}}\n\nIn 1893, she published ''Woman, Church and State'', a book which outlined the variety of ways in which Christianity had oppressed women and reinforced [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] systems. It was wide-ranging and built extensively upon arguments and ideas she had previously put forth in speeches (and in a chapter of ''History of Woman Suffrage'' which bore the same name). Gage became a [[Theosophist]], and the last two years of her life, her thoughts were concentrated upon metaphysical subjects, and the phenomena and philosophy of Spiritualism and Theosophical studies. During her critical illness in 1896, she experienced some illuminations that intensified her interest in psychical research. She had great interest in the occult mysteries of Theosophy and other Eastern speculations as to reincarnation and the illimitable creative power of man.{{sfn|Green|1898|p=337}}\n\nLike many other suffragists, Gage considered [[abortion]] a regrettable tragedy, although her views on the subject were more complex than simple opposition. In 1868, she wrote a letter to ''The Revolution'' (a women's rights paper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and [[Parker Pillsbury]]), supporting the view that abortion was an institution supported, dominated and furthered by men. Gage opposed abortion on principle, blaming it on the 'selfish desire' of husbands to maintain their wealth by reducing their offspring:\n\n{{quote|text=The short article on \"Child Murder\" in your paper of March 12 that touched a subject which lies deeper down in woman's wrongs than any other. This is the denial of the right to herself ... nowhere has the marital union of the sexes been one in which woman has had control over her own body. Enforced motherhood is a crime against the body of the mother and the soul of the child. ... But the crime of abortion is not one in which the guilt lies solely or even chiefly with the woman. ... I hesitate not to assert that most of this crime of \"child murder\", \"abortion\", \"infanticide\", lies at the door of the male sex. Many a woman has laughed a silent, derisive laugh at the decisions of eminent medical and legal authorities, in cases of crimes committed against her as a woman. Never, until she sits as juror on such trials, will or can just decisions be rendered.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"Is Woman Her Own?\"}}\n\nGage was quite concerned with the rights of a woman over her own life and body. In 1881 she wrote, on the subject of [[divorce]]:\n\n{{quote|text=When they preach as does Rev. Crummell, of \"the hidden mystery of generation, the wondrous secret of propagated life, committed to the trust of woman,\" they bring up a self-evident fact of nature which needs no other inspiration, to show the world that the mother, and not the father, is the true head of the family, and that she should be able to free herself from the adulterous husband, keeping her own body a holy temple for its divine-human uses, of which as priestess and holder of the altar she alone should have control.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"A Sermon Against Woman\"}}\n\nOther feminists of the period referred to \"voluntary motherhood,\" achieved through consensual nonprocreative sexual practices, periodic or permanent sexual abstinence, or (most importantly) the right of a woman (especially a wife) to refuse sex.<ref name=\"whaoitegj\">{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Linda|title=Voluntary Motherhood; The Beginnings of Feminist Birth Control Ideas in the United States|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Winter\u2013Spring 1973|volume=1|issue=3/4|pages=5\u201322|jstor=1566477}}</ref> Works about [[Native Americans in the United States]] by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] also influenced Gage.  She decried the brutal treatment of Native Americans in her writings and public speeches.

Frank Baum]] (''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'') at a time when he was a struggling [[actor]] with only a handful of plays (of which only ''[[The Maid of Arran]]'' survives) to his writing credit. However, a few minutes after the initial announcement, Gage started laughing, apparently realizing that her emphasis on all individuals making up their own minds was not lost on her headstrong daughter, who gave up a chance at a law career when the opportunity for women was rare. Gage spent six months of every year with Maud and Frank. Gage's son Thomas Clarkson Gage and his wife Sophia had a daughter named Dorothy Louise Gage, who was born in [[Bloomington, Illinois]], on June 11, 1898, but died five months later, on November 11, 1898.<ref name=\"beyondtherainbow2oz.com\">Willingham, Elaine (1998).

She was the author of the ''Woman's Rights Catechism'' (1868); ''Woman as Inventor'' (1870); ''Who Planned the Tennessee Campaign'' (1880); and ''Woman, Church and State'' (1893).{{sfn|White|1921|p=244}}\n\nGage served as president of the New York State Suffrage Association for five years, and president of the National Woman's Suffrage Association during 1875\u201376, which was one of the affiliating societies forming the national suffrage association, in 1890; she also held the office of second vice-president, vice-president-at-large and chairman of the executive committee of the original National Woman Suffrage Association.{{sfn|White|1921|p=244}}\n\nGage's views on suffrage and feminism were considered too radical by many members of the suffrage association, and in consequence, she organized in 1890 the [[Woman's National Liberal Union]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=WOMEN\u2019S NATIONAL LIBERAL UNION REPORT OF THE CONVENTION FOR ORGANIZATION|last=Gage|first=Matilda Joslyn|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> whose objects were: To assert woman's natural right to self-government; to show the cause of delay in the recognition of her demand; to preserve the principles of civil and religious liberty; to arouse public opinion to the danger of a union of church and state through an amendment to the constitution, and to denounce the doctrine of woman's inferiority.

She served as president of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] from 1875 to 1876, and served as either Chair of the Executive Committee or Vice President for over twenty years. During the 1876 convention, she successfully argued against a group of police who claimed the association was holding an illegal assembly. They left without pressing charges.{{sfn|Snodgrass|2015|p=}}\n\nGage was considered to be more radical than either [[Susan B. Anthony]] or [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (with whom she wrote ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]],{{sfn|Gordon|1990|p=499}} and Declaration of the Rights of Women'').{{sfn|Schenken|1999|p=287}} Along with Stanton, she was a vocal critic of the [[Christian Church]], which put her at odds with conservative suffragists such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. Rather than arguing that women deserved the vote because their feminine morality would then properly influence legislation (as the WCTU did), she argued that they deserved suffrage as a 'natural right'. Despite her opposition to the Church, Gage was in her own way deeply religious, and she joined Stanton's Revising Committee to write ''[[The Woman's Bible]]''.\n\n==Writer and editor==\nGage was well-educated and a prolific writer\u2014the most gifted and educated woman of her age, claimed her devoted son-in-law, [[L. Frank Baum]]. She corresponded with numerous newspapers, reporting on developments in the [[women's suffrage|woman suffrage]] movement. In 1878, she bought the ''Ballot Box'', the monthly journal of a [[Toledo, Ohio]], suffrage association, when its editor, Sarah R. L. Williams, decided to retire. Gage turned it into ''The National Citizen and Ballot Box'', explaining her intentions for the paper thus:\n\n{{quote|text=Its especial object will be to secure national protection to women citizens in the exercise of their rights to vote ... it will oppose Class Legislation of whatever form ...

Each edition bore the words '[[The pen is mightier than the sword|The Pen Is Mightier Than The Sword]]', and included regular columns about prominent women in history and female inventors. Gage wrote clearly, logically, and often with a dry wit and a well-honed sense of irony. Writing about laws which allowed a man to will his children to a guardian unrelated to their mother, Gage observed:\n\n{{quote|text=It is sometimes better to be a dead man than a live woman.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"All The Rights I Want\"<ref>Gage, Matilda E.

Gage ensured that every woman in her area ([[Fayetteville, New York]]) had the opportunity to vote by writing letters making them aware of their rights, and sitting at the polls making sure nobody was turned away. In 1871, Gage was part of a group of 10 women who attempted to vote. Reportedly, she stood by and argued with the polling officials on behalf of each individual woman. She supported [[Victoria Woodhull]] and (later) [[Ulysses S Grant]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1872|1872 presidential election]]. In 1873 she defended Susan B. Anthony when Anthony was placed on trial for having voted in that election, making compelling legal and moral arguments.<ref>United States. Circuit Court (New York : Northern District).

Susan B. Anthony who had helped to found the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), was primarily concerned with gaining the vote, an outlook which Gage found too narrow. Conservative suffragists were drawn into the suffrage movement believing women's vote would achieve temperance and Christian political goals. These women were not in support of general social reform. The [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)]], part of the conservative wing of the suffrage movement (and formerly at odds with the National), was open to the prospect of merging with the NWSA under Anthony, while Anthony was working toward unifying the suffrage movement under the single goal of gaining the vote. The merger of the two organizations, pushed through by [[Lucy Stone]], [[Alice Stone Blackwell]] and Anthony, produced the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) in 1890. Stanton and Gage maintained their radical positions and opposed the merger of the two suffrage associations because they believed it was a threat to separation of church and state. The successful merger of the two suffrage groups prompted Gage to establish the [[Woman's National Liberal Union]] (WNLU) in 1890, of which she was president until her death (by stroke) in 1898. Attracting more radical members than NAWSA, the WNLU became the platform for radical and liberal ideas of the time. Gage became the editor of the official journal of the WNLU, ''The Liberal Thinker''.\n\nGage was an avid opponent of the Christian church as controlled by men, having analyzed centuries of Christian practices as degrading and oppressive to women.{{sfn|Clark|1986|p=394}}{{sfn|Harrison|2007|pp=278-9}}{{sfn|Hamlin|2014|p=49}} She saw the Christian church as central to the process of men subjugating women, a process in which church doctrine and authority were used to portray women as morally inferior and inherently sinful. She strongly supported the [[separation of church and state]], believing \"that the greatest injury to women arose from theological laws that subjugated woman to man.\" She wrote in October 1881:\n\n{{quote|text=Believing this country to be a political and not a religious organisation ... the editor of the ''National Citizen'' will use all her influence of voice and pen against \"Sabbath Laws\", the uses of the \"Bible in School\", and pre-eminently against an amendment which shall introduce \"God in the Constitution\".|title=\"God in the Constitution\"|source=page 2}}\n\nIn 1893, she published ''Woman, Church and State'', a book which outlined the variety of ways in which Christianity had oppressed women and reinforced [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] systems. It was wide-ranging and built extensively upon arguments and ideas she had previously put forth in speeches (and in a chapter of ''History of Woman Suffrage'' which bore the same name). Gage became a [[Theosophist]], and the last two years of her life, her thoughts were concentrated upon metaphysical subjects, and the phenomena and philosophy of Spiritualism and Theosophical studies. During her critical illness in 1896, she experienced some illuminations that intensified her interest in psychical research. She had great interest in the occult mysteries of Theosophy and other Eastern speculations as to reincarnation and the illimitable creative power of man.{{sfn|Green|1898|p=337}}\n\nLike many other suffragists, Gage considered [[abortion]] a regrettable tragedy, although her views on the subject were more complex than simple opposition. In 1868, she wrote a letter to ''The Revolution'' (a women's rights paper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and [[Parker Pillsbury]]), supporting the view that abortion was an institution supported, dominated and furthered by men. Gage opposed abortion on principle, blaming it on the 'selfish desire' of husbands to maintain their wealth by reducing their offspring:\n\n{{quote|text=The short article on \"Child Murder\" in your paper of March 12 that touched a subject which lies deeper down in woman's wrongs than any other. This is the denial of the right to herself ... nowhere has the marital union of the sexes been one in which woman has had control over her own body. Enforced motherhood is a crime against the body of the mother and the soul of the child. ... But the crime of abortion is not one in which the guilt lies solely or even chiefly with the woman. ... I hesitate not to assert that most of this crime of \"child murder\", \"abortion\", \"infanticide\", lies at the door of the male sex. Many a woman has laughed a silent, derisive laugh at the decisions of eminent medical and legal authorities, in cases of crimes committed against her as a woman. Never, until she sits as juror on such trials, will or can just decisions be rendered.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"Is Woman Her Own?\"}}\n\nGage was quite concerned with the rights of a woman over her own life and body. In 1881 she wrote, on the subject of [[divorce]]:\n\n{{quote|text=When they preach as does Rev. Crummell, of \"the hidden mystery of generation, the wondrous secret of propagated life, committed to the trust of woman,\" they bring up a self-evident fact of nature which needs no other inspiration, to show the world that the mother, and not the father, is the true head of the family, and that she should be able to free herself from the adulterous husband, keeping her own body a holy temple for its divine-human uses, of which as priestess and holder of the altar she alone should have control.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"A Sermon Against Woman\"}}\n\nOther feminists of the period referred to \"voluntary motherhood,\" achieved through consensual nonprocreative sexual practices, periodic or permanent sexual abstinence, or (most importantly) the right of a woman (especially a wife) to refuse sex.<ref name=\"whaoitegj\">{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Linda|title=Voluntary Motherhood; The Beginnings of Feminist Birth Control Ideas in the United States|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Winter\u2013Spring 1973|volume=1|issue=3/4|pages=5\u201322|jstor=1566477}}</ref> Works about [[Native Americans in the United States]] by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] also influenced Gage.  She decried the brutal treatment of Native Americans in her writings and public speeches.

However, a few minutes after the initial announcement, Gage started laughing, apparently realizing that her emphasis on all individuals making up their own minds was not lost on her headstrong daughter, who gave up a chance at a law career when the opportunity for women was rare. Gage spent six months of every year with Maud and Frank.

In ''Official Records'' it states that he was in 5th Regiment Kentucky Mounted Infantry. This enlistment is also mentioned in ''Kentucky Adjutant General's Report \u2013 Confederate Volunteers 1861\u20131865, Vol.1'' page 254 entry 80, where Kiney's enlistment is dated on November 1st 1861. Wikipedia's entry on this unit states that they were disbanded in October 1862 and the troops were given a three way choice, discharge, reenlistment or joining the Kentucky Cavalry. Kiney went with the last option as he enlisted in Company l of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry on 18th November 1863. (This extract is from the book ''The 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' by John B. Wells & Jim Pritchard. See ''Roster of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' www.potterflats.com10thKyhtml) Professor Hoare's segment on Kiney in ''The South's Last Boys in Gray'' reproduces an excerpt of Lloyd B. Walton's article \"He's a Man Even at 109\" from ''The Indianapolis Times'' September 14th 1952. Here Kiney speaks of his Civil War experience, recalling that he was in most of the war and that Shiloh was his toughest fight.

Sheets of that same company kept a diary where Thomas Riddle is mentioned on February 26th 1863.\n        Against this evidence is the fact that Lowry cautions against believing Riddle and that some of Riddle's descendants warn that due to census information, he could not have served in the Civil War.

Unlike the U.S. military archives, the Confederate records had no official archive system after the war. However, for most of the cases investigated, the ages of the claimants alone were enough to prove their claim was false. Walter Williams was generally acknowledged as the \"last Confederate veteran\" in 1950s newspapers. However, in September 1959 an expos\u00e9 by ''The New York Times'' revealed that he was in fact born in 1854 in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi]], and not 1842 as claimed. Still, since [[John B. Salling]] and all the other claimants were dead, Williams was celebrated as the last Confederate veteran after his death on 20 December 1959.<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1959|title=Reputed Last Civil War Veteran Dies in Texas After Long Illness: Walter Williams Put His Age at 117 \u2013 Tributes Note the End of an Era|accessdate=17 October 2011|url=http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328015838/http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-date=28 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSalling's own status is disputed. In 1991, William Marvel examined the claims of Salling and several other \"last Civil War veterans\" for a piece in the Civil War history magazine ''Blue & Gray.'' Marvel found census data that indicated Salling was born in 1858, not 1846. Although in 1900 Salling supplied a birthdate of March 1858, he appears to have been born around 1856, still too late to have served in the Confederate Army. The 1860 census lists him as 4 years old, and the 1870 census as 14.<ref name=\"impostors\">{{cite book|title=The great imposters|first=William|last=Marvel|publisher=Blue and Gray|volume=VIII|issue=3|year=1991|pages=32\u201333|location=Columbus}}</ref> William Lundy is listed as 1 year old on the 1860 census, and from 1870 until 1930 he gave census marshals ages that reflected birthdates as early as 1853 and as late as 1860. He did not push his birthdate back to the 1840s until he applied for a Confederate pension from the state of Florida. In the same piece, Marvel confirmed Woolson's claim to be the last surviving Union veteran and asserted that Woolson was the last genuine Civil War veteran on either side. However, Marvel did not present research establishing who, among the several other Confederate claims from the 1950s, some of which appear to be genuine, was the real last Confederate veteran.\n\n=== [[French invasion of Mexico]] (1861\u201367) ===\n* Jules Pujos (1846\u20131942)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fMjAQAAMAAJ&dq=ancien+%22Pujos%22+%22mexique%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Jules+Pujos|title=l\u00e9gion d'honneur|publisher=Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise|date=12 January 1937|page=508|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DDD\" />\n* Francisco Arellano Zenteno (1842\u20131935)&nbsp;\u2013 Mexico.

In ''Official Records'' it states that he was in 5th Regiment Kentucky Mounted Infantry. This enlistment is also mentioned in ''Kentucky Adjutant General's Report \u2013 Confederate Volunteers 1861\u20131865, Vol.1'' page 254 entry 80, where Kiney's enlistment is dated on November 1st 1861. Wikipedia's entry on this unit states that they were disbanded in October 1862 and the troops were given a three way choice, discharge, reenlistment or joining the Kentucky Cavalry. Kiney went with the last option as he enlisted in Company l of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry on 18th November 1863. (This extract is from the book ''The 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' by John B. Wells & Jim Pritchard. See ''Roster of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' www.potterflats.com10thKyhtml) Professor Hoare's segment on Kiney in ''The South's Last Boys in Gray'' reproduces an excerpt of Lloyd B. Walton's article \"He's a Man Even at 109\" from ''The Indianapolis Times'' September 14th 1952. Here Kiney speaks of his Civil War experience, recalling that he was in most of the war and that Shiloh was his toughest fight.

Sheets of that same company kept a diary where Thomas Riddle is mentioned on February 26th 1863.\n        Against this evidence is the fact that Lowry cautions against believing Riddle and that some of Riddle's descendants warn that due to census information, he could not have served in the Civil War.

Unlike the U.S. military archives, the Confederate records had no official archive system after the war. However, for most of the cases investigated, the ages of the claimants alone were enough to prove their claim was false. Walter Williams was generally acknowledged as the \"last Confederate veteran\" in 1950s newspapers. However, in September 1959 an expos\u00e9 by ''The New York Times'' revealed that he was in fact born in 1854 in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi]], and not 1842 as claimed. Still, since [[John B. Salling]] and all the other claimants were dead, Williams was celebrated as the last Confederate veteran after his death on 20 December 1959.<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1959|title=Reputed Last Civil War Veteran Dies in Texas After Long Illness: Walter Williams Put His Age at 117 \u2013 Tributes Note the End of an Era|accessdate=17 October 2011|url=http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328015838/http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-date=28 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSalling's own status is disputed. In 1991, William Marvel examined the claims of Salling and several other \"last Civil War veterans\" for a piece in the Civil War history magazine ''Blue & Gray.'' Marvel found census data that indicated Salling was born in 1858, not 1846. Although in 1900 Salling supplied a birthdate of March 1858, he appears to have been born around 1856, still too late to have served in the Confederate Army. The 1860 census lists him as 4 years old, and the 1870 census as 14.<ref name=\"impostors\">{{cite book|title=The great imposters|first=William|last=Marvel|publisher=Blue and Gray|volume=VIII|issue=3|year=1991|pages=32\u201333|location=Columbus}}</ref> William Lundy is listed as 1 year old on the 1860 census, and from 1870 until 1930 he gave census marshals ages that reflected birthdates as early as 1853 and as late as 1860. He did not push his birthdate back to the 1840s until he applied for a Confederate pension from the state of Florida. In the same piece, Marvel confirmed Woolson's claim to be the last surviving Union veteran and asserted that Woolson was the last genuine Civil War veteran on either side. However, Marvel did not present research establishing who, among the several other Confederate claims from the 1950s, some of which appear to be genuine, was the real last Confederate veteran.\n\n=== [[French invasion of Mexico]] (1861\u201367) ===\n* Jules Pujos (1846\u20131942)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fMjAQAAMAAJ&dq=ancien+%22Pujos%22+%22mexique%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Jules+Pujos|title=l\u00e9gion d'honneur|publisher=Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise|date=12 January 1937|page=508|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DDD\" />\n* Francisco Arellano Zenteno (1842\u20131935)&nbsp;\u2013 Mexico.
