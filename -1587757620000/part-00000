In his opinion, such a decision would lead to dual power, which would be disastrous for Russia).<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.mk.ru/politics/2020/03/06/vladimir-putin-obyasnil-pochemu-ne-vozglavit-gossovet.html|title=\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442|language=ru |website= |publisher=\u041c\u041a.RU |date=2020-03-06 |accessdate=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n*The amendments will also set stricter requirements for people running for president. Namely, they will have to have lived in Russia for the last 25 years (according to the old norm of 10 years), and the President can not become a person who has or ever had a foreign citizenship or residence permit in another country, while people who previously had citizenship of a country that or part of which became part of Russia will be able to run for president (this means that former Ukrainian citizens who lived in Crimea in 2014 and received Russian citizenship after the annexation of the peninsula will be able to run for president in the future, however, if under the old rule they could run already in these elections. Now they will not be able to do this until 2039).\n*Also, after the amendments, all former presidents will receive the status of senators for life, at the same time, they will have the right to refuse this status.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2020/02/11/822786-bivshie-prezidenti-status-senatorov|title=\u0411\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435

The students introduce Tracy to Motormouth Maybelle, an [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] record shop owner and host of the monthly \"Negro Day\" on ''The Corny Collins Show''. They teach Tracy, Penny, and Link dance moves and Penny begins an [[Interracial relationship|interracial romance]] with Motormouth Maybelle's son, Seaweed.

''Hairspray'' was his only film with Waters in which he didn't play the lead.  Originally, Divine was considered to play both Tracy Turnblad and her mother Edna.  Executives from New Line Cinema, the film's distributor, discouraged this concept, and it was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last=Egan|first=James|title=John Waters: Interviews|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781617031823|pages=xxiii |edition=Paperback}}</ref> Instead Divine played Edna Turnblad and Arvin Hodgepile, racist TV station owner.\n\nAccording to BusinessInsider.com, \"Hairspray\" became the most popular movie set in Maryland.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nA handful of [[Deleted scene|scenes were cut]] while in post-production, some of which explained certain elements seen in the film.\n\nThe first scene occurs before Tracy and Penny go the Parkville VFW record hop.  Tracy is required to start her first shift working in the Hardy-Har Joke Shop. But after managing to scare away all her customers she is excused to go to the hop. The joke shop customers are still listed in the end credits of the final cut.\n\nAnother involves Tracy skipping school, stealing shoes from the Etta Gown Shop, and breaking into the Von Tussles' home, using Amber's hair bleach to bleach her hair in  Amber's sink, thus explaining Tracy's change of hair color later in the film.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nAnother deleted scene involved live roaches crawling out of Tracy's hair at Tilted Acres. The actual filmed scene of the cockroach crawling out of Tracy's hair is cut, but still included is Amber's horrified reaction.  However, she is presumed to be joking and/or lying. When discussing his decision to ultimately cut the scene, Waters explained \"[[Robert Shaye|Bob Shaye]], the head of New Line, probably correctly, said, 'This doesn't work. What is this, a [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] movie?' [...] And he was probably right.\"<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nA further excised scene sees Penny and Seaweed trying to take refuge at Nadine's home after Penny's escape.\n\nThe final deleted scene was a musical number which involved the teens performing an obscure 1960s dance called \"The Stupidity\" at the auto show just prior to Tracy being released from reform school, but again, Waters ultimately decided it wasn't appropriate, stating, \"[B]asically, I thought, you know, you don't want your leading man to look stupid right in the big finale.\"<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Hairspray'' received three stars from critics [[Gene Siskel]]{{citation needed|date = February 2019}} and [[Roger Ebert]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hairspray-1988 | work=RogerEbert.com | title=Hairspray |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |date=February 26, 1988 |accessdate= April 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds a 98% \"certified fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10.

The ''Corny Collins Show'' is based on the real-life ''[[The Buddy Deane Show|Buddy Deane Show]]'', a local dance party program which pre-empted Dick Clark's ''[[American Bandstand]]'' in the Baltimore area during the 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\">{{cite AV media|title='Hairspray' DVD Commentary by: John Waters and Ricki Lake|author=[[John Waters]]; [[Ricki Lake]]|date=November 5, 2002|work=[[New Line Cinema|New Line Home Video]]}}</ref> Waters had previously written about ''The Buddy Deane Show'' in his 1983 book ''Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters.''\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in and around the Baltimore area during the summer of 1987.<ref name=\"LBH\">{{cite book|author=[[Robert Maier]]|date=2011|title=Low Budget Hell: Making Underground Movies with John Waters|url=|location=Davidson, North Carolina, U.S.A.|publisher=Full Page Publishing|pages=273\u2013297|isbn=978-0-9837708-0-0}}</ref> The school scenes were filmed at [[Perry Hall High School]] with set locations including the library, a first-floor English class, and the principal's office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcpl.info/info/history/hist_pe_schools.html |title=Perry Hall's Schools: The Heart of the Community |author=David Marks |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101004408/http://www.bcpl.info/info/history/hist_pe_schools.html |archivedate=January 1, 2009 }}</ref> In the scene set in the principal's office, the Harry Dorsey Gough (see [[Perry Hall Mansion]]) coat-of-arms that once hung in the main lobby can be seen through the doorway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perryhallmaryland.org/funfacts|title=Fun Facts About Perry Hall|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709085526/http://www.perryhallmaryland.org/funfacts|archivedate=2009-07-09}}</ref> The scenes set at Tilted Acres amusement park were filmed at [[Dorney Park]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].\n\nAccording to [[Debbie Harry]], Waters wanted her to perform music for the film as well as act in it, but the record label she was signed to objected.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harry |first1=Debbie |last2=Simmons |first2=Sylvie |title=Face It |date=2019 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-074958-3 |page=269}}</ref>\n\n''Hairspray'' was [[Divine (performer)|Divine]]'s final film to be released in his lifetime; he died on March 7, 1988, three weeks after the film's premiere and nine days after the film's release. ''Hairspray'' was his only film with Waters in which he didn't play the lead.  Originally, Divine was considered to play both Tracy Turnblad and her mother Edna.  Executives from New Line Cinema, the film's distributor, discouraged this concept, and it was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last=Egan|first=James|title=John Waters: Interviews|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781617031823|pages=xxiii |edition=Paperback}}</ref> Instead Divine played Edna Turnblad and Arvin Hodgepile, racist TV station owner.\n\nAccording to BusinessInsider.com, \"Hairspray\" became the most popular movie set in Maryland.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nA handful of [[Deleted scene|scenes were cut]] while in post-production, some of which explained certain elements seen in the film.\n\nThe first scene occurs before Tracy and Penny go the Parkville VFW record hop.  Tracy is required to start her first shift working in the Hardy-Har Joke Shop. But after managing to scare away all her customers she is excused to go to the hop. The joke shop customers are still listed in the end credits of the final cut.\n\nAnother involves Tracy skipping school, stealing shoes from the Etta Gown Shop, and breaking into the Von Tussles' home, using Amber's hair bleach to bleach her hair in  Amber's sink, thus explaining Tracy's change of hair color later in the film.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nAnother deleted scene involved live roaches crawling out of Tracy's hair at Tilted Acres. The actual filmed scene of the cockroach crawling out of Tracy's hair is cut, but still included is Amber's horrified reaction.  However, she is presumed to be joking and/or lying. When discussing his decision to ultimately cut the scene, Waters explained \"[[Robert Shaye|Bob Shaye]], the head of New Line, probably correctly, said, 'This doesn't work. What is this, a [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] movie?' [...] And he was probably right.\"<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nA further excised scene sees Penny and Seaweed trying to take refuge at Nadine's home after Penny's escape.\n\nThe final deleted scene was a musical number which involved the teens performing an obscure 1960s dance called \"The Stupidity\" at the auto show just prior to Tracy being released from reform school, but again, Waters ultimately decided it wasn't appropriate, stating, \"[B]asically, I thought, you know, you don't want your leading man to look stupid right in the big finale.\"<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Hairspray'' received three stars from critics [[Gene Siskel]]{{citation needed|date = February 2019}} and [[Roger Ebert]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hairspray-1988 | work=RogerEbert.com | title=Hairspray |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |date=February 26, 1988 |accessdate= April 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds a 98% \"certified fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10.

In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions. In this way, freed of their historical context, warning and appeal demonstrate their enduring validity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_kuenstler/index.html|title=Quote from the newsletter of the Dittmar Gallery on April 9, 2020 |website=www.galerie-dittmar.at|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions==\n* 2019 Vienna Art Week: ''Bei Uns'' (Around Here), WOP - Works on Paper, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/103368/hana-usui-bei-uns|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wopwien.com/wop/hana-usui\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.wopwien.com|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viennaartweek.at/de/program/\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.viennaartweek.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''An das Leben'' (To Life), Artcurial Austria, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/98220|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kekinwien.at/kunst/09/2018/hana-usui-an-das-leben/|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.kekinwien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''Black End'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101412;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2016 ''High & Slow'', with Thilo Westermann, Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de/ausstellungen/high-slow/|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ausstellung-kuenste-der-verfeinerung-1.3192064|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.sueddeutsche.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101413;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Schwarzer Regen'' (Black Rain), Bildraum 01, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bildrecht.at/bildraum/bildraum-01/hana-usui-schwarzer-regen/|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.bildrecht.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/90838;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/!5236630/ |title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.taz.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Daniela and Cora H\u00f6lzl - EY5, D\u00fcsseldorf / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de/current%20exhibition.htm|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Cora H\u00f6lzl|website=www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2013 '' Hana Usui - Drawings'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/86712;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2012 Vienna Art Week: ''Hana Usui.

In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions. In this way, freed of their historical context, warning and appeal demonstrate their enduring validity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_kuenstler/index.html|title=Quote from the newsletter of the Dittmar Gallery on April 9, 2020 |website=www.galerie-dittmar.at|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions==\n* 2019 Vienna Art Week: ''Bei Uns'' (Around Here), WOP - Works on Paper, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/103368/hana-usui-bei-uns|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wopwien.com/wop/hana-usui\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.wopwien.com|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viennaartweek.at/de/program/\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.viennaartweek.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''An das Leben'' (To Life), Artcurial Austria, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/98220|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kekinwien.at/kunst/09/2018/hana-usui-an-das-leben/|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.kekinwien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''Black End'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101412;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2016 ''High & Slow'', with Thilo Westermann, Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de/ausstellungen/high-slow/|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ausstellung-kuenste-der-verfeinerung-1.3192064|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.sueddeutsche.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101413;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Schwarzer Regen'' (Black Rain), Bildraum 01, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bildrecht.at/bildraum/bildraum-01/hana-usui-schwarzer-regen/|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.bildrecht.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/90838;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/!5236630/ |title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.taz.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Daniela and Cora H\u00f6lzl - EY5, D\u00fcsseldorf / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de/current%20exhibition.htm|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Cora H\u00f6lzl|website=www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2013 '' Hana Usui - Drawings'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/86712;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2012 Vienna Art Week: ''Hana Usui.

In this description, the natural observables are connectivities of clusters, i.e. probabilities that a number of points belong to the same cluster. \nThe Ising model can then be viewed as the case <math>q=2</math> of the <math>q</math>-state [[Potts model]], whose parameter <math>q</math> can vary continuously, and is related to the central charge of the [[Virasoro algebra]]. \n\nIn the critical limit, connectivities of clusters have the same behaviour under conformal transformations as correlation functions of the spin operator.
