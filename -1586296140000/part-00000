It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for [[Apulia]] to enlist in the army of [[Walter III, Count of Brienne]]. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life.<ref name=\"ODCC Francis\"/> According to [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions.

Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the [[Bishop of Assisi]], Francis renounced his father and his [[Property|patrimony]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/> Some accounts report that he stripped himself naked in token of this renunciation, and the Bishop covered him with his own cloak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrinesf.org/life-of-st-francis.html|title=Life of St. Francis|first=Fr.

He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a [[penitent]], during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometer from Rivotorto, today on private property and once again in ruin); and the [[Porziuncola]], the little chapel of [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]] in the plain just below the town.<ref name=\"cefa\"/> This later became his favorite [[Dwelling|abode]].<ref name=\"chest54\"/> By degrees he took to nursing [[leper]]s, in the [[lazar house]]s near [[Assisi]].\n\n===Founding of the Franciscan Orders===\n====The Friars Minor====\nOne morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the \"Commissioning of the Twelve\" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around him with a knotted rope and went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n \nHis example drew others to him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a [[simple living|simple life]] in the deserted [[lazar house]] of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of [[Umbria]], making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n[[File:Legend of St. Francis by Giotto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Innocent III]] approving the statutes of the Order of the Franciscans, by [[Giotto]], 1295\u20131300]]\nIn 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (\"friars\"), the ''Regula primitiva'' or \"Primitive Rule\", which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was \"To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps\". He then led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from [[Pope Innocent III]] to found a new religious Order.<ref name=\"chest107\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;107\u2013108</ref> Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent&nbsp;III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance. The group was [[tonsure]]d.<ref name=\"Francis of Assisi and His World\">Galli(2002), pp.&nbsp;74\u201380</ref> This was important in part because it go cheack me out on tiktok \n authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier. Though a number of the Pope's counselors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order. This occurred, according to tradition, on 16 April 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]].<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> The group, then the \"Lesser Brothers\" (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order'' or the ''Seraphic Order''), were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, although he was later ordained a deacon.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n====The Poor Clares and the Third Order====\n[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil17.jpg|thumb|St. Clare is received by St. Francis, Josep Benlliure]]\nFrom then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations.  Hearing Francis preaching in the church of [[Assisi Cathedral|San Rufino]] in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman [[Clare of Assisi]] became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling. Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order, which he joined. On the night of [[Palm Sunday]], 28 March 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies.<ref name=\"chest110\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;110\u2013111</ref> This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a [[religious habit]], or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her in a nearby monastery of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns until he could provide a suitable retreat for her, and for her younger sister, [[Agnes of Assisi|Caterina]], and the other young women who had joined her. Later he transferred them to San Damiano,<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> to a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as [[Poor Clares]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nFor those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance]], a fraternity composed of either [[laity]] or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took [[religious vows]]. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy. The Third Order is now titled the [[Secular Franciscan Order]].\n\n===Travels===\nDetermined to bring the Gospel to all peoples of the World and convert them, after the example of the first disciples of Jesus, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On 8 May 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of [[La Verna]] (Alverna) as a gift from [[Count]] Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as \u201ceminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind\u201d.<ref>Fioretti quoted in: St. Francis, ''The Little Flowers, Legends, and Lauds'', trans. N. Wydenbruck, ed. Otto Karrer (London: [[Sheed and Ward]], 1979) 244.</ref> The mountain would become one of his favourite retreats for prayer.<ref name=\"chest130\">Chesterton (1924), p.130</ref>\n\nIn the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but this time an illness forced him to break off his journey in Spain. Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them [[Tommaso da Celano]], who would later write the biography of St. Francis), and some well-educated men joined his Order. In 1215, Francis may have gone to Rome for the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], but that is not certain. During this time, he probably met a [[canon (priest)|canon]], [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzman]]<ref name=\"chest126\">Chesterton (1924), p.126</ref> (later to be Saint Dominic, the founder of the [[Dominican Order#Foundation|Friars Preachers]], another [[Catholic religious order]]). In 1217, he offered to go to France. Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy.\n\nIn 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the [[Fifth Crusade]] where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of [[Damietta]] {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile. The Sultan, [[al-Kamil]], a nephew of [[Saladin]], had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on 29 August 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks.<ref>Runciman, Steven.

The scene in the fresco adopts a position midway between the two extremes. Since the idea was put forward by the German art historian, Friedrich Rintelen in 1912,<ref>Friedrich Rintelen, ''Giotto und die Giotto-apokryphen'', (1912)</ref> many scholars have expressed doubt that Giotto was the author of the Upper Church frescoes.\n\nAccording to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis.<ref>For grants of various permissions and privileges to Francis as attributed by later sources, see, e.g., Tolan, pp. 258\u2013263. The first mention of the Sultan's conversion occurs in a sermon delivered by Bonaventure on 4 October 1267. See Tolan, pp. 168</ref> The Franciscan Order has been present in the [[Holy Land]] almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions from the [[Mameluke]] Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]], and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from [[Pope Clement VI]] in 1342.<ref>Bulla ''Gratias agimus'', commemorated by Pope John Paul II in a [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1992/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19921130_p-schalluuck_it.html Letter] dated 30 November 1992.

On the Franciscan presence, including an historical overview, see, generally the official website at [http://www.custodia.org/default.asp?id=425 ''Custodia''] and [[Custodian of the Holy Land]]</ref>\n\n===Reorganization of the Franciscan Order===\n[[Image:Francis preaching the birds.fresco. master of st francis. Assisi.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Francis preaching to the birds outside of [[Bevagna]] ([[Master of Saint Francis]]).]] By this time, the growing Order of friars was divided into [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in [[Morocco]], Francis returned to Italy via [[Venice]].<ref name=\"b162\">Bonaventure (1867), p.&nbsp;162</ref> Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the \"First Rule\" or \"Rule Without a [[Papal Bull]]\" (''Regula prima'', ''Regula non bullata''), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nOn 29 September 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on 10 March 1221, and was buried there. When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans. Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life.\n[[File:Honorius_III_approving_the_Rule_of_St._Francis,_Bartolome_del_Castro,_c._1500_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Honorius III]] Approving the Rule of St. Francis of Assisi'', Bartolome del Castro, c. 1500 ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\nThe reports of miracles ceased. Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as [[Vicar]] of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the \"First Rule\", creating the \"Second Rule\" or \"Rule With a Bull\", which was approved by Pope Honorius III on 29 November 1223. As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars \"to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity\". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order. Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as [[Catania]] in Sicily and afterward as far north as [[Bologna]].\n\n=== Stigmata, final days, and Sainthood ===\n[[File:Cigoli, san francesco.jpg|thumb|Francis considered his [[stigmata]] part of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]''.<ref name=Goff>Le Goff, Jacques.

Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. \"Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ.\"<ref name=\"chest131\">Chesterton (1924), p.131</ref> Suffering from these stigmata and from [[trachoma]], Francis received care in several cities ([[Siena]], [[Cortona]], [[Nocera Umbra|Nocera]]) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where the Franciscan movement began, and feeling that the end of his life was approaching, he spent his last days dictating his spiritual testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, 3 October 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), ''\"Voce mea ad Dominum\"''.\n<!-- [[File:Traslaci\u00f3n de San Francisco de As\u00eds, de Benet Mercad\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The Passing of Saint Francis of Assisi (1866), by [[Benet Mercad\u00e9]]]] -->\n\nOn 16 July 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope [[Gregory IX]] (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, a friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in Assisi. Francis was buried on 25 May 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]], and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.\n\n==Character and legacy==\n[[Image:Francis_wolf.JPG|thumb|right|Saint Francis talking to the [[wolf of Gubbio]] ([[:de:Carl Weidemeyer|Carl Weidemeyer]], 1911)]] Francis set out to imitate Christ and literally carry out his work.

He believed that all creatures should praise God (a common theme in the Psalms) and the people have a duty to protect and enjoy nature as both the stewards of God's creation and as creatures ourselves.<ref name=\"b78\"/> Many of the stories that surround the life of Saint Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment.<ref name=\"b78\">Bonaventure (1867), pp.&nbsp;78\u201385</ref>\n\n[[File:St Francis Statue 2.JPG|thumb|left|A garden statue of Francis of Assisi with birds]]\nAn incident illustrating the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the \"Fioretti\" (\"Little Flowers\"), a collection of [[legend]]s and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. One day, while Francis was traveling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to \"wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.\"<ref name=\"b78\"/> The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.\n\nAnother legend from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' tells that in the city of [[Gubbio]], where Francis lived for some time, was a [[Wolf of Gubbio|wolf \"terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals\".]] Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at Francis' feet.\n\n\"Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil\", said Francis. \"All these people accuse you and curse you ... But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people.\" Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had \u201cdone evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner [[Gubbio]] was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.\n\nThree-quarters of a millennium after his death, St Francis remains an important figure and symbol in and out of Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. On 29 November 1979, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Saint Francis the Patron Saint of Ecology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |title=Inter Sanctos (Apostolic Letter AAS 71) |author=Pope John Paul II |date=29 November 1979 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809222858/http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |author-link=Pope John Paul II }}</ref>  During the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that Saint Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder \"not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us.\" The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, 1 January 1990, the saint of Assisi \"offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ...\" He went on to make the point that: \"As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation \u2013 animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon \u2013 to give honor and praise to the Lord.

It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for [[Apulia]] to enlist in the army of [[Walter III, Count of Brienne]]. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life.<ref name=\"ODCC Francis\"/> According to [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions. In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, \"Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen\", meaning his \"Lady Poverty\".<ref name=\"cefa\"/> \n[[File:Sassetta 001.jpg|thumb|''Saint Francis Abandons His Father''.

He said he had a mystical [[visions of Jesus and Mary|vision of Jesus Christ]] in the forsaken country chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]], just outside Assisi, in which the [[San Damiano cross|Icon of Christ Crucified]] said to him, \"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.\" He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose.<ref name=\"chest54\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;54\u201356</ref> When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nIn order to avoid his father's wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month.

Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the [[Bishop of Assisi]], Francis renounced his father and his [[Property|patrimony]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/> Some accounts report that he stripped himself naked in token of this renunciation, and the Bishop covered him with his own cloak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrinesf.org/life-of-st-francis.html|title=Life of St. Francis|first=Fr.

He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a [[penitent]], during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometer from Rivotorto, today on private property and once again in ruin); and the [[Porziuncola]], the little chapel of [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]] in the plain just below the town.<ref name=\"cefa\"/> This later became his favorite [[Dwelling|abode]].<ref name=\"chest54\"/> By degrees he took to nursing [[leper]]s, in the [[lazar house]]s near [[Assisi]].\n\n===Founding of the Franciscan Orders===\n====The Friars Minor====\nOne morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the \"Commissioning of the Twelve\" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around him with a knotted rope and went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n \nHis example drew others to him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a [[simple living|simple life]] in the deserted [[lazar house]] of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of [[Umbria]], making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n[[File:Legend of St. Francis by Giotto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Innocent III]] approving the statutes of the Order of the Franciscans, by [[Giotto]], 1295\u20131300]]\nIn 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (\"friars\"), the ''Regula primitiva'' or \"Primitive Rule\", which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was \"To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps\". He then led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from [[Pope Innocent III]] to found a new religious Order.<ref name=\"chest107\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;107\u2013108</ref> Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent&nbsp;III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance. The group was [[tonsure]]d.<ref name=\"Francis of Assisi and His World\">Galli(2002), pp.&nbsp;74\u201380</ref> This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier. Though a number of the Pope's counselors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order. This occurred, according to tradition, on 16 April 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]].<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> The group, then the \"Lesser Brothers\" (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order'' or the ''Seraphic Order''), were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, although he was later ordained a deacon.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n====The Poor Clares and the Third Order====\n[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil17.jpg|thumb|St. Clare is received by St. Francis, Josep Benlliure]]\nFrom then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations.  Hearing Francis preaching in the church of [[Assisi Cathedral|San Rufino]] in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman [[Clare of Assisi]] became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling. Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order, which he joined. On the night of [[Palm Sunday]], 28 March 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies.<ref name=\"chest110\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;110\u2013111</ref> This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a [[religious habit]], or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her in a nearby monastery of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns until he could provide a suitable retreat for her, and for her younger sister, [[Agnes of Assisi|Caterina]], and the other young women who had joined her. Later he transferred them to San Damiano,<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> to a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as [[Poor Clares]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nFor those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance]], a fraternity composed of either [[laity]] or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took [[religious vows]]. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy. The Third Order is now titled the [[Secular Franciscan Order]].\n\n===Travels===\nDetermined to bring the Gospel to all peoples of the World and convert them, after the example of the first disciples of Jesus, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On 8 May 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of [[La Verna]] (Alverna) as a gift from [[Count]] Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as \u201ceminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind\u201d.<ref>Fioretti quoted in: St. Francis, ''The Little Flowers, Legends, and Lauds'', trans. N. Wydenbruck, ed. Otto Karrer (London: [[Sheed and Ward]], 1979) 244.</ref> The mountain would become one of his favourite retreats for prayer.<ref name=\"chest130\">Chesterton (1924), p.130</ref>\n\nIn the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but this time an illness forced him to break off his journey in Spain. Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them [[Tommaso da Celano]], who would later write the biography of St. Francis), and some well-educated men joined his Order. In 1215, Francis may have gone to Rome for the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], but that is not certain. During this time, he probably met a [[canon (priest)|canon]], [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzman]]<ref name=\"chest126\">Chesterton (1924), p.126</ref> (later to be Saint Dominic, the founder of the [[Dominican Order#Foundation|Friars Preachers]], another [[Catholic religious order]]). In 1217, he offered to go to France. Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy.\n\nIn 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the [[Fifth Crusade]] where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of [[Damietta]] {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile. The Sultan, [[al-Kamil]], a nephew of [[Saladin]], had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on 29 August 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks.<ref>Runciman, Steven.

Tolan (p.126) discusses the incident as recounted by Bonaventure, an incident which does not extend to a fire actually being lit.</ref> It has been suggested that the winged figures atop the columns piercing the roof of the building on the left of the scene are not idols (as [[Erwin Panofsky]] had proposed) but are part of the secular iconography of the sultan, affirming his worldly power which, as the scene demonstrates, is limited even as regards his own \"priests\" who shun the challenge.<ref>P\u00e9ter Bokody, [https://www.academia.edu/1787059/Idolatry_or_Power_St._Francis_in_Front_of_the_Sultan  \"Idolatry or Power: St. Francis in Front of the Sultan\"], in: ''Promoting the Saints: Cults and Their Contexts from Late Antiquity until the Early Modern Period'', ed.

The scene in the fresco adopts a position midway between the two extremes. Since the idea was put forward by the German art historian, Friedrich Rintelen in 1912,<ref>Friedrich Rintelen, ''Giotto und die Giotto-apokryphen'', (1912)</ref> many scholars have expressed doubt that Giotto was the author of the Upper Church frescoes.\n\nAccording to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis.<ref>For grants of various permissions and privileges to Francis as attributed by later sources, see, e.g., Tolan, pp. 258\u2013263. The first mention of the Sultan's conversion occurs in a sermon delivered by Bonaventure on 4 October 1267. See Tolan, pp. 168</ref> The Franciscan Order has been present in the [[Holy Land]] almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions from the [[Mameluke]] Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]], and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from [[Pope Clement VI]] in 1342.<ref>Bulla ''Gratias agimus'', commemorated by Pope John Paul II in a [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1992/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19921130_p-schalluuck_it.html Letter] dated 30 November 1992.

On the Franciscan presence, including an historical overview, see, generally the official website at [http://www.custodia.org/default.asp?id=425 ''Custodia''] and [[Custodian of the Holy Land]]</ref>\n\n===Reorganization of the Franciscan Order===\n[[Image:Francis preaching the birds.fresco. master of st francis. Assisi.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Francis preaching to the birds outside of [[Bevagna]] ([[Master of Saint Francis]]).]] By this time, the growing Order of friars was divided into [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in [[Morocco]], Francis returned to Italy via [[Venice]].<ref name=\"b162\">Bonaventure (1867), p.&nbsp;162</ref> Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the \"First Rule\" or \"Rule Without a [[Papal Bull]]\" (''Regula prima'', ''Regula non bullata''), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nOn 29 September 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on 10 March 1221, and was buried there. When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans. Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life.\n[[File:Honorius_III_approving_the_Rule_of_St._Francis,_Bartolome_del_Castro,_c._1500_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Honorius III]] Approving the Rule of St. Francis of Assisi'', Bartolome del Castro, c. 1500 ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\nThe reports of miracles ceased. Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as [[Vicar]] of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the \"First Rule\", creating the \"Second Rule\" or \"Rule With a Bull\", which was approved by Pope Honorius III on 29 November 1223. As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars \"to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity\". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order. Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as [[Catania]] in Sicily and afterward as far north as [[Bologna]].\n\n=== Stigmata, final days, and Sainthood ===\n[[File:Cigoli, san francesco.jpg|thumb|Francis considered his [[stigmata]] part of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]''.<ref name=Goff>Le Goff, Jacques.

Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. \"Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ.\"<ref name=\"chest131\">Chesterton (1924), p.131</ref> Suffering from these stigmata and from [[trachoma]], Francis received care in several cities ([[Siena]], [[Cortona]], [[Nocera Umbra|Nocera]]) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where the Franciscan movement began, and feeling that the end of his life was approaching, he spent his last days dictating his spiritual testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, 3 October 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), ''\"Voce mea ad Dominum\"''.\n<!-- [[File:Traslaci\u00f3n de San Francisco de As\u00eds, de Benet Mercad\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The Passing of Saint Francis of Assisi (1866), by [[Benet Mercad\u00e9]]]] -->\n\nOn 16 July 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope [[Gregory IX]] (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, a friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in Assisi. Francis was buried on 25 May 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]], and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.\n\n==Character and legacy==\n[[Image:Francis_wolf.JPG|thumb|right|Saint Francis talking to the [[wolf of Gubbio]] ([[:de:Carl Weidemeyer|Carl Weidemeyer]], 1911)]] Francis set out to imitate Christ and literally carry out his work.

He believed that all creatures should praise God (a common theme in the Psalms) and the people have a duty to protect and enjoy nature as both the stewards of God's creation and as creatures ourselves.<ref name=\"b78\"/> Many of the stories that surround the life of Saint Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment.<ref name=\"b78\">Bonaventure (1867), pp.&nbsp;78\u201385</ref>\n\n[[File:St Francis Statue 2.JPG|thumb|left|A garden statue of Francis of Assisi with birds]]\nAn incident illustrating the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the \"Fioretti\" (\"Little Flowers\"), a collection of [[legend]]s and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. One day, while Francis was traveling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to \"wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.\"<ref name=\"b78\"/> The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.\n\nAnother legend from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' tells that in the city of [[Gubbio]], where Francis lived for some time, was a [[Wolf of Gubbio|wolf \"terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals\".]] Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at Francis' feet.\n\n\"Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil\", said Francis. \"All these people accuse you and curse you ... But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people.\" Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had \u201cdone evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner [[Gubbio]] was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.\n\nThree-quarters of a millennium after his death, St Francis remains an important figure and symbol in and out of Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. On 29 November 1979, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Saint Francis the Patron Saint of Ecology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |title=Inter Sanctos (Apostolic Letter AAS 71) |author=Pope John Paul II |date=29 November 1979 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809222858/http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |author-link=Pope John Paul II }}</ref>  During the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that Saint Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder \"not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us.\" The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, 1 January 1990, the saint of Assisi \"offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ...\" He went on to make the point that: \"As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation \u2013 animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon \u2013 to give honor and praise to the Lord.
