Researchers have observed in some studies that brain tumor patients (or their mothers) have generally consumed more cured foods (also known as [[Curing (food preservation)|Curing]]) than control groups.  Recently, Drs. Lee, Wrensch and others found that adults with glioma were more likely to consume diets high in cured foods and low in vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables, and to consume diets high in [[nitrites]] and low in [[vitamin C]]. The effect was more pronounced in men than women. However, the pattern of increased risk with increased consumption of cured foods, and decreased risk with greater consumption of fruits, vegetables, and antioxidant vitamins is compatible with other cancer studies that show increased consumption of vegetables and possibly of fruits is associated with decreased cancer risk.<ref>http://www.kallansklan.org/uploads/FactSheet-WhoGetsBTsv_20rev.pdf{{full citation needed|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Radiation ===\nA link between gliomas and [[electromagnetic radiation]] from [[cell phones]] has not been conclusively proven.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=S\u00f6derqvist |first1=Fredrik |last2=Carlberg |first2=Michael |last3=Mild |first3=Kjell Hansson |last4=Hardell |first4=Lennart |title=Childhood brain tumour risk and its association with wireless phones: a commentary |journal=Environmental Health |date=19 December 2011 |volume=10 |issue=106 |pages=106 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-10-106 |pmid=22182218 |pmc=3278351 }}</ref> It was considered possible,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morgana |first1=L.

Researchers have observed in some studies that brain tumor patients (or their mothers) have generally consumed more cured foods (also known as [[Curing (food preservation)|Curing]]) than control groups.  Recently, Drs. Lee, Wrensch and others found that adults with glioma were more likely to consume diets high in cured foods and low in vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables, and to consume diets high in [[nitrites]] and low in [[vitamin C]]. The effect was more pronounced in men than women. However, the pattern of increased risk with increased consumption of cured foods, and decreased risk with greater consumption of fruits, vegetables, and antioxidant vitamins is compatible with other cancer studies that show increased consumption of vegetables and possibly of fruits is associated with decreased cancer risk.<ref>http://www.kallansklan.org/uploads/FactSheet-WhoGetsBTsv_20rev.pdf{{full|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Radiation ===\nA link between gliomas and [[electromagnetic radiation]] from [[cell phones]] has not been conclusively proven.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=S\u00f6derqvist |first1=Fredrik |last2=Carlberg |first2=Michael |last3=Mild |first3=Kjell Hansson |last4=Hardell |first4=Lennart |title=Childhood brain tumour risk and its association with wireless phones: a commentary |journal=Environmental Health |date=19 December 2011 |volume=10 |issue=106 |pages=106 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-10-106 |pmid=22182218 |pmc=3278351 }}</ref> It was considered possible,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morgana |first1=L.
