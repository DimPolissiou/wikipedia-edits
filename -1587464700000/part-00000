{"title_page": "Hylomorphism", "text_new": "{{about|the concept of hylomorphism in Aristotelian philosophy|the concept in computer science|Hylomorphism (computer science)}}\n'''Hylomorphism''' (or '''hylemorphism''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory developed by [[Aristotle]], which conceives [[wiktionary:being|being]] ([[ousia]]) as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. The word is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words \u1f55\u03bb\u03b7 ''hyle'', \"wood, matter\", and \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae, ''morph\u0113'', \"form\".\n\n==Matter and form==\n{{further|Aristotle's biology}}\n\nAristotle defines X's matter as \"that out of which\" X is made.<ref>''Physics'' 194b23-24</ref> For example, letters are the matter of syllables.<ref>''Physics'' 195a16</ref> Thus, \"matter\" is a relative term:<ref>''Physics'' 194b9</ref> an object counts as matter relative to something else. For example, clay is matter relative to a brick because a brick is made of clay, whereas bricks are matter relative to a brick house.\n\nChange is analyzed as a material transformation: matter is what undergoes a change of form.<ref>Robinson 18-19</ref> For example, consider a lump of bronze that's shaped into a statue. Bronze is the matter, and this matter loses one form (''morphe'') (that of a lump) and gains a new form (that of a statue).<ref>''Physics'' 195a6-8</ref><ref>''Metaphysics'' 1045a26-29</ref>\n\nAccording to Aristotle's theory of [[perception]], we perceive an object by receiving its form (''eidos'') with our sense organs.<ref>''On the Soul'' 424a19</ref> Thus, forms include complex ''[[qualia]]'' such as colors, textures, and flavors, not just shapes.<ref>''On the Soul'' 418a11\u201312</ref>\n\n==Substantial form, accidental form, and prime matter==\n{{See also|Substantial form}}\nMedieval philosophers who used Aristotelian concepts frequently distinguished between [[substantial form]]s and accidental forms. A substance necessarily possesses at least one substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms. For Aristotle, a \"substance\" (''ousia'') is an individual thing\u2014for example, an individual man or an individual horse.<ref>''Categories'' 2a12-14</ref> The substantial form of substance S consists of S's essential properties,<ref>Cross 34</ref> the properties that S's matter needs in order to be the kind of substance that S is.<ref>Kenny 24</ref> In contrast, S's accidental forms are S's non-essential properties,<ref>Cross 94</ref> properties that S can lose or gain without changing into a different kind of substance.<ref>Kenny 24</ref>\n\nIn some cases, a substance's matter will itself be a substance. If substance A is made out of substance B, then substance B is the matter of substance A. However, what is the matter of a substance that is not made out of any other substance? According to Aristotelians, such a substance has only \"prime matter\" as its matter. Prime matter is matter with no substantial form of its own.<ref>Leftow 136-37</ref> Thus, it can change into various kinds of substances without remaining any kind of substance all the time.<ref>Kenny 25</ref>\n\n==Body\u2013soul hylomorphism==\n===Basic theory===\n{{See also|On the Soul|Aristotle's biology}}\n\nAristotle applies his theory of hylomorphism [[Aristotle's biology|to living things]]. He defines a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as that which makes a living thing alive.<ref>''On the Soul'' 413a20-21</ref> Life is a property of living things, just as knowledge and health are.<ref>''On the Soul'' 414a3-9</ref> Therefore, a soul is a form\u2014that is, a specifying principle or cause\u2014of a living thing.<ref>''On the Soul'' 412a20, 414a15-18</ref> Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.<ref>''On the Soul'' 412b5-7, 413a1-3, 414a15-18</ref>\n\nHence, Aristotle argues, there is no problem in explaining the unity of body and soul, just as there is no problem in explaining the unity of wax and its shape.<ref>412b5-6</ref> Just as a wax object consists of wax with a certain shape, so a living organism consists of  a body with the property of life, which is its soul. On the basis of his hylomorphic theory, Aristotle rejects the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine of [[reincarnation]], ridiculing the notion that just any soul could inhabit just any body.<ref>''On the Soul'' 407b20-24, 414a22-24</ref>\n\nAccording to Timothy Robinson, it is unclear whether Aristotle identifies the soul with the body's structure.<ref>Robinson 45-47</ref> According to one interpretation of Aristotle, a properly organized body is already alive simply by virtue of its structure.<ref>Robinson 46</ref> However, according to another interpretation, the property of life\u2014that is, the soul\u2014is something in addition to the body's structure. Robinson uses the analogy of a car to explain this second interpretation. A running car is running not only because of its structure but also because of the activity in its engine.<ref>Robinson 46</ref> Likewise, according to this second interpretation, a living body is alive not only because of its structure but also because of an additional property: the soul, which a properly organized body needs in order to be alive.<ref>Robinson 47</ref> John Vella uses [[Frankenstein]]'s monster to illustrate the second interpretation:<ref>Vella 92</ref> the corpse lying on Frankenstein's table is already a fully organized human body, but it is not yet alive; when Frankenstein activates his machine, the corpse gains a new property, the property of life, which Aristotle would call the soul.\n\n===Living bodies===\nSome scholars have pointed out a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism.<ref>Shields, ''Aristotle'' 290-93</ref> According to Aristotle, a living thing's matter is its body, which needs a soul in order to be alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death.<ref>Shields, ''Aristotle'' 291</ref> However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death.<ref>''On the Soul'' 412b19-24</ref> Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive.<ref>412b15</ref> But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.\n\nOne approach to resolving this problem<ref>Shields, ''Aristotle'' 293</ref> relies on the fact that a living body is constantly replacing old matter with new. A five-year-old body consists of different matter than does the same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old and the seventy-year-old bodies share a soul\u2014that is, the person's life\u2014we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.\n\nAnother approach to resolving the problem<ref>Shields, \"A Fundamental Problem\"</ref> relies on a distinction between \"proximate\" and \"non-proximate\" matter. When Aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing, he may be using the word \"body\" to refer to the matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this \"body\" remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same after its death, he is using the word \"body\" to refer to the fully organized body.\n\n===Intellect===\n{{See also|Nous|Active intellect|Passive intellect}}\nAristotle says that the intellect (''[[nous]]''), the ability to think, has no bodily organ (in contrast with other psychological abilities, such as sense-perception and imagination).<ref>''On the Soul'' 429a26-27</ref> In fact, he says that it is not mixed with the body<ref>''On the Soul'' 429a24-25</ref> and suggests that it can exist apart from the body.<ref>''On the Soul'' 413b24-26, 429b6</ref> This can be made sense of by thinking about the teachings of his teacher; Plato's Timaeus tells the story of the cosmic nous' process for the creation of our world--in it, the maker put nous in soul and soul in body, bringing life and order to our world.\n\nAristotle distinguishes between two types of intellect.<ref>''On the Soul'' 15-25</ref> These two intellectual powers are traditionally called the \"[[passive intellect]]\" and the \"[[active intellect|active (or agent) intellect]]\".<ref>Robinson 50</ref>\n\nAccording to one interpretation, a person's ability to think (unlike his other psychological abilities) belongs to some incorporeal organ distinct from his body.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Psychology\" 337</ref> This would amount to a form of dualism.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Psychology\" 337</ref> However, according to some scholars, it would not be a full-fledged [[Mind-body dualism#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]].<ref>Shields, \"Some Recent Approaches\" 165</ref> This interpretation creates what Robert Pasnau has called the \"mind-soul problem\": if the intellect belongs to an entity distinct from the body, and the soul is the form of the body, then how is the intellect part of the soul?<ref>Pasnau 160</ref>\n\nAnother interpretation rests on the distinction between the passive intellect and the agent intellect. According to this interpretation, the passive intellect is a property of the body, while the agent intellect is a substance distinct from the body.<ref>McEvilley 534</ref><ref>Vella 110</ref> Some proponents of this interpretation think that each person has his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Two Intellects\" 207</ref><ref>Vella 110</ref> Others interpret the agent intellect as a single divine being, perhaps the [[unmoved mover]], Aristotle's God.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Psychology\" 339</ref><ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Two Intellects\" 199</ref>\n\nA third interpretation<ref>Shields, \"Soul as Subject\"</ref> relies on the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.<ref>Shields, \"Soul as Subject\" 142</ref> According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself, not of the body. If that is the case, then the soul is the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.<ref>Shields, \"Soul as Subject\" 145</ref>\n\n==Universal hylomorphism==\nThe [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol|Avicebron (''a.k.a.''Solomon Ibn Gabirol)]] proposed a Neoplatonic version of this Aristotelian concept, according to which all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form.<ref name=stanford>{{cite encyclopedia\n | last1 = Pessin\n | first1 = Sarah\n | editor-last = Zalta\n | editor-first = Edward N.\n | title = Solomon Ibn Gabirol [Avicebron]\n | encyclopedia = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n | edition = Summer 2014\n | date = April 18, 2014\n | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-gabirol/\n | accessdate = October 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Medieval modifications==\n[[Medieval]] [[theology|theologians]], newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christian doctrines such as the [[transubstantiation]] of the Eucharist's bread and wine into the body and blood of [[Jesus]]. Theologians such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.\n\n===Plurality vs. unity of substantial form===\nMany medieval theologians and philosophers followed Aristotle in seeing a living being's soul as that being's form\u2014specifically, its substantial form. However, they disagreed about whether X's soul is X's ''only'' substantial form. Some medieval thinkers argued that X's soul is X's only substantial form, responsible for all of the features of X's body.<ref>Kenny 26</ref> In contrast, other medieval thinkers argued that a living being contains at least two substantial forms\u2014(1) the shape and structure of its body, and (2) its soul, which makes its body alive.<ref>Cross 70</ref>\n\n===Thomistic hylomorphism===\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] claimed that X's soul was X's only [[substantial form]], although X also had numerous accidental forms that accounted for X's nonessential features.<ref>Stump, \"Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul\" 161</ref> Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which in the case of a human being is [[reason|rational capacity]].<ref>Leftow, \"Soul, Mind, and Brain\" 397</ref> He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms.<ref>Stump, \"Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul\" 165</ref> However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person.<ref>Eberl 340</ref> He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person.<ref>Eberl 341</ref> So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.<ref>Stump, \"Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul\" 161</ref>\n\n[[Eleonore Stump]] describes Aquinas' theory of the soul in terms of \"configuration\". The body is matter that is \"configured\", i.e. structured, while the soul is a \"configured configurer\". In other words, the soul is itself a configured thing, but it also configures the body.<ref>Stump, \"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 514</ref>  A dead body is merely matter that was once configured by the soul. It does not possess the configuring capacity of a human being.\n\nAquinas believed that rational capacity was a property of the soul alone, not of any bodily organ.<ref>Stump,\"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 512</ref> However, he did believe that the brain had some basic cognitive function.<ref>Stump, \"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 512</ref> Aquinas\u2019 attribution of rational capacity to the soul allowed him to claim that disembodied souls could retain their rational capacity, although he was adamant that such a state was unnatural.<ref>Stump, \"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 519</ref>\n\n==Teleology and ethics==\n{{See also|Nicomachean Ethics}}\nAristotle holds a [[teleology|teleological]] worldview: he sees the universe as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists for the sake of actuality.<ref>Irwin 237</ref> Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form,<ref>''Metaphysics'' 1050a15</ref> and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing.<ref>Irwin 237</ref> Now, each thing has certain potentialities as a result of its form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither; we can say that the snake ''ought to'' slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.\n\nAristotle bases his [[ethics|ethical]] theory on this teleological worldview. Because of his form, a human being has certain abilities. Hence, his purpose in life is to exercise those abilities as well and as fully as possible.<ref>''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a16-18</ref> Now, the most characteristic human ability, which is not included in the form of any other organism, is the ability to think.<ref>''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a1-5</ref> Therefore, the best human life is a life lived rationally.<ref>''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a7-8</ref> .....\n\n==Modern physics==\nThe idea of hylomorphism can be said to have been reintroduced to the world when [[Werner Heisenberg]] invented his duplex world of [[quantum mechanics]]. In his 1958 text ''Physics and Philosophy'', Heisenberg states:\n\n{{quote|In the experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any phenomena in daily life. But atoms and the elementary particles themselves are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts ... The probability wave ... mean[s] tendency for something. It's a quantitative version of the old concept of potentia from Aristotle's philosophy. It introduces something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|title=Physics and Philosophy|year=1958|publisher=Allen and Unwin|location=London|page=41}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Endurantism]]\n* [[Hyle]]\n* [[Hylozoism]]\n* [[Inherence]]\n* [[Materialism]]\n* [[Substance theory]]\n* [[Substantial form]]\n* [[Vitalism]]\n* [[Moderate realism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Aristotle.\n** ''Metaphysics''\n** ''Nichomachean Ethics''\n** ''On the Soul.''\n** ''Physics''\n* Caston, Victor.\n** \"Aristotle's Psychology\".

A substance necessarily possesses at least one substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms. For Aristotle, a \"substance\" (''ousia'') is an individual thing\u2014for example, an individual man or an individual horse.<ref>''Categories'' 2a12-14</ref> The substantial form of substance S consists of S's essential properties,<ref>Cross 34</ref> the properties that S's matter needs in order to be the kind of substance that S is.<ref>Kenny 24</ref> In contrast, S's accidental forms are S's non-essential properties,<ref>Cross 94</ref> properties that S can lose or gain without changing into a different kind of substance.<ref>Kenny 24</ref>\n\nIn some cases, a substance's matter will itself be a substance.

He defines a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as that which makes a living thing alive.<ref>''On the Soul'' 413a20-21</ref> Life is a property of living things, just as knowledge and health are.<ref>''On the Soul'' 414a3-9</ref> Therefore, a soul is a form\u2014that is, a specifying principle or cause\u2014of a living thing.<ref>''On the Soul'' 412a20, 414a15-18</ref> Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.<ref>''On the Soul'' 412b5-7, 413a1-3, 414a15-18</ref>\n\nHence, Aristotle argues, there is no problem in explaining the unity of body and soul, just as there is no problem in explaining the unity of wax and its shape.<ref>412b5-6</ref> Just as a wax object consists of wax with a certain shape, so a living organism consists of  a body with the property of life, which is its soul.

Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death.<ref>Shields, ''Aristotle'' 291</ref> However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death.<ref>''On the Soul'' 412b19-24</ref> Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive.<ref>412b15</ref> But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.\n\nOne approach to resolving this problem<ref>Shields, ''Aristotle'' 293</ref> relies on the fact that a living body is constantly replacing old matter with new.

When Aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing, he may be using the word \"body\" to refer to the matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this \"body\" remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same after its death, he is using the word \"body\" to refer to the fully organized body.\n\n===Intellect===\n{{See also|Nous|Active intellect|Passive intellect}}\nAristotle says that the intellect (''[[nous]]''), the ability to think, has no bodily organ (in contrast with other psychological abilities, such as sense-perception and imagination).<ref>''On the Soul'' 429a26-27</ref> In fact, he says that it is not mixed with the body<ref>''On the Soul'' 429a24-25</ref> and suggests that it can exist apart from the body.<ref>''On the Soul'' 413b24-26, 429b6</ref> This seems to contradict Aristotle's claim that the soul is a form or property of the body. To complicate matters further, Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds, or two parts, of intellect.<ref>''On the Soul'' 15-25''</ref> These two intellectual powers are traditionally called the \"[[passive intellect]]\" and the \"[[active intellect|active (or agent) intellect]]\".<ref>Robinson 50</ref> Thus, interpreters of Aristotle have faced the problem of explaining how the intellect fits into Aristotle's hylomorphic theory of the soul.\n\nAccording to one interpretation, a person's ability to think (unlike his other psychological abilities) belongs to some incorporeal organ distinct from his body.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Psychology\" 337</ref> This would amount to a form of dualism.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Psychology\" 337</ref> However, according to some scholars, it would not be a full-fledged [[Mind-body dualism#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]].<ref>Shields, \"Some Recent Approaches\" 165</ref> This interpretation creates what Robert Pasnau has called the \"mind-soul problem\": if the intellect belongs to an entity distinct from the body, and the soul is the form of the body, then how is the intellect part of the soul?<ref>Pasnau 160</ref>\n\nAnother interpretation rests on the distinction between the passive intellect and the agent intellect. According to this interpretation, the passive intellect is a property of the body, while the agent intellect is a substance distinct from the body.<ref>McEvilley 534</ref><ref>Vella 110</ref> Some proponents of this interpretation think that each person has his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Two Intellects\" 207</ref><ref>Vella 110</ref> Others interpret the agent intellect as a single divine being, perhaps the [[unmoved mover]], Aristotle's God.<ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Psychology\" 339</ref><ref>Caston, \"Aristotle's Two Intellects\" 199</ref>\n\nA third interpretation<ref>Shields, \"Soul as Subject\"</ref> relies on the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.<ref>Shields, \"Soul as Subject\" 142</ref> According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself, not of the body. If that is the case, then the soul is the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.<ref>Shields, \"Soul as Subject\" 145</ref>\n\n==Universal hylomorphism==\nThe [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol|Avicebron (''a.k.a.''Solomon Ibn Gabirol)]] proposed a Neoplatonic version of this Aristotelian concept, according to which all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form.<ref name=stanford>{{cite encyclopedia\n | last1 = Pessin\n | first1 = Sarah\n | editor-last = Zalta\n | editor-first = Edward N.\n | title = Solomon Ibn Gabirol [Avicebron]\n | encyclopedia = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n | edition = Summer 2014\n | date = April 18, 2014\n | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-gabirol/\n | accessdate = October 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Medieval modifications==\n[[Medieval]] [[theology|theologians]], newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christian doctrines such as the [[transubstantiation]] of the Eucharist's bread and wine into the body and blood of [[Jesus]]. Theologians such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.\n\n===Plurality vs. unity of substantial form===\nMany medieval theologians and philosophers followed Aristotle in seeing a living being's soul as that being's form\u2014specifically, its substantial form. However, they disagreed about whether X's soul is X's ''only'' substantial form. Some medieval thinkers argued that X's soul is X's only substantial form, responsible for all of the features of X's body.<ref>Kenny 26</ref> In contrast, other medieval thinkers argued that a living being contains at least two substantial forms\u2014(1) the shape and structure of its body, and (2) its soul, which makes its body alive.<ref>Cross 70</ref>\n\n===Thomistic hylomorphism===\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] claimed that X's soul was X's only [[substantial form]], although X also had numerous accidental forms that accounted for X's nonessential features.<ref>Stump, \"Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul\" 161</ref> Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which in the case of a human being is [[reason|rational capacity]].<ref>Leftow, \"Soul, Mind, and Brain\" 397</ref> He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms.<ref>Stump, \"Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul\" 165</ref> However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person.<ref>Eberl 340</ref> He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person.<ref>Eberl 341</ref> So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.<ref>Stump, \"Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul\" 161</ref>\n\n[[Eleonore Stump]] describes Aquinas' theory of the soul in terms of \"configuration\". The body is matter that is \"configured\", i.e. structured, while the soul is a \"configured configurer\". In other words, the soul is itself a configured thing, but it also configures the body.<ref>Stump, \"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 514</ref>  A dead body is merely matter that was once configured by the soul. It does not possess the configuring capacity of a human being.\n\nAquinas believed that rational capacity was a property of the soul alone, not of any bodily organ.<ref>Stump,\"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 512</ref> However, he did believe that the brain had some basic cognitive function.<ref>Stump, \"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 512</ref> Aquinas\u2019 attribution of rational capacity to the soul allowed him to claim that disembodied souls could retain their rational capacity, although he was adamant that such a state was unnatural.<ref>Stump, \"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism\" 519</ref>\n\n==Teleology and ethics==\n{{See also|Nicomachean Ethics}}\nAristotle holds a [[teleology|teleological]] worldview: he sees the universe as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists for the sake of actuality.<ref>Irwin 237</ref> Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form,<ref>''Metaphysics'' 1050a15</ref> and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing.<ref>Irwin 237</ref> Now, each thing has certain potentialities as a result of its form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither; we can say that the snake ''ought to'' slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.\n\nAristotle bases his [[ethics|ethical]] theory on this teleological worldview. Because of his form, a human being has certain abilities. Hence, his purpose in life is to exercise those abilities as well and as fully as possible.<ref>''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a16-18</ref> Now, the most characteristic human ability, which is not included in the form of any other organism, is the ability to think.<ref>''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a1-5</ref> Therefore, the best human life is a life lived rationally.<ref>''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a7-8</ref> .....\n\n==Modern physics==\nThe idea of hylomorphism can be said to have been reintroduced to the world when [[Werner Heisenberg]] invented his duplex world of [[quantum mechanics]]. In his 1958 text ''Physics and Philosophy'', Heisenberg states:\n\n{{quote|In the experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any phenomena in daily life. But atoms and the elementary particles themselves are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts ... The probability wave ... mean[s] tendency for something. It's a quantitative version of the old concept of potentia from Aristotle's philosophy. It introduces something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|title=Physics and Philosophy|year=1958|publisher=Allen and Unwin|location=London|page=41}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Endurantism]]\n* [[Hyle]]\n* [[Hylozoism]]\n* [[Inherence]]\n* [[Materialism]]\n* [[Substance theory]]\n* [[Substantial form]]\n* [[Vitalism]]\n* [[Moderate realism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Aristotle.\n** ''Metaphysics''\n** ''Nichomachean Ethics''\n** ''On the Soul.''\n** ''Physics''\n* Caston, Victor.\n** \"Aristotle's Psychology\".

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|title=Second-Generation Su-27s & Derivatives|author=Greg Goebel/chapter 2 of 2/ public domain|accessdate=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140354/http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-30LL demonstrator flying along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport less than 1 metre off the ground.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30LL flying along the runway at [[Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport]] extremely close to the ground piloted by [[Anatoly Kvochur]] ]]\n\nThe Su-30 is a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighter.]] It has a two-seat cockpit with an [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrake]] behind the canopy.\n\n===Flight characteristics===\nThe integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the [[thrust vectoring]] control ability, results in high manoeuvrability and unique takeoff and landing characteristics. Equipped with a digital [[fly-by-wire]] system, the Su-30 is able to perform some very advanced manoeuvres, including the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and the [[tailslide]]. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[Radar lock-on|radar-lock]], as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |title=Discovering Novel Fighter Combat Maneuvers. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103641/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Powerplant===\nThe aircraft's powerplant incorporates two Saturn [[AL-31]]F [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[low-bypass turbofan]] engines, fed through [[intake ramp]]s.

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|title=Second-Generation Su-27s & Derivatives|author=Greg Goebel/chapter 2 of 2/ public domain|accessdate=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140354/http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-30LL demonstrator flying along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport less than 1 metre off the ground.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30LL flying along the runway at [[Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport]] extremely close to the ground piloted by [[Anatoly Kvochur]] ]]\n\nThe Su-30 is a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighter.]] It has a two-seat cockpit with an [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrake]] behind the canopy.\n\n===Flight characteristics===\nThe integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the [[thrust vectoring]] control ability, results in high manoeuvrability and unique takeoff and landing characteristics. Equipped with a digital [[fly-by-wire]] system, the Su-30 is able to perform some very advanced manoeuvres, including the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and the [[tailslide]]. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[Radar lock-on|radar-lock]], as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |title=Discovering Novel Fighter Combat Maneuvers. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103641/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Powerplant===\nThe aircraft's powerplant incorporates two Saturn [[AL-31]]F [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[low-bypass turbofan]] engines, fed through [[intake ramp]]s.

The following year, games were played between [[Australia]] and a touring [[Meath GAA|County Meath]] Gaelic football team, Meath being the reigning [[1967 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland senior football champions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footystamps.com/ot_int_rules.htm|title=History of International Rules Football|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref> Following intermittent international tests between Australia and Ireland, the [[International Rules Series]] between the senior [[Australian international rules football team]] and [[Ireland international rules football team]] has been played intermittently since 1984, and has generally been a closely matched contest.  The sport has raised interest and exposure in developing markets for Gaelic and Australian football and has been considered a development tool by governing bodies of both codes, particularly by the [[AFL Commission]].\n\nInternational rules football does not have any dedicated clubs or leagues. It is currently played by men's, women's, and junior teams only in [[tournament|tournaments]] or Test matches.\n\n==Rules==\n===Overview===\nThe rules are designed to provide a compromise or combine between those of the two codes,  with Gaelic football players being advantaged by the use of a round ball and a rectangular field measured about {{convert|160|yd|m|order=flip|abbr=in}} long by {{convert|98|yd|m|order=flip|abbr=in}} wide (Australian rules uses an oval ball and field), while the Australian rules football players benefit from the opportunity to [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] by grabbing between the shoulders and thighs and pulling to the ground, something banned in Gaelic football. The game also introduces the concept of the [[mark (Australian football)|mark]], from Australian rules football, with a free kick awarded for a ball caught from a kick of over {{convert|15|m|yd}}, where the kick must be in the forward direction if originating from a teammate.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n \nA player must bounce, solo (kick into one's own hands) or touch the ball on the ground once every {{convert|10|m|yd}} or six steps.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> A maximum of two bounces per possession are allowed, while players can solo the ball as often as they wish on a possession.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> Unlike in Gaelic football, the ball may be lifted directly off the ground, without putting a foot underneath it first.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> Players however cannot scoop the ball off the ground to a team-mate, nor pick up the ball if they are on their knees or on the ground.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> If a foul is committed, a free kick will be awarded, though referees (called umpires in Australian Rules) can give the fouled player advantage to play on at their discretion.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n\n[[File:International Rules Football scores.png|thumb|500px|Scoring in International rules football]]\n\nThe game uses two large posts usually set {{convert|6.5|m|yd|0}} apart, and connected {{convert|2.5|m|yd}} above the ground by a [[Goal (sport)|crossbar]] with a goal net that could extend behind the goalposts and attached to the crossbar and lower goalposts, as in Gaelic football. A further {{convert|6.5|m|yd|0}} apart on either side of those and not connected by a crossbar are 2 small posts, known as behind posts, as in Australian rules football.\n\nPoints are scored as follows:\n\n* Under the crossbar and into the goal net (a goal): 6 points, umpire waves a green flag and raises both index fingers.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\">{{cite news |first=Paddy |last=Heaney |title=The rules of engagement: A brief guide |work=[[The Irish News]] |page=58 |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate= |quote= |url= }}</ref>\n* Over the crossbar and between the two large posts (an over): 3 points, umpire waves red flag and raises one arm above his head.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n* Between either of the large posts and small posts (a behind): 1 point, umpire waves white flag and raises one index finger.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n\nScores are written so as to clarify how many of each type of score were made as well as, like Australian football, giving the total points score for each team; for example, if a team scores one goal, four overs and 10 behinds, the score is written as 1\u20134\u201310 (28), meaning one goal (six points) plus 4 overs (4 \u00d7 3 = 12 points) plus 10 behinds (10 \u00d7 1 = 10 points), for a total score of 28 points.\n\nAn international rules match lasts for 72 minutes (divided into four quarters of 18 minutes each).<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> Inter-county Gaelic football matches go on for 70 minutes, divided into two halves, and Australian rules matches consist of four 20 minute quarters of game time, although with the addition of [[Time on (Australian rules football)|stoppage time]], most quarters actually last between 25 and 30 minutes.\n\nAs in Gaelic football, teams consist of fifteen players, including a [[goalkeeper]], whereas eighteen are used in Australian rules (with no keeper).\n\n===Alterations===\nA number of rule changes were introduced before the [[2006 International Rules Series]]:\n\n* Match time reduced from 80 minutes to 72 minutes. Time per quarter was reduced from 20 minutes to 18 minutes.\n* A player who received a red card is to be sent off and no replacement is allowed; in addition to this a penalty is awarded regardless of where the incident takes place. (Previously a replacement ''was'' allowed and a penalty was only awarded if the incident happened in the penalty area.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2006/0125/200635-international/|title=Rule changes for International series agreed |website=Rte.ie |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2017-03-15}}</ref>\n* A yellow card now means a 15-minute [[penalty box|sin bin]] for the offending player, who will be sent off if he receives a second card.<ref name=\"2006changes\">[https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2006/0125/200635-international/]</ref>\n\nFurther alterations were made before the [[2008 International Rules Series]]:\n* Maximum of 10<ref name=\"time for talk\">{{cite news |first=Paddy |last=Heaney |title=Time for talk is over |work=[[The Irish News]] |page=58 |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate= |quote= |url= }}</ref> interchanges per quarter.\n* Teams are allowed only four consecutive hand passes (ball must then be kicked).<ref name=\"time for talk\"/>\n<!--* Match time reduced from 80 minutes to 72 minutes (18 minutes per quarter).<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>-->\n* The goalkeeper can no longer kick the ball to himself from the kick-out.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n* Suspensions may carry over to GAA and AFL matches if the Match Review Panel sees fit.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n* A dangerous \"slinging\" tackle will be an automatic red card.\n* A [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)#Bumping|front-on bump]] (known as a shirtfront in Australian football) endangering the head will result in a red card.\n* Physical intimidation can result in a yellow card.\n* The keeper cannot be tackled or touched when the keeper is charging.\n* An independent referee can cite players for reportable offences from the stands.\n* Yellow card sin bin reduced to 10 minutes.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n\nThe most recent changes were made ahead of the [[2014 International Rules Series]]:\n* Maximum number of interchanges per quarter increased from 10 to 16.\n* Unlimited number of interchanges allowed at quarter and half time breaks.\n* Number of consecutive hand-passes teams are allowed increased from 4 to 6.\n* Marks will not be paid for backwards kicks caught by a teammate.\n* Goalkeepers required to kick the ball out beyond the 45&nbsp;m line after all wides, behinds and overs.\n* Failure of a goalkeeper to kick over the 45&nbsp;m line will result in a free kick to the opposition (from the 45&nbsp;m line).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/international-rules/2014/0722/632344-no-more-short-kick-outs-for-international-rules/ |title=No more short kick-outs for International Rules |website=Rte.ie |date=2014-07-22 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:Intrules.jpg|thumb|The June 2014 International Rules match at the University of Birmingham]]\n\nInternational rules has been played in various locations throughout North America and the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and Australia and New Zealand between fledgling Australian rules football and Gaelic football clubs.\n\nIn 2006, an exhibition match between South African youth teams and an [[Indigenous Australian]] touring side composed of players from the [[Clontarf Foundation]], led by [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]]'s [[Adam Goodes]], was held at [[Potchefstroom, North West|Potchefstroom]].\n\nThe [[University of Birmingham]] holds an annual International Rules match between its Australian Rules football team and its Gaelic Football team, with the 2013 edition won by the Australian Rules team 56\u201355, before a crowd of over 400 students.<ref name=\"Aussie Rules claims victory\">{{cite news|title=Aussie Rules claim victory against Gaelic Football|work=[[University of Birmingham]]|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=14 June 2013|url=http://www.sport.bham.ac.uk/news.aspx?itemid=3781&itemTitle=Aussie+Rules+claim+victory+against+Gaelic+Football&sitesectionid=32&sitesectiontitle=Latest+News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215226/http://www.sport.bham.ac.uk/news.aspx?itemid=3781&itemTitle=Aussie+Rules+claim+victory+against+Gaelic+Football&sitesectionid=32&sitesectiontitle=Latest+News|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[International Rules Series]], the most well-known International Rules event, Australia and Ireland are at an impasse, with 10 series wins apiece.

The following year, games were played between [[Australia]] and a touring [[Meath GAA|County Meath]] Gaelic football team, Meath being the reigning [[1967 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland senior football champions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footystamps.com/ot_int_rules.htm|title=History of International Rules Football|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref> Following intermittent international tests between Australia and Ireland, the [[International Rules Series]] between the senior [[Australian international rules football team]] and [[Ireland international rules football team]] has been played intermittently since 1984, and has generally been a closely matched contest.  The sport has raised interest and exposure in developing markets for Gaelic and Australian football and has been considered a development tool by governing bodies of both codes, particularly by the [[AFL Commission]].\n\nInternational rules football does not have any dedicated clubs or leagues. It is currently played by men's, women's, and junior teams only in [[tournament|tournaments]] or Test matches.\n\n==Rules==\n===Overview===\nThe rules are designed to provide a compromise or combine between those of the two codes,  with Gaelic football players being advantaged by the use of a round ball and a rectangular field measured about {{convert|160|yd|m|order=flip|abbr=in}} long by {{convert|98|yd|m|order=flip|abbr=in}} wide (Australian rules uses an oval ball and field), while the Australian rules football players benefit from the opportunity to [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] by grabbing between the shoulders and thighs and pulling to the ground, something banned in Gaelic football. The game also introduces the concept of the [[mark (Australian football)|mark]], from Australian rules football, with a free kick awarded for a ball caught from a kick of over {{convert|15|m|yd}}, where the kick must be in the forward direction if originating from a teammate.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n \nA player must bounce, solo (kick into one's own hands) or touch the ball on the ground once every {{convert|10|m|yd}} or six steps.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> A maximum of two bounces per possession are allowed, while players can solo the ball as often as they wish on a possession.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> Unlike in Gaelic football, the ball may be lifted directly off the ground, without putting a foot underneath it first.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> Players however cannot scoop the ball off the ground to a team-mate, nor pick up the ball if they are on their knees or on the ground.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> If a foul is committed, a free kick will be awarded, though referees (called umpires in Australian Rules) can give the fouled player advantage to play on at their discretion.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n\n[[File:International Rules Football scores.png|thumb|500px|Scoring in International rules football]]\n\nThe game uses two large posts usually set {{convert|6.5|m|yd|0}} apart, and connected {{convert|2.5|m|yd}} above the ground by a [[Goal (sport)|crossbar]] with a goal net that could extend behind the goalposts and attached to the crossbar and lower goalposts, as in Gaelic football. A further {{convert|6.5|m|yd|0}} apart on either side of those and not connected by a crossbar are 2 small posts, known as behind posts, as in Australian rules football.\n\nPoints are scored as follows:\n\n* Under the crossbar and into the goal net (a goal): 6 points, umpire waves a green flag and raises both index fingers.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\">{{cite news |first=Paddy |last=Heaney |title=The rules of engagement: A brief guide |work=[[The Irish News]] |page=58 |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate= |quote= |url= }}</ref>\n* Over the crossbar and between the two large posts (an over): 3 points, umpire waves red flag and raises one arm above his head.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n* Between either of the large posts and small posts (a behind): 1 point, umpire waves white flag and raises one index finger.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n\nScores are written so as to clarify how many of each type of score were made as well as, like Australian football, giving the total points score for each team; for example, if a team scores one goal, four overs and 10 behinds, the score is written as 1\u20134\u201310 (28), meaning one goal (six points) plus 4 overs (4 \u00d7 3 = 12 points) plus 10 behinds (10 \u00d7 1 = 10 points), for a total score of 28 points.\n\nAn international rules match lasts for 72 minutes (divided into four quarters of 18 minutes each).<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/> Inter-county Gaelic football matches go on for 70 minutes, divided into two halves, and Australian rules matches consist of four 20 minute quarters of game time, although with the addition of [[Time on (Australian rules football)|stoppage time]], most quarters actually last between 25 and 30 minutes.\n\nAs in Gaelic football, teams consist of fifteen players, including a [[goalkeeper]], whereas eighteen are used in Australian rules (with no keeper).\n\n===Alterations===\nA number of rule changes were introduced before the [[2006 International Rules Series]]:\n\n* Match time reduced from 80 minutes to 72 minutes. Time per quarter was reduced from 20 minutes to 18 minutes.\n* A player who received a red card is to be sent off and no replacement is allowed; in addition to this a penalty is awarded regardless of where the incident takes place. (Previously a replacement ''was'' allowed and a penalty was only awarded if the incident happened in the penalty area.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2006/0125/200635-international/|title=Rule changes for International series agreed |website=Rte.ie |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2017-03-15}}</ref>\n* A yellow card now means a 15-minute [[penalty box|sin bin]] for the offending player, who will be sent off if he receives a second card.<ref name=\"2006changes\">[https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2006/0125/200635-international/]</ref>\n\nFurther alterations were made before the [[2008 International Rules Series]]:\n* Maximum of 10<ref name=\"time for talk\">{{cite news |first=Paddy |last=Heaney |title=Time for talk is over |work=[[The Irish News]] |page=58 |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate= |quote= |url= }}</ref> interchanges per quarter.\n* Teams are allowed only four consecutive hand passes (ball must then be kicked).<ref name=\"time for talk\"/>\n<!--* Match time reduced from 80 minutes to 72 minutes (18 minutes per quarter).<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>-->\n* The goalkeeper can no longer kick the ball to himself from the kick-out.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n* Suspensions may carry over to GAA and AFL matches if the Match Review Panel sees fit.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n* A dangerous \"slinging\" tackle will be an automatic red card.\n* A [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)#Bumping|front-on bump]] (known as a shirtfront in Australian football) endangering the head will result in a red card.\n* Physical intimidation can result in a yellow card.\n* The keeper cannot be tackled or touched when the keeper is charging.\n* An independent referee can cite players for reportable offences from the stands.\n* Yellow card sin bin reduced to 10 minutes.<ref name=\"rules of engagement\"/>\n\nThe most recent changes were made ahead of the [[2014 International Rules Series]]:\n* Maximum number of interchanges per quarter increased from 10 to 16.\n* Unlimited number of interchanges allowed at quarter and half time breaks.\n* Number of consecutive hand-passes teams are allowed increased from 4 to 6.\n* Marks will not be paid for backwards kicks caught by a teammate.\n* Goalkeepers required to kick the ball out beyond the 45&nbsp;m line after all wides, behinds and overs.\n* Failure of a goalkeeper to kick over the 45&nbsp;m line will result in a free kick to the opposition (from the 45&nbsp;m line).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/international-rules/2014/0722/632344-no-more-short-kick-outs-for-international-rules/ |title=No more short kick-outs for International Rules |website=Rte.ie |date=2014-07-22 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:Intrules.jpg|thumb|The June 2014 International Rules match at the University of Birmingham]]\n\nInternational rules has been played in various locations throughout North America and the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and Australia and New Zealand between fledgling Australian rules football and Gaelic football clubs.\n\nIn 2006, an exhibition match between South African youth teams and an [[Indigenous Australian]] touring side composed of players from the [[Clontarf Foundation]], led by [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]]'s [[Adam Goodes]], was held at [[Potchefstroom, North West|Potchefstroom]].\n\nThe [[University of Birmingham]] holds an annual International Rules match between its Australian Rules football team and its Gaelic Football team, with the 2013 edition won by the Australian Rules team 56\u201355, before a crowd of over 400 students.<ref name=\"Aussie Rules claims victory\">{{cite news|title=Aussie Rules claim victory against Gaelic Football|work=[[University of Birmingham]]|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=14 June 2013|url=http://www.sport.bham.ac.uk/news.aspx?itemid=3781&itemTitle=Aussie+Rules+claim+victory+against+Gaelic+Football&sitesectionid=32&sitesectiontitle=Latest+News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215226/http://www.sport.bham.ac.uk/news.aspx?itemid=3781&itemTitle=Aussie+Rules+claim+victory+against+Gaelic+Football&sitesectionid=32&sitesectiontitle=Latest+News|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[International Rules Series]], the most well-known International Rules event, Australia and Ireland are at an impasse, with 10 series wins apiece.

Rather began his career in Texas, becoming a national name after his reporting saved thousands of lives during [[Hurricane Carla]] in September 1961. Rather spontaneously created the first radar weather report by overlaying a transparent map over a radar image of Hurricane Carla. In his first national broadcast, he helped initiate the successful evacuation of 350,000 people.\n\nRather reported from Dallas in November 1963 at the time of the President [[Kennedy assassination]]. Based on his reporting, he was promoted at [[CBS News]], where he served as White House correspondent beginning in 1964. He served as foreign correspondent in London and Vietnam over the next two years before returning to the White House correspondent position. He covered the [[presidency of Richard Nixon]], including Nixon's trip to China, the Watergate scandal, and the president's resignation.\n\nIn 1981, Rather was promoted to [[news presenter|news anchor]] for the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', a role he occupied for 24 years. Along with [[Peter Jennings]] at [[ABC News]] and [[Tom Brokaw]] at [[NBC News]], he was one of the \"Big Three\" nightly [[news anchor]]s in the U.S. from the 1980s through the early 2000s. He frequently contributed to CBS's weekly news magazine, ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Within a year of Brokaw's retirement and Jennings's death, Rather left the anchor desk in 2005 following a [[Killian documents]] controversy in which he presented unauthenticated documents in a news report on President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Vietnam War]]\u2013era service in the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]]. He continued to work with CBS until 2006.\n\nOn the cable channel [[AXS TV]] (then called HDNet), Rather hosted ''[[Dan Rather Reports]]'', a ''60 Minutes''\u2013style investigative news program, from 2006 to 2013. He also hosts several other projects for AXS TV, including ''Dan Rather Presents'', which provides in-depth reporting on broad topics such as mental health care or adoption, and ''The Big Interview with Dan Rather'', in which he conducts long-form interviews with musicians and other entertainers. In January 2018, he began hosting an online newscast called ''The News with Dan Rather'' on [[The Young Turks]]' YouTube channel.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Dan Rather boyhood home IMG 1055.JPG|thumb|Rather's boyhood home being restored at the Wharton County Museum]]\nDan Irvin Rather Jr. was born on October 31, 1931, in [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton County]], [[Texas]], the son of Daniel Irvin Rather Sr., a ditch digger and pipe layer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/biography|title=Biography &#124; Dan Rather|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052542/https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/biography|archive-date=September 6, 2018 |url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref> and the former Byrl Veda Page.

He conceived of overlaying a transparent map over the radar screen in order to show the size of Hurricane Carla to the audience. Convinced of the threat, more than 350,000 people evacuated from the area, the largest known evacuation to that time. Their actions are believed to have saved thousands of lives compared to the previous hurricane, which had killed 6000 to 12000 people.<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dan-rather-showed-the-first-radar-image-of-a-hurricane-on-tv/264246/</ref> Rather's live coverage of Carla was broadcast by New York and national stations.

Rather did not fit in easily on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. His first reports for CBS included coverage of the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 1]] in [[Jamaica Bay]], and a report on the suffocation of children at a hospital in [[Binghamton, New York]]. Shortly after, Rather was made chief of CBS's Southwest [[News bureau|bureau]] in [[Dallas]].

He did not witness the shooting of Kennedy, and knew nothing of the events until he reached KRLD, having run through Dealey Plaza. He later wrote: \n<blockquote>\"The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing. Policemen swarmed everywhere and distinctly above the din, I heard one shout, 'DON'T ANYBODY PANIC.' And of course, there was nothing but panic wherever you looked.\"<ref>Rather, ''The Camera Never Blinks'', p. 115.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his autobiography, Rather said he was one of the first to view the [[Zapruder film]] showing the assassination and the first to describe it on television.<ref>{{cite video\n| title = Oswald's_Ghost\n| episodelink =\n| series = American Experience\n| serieslink = American Experience\n| date =November 17, 2008\n| season = 20\n| number = }}</ref> The film was never shown on television to the general public.

Rather had a significantly different style of reporting the news. In contrast to the [[wikt:avuncular|avuncular]] Cronkite, who ended his newscast with \"That's the way it is\", Rather searched to find a broadcast ending more suitable to his tastes.

A police spokesman said that the cab driver refused to go to the address and instead \"wildly drove through the city streets\" with Rather shouting out the window asking for help. The driver was charged with disorderly conduct. Rather called the incident \"a rather minor thing\".\nBy the time the case was about to come to trial, he was about to add anchoring the \"CBS Evening News\" to his \"60 Minutes\" role at CBS News.

In 1994, the band [[R.E.M.]] released the song \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\" on their album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]''.

He was upset that the news was being cut into to make room for sports and discussed it with the sports department and made it clear that if the newscast did not start on time then CBS Sports should fill the half hour. The [[Steffi Graf]]\u2013[[Lori McNeil]] tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32&nbsp;p.m., but Rather had disappeared. ([[CBS Sports]] had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.)

Rather began his career in Texas, becoming a national name after his reporting saved thousands of lives during [[Hurricane Carla]] in September 1961. Rather spontaneously created the first radar weather report by overlaying a transparent map over a radar image of Hurricane Carla. In his first national broadcast, he helped initiate the successful evacuation of 350,000 people.\n\nRather reported from Dallas in November 1963 at the time of the President [[Kennedy assassination]]. Based on his reporting, he was promoted at [[CBS News]], where he served as White House correspondent beginning in 1964. He served as foreign correspondent in London and Vietnam over the next two years before returning to the White House correspondent position. He covered the [[presidency of Richard Nixon]], including Nixon's trip to China, the Watergate scandal, and the president's resignation.\n\nIn 1981, Rather was promoted to [[news presenter|news anchor]] for the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', a role he occupied for 24 years. Along with [[Peter Jennings]] at [[ABC News]] and [[Tom Brokaw]] at [[NBC News]], he was one of the \"Big Three\" nightly [[news anchor]]s in the U.S. from the 1980s through the early 2000s. He frequently contributed to CBS's weekly news magazine, ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Within a year of Brokaw's retirement and Jennings's death, Rather left the anchor desk in 2005 following a [[Killian documents]] controversy in which he presented unauthenticated documents in a news report on President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Vietnam War]]\u2013era service in the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]]. He continued to work with CBS until 2006.\n\nOn the cable channel [[AXS TV]] (then called HDNet), Rather hosted ''[[Dan Rather Reports]]'', a ''60 Minutes''\u2013style investigative news program, from 2006 to 2013. He also hosts several other projects for AXS TV, including ''Dan Rather Presents'', which provides in-depth reporting on broad topics such as mental health care or adoption, and ''The Big Interview with Dan Rather'', in which he conducts long-form interviews with musicians and other entertainers. In January 2018, he began hosting an online newscast called ''The News with Dan Rather'' on [[The Young Turks]]' YouTube channel.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Dan Rather boyhood home IMG 1055.JPG|thumb|Rather's boyhood home being restored at the Wharton County Museum]]\nDan Irvin Rather Jr. was born on October 31, 1931, in [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton County]], [[Texas]], the son of Daniel Irvin Rather Sr., a ditch digger and pipe layer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/biography|title=Biography &#124; Dan Rather|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052542/https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/biography|archive-date=September 6, 2018 |url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref> and the former Byrl Veda Page.

He asked the cab driver to take him to the home of writer [[Studs Terkel]], whom he was interviewing for ''60&nbsp;Minutes''. A police spokesman said that the cab driver refused to go to the address and instead \"wildly drove through the city streets\" with Rather shouting out the window asking for help. The driver was charged with disorderly conduct. Rather called the incident \"a rather minor thing\".\nBy the time the case was about to come to trial, he was about to add anchoring the \"CBS Evening News\" to his \"60 Minutes\" role at CBS News. Rather declined to press charges, citing a \"mounting schedule of reporting assignments\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times\n|title=The Ride of Dan Rather\n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/11/111306745.pdf\n|author=Albin Krebs and David Bird |date=November 11, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/28/nyregion/notes-on-people-rather-withdraws-charges-against-cab-driver.html\n|title=Rather Withdraws Charges Against Cab Driver\n|author=Albin Krebs and Robert McG.

As the assailant pummeled and kicked Rather, he kept repeating the question. In describing the incident, Rather said \"I got mugged. Who understands these things? I didn't and I don't now.

The phrase \"What's the frequency, Kenneth?\" became a popular-culture reference over the years, such as in a scene in the graphic novel ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]]'' by cartoonist [[Daniel Clowes]]. In 1994, the band [[R.E.M.]] released the song \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\" on their album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]''. Rather later sang with R.E.M. during a sound check prior to a gig at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]], which was shown the following night on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=REM & Dan Rather - What's The Frequency Kenneth? - 1995 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Huyn9itzIw |website=youtube.com |accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a TV critic writing in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' solved the mystery, publishing a photo of the alleged assailant, William Tager, who received a 12\u00bd-to-25-year prison sentence for killing NBC stagehand Campbell Montgomery outside ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' studio in 1994.<ref name=\"Bruni\" /> Rather confirmed the story: \"There's no doubt in my mind that this is the person.\"<ref name=\"Bruni\" /> New York District Attorney [[Robert M.

He said that it was just a signature line and had nothing to do with the news at the time.

He was upset that the news was being cut into to make room for sports and discussed it with the sports department and made it clear that if the newscast did not start on time then CBS Sports should fill the half hour. The [[Steffi Graf]]\u2013[[Lori McNeil]] tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32&nbsp;p.m., but Rather had disappeared. ([[CBS Sports]] had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.) Thus, over 100 affiliates were forced to broadcast six minutes of dead air.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boyer|first=Peter J.|title=Rather Walked Off Set of CBS News|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/nyregion/rather-walked-off-set-of-cbs-news.html|work=The New York Times|date=September 13, 1987}}</ref> The next day, Rather apologized for leaving the anchor desk.

An animated caricature of him made a cameo appearance in the [[JibJab]] [[political cartoon]], ''Good to Be in D.C.'' In 1971 he had a cameo in an episode of the number one hit comedy series ''[[All in the Family]]''. Entitled ''The Man in the Street'', series star [[Carroll O'Connor]]'s Archie Bunker character excitedly awaits the viewing of a videotaped interview he gave earlier that day for the ''CBS Evening News''. At the last minute, to his dismay, the segment is preempted by the telecast of a Richard Nixon presidential address from the [[Oval Office]]. Rather appears, as himself, delivering post-speech analysis from actual news footage. [[Jean Stapleton]], as Archie's scatterbrained wife Edith Bunker, says of Rather how he's there to \"...{{nbsp}}tell us what Mr. Nixon just said.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rich |first1=John |title=Warm Up the Snake: A Hollywood Memoir |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0472115782 |page=137}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, he was featured in the documentary film ''Barbecue: A Texas Love Story'' by Austin-based director [[Chris Elley]].<ref>[http://www.bbqfilm.com ''BBQ''.]</ref> Two years later, Rather and Elley educated a group of New Yorkers in [[Madison Square Park]] about the true meaning of BBQ and its significance to the identity of the Lone Star State.\n\nIn the 2006\u201307 graphic novel ''Shooting War'', which is set in the year 2011, an 80-year-old Dan Rather is shown to be one of the last journalists still reporting from Iraq.

He guest-starred as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode, \"[[E Pluribus Wiggum]]\".\n\nRather appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' in May 2009 wearing an Afro wig and mutton-chop sideburns to narrate a segment about the late former President Nixon eating a burrito, as a parody of [[MSNBC]]'s extensive coverage of President Obama and Vice President Biden's hamburger lunch.<ref>{{cite episode |series=The Daily Show |airdate=May 6, 2009 |network=Comedy Central |title=Nixon Has a Burrito\n|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-may-6-2009/nixon-has-a-burrito}}</ref> He appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary ''[[Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Transcript {{!}} BOOGIE MAN: THE LEE ATWATER STORY |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/atwater/etc/script.html |website=pbs.org |accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA character \"Dano\", an imitation of Rather, appears on the ''Brad and Britt'' morning show on [[WYMY|WZTK]] radio.
