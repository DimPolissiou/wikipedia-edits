Hayward became the group's principal lead guitarist and vocalist over the 1967\u20131974 period, and the most prolific songwriter and composer of several international hit singles for the band.\n\nHayward wrote singles for the Moody Blues including \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\", \"[[Tuesday Afternoon]]\", \"[[Voices in the Sky]]\", \"[[Never Comes the Day]]\", \"[[Question (The Moody Blues song)|Question]]\", \"[[The Story in Your Eyes]]\", \"[[Driftwood (The Moody Blues song)|Driftwood]]\", \"[[The Voice (The Moody Blues song)|The Voice]]\", \"[[Blue World (The Moody Blues song)|Blue World]]\", \"[[Your Wildest Dreams]]\", \"[[I Know You're Out There Somewhere]]\" and \"[[English Sunset]]\"; in all, writing 20 of the group's 27 post-1967 singles. He also had a solo career. His first album outside the Moody Blues, ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]'', a collaboration with [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]], reached the UK top five in 1975.

Within a few days, Hayward had replaced departing Moody Blues vocalist and guitarist [[Denny Laine]]. Bassist [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]] replaced temporary deputy Rod Clarke, who had stood in for departed bassist [[Clint Warwick]] at the same time.\n\nAfter beginning by singing the old [[blues]]-inspired repertoire of the Moody Blues' 1964\u20131965 era, Hayward's initial artistic contribution to the Moody Blues was his song \"Fly Me High\", which was a [[Decca Records|Decca]] single early in 1967. It failed to chart, but gave the revised band a new direction forward from the [[R&B]] sound they had been largely producing up to that point.\n\nHayward's driving rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" was then used as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their next  single on Decca, backing Pinder's \"Love And Beauty\" (1967), the first Moody Blues record to feature the [[Mellotron]].\n\nHayward and Lodge's integration into the Moody Blues along with Pinder's use of the [[Mellotron]] sparked greater commercial success and recognition for the band, transforming them into one of pop music's biggest-selling acts.\n\nThe 1967 album ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'', one of the first and most influential [[symphonic rock]] albums, gave rise to the Hayward-penned singles \"[[Tuesday Afternoon]]\" and \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\". The latter record went on to sell over two million copies, charting three times in the UK (1967, 1972, and 1979), and has been recorded by many other recording artists. Hayward's B-side song \"Cities\" was an early ecology-themed item.\n\nIn addition to delivering the lead vocals on his own compositions, Hayward took a featured lead or co-lead vocal on other band members' songs, including \"Dawn is a Feeling\" (Pinder), \"Gimmie A Little Somethin'\",  \"[[Isn't Life Strange]]\", \"[[Candle of Life]]\" (Lodge), \"After You Came\", \"I'll Be Level With You\", \"The Spirit\", and \"Nothing Changes\" (Edge).\n\nThe Moody Blues' attempts to come up with another hit single during 1967\u201368 had them record three other Hayward compositions; \"Long Summer Days\", \"King and Queen\", and \"What Am I Doing Here?\", all of which were then left unissued, but together with unissued songs by Pinder and Lodge they later formed the 'studio side four' of Decca's 1977 release ''Caught Live Plus Five'' which largely comprised a December 1969 live recording of a concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] (issued against the group's wishes).\n\nHayward also co-wrote with [[Ray Thomas]] album tracks \"[[Visions of Paradise]]\", \"[[Are You Sitting Comfortably? (song)|Are You Sitting Comfortably]]\", \"[[Watching and Waiting]]\", and, much later, \"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\", plus he later co-wrote many songs with John Lodge for the Moody Blues, notably \"[[Gemini Dream]]\" (a US chart hit), \"Meet Me Halfway\", \"Talkin' Talkin'\", \"Want to Be With You\", \"Once is Enough\", \"Strange Times\", and \"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\", among others.\n\nHayward's songs have opened each of the Moody Blues albums in their 'post-Mike Pinder era' since ''Long Distance Voyager'' in 1981, and his songs, both solo compositions and co-written with Lodge, plus his lead vocals, harmony voice, and guitar playing, have been a major overriding factor in the band's work and continued success since 1981.\n\nTheir album sales from 1978 to the present total more than 60 million. This is the regularly quoted estimate of their album sales, since the total sales of their albums before 1978 are disputed owing to lack of official record company data,<ref name=autogenerated1>Decca Moody Blues liner notes, Decca Records / Universal Music 2006</ref> However, the period 1967 to 1974 was when their albums (and singles) were charting highest in the UK and US plus worldwide (album track \"Melancholy Man\" made number one in France as a single in 1970) - ''Days of Future Passed'' topped the US album charts on reissue in 1972, then was followed into the album charts by the new studio album ''Seventh Sojourn''.\n\n==Hiatus and Blue Jays / solo work==\nIn 1974, the Moody Blues decided to take what ended up being a four-year break from performing and recording. Hayward continued working with Lodge and producer [[Tony Clarke (producer)|Tony Clarke]], using musicians from the Moody Blues' label, [[Threshold Records|Threshold]], and sounding very much like the mother group. Together, they had a hit in 1975 with \"Blue Guitar\" (a Hayward recording with the band [[10cc]]) and released an album titled ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]''.\n\nIn 1977, Hayward recorded his first solo album ''[[Songwriter (Justin Hayward album)|Songwriter]]''. He enjoyed international solo success in 1978 when he appeared on ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'' [[concept album]], which yielded his hits \"[[Forever Autumn (song)|Forever Autumn]]\" and \"The Eve of the War\".  Wayne later contributed to Hayward's 1980 album ''[[Night Flight (Justin Hayward album)|Night Flight]]''.\n\nHayward issued a rare non-album single \"Marie\" backed by \"Heart of Steel' (Decca F13834) in April 1979, both sides composed by him, the 'A' side dedicated to his wife. These tracks were later included among the bonus tracks on a CD reissue of his ''Songwriter'' solo album in 2004.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Hayward composed and performed for film and television, including the theme song \"It Won't Be Easy\" for the 1987 [[BBC Two|BBC2]] science-fiction series ''[[Star Cops]]'', \"Something Evil, Something Dangerous\" for the film ''[[Howling IV: The Original Nightmare]]'', \"Eternal Woman\" for the film ''[[She (1982 film)|She]]'', and music for the animated television series ''[[The Shoe People]]''.\n\nIn 1989, with producer-arranger [[Mike Batt]], Hayward released ''[[Classic Blue]]'', an album of pop standards written by other composers set to [[orchestration]] arranged by Batt. ''Classic Blue'' included a cover version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s hit \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\". Hayward's solo album ''[[The View from the Hill]]'' was released in 1996, and a live recording, ''[[Live in San Juan Capistrano (album)|Live in San Juan Capistrano]]'', followed in 1998.\n\nOn 10 March 1997, Hayward was featured on the [[BBC One]]'s programme ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' with [[Michael Aspel]].\n\nHayward contributed vocals to a song on [[Rick Wakeman]]'s 1999 album ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]''.\n\nIn June 2003, he gave several performances at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagerock.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=63|title=The Justin Hayward Interview|publisher=VintageRock.com|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Later that year, he sang along with other rock singers on another orchestral album, consisting of Moody Blues songs with the Frankfurt Rock Orchestra, titled ''[[Justin Hayward and Friends Sing the Moody Blues Classic Hits|Justin Hayward and Friends Perform the Hits of the Moody Blues]]'' (alternatively called ''Justin Hayward and Friends Sing the Moody Blues Classic Hits''). Hayward was later involved in a legal dispute, since resolved, arguing he was not paid for his participation on the album.\n\nIn April 2006, Hayward took part in the stage tour of ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'', reprising his role in autumn 2007 in Australia and in the UK in December 2007. He did so again in the UK in June 2009 and appeared on the tour in November and December 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenplec.com/review-jeff-waynes-war-worlds/|title=Review: Jeff Wayne\u2019s War of The Worlds |publisher=Goldenplec.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Moody Blues, with Hayward, Lodge, and original drummer [[Graeme Edge]], continue to tour extensively, and in a [[BBC World Service]] interview, Hayward and Lodge made it clear they have no plans to stop working, regarding it as \"a privilege\" to still be working in the music industry. In an interview in 2005, Edge said if he remained in good health, he could go on for 10 more years.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 2011, Hayward contributed to the Moody Blues [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tribute album ''[[Moody Bluegrass]] TWO...Much Love'' along with Moody Blues bandmates Lodge, Edge, Thomas, and Pinder.  Hayward sang lead vocal on his song \"It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart\".  Many other Hayward compositions are featured on this album as well as 2004's ''[[Moody Bluegrass]]: A Nashville Tribute to the Moody Blues''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/moody-blues-moody-bluegrass-two-much-love/|title=Moody Blues Have \u2018Much Love\u2019 for Bluegrass |publisher=theboot.com|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 December 2011, Hayward, along with [[Ian Anderson]] from [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[Bruce Dickinson]] from [[Iron Maiden]], played a concert together at [[Canterbury Cathedral]].<ref>[http://www.kentlife.co.uk/people/celebrity-interviews/canterbury-rocks-1-1648597 Kent Life interview with Ian Anderson, December 2011]</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, Hayward released his solo album ''[[Spirits of the Western Sky]]'' on the [[Eagle Rock Entertainment|Eagle Rock]] label. He toured solo with this album on the East coast of the USA in August 2013, to much acclaim, with Moody Blues keyboardist Alan Hewitt and vocalist Julie Ragins.

Hayward did still perform during the \"On the Blue Cruise\" in February of 2019. <ref>https://bestclassicbands.com/justin-hayward-illness-2-4-19/</ref>\n\n==Instruments==\nFor the most part, Hayward has used a red [[Gibson ES-335]], though he also uses other guitars in both performing and recording, including a 1955 [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-28 \"[[Dreadnought (guitar type)|Dreadnought]]\", a James Olson six-string acoustic, a black [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] acoustic, a [[Squier Stratocaster]] (essentially an inexpensive [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], as [[Squier]] is a subsidiary of Fender), a [[Fender Telecaster]], a blonde Guild 12-string acoustic (tuned to [[Open C tuning#Variants|\"open C\"]] for \"Question\"), and in 1967 a black [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Between 1965 and 1968, he was without his Gibson 335 and relied on other instruments, most notably a 1964 Fender Telecaster and a hand-built 12-string guitar he had renovated for Donegan (he eventually bought this guitar from Donegan's widow). However, in an interview included on the ''Lovely to See You'' concert DVD (2005), Hayward says the 1963 Gibson 335 has been with him since 1967. Recently, he has played a [[Collings Guitars|Collings]] D3 on stage and on recordings. Among other instruments, Hayward also played [[mandolin]] on ''[[A Question of Balance]]'' and [[sitar]] on ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Personal life==\nWritten at the end of one love affair and the beginning of another, the song \"Nights in White Satin\" was, according to Hayward, \"in adoration of all women\". Hayward married model Ann Marie Guirron on 19 December 1970. His daughter Doremi, who sings on the track \"Raised on Love\" on Hayward's 1977 album ''[[Songwriter (Justin Hayward album)|Songwriter]]'', was born on 3 December 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLesyyMYm5c |title=Justin Hayward and daughter in California |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Hayward spoke of his learning [[transcendental meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, along with other members of the Moody Blues.<ref name=rcm2013>{{cite web|last1=Gleason|first1=Paul|title=Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues on His Days of Future Passed (and Present)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/justin-hayward-interview-moody-blues-spirits-western-sky/#sthash.joDRnadl.dpuf|website=Rockcellar Magazine|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 April 2013|quote=We went to the TM Center at the same time that The Beatles did.

The single \"Blue Guitar\" with recorded with 10cc as the backing band reached the UK top ten in 1975, and his 1978 recording of \"[[Forever Autumn (song)|Forever Autumn]]\" from ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'' reached the UK top five.<ref>{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|page=247|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Hayward was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Moody Blues.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Moody Blues|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/moody-blues|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=17 December 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and early career==\nHayward was born in Dean Street, [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]], England, and educated at Shrivenham School in Berkshire and the [[Commonweal School]] in Swindon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealarts.co.uk/20052006pages/patronjustin.htm|title=Justin Hayward friend of Commonweal|publisher=Commonwealarts.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184340/http://www.commonwealarts.co.uk/20052006pages/patronjustin.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was playing in several bands as early as age 15 when he bought his [[Gibson 335]], a guitar that appears on nearly all of his records throughout his career,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitar-bass.net/features/true-blue-justin-hayward-88/|title=True Blue \u2013 Justin Hayward|publisher=Guitar & Bass Magazine|accessdate=25 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024144/http://www.guitar-bass.net/features/true-blue-justin-hayward-88/|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a [[Vox AC30]] amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ac30-guide.com/?page_id=254|title=Notable users of the AC30|publisher=AC30-Guide|accessdate=25 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626130827/http://www.ac30-guide.com/?page_id=254|archivedate=26 June 2015}}</ref> All previous guitars were \"unsatisfactory\" and required modification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageguitar.com/15614/justin-hayward/|title=Justin Hayward \u2013 Prolificity and Perceptions|publisher=VintageGuitar.com|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> He performed with local Swindon groups in clubs and dance halls playing mostly [[Buddy Holly]] songs.

Within a few days, Hayward had replaced departing Moody Blues vocalist and guitarist [[Denny Laine]]. Bassist [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]] replaced temporary deputy Rod Clarke, who had stood in for departed bassist [[Clint Warwick]] at the same time.\n\nAfter beginning by singing the old [[blues]]-inspired repertoire of the Moody Blues' 1964\u20131965 era, Hayward's initial artistic contribution to the Moody Blues was his song \"Fly Me High\", which was a [[Decca Records|Decca]] single early in 1967. It failed to chart, but gave the revised band a new direction forward from the [[R&B]] sound they had been largely producing up to that point.\n\nHayward's driving rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" was then used as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their next  single on Decca, backing Pinder's \"Love And Beauty\" (1967), the first Moody Blues record to feature the [[Mellotron]].\n\nHayward and Lodge's integration into the Moody Blues along with Pinder's use of the [[Mellotron]] sparked greater commercial success and recognition for the band, transforming them into one of pop music's biggest-selling acts.\n\nThe 1967 album ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'', one of the first and most influential [[symphonic rock]] albums, gave rise to the Hayward-penned singles \"[[Tuesday Afternoon]]\" and \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\". The latter record went on to sell over two million copies, charting three times in the UK (1967, 1972, and 1979), and has been recorded by many other recording artists. Hayward's B-side song \"Cities\" was an early ecology-themed item.\n\nIn addition to delivering the lead vocals on his own compositions, Hayward took a featured lead or co-lead vocal on other band members' songs, including \"Dawn is a Feeling\" (Pinder), \"Gimmie A Little Somethin'\",  \"[[Isn't Life Strange]]\", \"[[Candle of Life]]\" (Lodge), \"After You Came\", \"I'll Be Level With You\", \"The Spirit\", and \"Nothing Changes\" (Edge).\n\nThe Moody Blues' attempts to come up with another hit single during 1967\u201368 had them record three other Hayward compositions; \"Long Summer Days\", \"King and Queen\", and \"What Am I Doing Here?\", all of which were then left unissued, but together with unissued songs by Pinder and Lodge they later formed the 'studio side four' of Decca's 1977 release ''Caught Live Plus Five'' which largely comprised a December 1969 live recording of a concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] (issued against the group's wishes).\n\nHayward also co-wrote with [[Ray Thomas]] album tracks \"[[Visions of Paradise]]\", \"[[Are You Sitting Comfortably? (song)|Are You Sitting Comfortably]]\", \"[[Watching and Waiting]]\", and, much later, \"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\", plus he later co-wrote many songs with John Lodge for the Moody Blues, notably \"[[Gemini Dream]]\" (a US chart hit), \"Meet Me Halfway\", \"Talkin' Talkin'\", \"Want to Be With You\", \"Once is Enough\", \"Strange Times\", and \"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\", among others.\n\nHayward's songs have opened each of the Moody Blues albums in their 'post-Mike Pinder era' since ''Long Distance Voyager'' in 1981, and his songs, both solo compositions and co-written with Lodge, plus his lead vocals, harmony voice, and guitar playing, have been a major overriding factor in the band's work and continued success since 1981.\n\nTheir album sales from 1978 to the present total more than 60 million. This is the regularly quoted estimate of their album sales, since the total sales of their albums before 1978 are disputed owing to lack of official record company data,<ref name=autogenerated1>Decca Moody Blues liner notes, Decca Records / Universal Music 2006</ref> However, the period 1967 to 1974 was when their albums (and singles) were charting highest in the UK and US plus worldwide (album track \"Melancholy Man\" made number one in France as a single in 1970) - ''Days of Future Passed'' topped the US album charts on reissue in 1972, then was followed into the album charts by the new studio album ''Seventh Sojourn''.\n\n==Hiatus and Blue Jays / solo work==\nIn 1974, the Moody Blues decided to take what ended up being a four-year break from performing and recording. Hayward continued working with Lodge and producer [[Tony Clarke (producer)|Tony Clarke]], using musicians from the Moody Blues' label, [[Threshold Records|Threshold]], and sounding very much like the mother group. Together, they had a hit in 1975 with \"Blue Guitar\" (a Hayward recording with the band [[10cc]]) and released an album titled ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]''.\n\nIn 1977, Hayward recorded his first solo album ''[[Songwriter (Justin Hayward album)|Songwriter]]''. He enjoyed international solo success in 1978 when he appeared on ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'' [[concept album]], which yielded his hits \"[[Forever Autumn (song)|Forever Autumn]]\" and \"The Eve of the War\".  Wayne later contributed to Hayward's 1980 album ''[[Night Flight (Justin Hayward album)|Night Flight]]''.\n\nHayward issued a rare non-album single \"Marie\" backed by \"Heart of Steel' (Decca F13834) in April 1979, both sides composed by him, the 'A' side dedicated to his wife. These tracks were later included among the bonus tracks on a CD reissue of his ''Songwriter'' solo album in 2004.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Hayward composed and performed for film and television, including the theme song \"It Won't Be Easy\" for the 1987 [[BBC Two|BBC2]] science-fiction series ''[[Star Cops]]'', \"Something Evil, Something Dangerous\" for the film ''[[Howling IV: The Original Nightmare]]'', \"Eternal Woman\" for the film ''[[She (1982 film)|She]]'', and music for the animated television series ''[[The Shoe People]]''.\n\nIn 1989, with producer-arranger [[Mike Batt]], Hayward released ''[[Classic Blue]]'', an album of pop standards written by other composers set to [[orchestration]] arranged by Batt. ''Classic Blue'' included a cover version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s hit \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\". Hayward's solo album ''[[The View from the Hill]]'' was released in 1996, and a live recording, ''[[Live in San Juan Capistrano (album)|Live in San Juan Capistrano]]'', followed in 1998.\n\nOn 10 March 1997, Hayward was featured on the [[BBC One]]'s programme ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' with [[Michael Aspel]].\n\nHayward contributed vocals to a song on [[Rick Wakeman]]'s 1999 album ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]''.\n\nIn June 2003, he gave several performances at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagerock.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=63|title=The Justin Hayward Interview|publisher=VintageRock.com|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Later that year, he sang along with other rock singers on another orchestral album, consisting of Moody Blues songs with the Frankfurt Rock Orchestra, titled ''[[Justin Hayward and Friends Sing the Moody Blues Classic Hits|Justin Hayward and Friends Perform the Hits of the Moody Blues]]'' (alternatively called ''Justin Hayward and Friends Sing the Moody Blues Classic Hits''). Hayward was later involved in a legal dispute, since resolved, arguing he was not paid for his participation on the album.\n\nIn April 2006, Hayward took part in the stage tour of ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'', reprising his role in autumn 2007 in Australia and in the UK in December 2007. He did so again in the UK in June 2009 and appeared on the tour in November and December 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenplec.com/review-jeff-waynes-war-worlds/|title=Review: Jeff Wayne\u2019s War of The Worlds |publisher=Goldenplec.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Moody Blues, with Hayward, Lodge, and original drummer [[Graeme Edge]], continue to tour extensively, and in a [[BBC World Service]] interview, Hayward and Lodge made it clear they have no plans to stop working, regarding it as \"a privilege\" to still be working in the music industry. In an interview in 2005, Edge said if he remained in good health, he could go on for 10 more years.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 2011, Hayward contributed to the Moody Blues [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tribute album ''[[Moody Bluegrass]] TWO...Much Love'' along with Moody Blues bandmates Lodge, Edge, Thomas, and Pinder.  Hayward sang lead vocal on his song \"It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart\".

He toured solo with this album on the East coast of the USA in August 2013, to much acclaim, with Moody Blues keyboardist Alan Hewitt and vocalist Julie Ragins. The opening act and accompanying guitarist in the main show was UK's [[Mike Dawes]]. The final show of the solo tour, in [[Atlanta]], was recorded by producer/director [[David Minasian]] for a live DVD project and a live CD. Recorded at the Buckhead Theatre on 17 August, the resulting DVD, ''Spirits\u2026 Live'' (2014), features the full concert along with a one-hour behind-the-scenes documentary titled ''On The Road To Love'' depicting Hayward's 2013 American tour, also directed by Minasian.<ref>[http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/mar/06/justin-hayward-spiritslive/ Retrieved 2016-6-19.]</ref> Following its release by Eagle Rock/Universal in August 2014, the DVD immediately rose to the #2 position on the Billboard Music Video charts<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bouldertheater.com/event/justin-hayward |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905223313/http://www.bouldertheater.com/event/justin-hayward |archivedate=5 September 2015  }} Retrieved 19 June 2016.</ref> and would soon be broadcast by the [[PBS]] network.<ref>[http://www.tpt.org/justin-hayward-spirits-live/ Retrieved 2016-6-19.]</ref> Two additional Hayward/Minasian collaborations quickly followed: A concert DVD filmed in Clearwater, Florida titled ''Watching and Waiting'', and ''The Story Behind Nights in White Satin'', an award winning documentary which chronicled the origins of Hayward's classic 1967 composition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parade.com/455009/nancyberk/the-moody-blues-justin-hayward-and-the-inside-story-behind-nights-in-white-satin/ |title=The Moody Blues' Justin Hayward and the Inside Story Behind 'Nights In White Satin' |work=Parade.com |date= |accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Hayward was interviewed on BBC Radio 2's [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnny Walker]] show.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Justin Hayward |episode-link= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05qsly6 |access-date=21 April 2015 |series=Johnny Walker's Sounds of the 70s |series-link= |first= |last= |network=BBC Radio 2 |station= |city= |date= |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe Spring of 2016 saw another Hayward release from producer/director David Minasian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2016/5/3/the-moody-blues-justin-hayward-celebrating-new-dvd-and-solo.html |title=The Moody Blues' Justin Hayward Celebrating New DVD and Solo Tour at Special Boston-Area Event |work=abcnewsradioonline.com |date=3 May 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> Titled ''Live in Concert at the Capitol Theatre'', the DVD contained a few surprises including the first live performance of \"You Can Never Go Home\" from the 1971 ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (album)|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'' LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justinhayward.com/join-justin-to-celebrate-solo-tour-new-dvd-and-new-epic-song-video/ |title=Join Justin to Celebrate Solo Tour, New DVD and New Epic Song & Video |publisher=Justin Hayward |date=29 April 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> Also featured was a bonus studio recording of a new song titled \"The Wind of Heaven\", a joint composition between Minasian and Hayward.

F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-28 \"[[Dreadnought (guitar type)|Dreadnought]]\", a James Olson six-string acoustic, a black [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] acoustic, a [[Squier Stratocaster]] (essentially an inexpensive [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], as [[Squier]] is a subsidiary of Fender), a [[Fender Telecaster]], a blonde Guild 12-string acoustic (tuned to [[Open C tuning#Variants|\"open C\"]] for \"Question\"), and in 1967 a black [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Between 1965 and 1968, he was without his Gibson 335 and relied on other instruments, most notably a 1964 Fender Telecaster and a hand-built 12-string guitar he had renovated for Donegan (he eventually bought this guitar from Donegan's widow). However, in an interview included on the ''Lovely to See You'' concert DVD (2005), Hayward says the 1963 Gibson 335 has been with him since 1967. Recently, he has played a [[Collings Guitars|Collings]] D3 on stage and on recordings. Among other instruments, Hayward also played [[mandolin]] on ''[[A Question of Balance]]'' and [[sitar]] on ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Personal life==\nWritten at the end of one love affair and the beginning of another, the song \"Nights in White Satin\" was, according to Hayward, \"in adoration of all women\". Hayward married model Ann Marie Guirron on 19 December 1970. His daughter Doremi, who sings on the track \"Raised on Love\" on Hayward's 1977 album ''[[Songwriter (Justin Hayward album)|Songwriter]]'', was born on 3 December 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLesyyMYm5c |title=Justin Hayward and daughter in California |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Hayward spoke of his learning [[transcendental meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, along with other members of the Moody Blues.<ref name=rcm2013>{{cite web|last1=Gleason|first1=Paul|title=Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues on His Days of Future Passed (and Present)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/justin-hayward-interview-moody-blues-spirits-western-sky/#sthash.joDRnadl.dpuf|website=Rockcellar Magazine|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 April 2013|quote=We went to the TM Center at the same time that The Beatles did.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It is characterised by the presence of abundant Cuartz sediments, along with the pesence of Red Clays. Along the meridional border of the [[Guettioua Formation]], on the same Stratigraphic tendence is developed a red Sandstone-Pelitic deposition, that changes from Quartzo-[[Conglomerate]]s to grains and fragments of Quartz, dispossed with liassic Calcareous strata.<ref name=Taquet1 /><ref name=Taquet2 /> is equivalent to the main Azilal \"Marnes Chocolat\".<ref name=Taquet1 /><ref name=Taquet2 /> The Main sector occurs near Acfarcid, with an expossure of ~800 m, recovering the most detritic sector. Along this expossure, the Wazzant member is appaears at the Rigth lateral, along massive calcareous [[Dolomite]]s, over the Latest [[Pliensbachian]] strata, where the lower Toarcian strata is missing.<ref name=Taquet1 /> The Wazzant facies never exceed 50 m, getting it\u00b4s maximum exposure at the north of the [[Guettioua Formation]].<ref name=Taquet1 /> The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys Ocean]] to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).
