He is a pioneer in the [[electronic music|electronic]], [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[New-age music|new-age]] genres, and known for organising outdoor [[spectacle]]s featuring his music, vast [[laser lighting display|laser displays]], large [[projector|projections]] and [[fireworks]].\n\nJarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, [[jazz]] musicians and the artist [[Pierre Soulages]]. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by [[Pierre Schaeffer]], a pioneer of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] at the [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales]].\n\nHis first mainstream success was the 1976 album ''[[Oxyg\u00e8ne]]''. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12&nbsp;million copies. ''Oxyg\u00e8ne'' was followed in 1978 by ''[[Equinoxe|\u00c9quinoxe]]'', and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the [[Place de la Concorde]], a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician.\n\nAs of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80&nbsp;million albums. He was the first [[Western world|Western]] musician officially invited to perform in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and holds the world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event for his Moscow concert on 6 September 1997, which was attended by 3.5 million people.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, influences, and education===\nJean-Michel Jarre was born in [[Lyon]] on 24 August 1948, to Francette Pejot, a [[French Resistance]] member and [[concentration camp]] survivor, and composer [[Maurice Jarre]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sleeman|Taylor|Francis|2003|p=809.}}</ref><ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref>{{Citation|url=http://aerojarre.blogspot.com/2010/03/end-of-first-week.html|title=End of First Week|first=Jean-Michel|last=Jarre|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> When Jarre was five, his parents separated and his father moved to the United States, leaving him with his mother.<ref name=\"Smoothoperator\">{{Citation | title = Jean-Michel Jarre: Smooth operator | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/jean-michel-jarre-smooth-operator-557538.html | last = Stuart | first = Julia | date = 23 August 2004 | work = independent| accessdate = 15 March 2009}}</ref> He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18.<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /> For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an [[oboe]] player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first tape recorder.<ref>{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=13}}</ref> From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young Jarre was able to observe [[street performer]]s at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nJarre struggled with classical piano studies, although he later changed teachers and worked on his scales.<ref name=\"Hughesp303\">{{Harvnb|Hughes|Reader|2003|p=303}}</ref> A more general interest in musical instruments was sparked by his discovery at the [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]] flea market, where his mother sold antiques, of a [[Boris Vian]] [[Stroh violin|trumpet violin]]. He often accompanied his mother to Le Chat Qui P\u00eache (The Fishing Cat), a friend's Paris [[jazz]] club, where saxophonists [[Archie Shepp]] and [[John Coltrane]], and trumpet players [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]] and [[Chet Baker]] were regular performers. These early jazz experiences suggested to him that music may be \"descriptive, without lyrics\".<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref name=\"Remilleuxp16\">{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=16}}</ref> He was also influenced by the work of French artist [[Pierre Soulages]], whose exhibition at the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] he attended. Soulages' paintings used multiple textured layers, and Jarre realised that \"for the first time in music, you could act as a painter with frequencies and sounds.\"<ref name=\"Steamroller\">{{Citation | title = Making the Steamroller Fly | publisher = Image Entertainment | date = 4 November 2003}}</ref> He was also influenced by classical, modernist music; in a 2004 interview for ''[[The Guardian]]'', he spoke of the effect that a performance of [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' had upon him:\n\n{{quote|This is where Stravinsky created it in 1913, and it was a huge shock. I also saw the last concert by the great Arabic singer [[Umm Kulthum|Om Khalsoum]]. She is the goddess, the [[Maria Callas]] of the Orient. Then I heard \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\" by [[Ray Charles]], and I realised that music can talk to your tummy. I was so impressed by the organic sensuality coming from Ray Charles's music \u2013 there was no intellectual process and it was great.<ref name=\"sensualhealing\" />}}\n\nAs a young man Jarre earned money by selling his paintings, exhibiting some of his works at the Lyon Gallery&nbsp;\u2013 ''L'\u0152il \u00e9coute'', and by playing in a band called Myst\u00e8re IV. While he studied at the [[:fr:Lyc\u00e9e Michelet|Lyc\u00e9e Michelet]], his mother arranged for him to take lessons in [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]] with Jeannine Rueff of the [[Conservatoire de Paris]].<ref name=\"Hughesp303\" /><ref name=\"Remilleuxp16\" /> In 1967 he played guitar in a band called ''The Dustbins'', who appear in the film ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Des gar\u00e7ons et des filles (1967 film)|fr|3=Des gar\u00e7ons et des filles|lt=Des gar\u00e7ons et des filles}}''. He mixed instruments including the electric guitar and the flute with tape effects and other sounds.<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /> More experimentation followed in 1968, when he began to use [[tape loop]]s, radios and other electronic devices, but joining the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) in 1969,<ref name=\"Hughesp303\" /><ref name=\"Jarreukmetamorphoses\" /> then under the direction of [[Pierre Schaeffer]] (\"father\" of [[musique concr\u00e8te]]), proved hugely influential.<ref name=\"soundonsound\" /> Jarre was introduced to the [[Moog modular synthesizer]] and spent time working at the studio of influential German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in [[Cologne]].<ref name=\"toujoursjarre\">{{Citation | last = Brown | first = Jonathan | title = Jean-Michel Jarre: Toujours Jarre | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/jean-michel-jarre-toujours-jarre-782870.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101006004810/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/jean-michel-jarre-toujours-jarre-782870.html | work = independent| date = 18 February 2008 | archivedate = 6 October 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Snider257\">{{Harvnb|Snider|2008|p=257}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Bos | first = Christian | url = http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1195816856258.shtml | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120803232420/http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1195816856258.shtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = 3 August 2012 | title = \"Synthesizer sind etwas Sinnliches\" \u2013 K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger | language = German | publisher = ksta.de | date = 28 November 2007 | accessdate = 28 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\n{{listen | pos = right | filename = La Cage Jean Michel Jarre.ogg | title=\"La Cage\" | description = Jarre's 1969 release, \"La Cage\" | format = [[Ogg]]}}\n\nIn the kitchen of his flat on Rue de la Tr\u00e9moille, near the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], Jarre set up a small recording studio.

He is a pioneer in the [[electronic music|electronic]], [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[New-age music|new-age]] genres, and known for organising outdoor [[spectacle]]s featuring his music, vast [[laser lighting display|laser displays]], large [[projector|projections]] and [[fireworks]].\n\nJarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, [[jazz]] musicians and the artist [[Pierre Soulages]]. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by [[Pierre Schaeffer]], a pioneer of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] at the [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales]].\n\nHis first mainstream success was the 1976 album ''[[Oxyg\u00e8ne]]''. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12&nbsp;million copies. ''Oxyg\u00e8ne'' was followed in 1978 by ''[[Equinoxe|\u00c9quinoxe]]'', and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the [[Place de la Concorde]], a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician.\n\nAs of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80&nbsp;million albums. He was the first [[Western world|Western]] musician officially invited to perform in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and holds the world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event for his Moscow concert on 6 September 1997, which was attended by 3.5 million people.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, influences, and education===\nJean-Michel Jarre was born in [[Lyon]] on 24 August 1948, to Francette Pejot, a [[French Resistance]] member and [[concentration camp]] survivor, and composer [[Maurice Jarre]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sleeman|Taylor|Francis|2003|p=809.}}</ref><ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref>{{Citation|url=http://aerojarre.blogspot.com/2010/03/end-of-first-week.html|title=End of First Week|first=Jean-Michel|last=Jarre|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> When Jarre was five, his parents separated and his father moved to the United States, leaving him with his mother.<ref name=\"Smoothoperator\">{{Citation | title = Jean-Michel Jarre: Smooth operator | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/jean-michel-jarre-smooth-operator-557538.html | last = Stuart | first = Julia | date = 23 August 2004 | work = independent| accessdate = 15 March 2009}}</ref> He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18.<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /> For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an [[oboe]] player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first tape recorder.<ref>{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=13}}</ref> From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young Jarre was able to observe [[street performer]]s at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nJarre struggled with classical piano studies, although he later changed teachers and worked on his scales.<ref name=\"Hughesp303\">{{Harvnb|Hughes|Reader|2003|p=303}}</ref> A more general interest in musical instruments was sparked by his discovery at the [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]] flea market, where his mother sold antiques, of a [[Boris Vian]] [[Stroh violin|trumpet violin]]. He often accompanied his mother to Le Chat Qui P\u00eache (The Fishing Cat), a friend's Paris [[jazz]] club, where saxophonists [[Archie Shepp]] and [[John Coltrane]], and trumpet players [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]] and [[Chet Baker]] were regular performers. These early jazz experiences suggested to him that music may be \"descriptive, without lyrics\".<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref name=\"Remilleuxp16\">{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=16}}</ref> He was also influenced by the work of French artist [[Pierre Soulages]], whose exhibition at the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] he attended. Soulages' paintings used multiple textured layers, and Jarre realised that \"for the first time in music, you could act as a painter with frequencies and sounds.\"<ref name=\"Steamroller\">{{Citation | title = Making the Steamroller Fly | publisher = Image Entertainment | date = 4 November 2003}}</ref> He was also influenced by classical, modernist music; in a 2004 interview for ''[[The Guardian]]'', he spoke of the effect that a performance of [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' had upon him:\n\n{{quote|This is where Stravinsky created it in 1913, and it was a huge shock. I also saw the last concert by the great Arabic singer [[Umm Kulthum|Om Khalsoum]]. She is the goddess, the [[Maria Callas]] of the Orient. Then I heard \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\" by [[Ray Charles]], and I realised that music can talk to your tummy.

The main competitor of this family is [[macOS]] by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for personal computers and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for mobile devices (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}}).\n** [[Windows Server]]: The operating system for server computers. The latest version is [[Windows Server 2019]]. Unlike its client sibling, it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this family is [[Linux]]. (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074031/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|archivedate = December 15, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market.

NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, [[multi-user]] operating system with [[POSIX]] compatibility and a modular, [[Software portability|portable]] [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] with [[preemptive multitasking]] and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of [[Windows 3.0]], the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended [[32-bit]] port of the [[Windows API]] known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows [[API]]s (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be [[Porting|ported]] to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.<ref name=\"insident\">{{cite book | ref= harv | last= Custer | first= Helen | title= Inside Windows NT | url= https://archive.org/details/insidewindowsnt00cust | url-access= registration | publisher= Microsoft Press | location= Redmond | year= 1993 | isbn=1-55615-481-X}}</ref><ref name=\"thurrott-nt\"/>\n\nThe first release of the resulting operating system, [[Windows NT 3.1]] (named to associate it with [[Windows 3.1]]) was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop [[workstation]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. [[Windows NT 3.5]] was released in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for [[Novell]]'s [[NetWare]], and was followed up by [[Windows NT 3.51]] in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the [[PowerPC]] architecture. [[Windows NT 4.0]] was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of [[Windows 95]] to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released [[Windows 2000]], a successor to NT 4.0.

This migration involved 3.5&nbsp;million separate files in a 300 gigabyte repository.<ref name=PBright /> By May 2017, 90 percent of its engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds per day.<ref name=PBright>{{cite web|last1=Bright|first1=Peter|title=Windows switch to Git almost complete: 8,500 commits and 1,760 builds each day|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|date=24 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524171707/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|archivedate=May 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Multilingual support====\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3. The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones.

Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.\n\nThe [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection.

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

(c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074031/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|archivedate = December 15, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market.

It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8.

This migration involved 3.5&nbsp;million separate files in a 300 gigabyte repository.<ref name=PBright /> By May 2017, 90 percent of its engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds per day.<ref name=PBright>{{cite web|last1=Bright|first1=Peter|title=Windows switch to Git almost complete: 8,500 commits and 1,760 builds each day|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|date=24 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524171707/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|archivedate=May 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Multilingual support====\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3. The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones.

Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.\n\nThe [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection.

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

Since [[biomass]] technically can be used as a fuel directly (e.g. wood logs), some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably. More often than not however, the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of, or some form of thermally/chemically altered ''solid'' end product, like torrefied pellets or briquettes. The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels, used for transportation. The EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) follow this naming practice.<ref>The IEA states: \"Biofuels are transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel that are made from biomass materials.\" https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=biofuel_home</ref> If the [[biomass]] used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly, the fuel is generally considered to be a form of [[renewable energy]]. \n[[File:Biofuel - The Noun Project.svg|thumb|Biofuel logo]]\nBiofuels can be produced from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes (if the waste has a biological origin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]].\n\nSome argue that ,brant is gay, biofuel can be [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because all biomass crops [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]] carbon to a certain extent \u2013 basically all crops move CO<sub>2</sub> from above-ground circulation to below-ground storage in the roots and the surrounding soil.

This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect [[ILUC|land use change]]. Many first generation biofuel projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives.<ref>\u00abThe environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy have been the subject of significant debate, particularly for first\u2010generation biofuels produced from food (e.g. grain and oil seed). Studies have reported life\u2010cycle GHG savings ranging from an 86% reduction to a 93% increase in GHG emissions compared with fossil fuels (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008; Davis et\u00a0al., 2009; Liska et\u00a0al., 2009; Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010). In addition, concerns have been raised that N2O emissions from biofuel feedstock cultivation could have been underestimated (Crutzen et\u00a0al., 2008; Smith & Searchinger, 2012) and that expansion of feedstock cultivation on agricultural land might displace food production onto land with high carbon stocks or high conservation value (i.e. iLUC) creating a carbon debt which could take decades to repay (Fargione et\u00a0al., 2008). Other studies have shown that direct nitrogen\u2010related emissions from annual crop feedstocks can be mitigated through optimized management practices (Davis et\u00a0al., 2013) or that payback times are less significant than proposed (Mello et\u00a0al., 2014). However, there are still significant concerns over the impacts of iLUC, despite policy developments aimed at reducing the risk of iLUC occurring (Ahlgren & Di Lucia, 2014; Del Grosso et\u00a0al., 2014).\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

This is controversial, as the allocation of GHG emissions to the management and the use of coproducts can have a large effect on the total carbon footprint of resulting bioenergy products (Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010; Davis et\u00a0al., 2013). The potential consequences of land use change (LUC) to bioenergy on GHG balance through food crop displacement or \u2018indirect\u2019 land use change (iLUC) are also an important consideration (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008).\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)</ref><ref>\u00abWhile the initial premise regarding bioenergy was that carbon recently captured from the atmosphere into plants would deliver an immediate reduction in GHG emission from fossil fuel use, the reality proved less straightforward. Studies suggested that GHG emission from energy crop production and land-use change might outweigh any CO2 mitigation (Searchinger et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Nitrous oxide (N2O) production, with its powerful global warming potential (GWP), could be a significant factor in offsetting CO2 gains (Crutzen et al., 2008) as well as possible acidification and eutrophication of the surrounding environment (Kim & Dale, 2005). However, not all biomass feedstocks are equal, and most studies critical of bioenergy production are concerned with biofuels produced from annual food crops at high fertilizer cost, sometimes using land cleared from natural ecosystems or in direct competition with food production (Naik et al., 2010). Dedicated perennial energy crops, produced on existing, lower grade, agricultural land, offer a sustainable alternative with significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration when produced with appropriate management (Crutzen et al., 2008; Hastings et al., 2008, 2012; Cherubini et al., 2009; Don- dini et al., 2009a; Don et al., 2012; Zatta et al., 2014; Rich- ter et al., 2015).\u00bb\nMcCalmont, J.

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)</ref>\n\nSome are carbon neutral or even negative, though, especially perennial crops. The amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG (greenhouse gases) emitted will determine if the total GHG life cycle cost of a biofuel project is positive, neutral or negative. A carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below-ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the total life-cycle GHG emissions above ground. In other words, to achieve carbon neutrality yields should be high and emissions should be low.\n\nHigh-yielding energy crops are thus prime candidates for carbon neutrality. The graphic on the right displays two CO<sub>2</sub> negative [[Miscanthus giganteus|Miscanthus x giganteus]] production pathways, represented in gram CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents per megajoule.

The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact. \n<ref>\u00abWhilst these values represent the extremes, they demonstrate that site selection for bioenergy crop cultivation can make the difference between large GHG savings or losses, shifting life\u2010cycle GHG [green house gas] emissions above or below mandated thresholds. Reducing uncertainties in \u2206C [carbon increase or decrease] following LUC [land use change] is therefore more important than refining N2O [nitrous oxide] emission estimates (Berhongaray et\u00a0al., 2017). Knowledge on initial soil carbon stocks could improve GHG savings achieved through targeted deployment of perennial bioenergy crops on low carbon soils (see section 2). [\u2026] The assumption that annual cropland provides greater potential for soil carbon sequestration than grassland appears to be over\u2010simplistic, but there is an opportunity to improve predictions of soil carbon sequestration potential using information on the initial soil carbon stock as a stronger predictor of \u2206C [change in carbon amount] than prior land use.\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

[[Grassland]] can also be carbon rich, however Milner et al. argues that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands. \n<ref>\u00abFig.\u00a03 confirmed either no change or a gain of SOC [soil organic carbon] (positive) through planting Miscanthus on arable land across England and Wales and only a loss of SOC (negative) in parts of Scotland. The total annual SOC change across GB in the transition from arable to Miscanthus if all nonconstrained land was planted with would be 3.3 Tg C yr\u22121 [3.3 million tonnes carbon per year]. The mean changes for SOC for the different land uses were all positive when histosols were excluded, with improved grasslands yielding the highest Mg C ha\u22121\u00a0yr\u22121 [tonnes carbon per hectare per year] at 1.49, followed by arable lands at 1.28 and forest at 1. Separating this SOC change by original land use (Fig.\u00a04) reveals that there are large regions of improved grasslands which, if planted with bioenergy crops, are predicted to result in an increase in SOC. A similar result was found when considering the transition from arable land; however for central eastern England, there was a predicted neutral effect on SOC. Scotland, however, is predicted to have a decrease for all land uses, particularly for woodland due mainly to higher SOC and lower Miscanthus yields and hence less input.\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

The higher the yield, the more likely CO<sub>2</sub> negativity becomes.\n\nThe two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel.\n\n[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]].\n\n[[Biodiesel]] is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. It can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nIn 2018, worldwide biofuel production reached 152 billion liters (40 billion gallons US), up 7% from 2017,<ref name=\"Transport biofuels\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/tcep/transport/biofuels/|title=Transport biofuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and biofuels provided 3% of the world's fuels for road transport.

From 2020 to 2030 global biofuel output has to increase by 10% each year to reach IEA's goal.

The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.\n\nSyngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.<ref name=\"e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch\">[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008</ref> The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.\n\nSyngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nLower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].\n\n===Ethanol===\n\n{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}\n[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]|alt=]]\nBiologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory<ref>[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | L\u00e4r dig mer om energi - E.ON<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \u2013 where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.\n\nEthanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.\n\nEthanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are \"flueless\", bioethanol fires<ref>Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)</ref> are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.\nThe downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCorn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,<ref>see \"Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol\"</ref> the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.<ref>Brinkman, N. et al., \"Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems\", 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. |display-authors=et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506\u20138 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.<ref>[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]</ref>\n\nIn some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100<!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) -->. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.\n\nElectronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.\nSince biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714031730/http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk/ |archive-date=14 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel.

Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.\n\nAs with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&W Diesel]], [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.\n\nVegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-\"Pumpe Duse\" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.\n\nOils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.<ref name=evans>Evans, G.

However, despite these efforts, drop-in biofuels represent only a small percentage (around 2%) of global biofuel markets. ... Due to the increased processing and resource requirements (e.g., hydrogen and catalysts) needed to make drop-in biofuels as compared to conventional biofuels, large scale production of cost-competitive drop-in biofuels is not expected to occur in the near to midterm. Rather, dedicated policies to promote development and commercialization of these fuels will be needed before they become significant contributors to global biofuels production. Currently, no policies (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies etc.) differentiate new, more fungible and infrastructure ready drop-in type biofuels from less infrastructure compatible oxygenated biofuels. ...  Thus, while tremendous technical progress has been made in developing and improving the various routes to drop-in fuels, supportive policies directed specifically towards the further development of drop-in biofuels are likely to be needed to ensure their future commercial success.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |url-status=live |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |pages=177, 182 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== By region==\n{{Main|Biofuels by region}}\n{{See also|Biodiesel by region}}\n[[File:Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of Indian Navy.jpg|alt=|thumb|Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of [[Indian Navy]] patrolling during [[International Fleet Review 2016|IFR 2016]].

Since [[biomass]] technically can be used as a fuel directly (e.g. wood logs), some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably. More often than not however, the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of, or some form of thermally/chemically altered ''solid'' end product, like torrefied pellets or briquettes. The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels, used for transportation. The EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) follow this naming practice.<ref>The IEA states: \"Biofuels are transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel that are made from biomass materials.\" https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=biofuel_home</ref> If the [[biomass]] used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly, the fuel is generally considered to be a form of [[renewable energy]]. \n[[File:Biofuel - The Noun Project.svg|thumb|Biofuel logo]]\nBiofuels can be produced from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes (if the waste has a biological origin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]].\n\nSome argue that biofuel can be [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because all biomass crops [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]] carbon to a certain extent \u2013 basically all crops move CO<sub>2</sub> from above-ground circulation to below-ground storage in the roots and the surrounding soil.

Basically, the higher the yield, the more land is usable as a GHG mitigation tool (including relatively carbon rich land.)|alt=]]\nHowever, the simple proposal that biofuel is [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] almost by definition has been superseded by the more nuanced proposal that for a particular biofuel project to be carbon neutral, the total carbon sequestered by the energy crop's root system must compensate for all the above-ground emissions (related to this particular biofuel project). This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect [[ILUC|land use change]]. Many first generation biofuel projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives.<ref>\u00abThe environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy have been the subject of significant debate, particularly for first\u2010generation biofuels produced from food (e.g. grain and oil seed). Studies have reported life\u2010cycle GHG savings ranging from an 86% reduction to a 93% increase in GHG emissions compared with fossil fuels (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008; Davis et\u00a0al., 2009; Liska et\u00a0al., 2009; Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010). In addition, concerns have been raised that N2O emissions from biofuel feedstock cultivation could have been underestimated (Crutzen et\u00a0al., 2008; Smith & Searchinger, 2012) and that expansion of feedstock cultivation on agricultural land might displace food production onto land with high carbon stocks or high conservation value (i.e. iLUC) creating a carbon debt which could take decades to repay (Fargione et\u00a0al., 2008). Other studies have shown that direct nitrogen\u2010related emissions from annual crop feedstocks can be mitigated through optimized management practices (Davis et\u00a0al., 2013) or that payback times are less significant than proposed (Mello et\u00a0al., 2014). However, there are still significant concerns over the impacts of iLUC, despite policy developments aimed at reducing the risk of iLUC occurring (Ahlgren & Di Lucia, 2014; Del Grosso et\u00a0al., 2014).\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

This is controversial, as the allocation of GHG emissions to the management and the use of coproducts can have a large effect on the total carbon footprint of resulting bioenergy products (Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010; Davis et\u00a0al., 2013). The potential consequences of land use change (LUC) to bioenergy on GHG balance through food crop displacement or \u2018indirect\u2019 land use change (iLUC) are also an important consideration (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008).\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)</ref><ref>\u00abWhile the initial premise regarding bioenergy was that carbon recently captured from the atmosphere into plants would deliver an immediate reduction in GHG emission from fossil fuel use, the reality proved less straightforward. Studies suggested that GHG emission from energy crop production and land-use change might outweigh any CO2 mitigation (Searchinger et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Nitrous oxide (N2O) production, with its powerful global warming potential (GWP), could be a significant factor in offsetting CO2 gains (Crutzen et al., 2008) as well as possible acidification and eutrophication of the surrounding environment (Kim & Dale, 2005). However, not all biomass feedstocks are equal, and most studies critical of bioenergy production are concerned with biofuels produced from annual food crops at high fertilizer cost, sometimes using land cleared from natural ecosystems or in direct competition with food production (Naik et al., 2010). Dedicated perennial energy crops, produced on existing, lower grade, agricultural land, offer a sustainable alternative with significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration when produced with appropriate management (Crutzen et al., 2008; Hastings et al., 2008, 2012; Cherubini et al., 2009; Don- dini et al., 2009a; Don et al., 2012; Zatta et al., 2014; Rich- ter et al., 2015).\u00bb\nMcCalmont, J.

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)</ref>\n\nSome are carbon neutral or even negative, though, especially perennial crops. The amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG (greenhouse gases) emitted will determine if the total GHG life cycle cost of a biofuel project is positive, neutral or negative. A carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below-ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the total life-cycle GHG emissions above ground. In other words, to achieve carbon neutrality yields should be high and emissions should be low.\n\nHigh-yielding energy crops are thus prime candidates for carbon neutrality. The graphic on the right displays two CO<sub>2</sub> negative [[Miscanthus giganteus|Miscanthus x giganteus]] production pathways, represented in gram CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents per megajoule.

The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact. \n<ref>\u00abWhilst these values represent the extremes, they demonstrate that site selection for bioenergy crop cultivation can make the difference between large GHG savings or losses, shifting life\u2010cycle GHG [green house gas] emissions above or below mandated thresholds. Reducing uncertainties in \u2206C [carbon increase or decrease] following LUC [land use change] is therefore more important than refining N2O [nitrous oxide] emission estimates (Berhongaray et\u00a0al., 2017). Knowledge on initial soil carbon stocks could improve GHG savings achieved through targeted deployment of perennial bioenergy crops on low carbon soils (see section 2). [\u2026] The assumption that annual cropland provides greater potential for soil carbon sequestration than grassland appears to be over\u2010simplistic, but there is an opportunity to improve predictions of soil carbon sequestration potential using information on the initial soil carbon stock as a stronger predictor of \u2206C [change in carbon amount] than prior land use.\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

Soils already rich in carbon includes [[Mire|peatland]] and mature forest. [[Grassland]] can also be carbon rich, however Milner et al. argues that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands. \n<ref>\u00abFig.\u00a03 confirmed either no change or a gain of SOC [soil organic carbon] (positive) through planting Miscanthus on arable land across England and Wales and only a loss of SOC (negative) in parts of Scotland. The total annual SOC change across GB in the transition from arable to Miscanthus if all nonconstrained land was planted with would be 3.3 Tg C yr\u22121 [3.3 million tonnes carbon per year]. The mean changes for SOC for the different land uses were all positive when histosols were excluded, with improved grasslands yielding the highest Mg C ha\u22121\u00a0yr\u22121 [tonnes carbon per hectare per year] at 1.49, followed by arable lands at 1.28 and forest at 1. Separating this SOC change by original land use (Fig.\u00a04) reveals that there are large regions of improved grasslands which, if planted with bioenergy crops, are predicted to result in an increase in SOC. A similar result was found when considering the transition from arable land; however for central eastern England, there was a predicted neutral effect on SOC. Scotland, however, is predicted to have a decrease for all land uses, particularly for woodland due mainly to higher SOC and lower Miscanthus yields and hence less input.\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

[[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]].\n\n[[Biodiesel]] is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. It can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nIn 2018, worldwide biofuel production reached 152 billion liters (40 billion gallons US), up 7% from 2017,<ref name=\"Transport biofuels\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/tcep/transport/biofuels/|title=Transport biofuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and biofuels provided 3% of the world's fuels for road transport.

The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.\n\nSyngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.<ref name=\"e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch\">[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008</ref> The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.\n\nSyngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nLower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].\n\n===Ethanol===\n\n{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}\n[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]|alt=]]\nBiologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory<ref>[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | L\u00e4r dig mer om energi - E.ON<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \u2013 where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.\n\nEthanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.\n\nEthanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are \"flueless\", bioethanol fires<ref>Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)</ref> are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.\nThe downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCorn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,<ref>see \"Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol\"</ref> the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.<ref>Brinkman, N. et al., \"Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems\", 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. |display-authors=et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506\u20138 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]].

It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.<ref>[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]</ref>\n\nIn some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100<!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) -->. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.\n\nElectronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.\nSince biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714031730/http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk/ |archive-date=14 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel.

Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.\n\nAs with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&W Diesel]], [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.\n\nVegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-\"Pumpe Duse\" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.\n\nOils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute.

However, despite these efforts, drop-in biofuels represent only a small percentage (around 2%) of global biofuel markets. ... Due to the increased processing and resource requirements (e.g., hydrogen and catalysts) needed to make drop-in biofuels as compared to conventional biofuels, large scale production of cost-competitive drop-in biofuels is not expected to occur in the near to midterm. Rather, dedicated policies to promote development and commercialization of these fuels will be needed before they become significant contributors to global biofuels production. Currently, no policies (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies etc.) differentiate new, more fungible and infrastructure ready drop-in type biofuels from less infrastructure compatible oxygenated biofuels. ...  Thus, while tremendous technical progress has been made in developing and improving the various routes to drop-in fuels, supportive policies directed specifically towards the further development of drop-in biofuels are likely to be needed to ensure their future commercial success.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |url-status=live |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |pages=177, 182 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== By region==\n{{Main|Biofuels by region}}\n{{See also|Biodiesel by region}}\n[[File:Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of Indian Navy.jpg|alt=|thumb|Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of [[Indian Navy]] patrolling during [[International Fleet Review 2016|IFR 2016]].

The team from B+H helped in the schematic design for the three-storey suspended [[scaffolding]], that allowed the construction to take place while the employees and businesses within the various floors of the building could continue to work.The scaffolding design is comparable to the platform systems used for window-washing tall buildings. All done on the exterior of the building, three floors worth of marble panels were removed and replaced with the new [[fritted glass]] panels at one time, lowered to the ground, disposed of, and raised to continue the process. The workers, about 60-70 people at a time, started from the top of the tower and worked their way down.
