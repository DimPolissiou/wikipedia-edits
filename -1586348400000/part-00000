Founded in 1912, the university has an enrollment of more than 22,000 students.\n\nThe university maintains The Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), The [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law]], the former [[Lambuth University]] campus (now a branch campus of The University of Memphis), The Loewenberg College of Nursing, The School of Public Health, The College of Communication and Fine Arts, The [[FedEx Institute of Technology]], The [[Advanced Distributed Learning Workforce Co-Lab]], and The Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ned R. McWherter Library, University of Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ned R. McWherter|Ned R. McWherter Library]]]]\n\nIn 1909, the Tennessee Legislature enacted the General Education Bill. This bill stated that three colleges be established, one within each [[Grand Divisions (Tennessee)|grand division]] of the state and one additional school for African-American students. After much bidding and campaigning, the state had to choose between two sites to build the new college for [[West Tennessee]]: [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]] and Memphis. Memphis was chosen, one of the main reasons being the proximity of the rail line to the site proposed to build the new college for [[West Tennessee]]. This would allow professors and students to go home and visit their relatives. The other three schools established through the General Education Act evolved into [[East Tennessee State University]] (ETSU), [[Middle Tennessee State University]] (MTSU), and [[Tennessee State University]] (TSU).\n\nPrior to the establishment of the '''West Tennessee Normal School'''{{clarify |reason=Or was it West Tennessee State Normal School?  If not, please create a redirect of West Tennessee Normal School to here.|date=November 2018}} pursuant to the General Education Bill, a number of higher education departments existed in Memphis under the banner of the ''University of Memphis.'' This earlier University of Memphis was formed in 1909 by adding to an already existing medical school's departments of pharmacy, dentistry, and law.<ref name=\"Bulletin 1928\">{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C2_WAAAAMAAJ&q=memphis+law+school&dq=memphis+law+school | title = Bulletin 1928 | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | accessdate = 2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\nOn September 10, 1912, West Tennessee Normal School opened in Memphis; its first president was Seymour A. Mynders. By 1913 all departments of the earlier ''University of Memphis,'' except the [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law|law school]], had been taken over by West Tennessee Normal School.<ref name=\"Bulletin 1928\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ppgVAAAAIAAJ&dq=memphis%20law%20school&pg=PA487#v=onepage&q=memphis%20law%20school&f=false | title = Bulletin of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 1921 | publisher = | accessdate = 2010-12-05}}</ref>  After Mynders' death in 1913, John Willard Brister was chosen to take his place. After Brister's resignation in 1918, Andrew A. Kincannon became president. In 1924, Brister returned to his post as president of the school.\n\nThe name changed in 1925 to '''West Tennessee State Teachers College'''. In 1931, the campus' first newspaper, ''The Tiger Rag'', was established. In 1939, Richard C. Jones became president of WTSTC. In 1941, the name was changed to '''Memphis State College''', when the college expanded its liberal arts curriculum. In 1943, Dr. Jennings B. Sanders succeeded Jones as president. Three years later, the first alumnus to become president, J. Millard (Jack) Smith, was appointed. In 1951 MSC awarded its first B.A. degrees. In 1957 the school received full [[University]] status and changed its name accordingly to '''Memphis State University'''.\n\nIn 1959, five years after [[Brown v. Board of Education]] the university admitted its first black students. [[Racial segregation]] was the norm throughout the South at the time. The Memphis State Eight, as they were known, were admitted to Memphis State University. Their presence on campus was the focus not only of intense media scrutiny, but severe criticism from much of the local public.  Ostensibly for the black students' safety and to maintain an air of calm on the campus, University administrators placed certain restrictions on where and when the black students could be on campus.  They were to go only to their classes, not to any of the public places on campus, such as the cafeteria; and they were to leave the campus immediately after they had finished their last class. These limitations were lifted after the novelty of their presence on campus had subsided and the public's focus on their presence there had lessened, and as more and more black students were admitted to the university. Today, black students make up more than one-third of the campus student body and participate in all campus activities.\n\nCecil C. Humphreys became president of MSU, succeeding Smith, in 1960. In 1966, the school began awarding doctoral degrees. Humphreys resigned as MSU president to become the first chancellor of the newly formed State University and Community College System, later renamed the Tennessee Board of Regents. John Richardson was appointed interim president.\n\nIn 1973, Dr. Billy Mac Jones became president. Also that year, the Memphis State Tiger men's [[basketball]] team reached the finals of the [[NCAA]] tournament, only to fall at the hands of a [[UCLA]] team led by future [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] superstar and Hall of Famer [[Bill Walton]] in The NCAA Basketball Championship Game in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. In 1980, Thomas Carpenter became president of MSU; he was succeeded by V. Lane Rawlins in 1991. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University changed its name again, to the '''University of Memphis'''.\n\nV. Lane Rawlins served from 1991 to 2000; Dr. Ralph Faudree filled in as interim president for one year after V. Lane Rawlins' departure. In 2001, The U of M installed its first female president, [[Shirley Raines]], who retired in the summer of 2013. After a yearlong search, Dr. M. David Rudd was confirmed as the 12th president on May 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=M. David Rudd Named President of The University of Memphis|url=http://www.memphis.edu/presweb/|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring semester of 2020, the University joined thousands of other institutions and made a mid-semester shift to online classes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also introduced a credit/no credit grade option in lieu of the traditional grading scale for that semester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.memphis.edu/health/coronavirus/index.php|title=Coronavirus Updates|website=www.memphis.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:lawschool2.jpg|thumb|The new [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law]], a [[University of Memphis, School of Law campus|former United States federal courthouse]], opened in 2010.]]\nThe University of Memphis campus is located approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|1}} east of downtown in the University District neighborhood of east Memphis. It has an area of {{convert|1160|acre|km2}}, although this figure does not include the law school in the former United States federal customshouse in downtown Memphis, which opened in January 2010. The historical core of campus encompasses approximately {{convert|30|acre|m2}}.\n\n[[File:Wildertower.JPG|thumb|left|[[John S. Wilder|Wilder]] Tower; the tallest building of the University's main campus]]\nCampus planners have significantly increased the amount of green space and the number of walkways over the past several years, while maintaining the original historic architecture of the campus.\n\nSurrounding the university's main campus are several historic neighborhoods to the north and east, as well as the University District neighborhood and the commercial Highland Strip to the west. Many University of Memphis college students also reside in housing south of the main campus.\n\n===Layout===\nThe University of Memphis campus is set out in a rectilinear format, planned as a geometric design similar to the [[Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian]] style of the [[University of Virginia]].\n\nDespite gradual expansion of the campus to the West and South, the campus is fairly compact and retains a park-like, tree-lined setting. The farthest distance on campus takes about twenty-five minutes to walk. According to the most recent master plan, the University of Memphis is projected to expand and redevelop additional areas one block west of the main campus' current western boundary of Patterson St., making Highland Avenue the \"de facto\" entrance to the university.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shelbycountytn.gov/DocumentCenter/View/27362/FinalDraftUniversityPlan_2009|title=University District Comprehensive Plan|date=2009|website=Shelby County Tennessee}}</ref>\n\n===Main Campus===\n[[File:Manning.jpg|thumb|right|Students walking in front of [[Manning Hall]]]]\n[[File:25 - FeDex Institute of Technology.JPG|thumb|right|The [[FedEx Institute of Technology]] is a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, robotics, and intelligent systems.]]\nThe center of the main campus comprises buildings that made up the original campus. The first college buildings, including Scates Hall, Manning Hall, Mynders Hall, and Administration Building, were erected in the early 20th century. This section stretches from Patterson St. south to the end of the main campus at Walker Ave., with most buildings surrounding Alumni Mall and Student Plaza. The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments, as well as those of the Physics and Astronomy departments of the College of Arts and Sciences, are located in the original areas of campus.\n[[File:CVR College of Engineering administration building, University of Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Administration Building at the University of Memphis]]\n[[File:Scates7.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scates Hall]], the 3rd oldest building on campus]]\n\nFlanking the original area of campus to the east are the areas of major research for The Life Sciences and Engineering departments, including J.M. Smith Hall, Life Sciences Building and Herff College of Engineering Complex, as well as the College of Education, residing in E.C. Ball Hall, and the Art Museum of the University of Memphis, located in the Communication and Fine Arts Building. The [[Ned R. McWherter]] Library, a state-of-the art library facility and one of the premier research libraries of the Mid-South United States, takes up the eastern part of the campus adjacent to Dunavant Plaza and Emeriti Grove.\n\nThe northwestern area of the main campus includes The Fogelman College of Business and Economics, The Fogelman Executive Center (a major conference center for regional executives visiting The University of Memphis), and The [[FedEx Institute of Technology]], a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, Nanotechnology, Robotics and Intelligent Systems. Originally, in the north end of the campus, Norriswood Ave. was the northern boundary and was an actual street that ran through the campus. The campus expanded into this area in the late 1960s & early 1970s.\n\nThe western edge and southwest corner include Johnson Hall (comprising the Geography and Geology Departments), Patterson Hall (housing the English department), John S. Wilder Tower (formerly Brister Tower), Greek Row, and the bulk of The University of Memphis residence halls. As The University of Memphis presses ahead with its planned expansion, many more facilities, pedestrian access, and green space will also be created with the renovation and development of the currently residential block west of Patterson St. in the University District neighborhood.\n\nOn January 29, 2013, Governor [[Bill Haslam]] announced a $44.6 million state budget pledge for the Community Health Building, which will be the new home of The Loewenberg College of Nursing and The School of Communication Sciences and Disorders.  The University of Memphis was required to raise $15 million from private funds to match the state funds.\n\nIn 2017, the University announced plans for a new Veterans Care Center on campus. Located in the Psychological Services Center on campus, the Veterans Care Center \"will address the mental health needs of veterans, regardless of era, gender, discharge status or service connection.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/9/university-of-memphis-plans-veterans-care-center-o/|title=University of Memphis plans veterans care center on campus|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the University opened the Hunter Harrison Memorial Bridge, providing for the first time in school history a pedestrian crossing that connects the main campus and the campus areas south of the Norfolk-Southern railroad with uninterrupted access. This bridge connects to the new Southern Parking Garage, as well as the new $30 million Student Recreation & Fitness Center that began construction in October 2019, expanding the area of the campus south of the railroad tracks. The University also announced plans to begin building the new Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music on Central Ave. in Fall 2019, beginning a major northward expansion of campus across Central Ave.\n\n===Park Avenue Campus===\nDirectly south of the main campus along the corner of Park Avenue and Getwell Road sits the Park Avenue Campus, formerly known as South Campus. The Park Avenue Campus was formerly the site of Kennedy Veterans Hospital from 1942 until 1967, when the U.S. Government donated the land and buildings to the University. Very few buildings from the Kennedy Hospital days remain on campus. The Park Avenue Campus is home not only to various intramural athletics programs and facilities, but also to various research facilities, classrooms and the Community Health Building, which houses the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, the Memphis Speech and Hearing Center, and the Loewenberg College of Nursing. The [[Defense Contract Audit Agency]] formerly operated its main training facility on the Park Avenue Campus from 1982 to the early 2010s. [[WKNO (disambiguation)|WKNO]]<!--Intentional link to DAB page--> formerly operated its FM and television stations on the Park Avenue Campus as well.\n\nFuture plans include a regulation indoor soccer stadium and track facility, capable of hosting large-scale NCAA Division I track-and-field meets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/masterplan/pdf/memphis_mp_alternatives_presentation_workbook_20140417.pdf|title=Facilities Master Plan Update|last=|first=|date=April 15, 2014|website=www.memphis.edu|publisher=|access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe graduate and family housing units are located at Park Avenue, {{convert|1|mi|km}} from the main university campus.

This facility pre-dates the existence of the University itself, having been constructed in multiple sections between 1885 and the early 1920s. In 2010, the law school was moved permanently from the main campus to the newly renovated downtown campus. The new University of Memphis, School of Law campus sits adjacent to downtown courts and the financial and administrative center of the city. It has been ranked multiple times among the top law school facilities in the U.S.\n\n===Lambuth Campus===\nIn 2011, the University of Memphis began offering undergraduate and graduate programs on the former [[Lambuth University]] campus in [[Jackson, Tennessee]], located approximately {{convert|80|mi|km}} east of Memphis. Now known as the ''University of Memphis Lambuth Campus'', the historic campus includes classroom buildings, dormitories, library, planetarium, and athletic facilities. Enrollment in the fall of 2011 stood at 246 students.  Enrollment in the spring of 2018 was the first time enrollment surpassed 1,000 students, with a total of 1,038 students. The 2019\u20132020 term was the first term to begin with an enrollment of over 1,000 students for the campus, with an official enrollment of 1,070 students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/oir/tools/enrollgenerator.php|title=Enrollment Table Generator - University of Memphis|website=www.memphis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>\n\n===Environmentalism===\nThe Edward J.

The band performs at Memphis Tigers football games as a marching band and at Tigers basketball games as a pep band. As one of the oldest institutions at the university, the Band partakes in many of the game day traditions. The MSS performs more than any other student ensemble on campus, and for approximately 350,000 fans each fall. The MSS is featured at nearly every campus-wide event, ranging from Freshman Convocation to the Homecoming Parade and Pep Rally. The band has been featured on the nationally syndicated \"Mike & Mandy\" Radio Show, and is a star attraction at the Bandmaster's Championship, a high school marching band contest administered by The University of Memphis Band Alumni Chapter. Members of the MSS represent all academic disciplines across campus, and historically has been open to all students via audition.\n\n===Mascot===\n{{main|TOM (mascot)}}\nFor over 30 years, the sideline [[mascot]] for The University of Memphis has been a live [[Bengal tiger]] named [[TOM (mascot)|TOM]].  During this time, the university has hosted three successive tigers, known respectively as TOM I, TOM II, and TOM III.  The university also has a costumed tiger mascot known as Pouncer.\n\nTOM III, the current Tiger mascot, attends all Tiger football home games and other University events. TOM III travels in a climate-controlled trailer with a police escort. TOM III is housed and cared for by the Highland Hundred Tiger Guard, an alumni [[booster club|booster organization]] in a $300,000 facility. TOM II matured, eventually weighing more than {{convert|500|lb}}. The University of Memphis is one of only two universities in America with a live tiger mascot (the other being [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]). After being diagnosed with mouth cancer, TOM II was [[euthanasia|euthanized]] on October 15, 2008, at the age of 17.  The team of veterinarians who oversaw TOM II decided this was necessary to ensure he did not suffer due to his illness.\n\nThe Highland Hundred football booster group found a replacement for the mascot in the tiger cub TOM III.\n\nThe university currently has fifty tiger statues located on campus and another fifty located around the Memphis area. The Alumni Association placed the life-sized tigers around the city in honor of the University's Centennial in January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/alumni/tigersaroundtown/|title=Alumni Association :: Tigers Around Town :: University of Memphis|work=memphis.edu|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Nickname===\nWhen the University of Memphis first fielded a football team in the fall of 1912, no one had selected a nickname for the squad. Early references to the football team tabbed them only as the Blue and Gray Warriors.\n\nAfter the final game of the 1914 season, there was a student parade. During this event, several university students shouted, \"We fight like Tigers!\" The nickname was born. As time passed, the nickname \"Tigers\" was increasingly used, particularly in campus publications, but did not catch on with the newspapers downtown. They continued to use \"the Blue and Gray\" when referring to the university.\n\nUnder Coach Lester Barnard in 1922, Memphis's football team gave a ring of truth to that old student yell about Tigers. The team adopted a motto \u2013 \"Every Man a Tiger\" \u2013 and went on to score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points. The Tiger nickname continued with students and alumni, eventually being adopted as the official nickname for the University of Memphis in 1939.\n\n===Song===\nNotable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], and athletic games is \"Go! Tigers! Go!\", the University of Memphis Tigers' [[fight song]].  The fight song was written by Tom Ferguson, former Director of Bands at Memphis State University during the 1960s.\n\n==Special programs==\n\n===Tennessee Governor's School for International Studies===\nThe Governor's School for International Studies is an academic summer program for gifted junior and senior high school students in Tennessee. It is a selective program located at the University of Memphis in which students study two Political Science, a foreign language, and an elective of their choice from the International Studies curriculum. The students, upon finishing the four-week term, gain six hours of college credit which may be transferred to any Tennessee Board of Regents School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/govschool/ |title=Governors School for International Studies :: Governor's School for International Studies :: University of Memphis |publisher=Memphis.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===Chucalissa Indian Village===\nUofM also operates the [[T.

Founded in 1912, the university has an enrollment of more than 22,000 students.\n\nThe university maintains The Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), The [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law]], the former [[Lambuth University]] campus (now a branch campus of The University of Memphis), The Loewenberg College of Nursing, The School of Public Health, The College of Communication and Fine Arts, The [[FedEx Institute of Technology]], The [[Advanced Distributed Learning Workforce Co-Lab]], and The Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ned R. McWherter Library, University of Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ned R. McWherter|Ned R. McWherter Library]]]]\n\nIn 1909, the Tennessee Legislature enacted the General Education Bill. This bill stated that three colleges be established, one within each [[Grand Divisions (Tennessee)|grand division]] of the state and one additional school for African-American students. After much bidding and campaigning, the state had to choose between two sites to build the new college for [[West Tennessee]]: [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]] and Memphis. Memphis was chosen, one of the main reasons being the proximity of the rail line to the site proposed to build the new college for [[West Tennessee]]. This would allow professors and students to go home and visit their relatives. The other three schools established through the General Education Act evolved into [[East Tennessee State University]] (ETSU), [[Middle Tennessee State University]] (MTSU), and [[Tennessee State University]] (TSU).\n\nPrior to the establishment of the '''West Tennessee Normal School'''{{clarify |reason=Or was it West Tennessee State Normal School?  If not, please create a redirect of West Tennessee Normal School to here.|date=November 2018}} pursuant to the General Education Bill, a number of higher education departments existed in Memphis under the banner of the ''University of Memphis.'' This earlier University of Memphis was formed in 1909 by adding to an already existing medical school's departments of pharmacy, dentistry, and law.<ref name=\"Bulletin 1928\">{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C2_WAAAAMAAJ&q=memphis+law+school&dq=memphis+law+school | title = Bulletin 1928 | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | accessdate = 2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\nOn September 10, 1912, West Tennessee Normal School opened in Memphis; its first president was Seymour A. Mynders. By 1913 all departments of the earlier ''University of Memphis,'' except the [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law|law school]], had been taken over by West Tennessee Normal School.<ref name=\"Bulletin 1928\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ppgVAAAAIAAJ&dq=memphis%20law%20school&pg=PA487#v=onepage&q=memphis%20law%20school&f=false | title = Bulletin of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 1921 | publisher = | accessdate = 2010-12-05}}</ref>  After Mynders' death in 1913, John Willard Brister was chosen to take his place. After Brister's resignation in 1918, Andrew A. Kincannon became president. In 1924, Brister returned to his post as president of the school.\n\nThe name changed in 1925 to '''West Tennessee State Teachers College'''. In 1931, the campus' first newspaper, ''The Tiger Rag'', was established. In 1939, Richard C. Jones became president of WTSTC. In 1941, the name was changed to '''Memphis State College''', when the college expanded its liberal arts curriculum. In 1943, Dr. Jennings B. Sanders succeeded Jones as president. Three years later, the first alumnus to become president, J. Millard (Jack) Smith, was appointed. In 1951 MSC awarded its first B.A. degrees. In 1957 the school received full [[University]] status and changed its name accordingly to '''Memphis State University'''.\n\nIn 1959, five years after [[Brown v. Board of Education]] the university admitted its first black students. [[Racial segregation]] was the norm throughout the South at the time. The Memphis State Eight, as they were known, were admitted to Memphis State University. Their presence on campus was the focus not only of intense media scrutiny, but severe criticism from much of the local public.  Ostensibly for the black students' safety and to maintain an air of calm on the campus, University administrators placed certain restrictions on where and when the black students could be on campus.  They were to go only to their classes, not to any of the public places on campus, such as the cafeteria; and they were to leave the campus immediately after they had finished their last class. These limitations were lifted after the novelty of their presence on campus had subsided and the public's focus on their presence there had lessened, and as more and more black students were admitted to the university. Today, black students make up more than one-third of the campus student body and participate in all campus activities.\n\nCecil C. Humphreys became president of MSU, succeeding Smith, in 1960. In 1966, the school began awarding doctoral degrees. Humphreys resigned as MSU president to become the first chancellor of the newly formed State University and Community College System, later renamed the Tennessee Board of Regents. John Richardson was appointed interim president.\n\nIn 1973, Dr. Billy Mac Jones became president. Also that year, the Memphis State Tiger men's [[basketball]] team reached the finals of the [[NCAA]] tournament, only to fall at the hands of a [[UCLA]] team led by future [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] superstar and Hall of Famer [[Bill Walton]] in The NCAA Basketball Championship Game in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. In 1980, Thomas Carpenter became president of MSU; he was succeeded by V. Lane Rawlins in 1991. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University changed its name again, to the '''University of Memphis'''.\n\nV. Lane Rawlins served from 1991 to 2000; Dr. Ralph Faudree filled in as interim president for one year after V. Lane Rawlins' departure. In 2001, The U of M installed its first female president, [[Shirley Raines]], who retired in the summer of 2013. After a yearlong search, Dr. M. David Rudd was confirmed as the 12th president on May 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=M. David Rudd Named President of The University of Memphis|url=http://www.memphis.edu/presweb/|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring semester of 2020, the University joined thousands of other institutions and made a mid-semester shift to online classes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also introduced a credit/no credit grade option in lieu of the traditional grading scale for that semester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.memphis.edu/health/coronavirus/index.php|title=Coronavirus Updates|website=www.memphis.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:lawschool2.jpg|thumb|The new [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law]], a [[University of Memphis, School of Law campus|former United States federal courthouse]], opened in 2010.]]\nThe University of Memphis campus is located approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|1}} east of downtown in the University District neighborhood of east Memphis. It has an area of {{convert|1160|acre|km2}}, although this figure does not include the law school in the former United States federal customshouse in downtown Memphis, which opened in January 2010. The historical core of campus encompasses approximately {{convert|30|acre|m2}}.\n\n[[File:Wildertower.JPG|thumb|left|[[John S. Wilder|Wilder]] Tower; the tallest building of the University's main campus]]\nCampus planners have significantly increased the amount of green space and the number of walkways over the past several years, while maintaining the original historic architecture of the campus.\n\nSurrounding the university's main campus are several historic neighborhoods to the north and east, as well as the University District neighborhood and the commercial Highland Strip to the west. Many University of Memphis college students also reside in housing south of the main campus.\n\n===Layout===\nThe University of Memphis campus is set out in a rectilinear format, planned as a geometric design similar to the [[Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian]] style of the [[University of Virginia]].\n\nDespite gradual expansion of the campus to the West and South, the campus is fairly compact and retains a park-like, tree-lined setting. The farthest distance on campus takes about twenty-five minutes to walk. According to the most recent master plan, the University of Memphis is projected to expand and redevelop additional areas one block west of the main campus' current western boundary of Patterson St., making Highland Avenue the \"de facto\" entrance to the university.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shelbycountytn.gov/DocumentCenter/View/27362/FinalDraftUniversityPlan_2009|title=University District Comprehensive Plan|date=2009|website=Shelby County Tennessee}}</ref>\n\n===Main Campus===\n[[File:Manning.jpg|thumb|right|Students walking in front of [[Manning Hall]]]]\n[[File:25 - FeDex Institute of Technology.JPG|thumb|right|The [[FedEx Institute of Technology]] is a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, robotics, and intelligent systems.]]\nThe center of the main campus comprises buildings that made up the original campus. The first college buildings, including Scates Hall, Manning Hall, Mynders Hall, and Administration Building, were erected in the early 20th century. This section stretches from Patterson St. south to the end of the main campus at Walker Ave., with most buildings surrounding Alumni Mall and Student Plaza. The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments, as well as those of the Physics and Astronomy departments of the College of Arts and Sciences, are located in the original areas of campus.\n[[File:CVR College of Engineering administration building, University of Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Administration Building at the University of Memphis]]\n[[File:Scates7.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scates Hall]], the 3rd oldest building on campus]]\n\nFlanking the original area of campus to the east are the areas of major research for The Life Sciences and Engineering departments, including J.M. Smith Hall, Life Sciences Building and Herff College of Engineering Complex, as well as the College of Education, residing in E.C. Ball Hall, and the Art Museum of the University of Memphis, located in the Communication and Fine Arts Building. The [[Ned R. McWherter]] Library, a state-of-the art library facility and one of the premier research libraries of the Mid-South United States, takes up the eastern part of the campus adjacent to Dunavant Plaza and Emeriti Grove.\n\nThe northwestern area of the main campus includes The Fogelman College of Business and Economics, The Fogelman Executive Center (a major conference center for regional executives visiting The University of Memphis), and The [[FedEx Institute of Technology]], a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, Nanotechnology, Robotics and Intelligent Systems. Originally, in the north end of the campus, Norriswood Ave. was the northern boundary and was an actual street that ran through the campus. The campus expanded into this area in the late 1960s & early 1970s.\n\nThe western edge and southwest corner include Johnson Hall (comprising the Geography and Geology Departments), Patterson Hall (housing the English department), John S. Wilder Tower (formerly Brister Tower), Greek Row, and the bulk of The University of Memphis residence halls. As The University of Memphis presses ahead with its planned expansion, many more facilities, pedestrian access, and green space will also be created with the renovation and development of the currently residential block west of Patterson St. in the University District neighborhood.\n\nOn January 29, 2013, Governor [[Bill Haslam]] announced a $44.6 million state budget pledge for the Community Health Building, which will be the new home of The Loewenberg College of Nursing and The School of Communication Sciences and Disorders.  The University of Memphis was required to raise $15 million from private funds to match the state funds.\n\nIn 2017, the University announced plans for a new Veterans Care Center on campus. Located in the Psychological Services Center on campus, the Veterans Care Center \"will address the mental health needs of veterans, regardless of era, gender, discharge status or service connection.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/9/university-of-memphis-plans-veterans-care-center-o/|title=University of Memphis plans veterans care center on campus|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the University opened the Hunter Harrison Memorial Bridge, providing for the first time in school history a pedestrian crossing that connects the main campus and the campus areas south of the Norfolk-Southern railroad with uninterrupted access. This bridge connects to the new Southern Parking Garage, as well as the new $30 million Student Recreation & Fitness Center that began construction in October 2019, expanding the area of the campus south of the railroad tracks. The University also announced plans to begin building the new Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music on Central Ave. in Fall 2019, beginning a major northward expansion of campus across Central Ave.\n\n===Park Avenue Campus===\nDirectly south of the main campus along the corner of Park Avenue and Getwell Road sits the Park Avenue Campus, formerly known as South Campus. The Park Avenue Campus was formerly the site of Kennedy Veterans Hospital from 1942 until 1967, when the U.S. Government donated the land and buildings to the University. Very few buildings from the Kennedy Hospital days remain on campus. The Park Avenue Campus is home not only to various intramural athletics programs and facilities, but also to various research facilities, classrooms and the Community Health Building, which houses the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, the Memphis Speech and Hearing Center, and the Loewenberg College of Nursing. The [[Defense Contract Audit Agency]] formerly operated its main training facility on the Park Avenue Campus from 1982 to the early 2010s.

Since that time, the newspaper has been continuously published by University of Memphis students. Even during World War II when paper and other resources were scarce, the newspaper published as a newsletter posted on bulletin boards around campus.\n\nThe name of the newspaper was changed to ''The Helmsman'' in 1972, and became ''The Daily Helmsman'' in 1981, when the newspaper began publishing four days a week.\n\n''The Helmsman'' has won many honors over the years for reporting, photography and design, including awards given by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, Columbia University and the Southeastern Journalism Conference.

The band performs at Memphis Tigers football games as a marching band and at Tigers basketball games as a pep band. As one of the oldest institutions at the university, the Band partakes in many of the game day traditions. The MSS performs more than any other student ensemble on campus, and for approximately 350,000 fans each fall. The MSS is featured at nearly every campus-wide event, ranging from Freshman Convocation to the Homecoming Parade and Pep Rally. The band has been featured on the nationally syndicated \"Mike & Mandy\" Radio Show, and is a star attraction at the Bandmaster's Championship, a high school marching band contest administered by The University of Memphis Band Alumni Chapter. Members of the MSS represent all academic disciplines across campus, and historically has been open to all students via audition.\n\n===Mascot===\n{{main|TOM (mascot)}}\nFor over 30 years, the sideline [[mascot]] for The University of Memphis has been a live [[Bengal tiger]] named [[TOM (mascot)|TOM]].  During this time, the university has hosted three successive tigers, known respectively as TOM I, TOM II, and TOM III.  The university also has a costumed tiger mascot known as Pouncer.\n\nTOM III, the current Tiger mascot, attends all Tiger football home games and other University events. TOM III travels in a climate-controlled trailer with a police escort. TOM III is housed and cared for by the Highland Hundred Tiger Guard, an alumni [[booster club|booster organization]] in a $300,000 facility. TOM II matured, eventually weighing more than {{convert|500|lb}}. The University of Memphis is one of only two universities in America with a live tiger mascot (the other being [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]). After being diagnosed with mouth cancer, TOM II was [[euthanasia|euthanized]] on October 15, 2008, at the age of 17.  The team of veterinarians who oversaw TOM II decided this was necessary to ensure he did not suffer due to his illness.\n\nThe Highland Hundred football booster group found a replacement for the mascot in the tiger cub TOM III.\n\nThe university currently has fifty tiger statues located on campus and another fifty located around the Memphis area. The Alumni Association placed the life-sized tigers around the city in honor of the University's Centennial in January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/alumni/tigersaroundtown/|title=Alumni Association :: Tigers Around Town :: University of Memphis|work=memphis.edu|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Nickname===\nWhen the University of Memphis first fielded a football team in the fall of 1912, no one had selected a nickname for the squad. Early references to the football team tabbed them only as the Blue and Gray Warriors.\n\nAfter the final game of the 1914 season, there was a student parade. During this event, several university students shouted, \"We fight like Tigers!\" The nickname was born. As time passed, the nickname \"Tigers\" was increasingly used, particularly in campus publications, but did not catch on with the newspapers downtown. They continued to use \"the Blue and Gray\" when referring to the university.\n\nUnder Coach Lester Barnard in 1922, Memphis's football team gave a ring of truth to that old student yell about Tigers. The team adopted a motto \u2013 \"Every Man a Tiger\" \u2013 and went on to score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points. The Tiger nickname continued with students and alumni, eventually being adopted as the official nickname for the University of Memphis in 1939.\n\n===Song===\nNotable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], and athletic games is \"Go! Tigers! Go!\", the University of Memphis Tigers' [[fight song]].  The fight song was written by Tom Ferguson, former Director of Bands at Memphis State University during the 1960s.\n\n==Special programs==\n\n===Tennessee Governor's School for International Studies===\nThe Governor's School for International Studies is an academic summer program for gifted junior and senior high school students in Tennessee. It is a selective program located at the University of Memphis in which students study two Political Science, a foreign language, and an elective of their choice from the International Studies curriculum. The students, upon finishing the four-week term, gain six hours of college credit which may be transferred to any Tennessee Board of Regents School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/govschool/ |title=Governors School for International Studies :: Governor's School for International Studies :: University of Memphis |publisher=Memphis.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===Chucalissa Indian Village===\nUofM also operates the [[T.
