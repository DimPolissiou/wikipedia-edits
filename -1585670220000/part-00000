The series stars [[Eugene Levy]] and [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Johnny and Moira Rose, a wealthy couple who are forced, after losing all their money, to rebuild their lives in their only remaining asset: the small town of Schitt's Creek, which they once purchased as a joke, where they are living with their two adult children in two adjacent rooms of a rundown motel.\n\n==Total nominations and awards
