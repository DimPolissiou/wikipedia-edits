Liberty National also hosts junior golf tournaments, the First Tee of New Jersey, and local high school golf teams from Jersey City practice and play their home matches at the course.  \n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nThe Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation was created in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.ppffound.org/about/|title=The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since its inception, the foundation has distributed over $165 million to charitable organizations with a focus primarily on improving the communities of both Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nAddressing homelessness has been a major initiative of the foundation.

Brockenhurst College has been an accredited [[Investors in People]] since 1996, and in 2004 was awarded by the [[AoC Beacon Awards|AoC Beacon Award]] and is also rated 'Good' by [[Ofsted]].<ref name=\"BomoEcho20170309\"/>\n\nThe types of courses the college provides are professional, vocational and [[Advanced Level (UK)|AS/A Level]] courses, [[Foundation Degree]]s and Apprenticeships.\n\n==Campus==\n\nThe College, with its many different buildings and uses, is divided up into A, B, E, M, S and T blocks. In addition to the Main Hall and Foyer, there are also other blocks given full names, such as the Sports Centre, the '''Hard Brock Caf\u00e9''', the Learning Care Centre, and the LRC (Learning Resources Centre).\n\nThere is also '''Highwood Nursery''' located between the sports centre and the car park. The college has adult learning centres in Brockenhurst, [[Lymington]] and [[New Milton]] along with the [[Hengistbury Head]] Outdoor Activity Centre and the Marchwood Marine and Construction Centre.\n[[Image:Brockenhurst College Promenade.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The promenade, with the main hall behind, connecting the M Block with the S Block, A Block and LRC.]]\n\n'''M Block'''\n\nM Block, standing for Main Building, is the oldest section of the college which includes the original hall, now called the SEC, used as a secondary room for exams and enrichment programmes. Also within the block, besides the main reception area, are much of the non-teaching staff at Brock as well as the main division offices and the Principal's offices. The offices are also used by [[connexions (agency)|Connexions]] and EMA ([[Education Maintenance Allowance]]) attendants located at Student Services. Based also in this block are a highly skilled team of IT professionals who are in charge of the college network system and maintenance of all college's IT equipment.\n\nMany of the lessons held in this block are [[Music]] courses with their own sound rooms and recording studios, [[Performing Arts]] and [[Theatre]] with their own Performing Arts Centre, [[Mass media|Media]] which also have sound rooms and digital editing suites, Philosophy, [[Politics]], [[Archeology]], [[History]], and [[Business]] which has over five computer suits for its study.\n\n'''A and S Block'''\n\nA Block contains the Specialist Art Centre, and S is the Sciences Centre complete with three-story building of [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Physics]] [[laboratories]] on the ground, first and second floor respectively. Both Chemistry and Biology have student accessible prep rooms frequented by staff. Alongside Physics, a GCSE in [[Astronomy]] is also offered. On the bottom floor is the staff room used for morning meetings with the Principal and division heads.\n[[Image:Beacon Block.jpg|right|thumb|200px|To the right the Beacon Technology Block]]\n'''B Block'''\n\nThe Beacon Technology Block, named after the college's Beacon Status, contains recording studios, media suites and a photo development lab. All top floor classrooms in the block are fitted with flat screens attached to PCs, and some classrooms are fitted with Apple Mac computers.\n\nOn the ground floor of the building are the Training Kitchens and MJ's Restaurant, which is open to the public. Engineering technology facilities and workshops are based in the block, as well as the [[Graphic Design]] rooms.\n[[Image:Brockenhurst College E Block.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Errington Block.]]\n\n'''E Block'''\n\nThe Errington Block, which was named after an ex-governor of the college, holds additional classrooms for [[Language]], [[Sociology]], [[Psychology]], [[Business Studies]], Child Care, [[Key Skills]] and [[GCSE]] courses. Each room is fitted with digital projectors and computers.\n\n'''Sports Centre'''\n\nThe sports centre holds all main functions regarding sports, and also contains a Fitness Suite which is opened to the public and college staff during the day and after college hours. The sports centre is also home to the National Volleyball League's [[New Forest Volleyball Club]]\n\n'''The Hard Brock Caf\u00e9'''\n\nThe Hard Brock Caf\u00e9 is a main social attraction for many college students and also holds the offices of the Students' Union. The caf\u00e9 provides hot and cold meals, quick snacks, drinks and ice creams.\n\n'''LRC (Learning Resources Centre)'''\n\nThe LRC was originally the college main hall and is now the main study area for students at Brock. The LRC has a small library containing a wide selection of course books and relevant course DVDs and CDs, as well as a wide selection of magazines from the [[NME]] to [[The Economist]]. As well as this on the top floor is an [[ILT]] Suite. In this building there is also [[Reprography|reprographics]] and private study rooms.\n\n'''STEM Centre / T Block'''\n\nThe STEM Centre was constructed from 2015\u20132016 and replaced most of the [[portable classrooms]] which formed H Block. Funding partly came from the M3 Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP).  The centre contains computer suites, study and social space, plus the Mathematics department on the first floor.\n\n==History==\n'''Pupil teachers' centre 1909\u20131921'''\n\nBrockenhurst College began its existence in 1909 as a [[pupil teachers' centre]] \u2013 a school where girls from age 13 learned to be teachers. The classes were held in the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Church]] [[Sunday School]], with only 18 children attending under the head mistress, Miss Moore. Although classes were first held in the church Sunday school, Brockenhurst never had any religious affiliation or received any funding from ecclesiastical authorities. It was always funded by the [[Hampshire Education Authority]], and the Sunday school room was used simply because it offered suitable accommodation. Between 1913 and 1935 the school moved location twice and changed head mistress to Miss Emma Clara Ward. During this time the school increased further with more problems continuing for teaching space.\n\n'''County school 1921\u20131939'''\n\nTaking in both boys and girls, the school was still expanding further with more pupils joining, by now numbering 150. Along with this the education board granted more funding and further building work; this was followed by a new hall, kitchen and a woodwork room. Miss Ward died in October 1935 to be replaced by the former head of Farnborough Grammar School, Mr R H May.\n\n'''County High School 1939\u20131950'''\n\nThe school by this time had grown even further to a [[high school]] enrolling 400 students and as young as eleven.\n\n'''Grammar school 1950\u20131953'''\n\nIn 1950 the [[headmaster]] decided that the school should be turned into a [[grammar school]] and students would therefore have to pass the [[eleven-plus exam|11-plus]] to join. At this stage the school was still taking in both sexes and was resisting the change wanted by the local community. It was also at this time that the headmaster changed Brock's motto to what it is today without any warning to staff or pupils.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The motto in the early 50s was \"Manners Makyth Man\", borrowed from Winchester College (the school song \"Forty Years On\" was borrowed from Harrow). The new motto \"Inter Silvas Quaerere Verum\" (Seek Truth [or Learning] Amongst the Trees), an adaptation from Horace's Epistles, refers to the school's location in the New Forest.  In spite of the borrowings from boys' public schools it is said that Dr Wood, formerly of Bedales school, accepted the post of Headmaster only on the condition that Brockenhurst remained co-educational rather than becoming boys only as had been proposed.\n\n'''County High School (again) 1953\u20131960'''\n\nIn 1953 the headmaster made another unexpected decision changed the name back to a high school. The name remained for seven years until the [[Hampshire Education Authority]] sanctioned the change to a grammar school.\n\n'''Grammar school 1960\u20131970'''\n\nFinally the name of grammar school remained for the following ten years after being reinstated by the Education Authority.\n\n'''College 1970\u2013'''\n\nThe school was converted into a [[college]] in 1969, leaving all the surrounding schools to continue lower school education in the area, and became a tertiary college in 1985.<ref>{{cite web | last =Merry | first =Louise | title =Brockenhurst college guide | work =The Telegraph | publisher =Telegraph Media Group | date =6 July 2011 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8480291/Brockenhurst-college-guide.html | accessdate =26 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Head masters/mistresses and principals==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Brock_totempoll.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Brock College Totem Poll]] -->\n* Miss Moore 1909\u20131913 (Head Mistress)<ref name=hist>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041205032723/http://www.avocaberks.ndonet.com/brockosa/history/history.htm History] at archive of avocaberks.ndonet.com</ref>\n* Miss Emma Clara Ward 1913\u20131935 (Head Mistress)<ref name=hist/>\n* Mr Green 1935 (Acting Head Master)<ref name=hist/>\n* Mr R.

The new motto \"Inter Silvas Quaerere Verum\" (Seek Truth [or Learning] Amongst the Trees), an adaptation from Horace's Epistles, refers to the school's location in the New Forest.  In spite of the borrowings from boys' public schools it is said that Dr Wood, formerly of Bedales school, accepted the post of Headmaster only on the condition that Brockenhurst remained co-educational rather than becoming boys only as had been proposed.\n\n'''County High School (again) 1953\u20131960'''\n\nIn 1953 the headmaster made another unexpected decision changed the name back to a high school. The name remained for seven years until the [[Hampshire Education Authority]] sanctioned the change to a grammar school.\n\n'''Grammar school 1960\u20131970'''\n\nFinally the name of grammar school remained for the following ten years after being reinstated by the Education Authority.\n\n'''College 1970\u2013'''\n\nThe school was converted into a [[college]] in 1969, leaving all the surrounding schools to continue lower school education in the area, and became a tertiary college in 1985.<ref>{{cite web | last =Merry | first =Louise | title =Brockenhurst college guide | work =The Telegraph | publisher =Telegraph Media Group | date =6 July 2011 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8480291/Brockenhurst-college-guide.html | accessdate =26 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Head masters/mistresses and principals==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Brock_totempoll.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Brock College Totem Poll]] -->\n* Miss Moore 1909\u20131913 (Head Mistress)<ref name=hist>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041205032723/http://www.avocaberks.ndonet.com/brockosa/history/history.htm History] at archive of avocaberks.ndonet.com</ref>\n* Miss Emma Clara Ward 1913\u20131935 (Head Mistress)<ref name=hist/>\n* Mr Green 1935 (Acting Head Master)<ref name=hist/>\n* Mr R.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|ongoing coronavirus pandemic]] has necessitated changes to the PPV; Money in the Bank was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> An advertisement promoting Money in the Bank aired during the second half of [[WrestleMania 36]], but with no reference to a venue.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell\u2019s live review of Night Two featuring Brock Lesnar vs. Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship, John Cena vs. \u201cThe Fiend\u201d Bray Wyatt in a Firefly Funhouse match, Edge vs. Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match, Rhea Ripley vs. Charlotte Flair for the NXT Women\u2019s Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/05/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-two-featuring-brock-lesnar-vs-drew-mcintyre-for-the-wwe-championship-john-cena-vs-the-fiend-bray-wyatt-in-a-firefly-funhouse-match/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 5, 2020|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, Royal Farms Arena cancelled the event due to the pandemic, and began issuing refunds.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|ongoing coronavirus pandemic]] has necessitated changes to the PPV; Money in the Bank was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> An advertisement promoting Money in the Bank aired during the second half of [[WrestleMania 36]], but with no reference to a venue.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell\u2019s live review of Night Two featuring Brock Lesnar vs. Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship, John Cena vs. \u201cThe Fiend\u201d Bray Wyatt in a Firefly Funhouse match, Edge vs. Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match, Rhea Ripley vs. Charlotte Flair for the NXT Women\u2019s Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/05/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-two-featuring-brock-lesnar-vs-drew-mcintyre-for-the-wwe-championship-john-cena-vs-the-fiend-bray-wyatt-in-a-firefly-funhouse-match/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 5, 2020|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, Royal Farms Arena cancelled the event due to the pandemic, and began issuing refunds.
