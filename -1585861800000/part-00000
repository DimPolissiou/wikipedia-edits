In 1960 he founded the ''avant garde'' literary journal ''[[Tel Quel]]'' (along with writer and art critic [[Marcelin Pleynet]]), which was published by Le Seuil and ran until 1982. Sollers then created the journal ''[[L'Infini]]'', published first by [[Denoel]], then by [[Gallimard]] with Sollers remaining as sole editor.\n\nSollers was at the heart of the period of intellectual unrest in the Paris of the 1960s and 1970s. He contributed to the publication of critics and thinkers such [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Roland Barthes]]. Some of them were later described in his novel, ''[[Femmes]]'' (1983) alongside other figures of French intellectualism active before and after [[May 1968 French civil unrest|May 1968]].\n\nHis writings and approach to language were examined and praised by French critic [[Roland Barthes]] in his book ''[[Writer Sollers]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Writer_Sollers.html?id=7-5cAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Writer Sollers|last=Barthes|first=Roland|date=1987|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780485113372|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSollers married [[Julia Kristeva]] in 1967.\n\n==Biography==\nSollers was born as Philippe Joyaux In [[Talence]], where his family ran the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Joyaux Fr\u00e8res'', the iron factory ''Recalt'' producing material for kitchens, metal constructions and machines for the [[SNCASO]] under the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II]].<ref>[http://www.actuacity.com/talence_33400/monuments/page2 Usine de ferblanterie Recalt ; usine de chaudronnerie Boyer S.A.], Actuacity</ref> His parents were Octave Joyaux and Marcelle Molini\u00e9. He moved to Paris in 1955, studied at the [[Lyc\u00e9e priv\u00e9 Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]] of [[Versailles]] and at the [[ESSEC Business School]].<ref>Anna Topaloff, \" ESSEC, la business school qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 tout \", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', juillet 2015, pages 54\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Philippe Sollers 1992.jpg|thumb|Philippe Sollers 1992]]\nFollowing his first novel ''A Strange Solitude'' (1958), hailed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]] and [[Louis Aragon]], Sollers began, with ''The Park'' (1961) the experiments in narrative form that would lead to ''Event'' (''Drame'', 1965) and ''Nombres'' (1968). [[Jacques Derrida]] analyzed these novels in his book ''Dissemination''. Sollers then attempted to counter the high seriousness of ''Nombres'' in ''Lois'' (1972), which featured greater linguistic vitality through the use of wordplay and a less formal style. The direction taken by ''Lois'' was developed through the heightened rhythmic intensity of non-punctuated texts such as ''Paradis'' (1981).\n[[File:Philippe Sollers \u00e0 Bordeaux dans le parc de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 familiale en 1937 avec sa m\u00e8re et sa soeur Annie.jpg|thumb|left|Philippe Sollers in Bordeaux in the homestead park in 1937 with his mother and his sister Annie.]]\nSollers's other novels include ''Women'' (1983), ''Portrait du joueur'' (1984), ''Le coeur absolu'' (1986), ''Watteau in Venice'' (1991), ''Studio'' (1997), ''Passion fixe'' (2000), ''L'\u00e9toile des amants'' (2002), which have all introduced a degree of realism to his fiction to the extent that they make more recognizable use of plot, character and thematic development. They offer the reader a clear fictional study of the society in which he or she lives by reinterpreting, among other things, the role of politics, media, sex, religion, and the arts.\n\nIn all these novels Sollers's interest in Chinese civilization plays an important part. From the late 1960s on, he studied Chinese and employed ideograms increasingly in his writings. He especially exemplifies this view in the subtitle of ''Lois'', a Chinese ideogram representing both \"France\" and \"Law.\"\n\nHis writings bear a particular focus on musicality. Vocalisation, or his preference for the spoken word, is seen a priority for Sollers. The combination of music, voice and theatre is especially found in opera. The kind of opera associated with Sollers should properly be called opera bouffe because of its sense of humour and love of irony: opera bouffe is a comical farcical type of opera from which the genius of [[Mozart]] sprang. In many ways Sollers is doing the work of the opera bouffe or ''drama giocoso'' in his novels since ''Women'' (1983). Since ''Lois'', the writing is musical: the references to the music in these books are innumerable. In ''Women'': \"Whoever understands nothing about music, understands nothing about metaphysics.\"<ref>Philippe Sollers, ''Women'', translated by Barbara Bray, Columbia, 1990 {{ISBN|9780704327917}}</ref>\n\nThe focus on the spoken language also draws Sollers toward [[James Joyce]].  Sollers is so fascinated by Joyce's style that he and Stephen Heath collaborated to translate Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' into French. In January 1975, Sollers gave a lecture to an international symposium on Joyce, claiming ''Finnegans Wake'' as \"the most formidable anti-fascist book produced between the two wars\".<ref>''The Reception of James Joyce in Europe'', A&C Black, 2009 ({{ISBN|9781847146014}})</ref> However, Joyce is much more than poetry for Sollers. Since both were educated by [[Jesuits]], Joyce and Sollers have strong ties to [[Catholicism]]. As Sollers indicated in ''Paradis'', Joycean Christianity, like Sollers' Catholicism, involves both the comic and the pathetic.\n\nThe novel ''Paradis'' has a particular flavour because the narrator is similar to a troubadour singing the story of postmodern times. The self seems to disappear as word games, puns, neologisms and misspellings create a text that is hallucinatory and humorous in its juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous words and phrases. There are constant references to orchestras and symphonies, thus suggesting that there is an innate structure to what appears at first glance to be a chaotic text. The text's life is much like the sexuality of the writer. There is a rhythm, very much like radar or sonar, according to which the text responds to its need to enjoy itself and also to reproduce itself. The physical drives and desires of the human body lead it toward variations of paradise.\n\nHis novels ''Femmes'' (1983) and ''Portrait de joueur'' (1984) have achieved a certain popularity. The first was translated into English as ''Women'' by Barbara Bray and published by Columbia University Press (1990). [[Philip Roth]]'s comment on the cover of ''Women'' says that Sollers is a \"master of good-natured malice, a kind of happy, lively, benign [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]].\"<ref>Philip Roth, \"Anybody out for a good time should read Philippe Sollers\", in Comments on ''Women'', Columbia University Press, 1990 ({{ISBN|0704327910}})</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons for the popularity of these books by Sollers is the sense of humour he exhibits with his narrative voice about the culture in which the voice thrives.\n\nIn his writing, Sollers has a place of predilection, a place that unites together the whole of his personal pantheon: [[Venice]]; [[Lorenzo Da Ponte|Da Ponte]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Tiziano]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Monteverdi]] and then [[Casanova]] \"the man whose name is synonymous with Venice\",<ref>Philippe Sollers, \"Casanova l'admirable\", Gallimard, 2000 ({{ISBN|9782070408917}})</ref> [[Vivant Denon]] and the [[Countess Albrizzi]]. In intimate experiences, expression, erudition, Sollers reveals the splendours of the Serenissima in a very personal ''Dictionnaire amoureux de Venise'' (2004).\n\nIn 2000 Sollers published ''[[Passion fixe]]'', a love story both immoral and moral.\n\nIn 2006 he published ''Une vie divine''. The narrator, a professor of philosophy, is entrusted with the task of discovering a world philosophy that would not exclude the religious dimension of humanity. Through his research and discussions with the two women in his life (one intellectual and the other frivolous) he discovers that only one thinker is strong enough to found a project of world philosophy: [[Nietzsche]]. In this novel, Philippe Sollers rises against contemporary nihilism \u2013 literature which he sees as locked into misfortune and melancholy \u2013 with which he contrasts promises of life and happiness. A political and philosophical novel, ''Une vie divine'' is both serious and humorous writing about the possibility of happiness, Nietzsche versus [[Schopenhauer]]. Its praises of joy alternate with sadness and ambient defeatism.\n\nIn 2016, Sollers published the novel ''Mouvement'' centring on [[Hegel]]'s philosophy and biography, with a radical rethinking of time and history.\n\nSollers also sees himself and his novels in an 18th-century lineage with philosophers of the [[French Enlightenment|French Enlightnement]] such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], and therefore does not break with all tradition.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Essays===\n* \"Complots \u2013 Gallimard, 2016\n* \"Portraits de femmes\" \u2013 Flammarion, 2013\n* \"Fugues\" \u2013

French writer and critic. In 1960 he founded the ''avant garde'' literary journal ''[[Tel Quel]]'' (along with writer and art critic [[Marcelin Pleynet]]), which was published by Le Seuil and ran until 1982. Sollers then created the journal ''[[L'Infini]]'', published first by [[Denoel]], then by [[Gallimard]] with Sollers remaining as sole editor.\n\nSollers was at the heart of the period of intellectual unrest in the Paris of the 1960s and 1970s. He contributed to the publication of critics and thinkers such [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Roland Barthes]]. Some of them were later described in his novel, ''[[Femmes]]'' (1983) alongside other figures of French intellectualism active before and after [[May 1968 French civil unrest|May 1968]].\n\nHis writings and approach to language were examined and praised by French critic [[Roland Barthes]] in his book ''[[Writer Sollers]]''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Writer_Sollers.html?id=7-5cAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Writer Sollers|last=Barthes|first=Roland|date=1987|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780485113372|language=en}}</ref>.\n\nSollers married [[Julia Kristeva]] in 1967.\n\n==Biography==\nSollers was born as Philippe Joyaux In [[Talence]], where his family ran the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Joyaux Fr\u00e8res'', the iron factory ''Recalt'' producing material for kitchens, metal constructions and machines for the [[SNCASO]] under the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II]]<ref>[http://www.actuacity.com/talence_33400/monuments/page2 Usine de ferblanterie Recalt ; usine de chaudronnerie Boyer S.A.], Actuacity</ref>. His parents were Octave Joyaux and Marcelle Molini\u00e9. He moved to Paris in 1955, studied at the [[Lyc\u00e9e priv\u00e9 Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]] of [[Versailles]] and at the [[ESSEC Business School]]<ref>Anna Topaloff, \" ESSEC, la business school qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 tout \", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', juillet 2015, pages 54\u201358.</ref>.\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Philippe Sollers 1992.jpg|thumb|Philippe Sollers 1992]]\nFollowing his first novel ''A Strange Solitude'' (1958), hailed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]] and [[Louis Aragon]], Sollers began, with ''The Park'' (1961) the experiments in narrative form that would lead to ''Event'' (''Drame'', 1965) and ''Nombres'' (1968). [[Jacques Derrida]] analyzed these novels in his book ''Dissemination''. Sollers then attempted to counter the high seriousness of ''Nombres'' in ''Lois'' (1972), which featured greater linguistic vitality through the use of wordplay and a less formal style. The direction taken by ''Lois'' was developed through the heightened rhythmic intensity of non-punctuated texts such as ''Paradis'' (1981).\n[[File:Philippe Sollers \u00e0 Bordeaux dans le parc de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 familiale en 1937 avec sa m\u00e8re et sa soeur Annie.jpg|thumb|left|Philippe Sollers in Bordeaux in the homestead park in 1937 with his mother and his sister Annie.]]\nSollers's other novels include ''Women'' (1983), ''Portrait du joueur'' (1984), ''Le coeur absolu'' (1986), ''Watteau in Venice'' (1991), ''Studio'' (1997), ''Passion fixe'' (2000), ''L'\u00e9toile des amants'' (2002), which have all introduced a degree of realism to his fiction to the extent that they make more recognizable use of plot, character and thematic development. They offer the reader a clear fictional study of the society in which he or she lives by reinterpreting, among other things, the role of politics, media, sex, religion, and the arts.\n\nIn all these novels Sollers's interest in Chinese civilization plays an important part. From the late 1960s on, he studied Chinese and employed ideograms increasingly in his writings. He especially exemplifies this view in the subtitle of ''Lois'', a Chinese ideogram representing both \"France\" and \"Law.\"\n\nHis writings bear a particular focus on musicality. Vocalisation, or his preference for the spoken word, is seen a priority for Sollers. The combination of music, voice and theatre is especially found in opera. The kind of opera associated with Sollers should properly be called opera bouffe because of its sense of humour and love of irony: opera bouffe is a comical farcical type of opera from which the genius of [[Mozart]] sprang. In many ways Sollers is doing the work of the opera bouffe or ''drama giocoso'' in his novels since ''Women'' (1983). Since ''Lois'', the writing is musical: the references to the music in these books are innumerable. In ''Women'': \"Whoever understands nothing about music, understands nothing about metaphysics.\"<ref>Philippe Sollers, ''Women'', translated by Barbara Bray, Columbia, 1990 {{ISBN|9780704327917}}</ref>\n\nThe focus on the spoken language also draws Sollers toward [[James Joyce]].  Sollers is so fascinated by Joyce's style that he and Stephen Heath collaborated to translate Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' into French. In January 1975, Sollers gave a lecture to an international symposium on Joyce, claiming ''Finnegans Wake'' as \"the most formidable anti-fascist book produced between the two wars\".<ref>''The Reception of James Joyce in Europe'', A&C Black, 2009 ({{ISBN|9781847146014}})</ref> However, Joyce is much more than poetry for Sollers. Since both were educated by [[Jesuits]], Joyce and Sollers have strong ties to [[Catholicism]]. As Sollers indicated in ''Paradis'', Joycean Christianity, like Sollers' Catholicism, involves both the comic and the pathetic.\n\nThe novel ''Paradis'' has a particular flavour because the narrator is similar to a troubadour singing the story of postmodern times. The self seems to disappear as word games, puns, neologisms and misspellings create a text that is hallucinatory and humorous in its juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous words and phrases. There are constant references to orchestras and symphonies, thus suggesting that there is an innate structure to what appears at first glance to be a chaotic text. The text's life is much like the sexuality of the writer. There is a rhythm, very much like radar or sonar, according to which the text responds to its need to enjoy itself and also to reproduce itself. The physical drives and desires of the human body lead it toward variations of paradise.\n\nHis novels ''Femmes'' (1983) and ''Portrait de joueur'' (1984) have achieved a certain popularity. The first was translated into English as ''Women'' by Barbara Bray and published by Columbia University Press (1990). [[Philip Roth]]'s comment on the cover of ''Women'' says that Sollers is a \"master of good-natured malice, a kind of happy, lively, benign [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]].\"<ref>Philip Roth, \"Anybody out for a good time should read Philippe Sollers\", in Comments on ''Women'', Columbia University Press, 1990 ({{ISBN|0704327910}})</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons for the popularity of these books by Sollers is the sense of humour he exhibits with his narrative voice about the culture in which the voice thrives.\n\nIn his writing, Sollers has a place of predilection, a place that unites together the whole of his personal pantheon: [[Venice]]; [[Lorenzo Da Ponte|Da Ponte]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Tiziano]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Monteverdi]] and then [[Casanova]] \"the man whose name is synonymous with Venice\",<ref>Philippe Sollers, \"Casanova l'admirable\", Gallimard, 2000 ({{ISBN|9782070408917}})</ref> [[Vivant Denon]] and the [[Countess Albrizzi]]. In intimate experiences, expression, erudition, Sollers reveals the splendours of the Serenissima in a very personal ''Dictionnaire amoureux de Venise'' (2004).\n\nIn 2000 Sollers published ''[[Passion fixe]]'', a love story both immoral and moral.\n\nIn 2006 he published ''Une vie divine''. The narrator, a professor of philosophy, is entrusted with the task of discovering a world philosophy that would not exclude the religious dimension of humanity. Through his research and discussions with the two women in his life (one intellectual and the other frivolous) he discovers that only one thinker is strong enough to found a project of world philosophy: [[Nietzsche]]. In this novel, Philippe Sollers rises against contemporary nihilism \u2013 literature which he sees as locked into misfortune and melancholy \u2013 with which he contrasts promises of life and happiness. A political and philosophical novel, ''Une vie divine'' is both serious and humorous writing about the possibility of happiness, Nietzsche versus [[Schopenhauer]]. Its praises of joy alternate with sadness and ambient defeatism.\n\nIn 2016, Sollers published the novel ''Mouvement'' centring on [[Hegel]]'s philosophy and biography, with a radical rethinking of time and history.\n\nSollers also sees himself and his novels in an 18th-century lineage with philosophers of the [[French Enlightenment|French Enlightnement]] such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], and therefore does not break with all tradition.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Essays===\n* \"Complots \u2013 Gallimard, 2016\n* \"Portraits de femmes\" \u2013 Flammarion, 2013\n* \"Fugues\" \u2013
