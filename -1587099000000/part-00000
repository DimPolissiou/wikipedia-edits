Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American History was the [[Black Friday (1869)|Panic of 1869]], which occurred when financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] took advantage of their connections with the [[Ulysses S. Grant#Gold standard and the Gold Ring|Grant Administration]] in an attempt [[Cornering the market|to corner]] the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by eighteen percent. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, [[Abel Corbin]], was ruined.\n\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, ''[[Engineering Magazine|Factory Management and Maintenance]]'', for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days, \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday\"; but these terms were quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"linguistlist239\" /><ref name=\"snopes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/thanksgiving/blackfriday.asp |title=snopes.com: How Did 'Black Friday' Get Its Name? |work= Urban Legends Reference Pages |publisher= Snopes.com |access-date=November 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2014-November/135115.html |title= Around and About |work= The Shortsville-Manchester Enterprise |date= December 1, 1961 |page= 4}}</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.<ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\">{{cite web |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |first= Jennifer |last= Lin |title= Why the Name Black Friday?

Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be \"in the red\", instead taking in the year's profits.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://bfads.net/Black-Friday-FAQ |title= Black Friday FAQ |work= BFAds.net}}</ref> The earliest known published reference to this explanation occurs in ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' for November 28, 1981.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |title= Shoppers Flood Stores for 'Black Friday' |work= The Philadelphia Inquirer |date= November 28, 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an internet rumor alleged that the phrase originated in the American south before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], from the practice of selling [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] on the day after Thanksgiving. This was debunked by [[Snopes.com]] in 2015.<ref name=\"snopes\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season may be linked together with the idea of [[Santa Claus parades]]. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major holiday following Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving Day parades were sponsored by department stores. These included the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]], in Canada, sponsored by [[Eaton's]], and the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] sponsored by [[Macy's]]. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it just became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\n\nThanksgiving Day's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President [[Franklin D.

Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8:00 or 9:00&nbsp;p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\".

As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of doorbuster/doorcrasher/doorsmasher items to entice traffic. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. Such hours may include opening as early as 12:00&nbsp;a.m. or remaining open overnight on Thanksgiving Day and beginning sale prices at midnight. In 2010, [[Toys 'R' Us]] began their Black Friday sales at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of [[Crayola]] crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like [[Sears]], Express, MK, [[Victoria's Secret]], [[Zumiez]], [[Tillys]], [[American Eagle Outfitters]], Nike, Jordan, Puma, [[A\u00e9ropostale (clothing)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and [[Kmart]], began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Friday evening.

The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[OfficeMax]], [[Big Lots]], and [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]]) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are [[trade secret]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title= Sale fight no fright for area Web site |work= Charleston Gazette & Daily Mail |date= November 26, 2002|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040308/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2017|via=HighBeam Research|author=Martyn Chase}}</ref>\n\nSome of these retailers have used the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take-down system]] of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as a means to remove the offending price listings. This policy may come from the fear that competitors will slash prices, and shoppers may comparison shop. The actual validity of the claim that prices form a protected work of authorship is uncertain as the prices themselves (though not the advertisements) might be considered a fact in which case they would not receive the same level of protection as a copyrighted work.<ref>''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 340 (1991).</ref>{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An [[Internet service provider]] in 2003 brought suit against [[Best Buy]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Target Corporation]], arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue the retailers.<ref>''Fatwallet, Inc. v. Best Buy Enterprises Services'', 2004 WL 793548 (N.D.Ill. 2004).</ref>\n\nUsage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S., influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.<ref name=\"Statscan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/01207/10464-eng.htm|title=Canadian Economic Observer |publisher= Stats Canada |access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult.

Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for [[state government]] employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday, such as [[Columbus Day]]. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off, which, along with the following regular weekend, makes it a four-day weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers.\n\nBlack Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the [[United States]] since 2005,<ref name=\"holiday.icsc.org\">{{cite web |url=http://holiday.icsc.org/2006/hw06_fullguide.pdf |title=Holiday Watch: Media Guide 2006 Holiday Facts and Figure |author=International Council of Shopping Centers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}; ShopperTrak, Press Release,{{cite web |url=http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |title=ShopperTrak Reports Positive Response to Early Holiday Promotions Boosts Projections for 2010 Holiday Season |accessdate=2012-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy }} (November 16, 2010).</ref> although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate,<ref name=\"International Council of Shopping Centers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|title=Daily Sales Comparison Top Ten Holiday Shopping Days (1996\u20132001)|author=International Council of Shopping Centers|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114831/http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time.<ref name=\"Albert R.

Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American History was the [[Black Friday (1869)|Panic of 1869]], which occurred when financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] took advantage of their connections with the [[Ulysses S. Grant#Gold standard and the Gold Ring|Grant Administration]] in an attempt [[Cornering the market|to corner]] the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by eighteen percent. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, [[Abel Corbin]], was ruined.\n\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, ''[[Engineering Magazine|Factory Management and Maintenance]]'', for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days, \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday\"; but these terms were quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"linguistlist239\" /><ref name=\"snopes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/thanksgiving/blackfriday.asp |title=snopes.com: How Did 'Black Friday' Get Its Name? |work= Urban Legends Reference Pages |publisher= Snopes.com |access-date=November 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2014-November/135115.html |title= Around and About |work= The Shortsville-Manchester Enterprise |date= December 1, 1961 |page= 4}}</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.<ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\">{{cite web |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |first= Jennifer |last= Lin |title= Why the Name Black Friday?

Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be \"in the red\", instead taking in the year's profits.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://bfads.net/Black-Friday-FAQ |title= Black Friday FAQ |work= BFAds.net}}</ref> The earliest known published reference to this explanation occurs in ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' for November 28, 1981.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |title= Shoppers Flood Stores for 'Black Friday' |work= The Philadelphia Inquirer |date= November 28, 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an internet rumor alleged that the phrase originated in the American south before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], from the practice of selling [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] on the day after Thanksgiving. This was debunked by [[Snopes.com]] in 2015.<ref name=\"snopes\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season may be linked together with the idea of [[Santa Claus parades]]. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major holiday following Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving Day parades were sponsored by department stores. These included the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]], in Canada, sponsored by [[Eaton's]], and the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] sponsored by [[Macy's]]. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it just became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\n\nThanksgiving Day's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.<ref name=congressthanks>{{cite web|title=Congress Establishes Thanksgiving|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving/|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving Day on the traditional date.<ref name=congressthanks /> Some started referring to the new date as [[Franksgiving]].\n\nIn 2015, [[Amazon.com]] held a \"Prime Day\" event in July and promised better deals than on Black Friday, with repeat Prime Days taking place in 2016 and 2017.

In 2009, Kmart opened at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on Thanksgiving, in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8:00 or 9:00&nbsp;p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\". In subsequent years, other stores have followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving Day, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/22/business/la-fi-black-thursday-20111122|title=Black Friday becoming Black Thursday as stores open on Thanksgiving |last=Li|first=Shan|date=November 21, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/business/make-room-for-deals-after-turkey-this-year.html|title=Make Room for Deals After Turkey This Year|last=Clifford|first=Stephanie|date=November 9, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> Some retail and media sources have used the terms \"Gray Thursday\" or \"Brown Thursday\" instead.<ref name=\"gray1\">{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Business/black-friday-shopping-kicks-off-thanksgiving-dinner/story?id=17784755 |title= Black Friday Shopping Kicks Off After Thanksgiving Dinner |first= Anthony |last= Castellano |date= November 22, 2012 |publisher= ABC News |access-date= November 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"gray2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html|title=How 'Black Friday' Morphed Into 'Gray Thursday'|last=Sreenivasan|first=Hari|date=November 22, 2012|access-date=November 23, 2012|work=PBS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123124251/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"brown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/11/22/thanksgiving-black-friday-brown-thursday-shopping-leno-stewart-kimmel-letterman/3674429/|title=Punchlines: The new Black Friday is Brown Thursday|date=November 22, 2013|access-date=November 27, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 \"Black Thursday\" sales were, in general, a failure, as overall sales for the holiday weekend fell 11% compared to the previous year despite heavy traffic at the stores on Thanksgiving night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/business/thanksgiving-weekend-sales-at-stores-and-online-slide-11-percent.html|last=Tabuchi|first=Tiroko|title=Black Friday Fatigue?

As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of doorbuster/doorcrasher/doorsmasher items to entice traffic. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. Such hours may include opening as early as 12:00&nbsp;a.m. or remaining open overnight on Thanksgiving Day and beginning sale prices at midnight. In 2010, [[Toys 'R' Us]] began their Black Friday sales at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of [[Crayola]] crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like [[Sears]], Express, MK, [[Victoria's Secret]], [[Zumiez]], [[Tillys]], [[American Eagle Outfitters]], Nike, Jordan, Puma, [[A\u00e9ropostale (clothing)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and [[Kmart]], began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Friday evening. [[Forever 21]] went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110815091655/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |url-status= dead |archive-date= August 15, 2011 |location= New York |work= Daily News |title= Black Friday Deals for Target, H&M, Forever21, Old Navy, Radio Shack, and More |first= David |last= Yi |date= November 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://financiallyfit.yahoo.com/finance/article-111402-7507-6-post-thanksgiving-shopping-starts-earlier?ywaad=ad0035&nc |title= Black Friday Moves to Thursday as Stores Woo Shoppers |work=Yahoo!

As opening time approached, the crowd grew anxious and when the doors were opened, the crowd pushed forward, breaking the door down, and a 34-year-old employee was trampled to death. The shoppers did not appear concerned with the victim's fate, expressing refusal to halt their stampede when other employees attempted to intervene and help the injured employee, complaining that they had been waiting in the cold and were not willing to wait any longer.

The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[OfficeMax]], [[Big Lots]], and [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]]) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are [[trade secret]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title= Sale fight no fright for area Web site |work= Charleston Gazette & Daily Mail |date= November 26, 2002|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040308/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2017|via=HighBeam Research|author=Martyn Chase}}</ref>\n\nSome of these retailers have used the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take-down system]] of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as a means to remove the offending price listings. This policy may come from the fear that competitors will slash prices, and shoppers may comparison shop. The actual validity of the claim that prices form a protected work of authorship is uncertain as the prices themselves (though not the advertisements) might be considered a fact in which case they would not receive the same level of protection as a copyrighted work.<ref>''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 340 (1991).</ref>{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An [[Internet service provider]] in 2003 brought suit against [[Best Buy]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Target Corporation]], arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue the retailers.<ref>''Fatwallet, Inc. v. Best Buy Enterprises Services'', 2004 WL 793548 (N.D.Ill. 2004).</ref>\n\nUsage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S., influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.<ref name=\"Statscan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/01207/10464-eng.htm|title=Canadian Economic Observer |publisher= Stats Canada |access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult.

The system is analogous to the [[pennant number]] system that the [[Royal Navy]] and other European and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies use.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\nThe U.S. Navy began to assign unique [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s to its ships in the 1890s. The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship's name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. Under this system, for example, the [[battleship]] [[USS Indiana (BB-1)|''Indiana'']] was USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1), the [[cruiser]] [[USS Olympia (C-6)|''Olympia'']] was USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6), and so on. Beginning in 1907, some ships also were referred to alternatively by single-letter or three-letter codes\u2014for example, USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1) could be referred to as USS ''Indiana'' (B-1) and USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6) could also be referred to as USS ''Olympia'' (C-6), while USS ''Pennsylvania'' (Armored Cruiser No. 4) could be referred to as USS ''Pennsylvania'' (ACR-4). However, rather than replacing it, these codes coexisted and were used interchangeably with the older system until the modern system was instituted on 17 July 1920.<ref name=DerDigiCru1/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the U.S. Navy acquired large numbers of privately owned and commercial ships and craft for use as [[patrol vessel]]s, [[Minelayer|mine warfare vessels]],  and various types of naval [[auxiliary ship]]s, some of them with identical names. To keep track of them all, the Navy assigned unique identifying numbers to them. Those deemed appropriate for patrol work received [[section patrol]] numbers (SP), while those intended for other purposes received \"identification numbers\", generally abbreviated \"Id. No.\" or \"ID;\" some ships and craft changed from an SP to an ID number or vice versa during their careers, without their unique numbers themselves changing, and some ships and craft assigned numbers in anticipation of naval service never were acquired by the Navy. The SP/ID numbering sequence was unified and continuous, with no SP number repeated in the ID series or vice versa so that there could not be, for example, both an \"SP-435\" and an \"Id. No 435\". The SP and ID numbers were used parenthetically after each boat's or ship's name to identify it; although this system pre-dated the modern hull classification system and its numbers were not referred to at the time as \"hull codes\" or \"hull numbers,\" it was used in a similar manner to today's system and can be considered its precursor.<ref>Naval History and heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images (archived from [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm the original] at https://web.archive.org/web/20100329212007/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm).</ref>\n\n=== United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Coast Guard ===\nThe [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] in January 1915 to form the modern [[United States Coast Guard]], began following the Navy's lead in the 1890s, with its [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] having parenthetical numbers called [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s following their names, such as (Cutter No. 1), etc.  This persisted until the Navy's modern hull classification system's introduction in 1920, which included Coast Guard ships and craft.\n\n=== United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ===\n\nLike the U.S. Navy, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] \u2013 a uniformed seagoing service of the [[United States Government]] and a predecessor of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) \u2013 adopted a hull number system for its fleet in the 20th century. Its largest vessels, \"Category I\" [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] [[survey ship]]s, were classified as \"ocean survey ships\" and given the designation \"OSS\". Intermediate-sized \"Category II\" oceanographic survey ships received the designation \"MSS\" for \"medium survey ship,\" and smaller \"Category III\" oceanographic survey ships were given the classification \"CSS\" for \"coastal survey ship.\" A fourth designation, \"ASV\" for \"auxiliary survey vessel,\" included even smaller vessels. In each case, a particular ship received a unique designation based on its classification and a unique hull number separated by a space rather than a hyphen; for example, the third Coast and Geodetic Survey ship named ''Pioneer'' was an ocean survey ship officially known as [[USC&GS Pioneer (OSS 31)|USC&GS ''Pioneer'' (OSS 31)]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYSPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA3612&lpg=PA3612&dq=Ocean+Survey+Ship+(OSS)+MSS+CSS&source=bl&ots=q0Iq2sEN7a&sig=HN4i6XsnjYb3s8LOLXrPMbSaIUg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3nBpU8XXFdHboASC64DoAg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ocean%20Survey%20Ship%20(OSS)%20MSS%20CSS&f=false United States Department of State, ''United States Treaties and Other International Obligations, Volume 23, Part Four'', Washington, D.C.:U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972, p. 3612.]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |title=United States Department of Commerce, ''Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1964'', U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.: 1964, pp. 3\u20135. |access-date=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219015620/http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Survey{{'}}s fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.\n\n== The modern hull classification system ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\n\nThe U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, \"identification numbers\", and the other numbering systems described above.  In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.\n\nThe combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser {{USS|Boston|CA-69}} was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships' symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.<ref>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Nomenclature history'')</ref>\n\nHull numbers are assigned by classification. Duplication between, but not within, classifications is permitted. Hence, CV-1 was the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} and BB-1 was the battleship {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|6}}.\n\nShip types and classifications have come and gone over the years, and many of the symbols listed below are not presently in use. The [[Naval Vessel Register]] maintains an online database of U.S. Navy ships showing which symbols are presently in use.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] until 1975, the U.S. Navy defined a \"[[frigate]]\" as a type of surface warship larger than a [[destroyer]] and smaller than a cruiser.  In other navies, such a ship generally was referred to as a \"[[flotilla leader]]\", or \"destroyer leader\".  Hence the U.S. Navy's use of \"DL\" for \"frigate\" prior to 1975, while \"frigates\" in other navies were smaller than destroyers and more like what the U.S. Navy termed a \"[[destroyer escort]]\", \"[[ocean escort]]\", or \"DE\".  The [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification]] of [[cruiser]]s, frigates, and ocean escorts brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with other nations' classifications, at least cosmetically in terms of terminology, and eliminated the perceived [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification#The \"cruiser gap\"|\"cruiser gap\"]] with the [[Soviet Navy]] by redesignating the former \"frigates\" as \"cruisers\".\n\n==== Military Sealift Command ====\nIf a U.S. Navy ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"T-\", it is part of the [[Military Sealift Command]], has a primarily civilian crew, and is a [[United States Naval Ship]] (USNS) in non-commissioned service \u2013 as opposed to a [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] [[United States Ship]] (USS) with an all-military crew.\n\n=== United States Coast Guard ===\nIf a ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"W\", it is a commissioned [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]] of the [[United States Coast Guard]].  Until 1965, the Coast Guard used U.S. Navy hull classification codes, prepending a \"W\" to their beginning.  In 1965, it retired some of the less mission-appropriate Navy-based classifications and developed new ones of its own, most notably WHEC for \"[[high endurance cutter]]\" and WMEC for \"[[medium endurance cutter]]\".\n\n=== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ===\nThe [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), a component of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], includes the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]] (or \"NOAA Corps\"), one of the eight [[uniformed services of the United States]], and operates a fleet of seagoing research and survey ships. The [[NOAA ships and aircraft|NOAA fleet]] also uses a hull classification symbol system, which it also calls \"hull numbers,\" for its ships.\n\nAfter NOAA took over the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet in 1970 along with research vessels of other government agencies, it adopted a new system of ship classification. In its system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories, [[research ship]]s and [[survey ship]]s.  The research ships, which include [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Fishery|fisheries]] research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with \"R\", while the survey ships, generally [[hydrography|hydrographic]] survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with \"S\". The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA \"class\" (i.e., size) of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ship's [[gross ton]]nage and [[horsepower]], while the next two digits combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.\n\nGenerally, each NOAA hull number is written with a space between the letter and the three-digit number, as in, for example, {{ship|NOAAS|Nancy Foster|R 352}} or {{ship|NOAAS|Thomas Jefferson|S 222}}.<ref>Wertheim, ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, 15th Edition: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems'', p. 1005.</ref>\n\nUnlike the Navy, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, \"S 222\" was assigned to {{ship|NOAAS|Mount Mitchell|S 222}}, then assigned to NOAAS ''Thomas Jefferson'' (S 222), which entered NOAA service after ''Mount Mitchell'' was stricken.\n\n== United States Navy hull classification codes ==\n\nThe U.S. Navy's system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Though considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows (and frequently the sterns) of most U.S. Navy ships.\n\nThe ship designator and hull number system's roots extend back to the late 1880s, when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging \"Steel Navy\". During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navy's clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the \"Jeffersonian Gunboats\" of the early 1800s and the \"Tinclad\" river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.\n\nIt is important to understand that hull number letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, \"DD\" does not stand for anything more than \"Destroyer\". \"SS\" simply means \"Submarine\". And \"FF\" is the post-1975 type code for \"Frigate.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Navy Ships \u2013 Listed by Hull Number|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/usnsh-no.htm|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref>\n\nThe hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8B [http://www.nvr.navy.mil/5030.8B.pdf (SECNAVINST 5030.8B).]\n\n=== Warships ===\nWarships are designed to participate in combat operations.\n\nThe origin of the two-letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes.<ref name=DerDigiCru1>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Cruisers'')</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Battleship\n| Heavy gun-armed vessel\n!

The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers.  Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships, less so.  Before 1920, ships were called \"<type> no. X\", with the type fully pronounced.  The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to \"B-X\", \"C-X\", \"D-X\" et cetera\u2014for example, before 1920, {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22}} would have been called \"USS ''Minnesota'', Battleship number&nbsp;22\" orally and \"USS ''Minnesota'', B-22\" in writing.

Such designations usually occur during periods of sudden mobilization, such as that which occurred prior to, and during, [[World War II]] or the [[Korean War]], when it was determined that a sudden temporary need arose for a ship for which there was no official Navy designation.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], for example, a number of commercial vessels were requisitioned, or acquired, by the U.S. Navy to meet the sudden requirements of war. A [[yacht]] acquired by the U.S. Navy during the start of World War II might seem desirable to the Navy whose use for the vessel might not be fully developed or explored at the time of acquisition.\n\nOn the other hand, a U.S. Navy vessel, such as the yacht in the example above, already in commission or service, might be desired, or found useful, for another need or purpose for which there is no official designation.\n* IX: Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary Ship, for example yacht ''Chanco'' acquired by the U.S. Navy on 1 October 1940. It was classified as a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{USS|Kestrel|AMc-5|1}}, but instead, mainly used as a [[patrol craft]] along the [[New England]] coast. When another assignment came, and it could not be determined how to classify the vessel, it was redesignated IX-175 on 10 July 1944.\n* IXSS: Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarines, such as the {{USS|Cod|IXSS-224}}, the {{USS|Angler|IXSS-240}} and the {{USS|Croaker|IXSS-246}}.\n* YAG: Miscellaneous Auxiliary Service Craft, such as the {{USS|George Eastman|YAG-39}}, {{USS|Butternut|YAG-60}} and {{USS|Christiana|YAG-32}} which, curiously, was earlier known as {{USS|Christiana|IX-80|1}}.\n\nNumerous other U.S. Navy vessels were launched with a temporary, or nominal, designation, such as YMS or PC, since it could not be determined, at time of construction, for what they should be used. Many of these were vessels in the 150 to 200 feet length class with powerful engines, whose function could be that of a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], [[patrol craft]], [[submarine chaser]], [[seaplane tender]], [[tugboat]], or other. Once their destiny, or capability, was found or determined, such vessels were reclassified with their actual designation.\n\n== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hull codes ==\n* R: Research ships, including oceanographic and fisheries research ships\n* S: Survey ships, including hydrographic survey ships\n\nThe letter is paired with a three-digit number. The first digit of the number is determined by the ship{{'}}s \"power tonnage,\" defined as the sum of its [[shaft horsepower]] and [[gross tonnage|gross international tonnage]], as follows:\n* If the power tonnage is 5,501 through 9,000, the first digit is \"1\".\n* If the power tonnage 3,501 through 5,500, the first digit is \"2.\"\n* If the power tonnage is 2,001 through 3,500, the first digit is \"3.\"\n* If the power tonnage is 1,001 through 2,000, the first digit is \"4.\"\n* If the power tonnage is 501 through 1,000, the first digit is \"5.\"\n* If the power tonnage is 500 or less and the ship is at least 65 feet (19.8 meters) long, the first digit is \"6.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporateservices.noaa.gov/ames/administrative_orders/chapter_217/217-108.html|title=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Home Page|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO).

The system is analogous to the [[pennant number]] system that the [[Royal Navy]] and other European and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies use.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\nThe U.S. Navy began to assign unique [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s to its ships in the 1890s. The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship's name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. Under this system, for example, the [[battleship]] [[USS Indiana (BB-1)|''Indiana'']] was USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1), the [[cruiser]] [[USS Olympia (C-6)|''Olympia'']] was USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6), and so on. Beginning in 1907, some ships also were referred to alternatively by single-letter or three-letter codes\u2014for example, USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1) could be referred to as USS ''Indiana'' (B-1) and USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6) could also be referred to as USS ''Olympia'' (C-6), while USS ''Pennsylvania'' (Armored Cruiser No. 4) could be referred to as USS ''Pennsylvania'' (ACR-4). However, rather than replacing it, these codes coexisted and were used interchangeably with the older system until the modern system was instituted on 17 July 1920.<ref name=DerDigiCru1/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the U.S. Navy acquired large numbers of privately owned and commercial ships and craft for use as [[patrol vessel]]s, [[Minelayer|mine warfare vessels]],  and various types of naval [[auxiliary ship]]s, some of them with identical names. To keep track of them all, the Navy assigned unique identifying numbers to them. Those deemed appropriate for patrol work received [[section patrol]] numbers (SP), while those intended for other purposes received \"identification numbers\", generally abbreviated \"Id. No.\" or \"ID;\" some ships and craft changed from an SP to an ID number or vice versa during their careers, without their unique numbers themselves changing, and some ships and craft assigned numbers in anticipation of naval service never were acquired by the Navy. The SP/ID numbering sequence was unified and continuous, with no SP number repeated in the ID series or vice versa so that there could not be, for example, both an \"SP-435\" and an \"Id. No 435\". The SP and ID numbers were used parenthetically after each boat's or ship's name to identify it; although this system pre-dated the modern hull classification system and its numbers were not referred to at the time as \"hull codes\" or \"hull numbers,\" it was used in a similar manner to today's system and can be considered its precursor.<ref>Naval History and heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images (archived from [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm the original] at https://web.archive.org/web/20100329212007/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm).</ref>\n\n=== United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Coast Guard ===\nThe [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] in January 1915 to form the modern [[United States Coast Guard]], began following the Navy's lead in the 1890s, with its [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] having parenthetical numbers called [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s following their names, such as (Cutter No. 1), etc.  This persisted until the Navy's modern hull classification system's introduction in 1920, which included Coast Guard ships and craft.\n\n=== United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ===\n\nLike the U.S. Navy, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] \u2013 a uniformed seagoing service of the [[United States Government]] and a predecessor of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) \u2013 adopted a hull number system for its fleet in the 20th century. Its largest vessels, \"Category I\" [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] [[survey ship]]s, were classified as \"ocean survey ships\" and given the designation \"OSS\". Intermediate-sized \"Category II\" oceanographic survey ships received the designation \"MSS\" for \"medium survey ship,\" and smaller \"Category III\" oceanographic survey ships were given the classification \"CSS\" for \"coastal survey ship.\" A fourth designation, \"ASV\" for \"auxiliary survey vessel,\" included even smaller vessels. In each case, a particular ship received a unique designation based on its classification and a unique hull number separated by a space rather than a hyphen; for example, the third Coast and Geodetic Survey ship named ''Pioneer'' was an ocean survey ship officially known as [[USC&GS Pioneer (OSS 31)|USC&GS ''Pioneer'' (OSS 31)]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYSPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA3612&lpg=PA3612&dq=Ocean+Survey+Ship+(OSS)+MSS+CSS&source=bl&ots=q0Iq2sEN7a&sig=HN4i6XsnjYb3s8LOLXrPMbSaIUg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3nBpU8XXFdHboASC64DoAg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ocean%20Survey%20Ship%20(OSS)%20MSS%20CSS&f=false United States Department of State, ''United States Treaties and Other International Obligations, Volume 23, Part Four'', Washington, D.C.:U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972, p. 3612.]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |title=United States Department of Commerce, ''Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1964'', U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.: 1964, pp. 3\u20135. |access-date=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219015620/http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Survey{{'}}s fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.\n\n== The modern hull classification system ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\n\nThe U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, \"identification numbers\", and the other numbering systems described above.  In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.\n\nThe combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser {{USS|Boston|CA-69}} was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships' symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.<ref>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Nomenclature history'')</ref>\n\nHull numbers are assigned by classification. Duplication between, but not within, classifications is permitted. Hence, CV-1 was the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} and BB-1 was the battleship {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|6}}.\n\nShip types and classifications have come and gone over the years, and many of the symbols listed below are not presently in use. The [[Naval Vessel Register]] maintains an online database of U.S. Navy ships showing which symbols are presently in use.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] until 1975, the U.S. Navy defined a \"[[frigate]]\" as a type of surface warship larger than a [[destroyer]] and smaller than a cruiser.  In other navies, such a ship generally was referred to as a \"[[flotilla leader]]\", or \"destroyer leader\".  Hence the U.S. Navy's use of \"DL\" for \"frigate\" prior to 1975, while \"frigates\" in other navies were smaller than destroyers and more like what the U.S. Navy termed a \"[[destroyer escort]]\", \"[[ocean escort]]\", or \"DE\".  The [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification]] of [[cruiser]]s, frigates, and ocean escorts brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with other nations' classifications, at least cosmetically in terms of terminology, and eliminated the perceived [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification#The \"cruiser gap\"|\"cruiser gap\"]] with the [[Soviet Navy]] by redesignating the former \"frigates\" as \"cruisers\".\n\n==== Military Sealift Command ====\nIf a U.S. Navy ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"T-\", it is part of the [[Military Sealift Command]], has a primarily civilian crew, and is a [[United States Naval Ship]] (USNS) in non-commissioned service \u2013 as opposed to a [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] [[United States Ship]] (USS) with an all-military crew.\n\n=== United States Coast Guard ===\nIf a ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"W\", it is a commissioned [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]] of the [[United States Coast Guard]].  Until 1965, the Coast Guard used U.S. Navy hull classification codes, prepending a \"W\" to their beginning.  In 1965, it retired some of the less mission-appropriate Navy-based classifications and developed new ones of its own, most notably WHEC for \"[[high endurance cutter]]\" and WMEC for \"[[medium endurance cutter]]\".\n\n=== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ===\nThe [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), a component of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], includes the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]] (or \"NOAA Corps\"), one of the eight [[uniformed services of the United States]], and operates a fleet of seagoing research and survey ships. The [[NOAA ships and aircraft|NOAA fleet]] also uses a hull classification symbol system, which it also calls \"hull numbers,\" for its ships.\n\nAfter NOAA took over the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet in 1970 along with research vessels of other government agencies, it adopted a new system of ship classification. In its system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories, [[research ship]]s and [[survey ship]]s.  The research ships, which include [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Fishery|fisheries]] research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with \"R\", while the survey ships, generally [[hydrography|hydrographic]] survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with \"S\". The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA \"class\" (i.e., size) of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ship's [[gross ton]]nage and [[horsepower]], while the next two digits combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.\n\nGenerally, each NOAA hull number is written with a space between the letter and the three-digit number, as in, for example, {{ship|NOAAS|Nancy Foster|R 352}} or {{ship|NOAAS|Thomas Jefferson|S 222}}.<ref>Wertheim, ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, 15th Edition: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems'', p. 1005.</ref>\n\nUnlike the Navy, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, \"S 222\" was assigned to {{ship|NOAAS|Mount Mitchell|S 222}}, then assigned to NOAAS ''Thomas Jefferson'' (S 222), which entered NOAA service after ''Mount Mitchell'' was stricken.\n\n== United States Navy hull classification codes ==\n\nThe U.S. Navy's system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Though considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows (and frequently the sterns) of most U.S. Navy ships.\n\nThe ship designator and hull number system's roots extend back to the late 1880s, when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging \"Steel Navy\". During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navy's clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the \"Jeffersonian Gunboats\" of the early 1800s and the \"Tinclad\" river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.\n\nIt is important to understand that hull number letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, \"DD\" does not stand for anything more than \"Destroyer\". \"SS\" simply means \"Submarine\". And \"FF\" is the post-1975 type code for \"Frigate.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Navy Ships \u2013 Listed by Hull Number|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/usnsh-no.htm|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref>\n\nThe hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8B [http://www.nvr.navy.mil/5030.8B.pdf (SECNAVINST 5030.8B).]\n\n=== Warships ===\nWarships are designed to participate in combat operations.\n\nThe origin of the two-letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes.<ref name=DerDigiCru1>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Cruisers'')</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Battleship\n| Heavy gun-armed vessel\n!

Contrary to popular belief, the \"CV\" hull classification symbol does not stand for \"carrier vessel\". \"CV\" derives from the cruiser designation, with the v for French ''voler'', \"to fly\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/voler|title=English Translation of \u201cvoler\u201d {{!}} Collins French-English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: the first sequence runs from CV-1 USS ''[[USS Langley (CV-1)|Langley]]'' to the very latest ships, and the second sequence, \"CVE\" for escort carriers, ran from CVE-1 [[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|''Long Island'']] to CVE-127 [[USS Okinawa (CVE-127)|''Okinawa'']] before being discontinued.\n* AV: [[Seaplane tender]] (retired)\n* AVG: [[Auxiliary aircraft ferry]] ([[escort carrier]]) (1941\u201342)\n* AVD: [[Seaplane tender destroyer]] (retired)\n* AVP: [[Seaplane tender]], Small (retired)\n* AVT (i) Auxiliary aircraft transport (retired)\n* AVT (ii) Auxiliary training carrier (retired)\n* ACV: [[Auxiliary aircraft carrier]] (escort carrier) (1942)\n* CV: [[Fleet aircraft carrier]] (1921\u20131975), multi-purpose [[aircraft carrier]] (1975\u2013present)\n* CVA: Aircraft carrier, attack (category merged into CV, 30 June 1975)\n* CV(N): Aircraft carrier, night (deck equipped with lighting and pilots trained and for nighttime fights) (1944) (retired)\n* CVAN: Aircraft carrier, attack, nuclear-powered (category merged into CVN, 30 June 1975)\n* CVB: Aircraft carrier, large (original USS ''Midway'' class, category merged into CVA, 1952)\n* CVE: [[Escort aircraft carrier]] (retired) (1943\u2013retirement of type)\n* CVHA: Aircraft carrier, helicopter assault (retired in favor of several LH-series [[amphibious assault ship]] hull codes)\n* CVHE: Aircraft carrier, helicopter, escort (retired)\n* CVL: [[Light aircraft carrier]] or aircraft carrier, small (retired) <ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1940/pdf/1aug43.pdf Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department.\"New Carrier Designations\".

The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers.  Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships, less so.  Before 1920, ships were called \"<type> no. X\", with the type fully pronounced.  The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to \"B-X\", \"C-X\", \"D-X\" et cetera\u2014for example, before 1920, {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22}} would have been called \"USS ''Minnesota'', Battleship number&nbsp;22\" orally and \"USS ''Minnesota'', B-22\" in writing.  After 1920, the ship's name would have been both written and pronounced \"USS ''Minnesota'' (BB-22)\".

SSK, retired by the USN, continues to be used colloquially and interchangeably with SS for diesel-electric attack/patrol submarines within the USN, and, more formally, by the Royal Navy and British firms such as [[Jane's Information Group]].\n* SC: Cruiser Submarine (retired)\n* SF: Fleet [[Submarine]] (retired)\n* SM: Submarine Minelayer (retired)\n* SS: Submarine, [[Attack Submarine]]<ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/CLASS.HTM U.S. Navy Ship And Service Craft Classifications<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016023831/http://www.nvr.navy.mil/class.htm |date=16 October 2004 }}</ref>\n* SSA: Submarine Auxiliary, Auxiliary/Cargo Submarine\n* SSAN: Submarine Auxiliary Nuclear, Auxiliary/Cargo Submarine, Nuclear-powered\n* SSB: Submarine Ballistic, [[Ballistic missile submarine|Ballistic Missile Submarine]]\n* SSBN: Submarine Ballistic Nuclear, [[Ballistic missile submarine|Ballistic Missile Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSC: Coastal Submarine, over 150 tons\n* SSG: Guided Missile Submarine\n* SSGN: [[Cruise missile submarine|Guided Missile Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSI: Attack Submarine (Diesel Air-Independent Propulsion)<ref>{{cite journal | last = Buff | first = Joe | authorlink = Joe Buff\n |date=June 2007 | title = Subs in the Littoral: Diesels Just Blowing Smoke? | journal = Proceedings of the Naval Institute\n | volume = 133 | issue = 6 | pages = 40\u201343 | issn = 0041-798X | url = http://www.usni.org/ | accessdate = 2007-06-13\n | quote = Diesel AIP boats are known as SSIs, differentiating them from purely diesel-electric-powered hunter-killer subs, or SSKs. }}</ref>\n* SSK: [[Hunter-killer submarine|Hunter-Killer]]/ASW Submarine (retired)<ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/oldclass.htm Inactive Classification Symbols<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118095120/http://www.nvr.navy.mil/oldclass.htm |date=18 January 2012 }}</ref>\n* SSM: Midget Submarine, under 150 tons\n* [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|SSN]]: [[Attack submarine|Attack Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSNR: Special Attack Submarine <ref group=\"note\">This odd entry is not recognized by the U.S. Naval Vessel Register, and appears only in MIL-STD-2525A: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (15 December 1996) and later editions (MIL-STD-2525B: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (30 January 1999) and MIL-STD-2525C: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (17 November 2008)).

Such designations usually occur during periods of sudden mobilization, such as that which occurred prior to, and during, [[World War II]] or the [[Korean War]], when it was determined that a sudden temporary need arose for a ship for which there was no official Navy designation.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], for example, a number of commercial vessels were requisitioned, or acquired, by the U.S. Navy to meet the sudden requirements of war. A [[yacht]] acquired by the U.S. Navy during the start of World War II might seem desirable to the Navy whose use for the vessel might not be fully developed or explored at the time of acquisition.\n\nOn the other hand, a U.S. Navy vessel, such as the yacht in the example above, already in commission or service, might be desired, or found useful, for another need or purpose for which there is no official designation.\n* IX: Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary Ship, for example yacht ''Chanco'' acquired by the U.S. Navy on 1 October 1940. It was classified as a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{USS|Kestrel|AMc-5|1}}, but instead, mainly used as a [[patrol craft]] along the [[New England]] coast. When another assignment came, and it could not be determined how to classify the vessel, it was redesignated IX-175 on 10 July 1944.\n* IXSS: Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarines, such as the {{USS|Cod|IXSS-224}}, the {{USS|Angler|IXSS-240}} and the {{USS|Croaker|IXSS-246}}.\n* YAG: Miscellaneous Auxiliary Service Craft, such as the {{USS|George Eastman|YAG-39}}, {{USS|Butternut|YAG-60}} and {{USS|Christiana|YAG-32}} which, curiously, was earlier known as {{USS|Christiana|IX-80|1}}.\n\nNumerous other U.S. Navy vessels were launched with a temporary, or nominal, designation, such as YMS or PC, since it could not be determined, at time of construction, what they should be used for. Many of these were vessels in the 150 to 200 feet length class with powerful engines, whose function could be that of a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], [[patrol craft]], [[submarine chaser]], [[seaplane tender]], [[tugboat]], or other. Once their destiny, or capability, was found or determined, such vessels were reclassified with their actual designation.\n\n== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hull codes ==\n* R: Research ships, including oceanographic and fisheries research ships\n* S: Survey ships, including hydrographic survey ships\n\nThe letter is paired with a three-digit number.
