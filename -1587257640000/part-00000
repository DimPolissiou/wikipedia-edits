Its [[headwaters]] are two streams on [[Hampstead Heath]], each of which was dammed into a series of ponds\u2014the [[Hampstead Ponds]] and the [[Highgate Ponds]]\u2014in the 18th century. At the southern edge of Hampstead Heath these descend underground as [[combined sewer|sewers]] and join in [[Camden Town]]. The waters flow {{convert|4|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the ponds to the [[River Thames]].\n\nThe river gives its name to [[Fleet Street]], the eastern end of which is at what was the crossing over the river known as Fleet Bridge, and is now the site of [[Ludgate Circus]].\n\n==Course==\n[[Image:St Pancras Old Church in 1815.jpg|thumb|The Fleet passing by [[St Pancras Old Church]]]]\nThe Fleet rises on [[Hampstead Heath]] as two sources, which flow on the surface as the Hampstead Ponds and the Highgate Ponds. Then they go underground, pass under [[Kentish Town]], join in [[Camden Town]], and flow onwards towards [[St Pancras Old Church]], which was sited on the river's banks. From there it passed in a sinuous course which is responsible for the unusual building line adjacent to [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]] station; the [[German Gymnasium, London|German Gymnasium]] faced the river banks, and the curve of the Great Northern Hotel follows the river, which passes alongside it.\n\nKing's Cross was originally named ''Battle Bridge'', referring to an ancient bridge over the Fleet where [[Boudica]]'s army is said to have fought an important battle against the Romans; the name was changed in the 19th century to refer to a statue of [[George IV]] and quickly replaced by the 'lighthouse' building that still stands today. From there, it heads down King's Cross Road, from where the valley slope can be seen in the surrounding streets, and into Clerkenwell; the comparatively steep valley is responsible for the viaduct bridges which carry local roads over the valley floor.\n\nThe river then flows down [[Farringdon Road]] and [[Farringdon Street]], where the valley broadens out, and straightens, and joins the Thames beneath [[Blackfriars Bridge]].\n\n==Name==\nThe river's name is derived from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] {{lang|ang|fl\u0113ot}} \"tidal [[inlet]]\".<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=fleet, n.<sup>2</sup>}}</ref> In Anglo-Saxon times, the Fleet served as a [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] for [[shipping]].\n\nThe lower reaches of the river were known as the Holbourne (or Oldbourne), whence [[Holborn]] derived its name.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trench|first=Richard|author2=Hillman, Ellis |title=London under London: a subterranean guide|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1993|edition=Second|page=33|isbn=0-7195-5288-5}}</ref>\n\nThe river gives its name to [[Fleet Street]] which runs from Ludgate Circus to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] at [[Strand, London|the Strand]]. In the 1970s, a [[London Underground]] tube line was planned to lie under the line of Fleet Street, provisionally named the [[Jubilee line#1939 to 1979, the Fleet line|Fleet line]]. However, it was renamed the [[Jubilee line]] in 1977, and plans for the part of the route through the [[City of London]] were subsequently abandoned.\n\n==History==\nIn [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, the Fleet was a major river, with its estuary possibly containing the oldest [[tidal mill]] in the world.<ref>[http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf Spain, Rob: \"A possible Roman Tide Mill\", Paper submitted to the ''Kent Archaeological Society'']</ref> The river secured the western flank of the Roman City.\n\n[[File:Map Londinium 400 AD-en.svg|thumb|alt=Vector map of Londinium in 400 AD|Londinium in the year 400 showing the Fleet to its the west.

Many [[water well|wells]] were built along its banks, and some on springs (Bagnigge Well, [[Clerkenwell]]) and St Bride's Well, were reputed to have healing qualities; in the 13th century the river was called River of Wells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wickstead|first=Thomas|title=On the supply of water to the Metropolis|journal=The Civil engineer and architect's journal|date=January 1840|volume=III|issue=28|page=10}}</ref> The small lane at the south-west end of New Bridge Street is called Watergate because it was the river entrance to [[Bridewell Palace]].\n\nAs London grew, the river became increasingly a [[combined sewer|sewer]]. The area came to be characterised by poor-quality housing and prisons: Bridewell Palace itself was converted into a prison; [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]], [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] and [[Ludgate]] prisons were all built in that area.  In 1728 [[Alexander Pope]] wrote in his ''[[Dunciad]]'', \"To where Fleet-ditch with disemboguing streams / Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames / The king of dykes! than whom no sluice of mud / with deeper sable blots the silver flood\".<ref>''Dunciad'', book the second</ref>\n\n[[File:River Fleet, 1844, 2.png|thumb|left|The Fleet Ditch in 1844]]\nFollowing the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, architect [[Christopher Wren]]'s proposal for widening the river was rejected. Rather, the Fleet was converted into the New Canal, completed in 1680 under the supervision of [[Robert Hooke]]. Newcastle Close and Old Seacoal Lane (now just short alleyways off Farringdon Street) recall the [[wharves]] that used to line this canal, especially used by the coastal coal trade from the [[north-east of England]].  (An adjacent narrow road, Seacoal Lane, also existed until the late 20th century, when the present building fronting onto Farringdon Street was built, perhaps suggesting that a new wharf had been built near the old one.)\n\nThe upper canal, unpopular and unused, was from 1737 enclosed between [[Holborn]] and [[Ludgate Circus]] to form the \"[[Fleet Market]]\". The lower part, the section from [[Ludgate Circus]] to the Thames, had been covered by 1769 for the opening of the new Blackfriars Bridge and was consequently named \"New Bridge Street\".\n\nThe development of the [[Regent's Canal]] and urban growth covered the river in King's Cross and [[Camden Town|Camden]] from 1812. The Fleet Market was closed during the 1860s with the construction of [[Farringdon Road]] and [[Farringdon Street]] as a highway to the north and the [[Metropolitan Railway]], while the final upper section of the river was covered when Hampstead was expanded in the 1870s.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Fleet Mouth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mouth of the River Fleet in 2002, appearing as a drainage outlet (obscured in shadow) in the [[Thames Embankment|embankment]] wall beneath [[Blackfriars Bridge]]]]\nThe Fleet, or rather the sewer that now follows its route, can be heard through a grating in Ray Street, [[Clerkenwell]]<ref>[http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=531385&y=182157&z=1&sv=ray+street&st=1&tl=Ray+Street+Bridge+(off+Farringdon+Lane),+EC1&searchp=newsearch.srf&mapp=newmap.srf Ray Street Bridge (off Farringdon Lane), EC1].
