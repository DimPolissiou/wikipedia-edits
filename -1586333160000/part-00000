Tie Me Down!''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|\u00a1\u00c1tame!}}, {{IPA-es|\u02c8a.ta.me|pron}}, \"Tie Me!\") is a 1989 Spanish [[Dark comedy|dark]] [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]], and starring [[Victoria Abril]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] alongside [[Loles L\u00e9on]], [[Francisco Rabal]], [[Julieta Serrano]], [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]], and [[Rossy de Palma]]. The plot follows a recently released psychiatric patient who kidnaps an actress in order to make her fall in love with him. He believes his destiny is to marry her and father her children.\n\nThe film was highly successful with both critics and audiences in Spain.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 106</ref> Its United States release was entangled in controversy, instrumental in the implementation by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] of a new rating category, [[List of NC-17 films|NC-17]], for films of an explicit nature that were previously unfairly regarded as pornographic because of the [[X rating]].<ref name=\"Edwards 107\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 107</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRicky, a 23-year-old psychiatric patient, has been deemed cured and is released from a [[mental institution]]. Until then he has been the lover of the woman director of the hospital. An orphan, free, and alone, his goal is to have a normal life with Marina Osorio, an actress, former [[Pornographic film actor|porn star]], and recovering drug addict, whom he once slept with during an escape from the asylum.\n\nRicky discovers Marina's whereabouts from a film journal announcement of the start of her next film. He goes to the studio where Marina is in her last day at work filming ''The Midnight Phantom'', a Euro-horror film about a hideously mutilated, masked muscleman in love with Marina's character. The film is directed by M\u00e1ximo Espejo, an old film director confined to a wheelchair after a stroke. M\u00e1ximo is a gentle mentor to Marina and threatens to throw out a journalist who mentions the words \"porn\" and \"junkie\" in Marina's presence. His protection of the actress is not completely innocent since he is sexually attracted to Marina and lusts after her, enjoying what could be his last experience of directing a sexy female lead.\n\nWhen Ricky comes to the set, he steals a few necessary items including the keys to Marina's apartment, and before long, he is an unwelcome presence in her life. Ricky, with a long-haired wig, does a handstand to try to capture her attention. Marina does not remember him and quickly dismisses him.\n\nAfter filming the last scene, Marina goes home to change for the post-shoot party. Ricky follows her to her apartment. When she answers the door, Ricky forces his way in. He grabs her and headbutts her to silence her when she screams; he tapes her mouth and binds her with rope. Marina wakes with a terrible toothache, which normal painkillers do not relieve as she is addicted to stronger drugs. Ricky explains that he has captured her so that when she gets to know him better she will fall in love and they will get married and have children. \"I'll never love you, ever,\" says Marina, understandably enraged at being handcuffed, gagged and lashed to the bed. \"We'll see,\" says Ricky, who would do anything to win her heart.\n\nMarina is shocked and in pain, and eventually persuades Ricky to take her to a doctor who can give her the necessary painkillers. Ricky barely leaves her alone with the doctor, and she is unable to communicate her plight. They cannot get the drugs in the pharmacy so Ricky goes off to get them on the black market. However, rather than paying the street price, he attacks the dealer to get the tablets.\n\nDuring the [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap party]], Marina's sister, Lola, who is the assistant director of ''The Midnight Phantom'', steals the show with a musical number. Increasingly worried about her sister's disappearance, Lola visits Marina's apartment and leaves a note. To avoid being discovered, Ricky moves Marina to her next door neighbor's apartment. The apartment is empty, but the owner has left his keys with Lola so she can water his plants while he is away during the summer.\n\nIn the street again, Ricky is spotted by the dealer who he had attacked. Ricky is then seriously beaten, robbed and left unconscious. During his absence Marina makes a desperate but somewhat halfhearted attempt to escape from her captivity. However, when Ricky returns covered with blood and cuts, she sees his vulnerability and devotion to her, no matter how misguided. She cares for him, cleaning and sterilizing his wounds, and is suddenly struck by the realization that she has fallen in love with her captor. They make love at length and Ricky seems to be on the verge of achieving his aim. They decide to take a trip together to his native village.\n\nWhen he is about to leave to steal a car for the trip, Marina, who still considers herself his prisoner, tells him to keep her tied up so that she will not try to escape. However, in Ricky's absence, Lola reenters the apartment and discovers Marina tied up and rescues her. Marina informs her sister that she is in love with her captor. Lola is astonished to learn that Marina really no longer wants to be rescued, but once convinced, she agrees to drive Marina to Ricky's birthplace. They find him there in the ruins of his family house in a deserted village, then the three climb into Lola's car to return to the city. Lola promises Ricky she will find him a job within the week, Marina cries with happiness, and they drive off together into the distance, singing like a normal family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Victoria Abril]] as Marina Osorio\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Ricky\n* [[Loles Le\u00f3n]] as Lola Osorio\n* [[Francisco Rabal]] as M\u00e1ximo Espejo\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Alma Espejo\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Berta, doctor\n* [[Rossy de Palma]] as drug dealer on scooter\n* Lola Cardona as Hospital director\n* Francisca Caballero as Marina's mother\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' marked Almod\u00f3var's breaking-up with his longtime star, [[Carmen Maura]], in a rift that took many years to heal. In any case, at 44 Maura was too old to play the protagonist, a role that demanded a younger actress.<ref name=\"Strauss 92\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var'', p. 92</ref>  \u00a1''Atame''! was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration with  [[Victoria Abril]]. Almod\u00f3var had previously considered her for the role of Cristal, the prostitute neighbor in ''[[What Have I Done to Deserve This? (film)|What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]'' and Candela, the model fleeing a relationship with a terrorist in ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]''.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\" /> Victoria Abril had a cameo role in ''[[Law of Desire]]''.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo 71\">D\u2019Lugo, '' Pedro Almod\u00f3var'', p. 71</ref> She was already a well established actress identified with strong female characters.<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 111\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 111</ref>\n\nThe male lead was played by Banderas in his fifth and most important collaboration with Almod\u00f3var.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\" /> His role in ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' launched his career in American films. [[Loles L\u00e9on]], a stand-up comedian, plays Marina's sassy sister Lola. She had previously appeared as the meddlesome telephonist in ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]''. [[Francisco Rabal]], one of Spain's foremost actors, took the role of the film director. Almod\u00f3var cast his own mother, Francisca Caballero, as Marina's mother. [[Rossy de Palma]], the actress of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]esque appearance discovered by Almod\u00f3var in 1986, plays the small role of the drug dealer.\n\n===Analysis===\nThe Spanish title ''\u00a1\u00c1tame!'' literally means \"Tie me up!\", while the second part of the English title, \"Tie Me Down!\", is presumably intended to suggest the idea of a lasting relationship.<ref name=\"Edwards 207\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 207</ref> Almod\u00f3var has consistently denied that ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''\u2019s ropes have any links with sadomasochism.<ref name=\"Smith 114\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 114</ref> There is no erotic charge to the ropes and gags.<ref name=\"Smith 114\" /> Almod\u00f3var explained:\" ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' is essentially a love story, or rather a story of how someone attempts to construct a love story in the same way as he might study for a degree: by means of effort, will power, and persistence... when you have nothing, like my main character, you have to force everything. Including love. Ricky has only (as the flamenco singers say) the night, the day, and the vitality of an animal.\"<ref name=\"Smith 107\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 107</ref>\n\nRicky's stated ambition is to be a good husband to Marina and a good father to their children. Indeed, the relationship between Marina and Ricky is meant, ultimately, to be a parody of how such relationships work, as if heterosexuality (and its consequence, marriage) are almost inevitably equivalent in character to the infamous [[Stockholm syndrome]].<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 111\" /> The cords that tie us one to another become literal ropey metaphors in the film. It is a tale not of kinky sex, but of a sweeter human bondage, of loose ends tied into lover's knots.\n\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' follows in the myth of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and the notion that the savagery of the Beast is, in the presence of Beauty, tamed by gentler feelings.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /> This has been a recurrent theme in films like ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''  and ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]''.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /> This theme is also present in [[Spanish Literature]]. In [[Calderon de la Barca]]'s famous play ''[[Life is a dream]]'', the main character, Segismundo, a half-man, half-beast who has been imprisoned for his whole twenty years, once released into the world finds that his violence is tamed by female beauty.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" />\n\nThe abduction narrative has some similarities with the film ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]'' (1965) directed by [[William Wyler]], in which a butterfly specialist abducts a young woman in order to add her to his collection. ''The Collector'' was adapted from the eponymous novel written by [[John Fowles]]. In style, theme and plot details, ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' differs greatly from Wyler's film and the novel that inspired it.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /><ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 110\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 110</ref> [[Bride kidnapping#In film|Bride kidnapping]] is also a central plot device in the Hollywood musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'' (1954).\n\n===Genre===\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' combines two different film genres: [[romantic comedy]] and [[horror film]]. In spite of some dark elements, It can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's clearest love story. Almod\u00f3var described the film as a \"romantic fairy tale\".<ref name=\"Strauss 100\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var'', p. 100</ref>  Ricky, in his violent courtship of Marina follows, in an exaggerated manner, the path of the romantic film genre like those made popular in the late 1950s by [[Doris Day]] with  various male film stars: ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959) with [[Rock Hudson]];'' [[Move Over, Darling]]'' (1963), with [[James Garner]]; and ''[[That Touch of Mink]]'' (1962), with [[Cary Grant]].<ref name=\"Edwards 114\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 114</ref>\n\nThe film is also rooted on the tradition of the horror film genre.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /> Marina plays the lead in the horror film ''Midnight Phantom'', in which she defeats the Phantom's attempt to kill her, overcoming him and thus subverting the horror film tradition of a woman as victim in a way that parallels Marina's relationship with Ricky. While filming ''The Midnight Phantom'', Lola notes that the film they are working on is \"more a love story than a horror story\", to which Maximo the director replies, \"sometimes they\u2019re indistinguishable\". ''Midnight Phantom'', is not simply a film within the film: just as the girl in ''Midnight Phantom'' defeats the monster, so ultimately Marina will succeed in taming Ricky. In a way, ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' is an extension of ''Midnight Phantom'' and both films mix horror and romance and variant versions of ''Beauty and the Beast''. ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' also makes reference to two horror films: ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956) and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 108\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 108</ref> M\u00e1ximo Espejo has a poster of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in his editing room and Marina watches ''Night of the Living Dead'' while Ricky is away.<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 108\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Ennio Morricone]] in the style of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] and is reminiscent of [[Bernard Herrmann]]\u2019s score for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\u2019s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 109\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 109</ref><ref name=\"Allison 196\">Allison, ''A Spanish Labyrinth'', p. 196</ref> Almod\u00f3var admired Morricone's soundtracks for westerns, but found the music for ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' conventional and uninspiring, too similar to Morricone's work for the film ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'', and used only half of Morricone's music.<ref name=\"Strauss 115\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var'', p. 115</ref>\n\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down''! prominently features two songs. The film closes with the theme ''Resistire'' (I will resist) by [[D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico]], a Spanish pop duo from the 1960s, suggesting Marina\u2019s happy resistance to Ricky\u2019s unconventional courtship.<ref name=\"Allison 199\">Allison, ''A Spanish Labyrinth'', p. 199</ref><ref name=\"Smith 118\">Smith, ''Desire Unlimited'', p. 118</ref> The wrap party scene breaks the hardship of the kidnapping scene. It presents Lola, Marina\u2019s sister, played by Loles Le\u00f3n, singing the bolero ''Canci\u00f3n del Alma'', a song popularized in Latin America by [[Alfredo Sadel]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'', Almod\u00f3var\u2019s eighth film, was completed in late 1989.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\" /> Its [[Film premiere|premiere]] at the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1990/02_programm_1990/02_Programm_1990.html |title=Berlinale: 1990 Programme |accessdate=15 March 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> in early 1990, was inauspicious. The projector broke down and in the following press conference Almod\u00f3var, whose films have not been well understood in Germany,<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" /> was subjected to heavy questioning about his homosexuality, drug abuse, and the Spanishness of his film.<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" />\n\nReleased in Spain in January 1990, ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' was an enormous success, becoming the highest-grossing domestic film of its year, reaching an audience of over a million. It had twice the audience of the most critically acclaimed Spanish film of that year, [[Carlos Saura]]\u2019s  ''[[\u00a1Ay Carmela! (film)|\u00a1Ay Carmela!]]'', a film starring Almod\u00f3var\u2019s former muse [[Carmen Maura]].\n\nThe film was generally well received by the Spanish critics.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo 74\">D\u2019Lugo, '' Pedro Almod\u00f3var'', p. 74</ref> Lluis Bonet, writing in ''La Vanguardia'', called the film \"a terrible tender love story\", agreeing with the director that the best scene was that in which Marina, initially held hostage by Ricky against her will, finally asks to be tied up by him so she will not be tempted to flee from the love he has successfully provoked in her.<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" /> Critic Javier Maqua in ''Cinco Dias'' called Marina's request evidence of \"the greatest intensity of love\".<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" /><ref name=\"Smith 108\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 108</ref> Rosy de Palma, who plays a drug dealer in the film, explained that the film's kidnapping was not to be imitated in real life and was only justified by the \"exceptional nature of the characters\".<ref name=\"Smith 108\" />\n\nBritish critics took time to warm up to Almod\u00f3var's films and dismissed ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''. Lawrence O\u2019Toole in [[Sight and Sound]], described it as:\" fairly banal, schematic and essentially humorless\".<ref name=\"Edwards 109\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 109</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the film seemed to offend the American sense of obscenity with a lengthy sex scene and by a couple of sequences in which Marina and later her sister Lola sit on the toilet to urinate.<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" />  Particularly controversial was the shot of Marina in a bath tub pleasuring herself with a scuba diver toy.\n\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' was entangled in a rating classification battle and was the subject of heated debate. Eventually released unrated, the film was decried by [[Feminism|feminists and women's advocacy groups]] for what they perceived as its [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochist]] undertones and victimization of women. Nevertheless, the film grossed $4,087,361 at the North American box office, a respectable amount for a foreign language film.\n\n==Controversy==\nThere was a legal battle over the decision by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), which determines film ratings in the United States, to give ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' an [[X rating]], which was normally reserved for [[pornography]].<ref name=\"Smith 117\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 117</ref> This marginalized its distribution and reduced its chance of box-office success.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo 75\">D\u2019Lugo, ''Pedro Almod\u00f3var'', p. 75</ref> The film's distribution company in North America, [[Miramax]], filed a lawsuit against the MPAA over the X rating. When the case came to court in New York, it gave rise to a general debate on cinema, censorship, and sexuality in the United States.<ref name=\"Smith 117\" />\n\nThe attorney for Miramax claimed that the AAP (Average American Parent) was not well served by a system that was lenient on films with hard violence and drug use while being harsh with films depicting sex.<ref name=\"Smith 117\" /> Miramax lost its case in court and the film was ultimately released unrated. However, numerous other filmmakers had complained about the X rating given to their films, and in September 1990 the MPAA dropped the X rating and replaced it with the [[NC-17]] rating, with ''[[Henry & June]]'' as the first film released with the new rating. This was especially helpful to films of an explicit nature that were previously assumed to be pornographic because of the X rating.<ref name=\"Smith 117\" />\n\n==Home media==\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' was released on Region 1 [[DVD]] in Spanish with English subtitles. It includes the film's [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]], but there are no other extras. The region 2 DVD released in the U.K. includes an interview of Almod\u00f3var by Banderas, footage of the premiere in [[Madrid]], poster and still galleries, and trailers.\n\nOn August 19, 2014, the film was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray by the [[Criterion Collection]] in the United States. A new documentary produced by Criterion was included among the extras, including some that were ported over from previous releases.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Allinson, Mark.

Tie Me Down!''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|\u00a1\u00c1tame!}}, {{IPA-es|\u02c8a.ta.me|pron}}, \"Tie Me!\") is a 1989 Spanish [[Dark comedy|dark]] [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]], and starring [[Victoria Abril]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] alongside [[Loles L\u00e9on]], [[Francisco Rabal]], [[Julieta Serrano]], [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]], and [[Rossy de Palma]]. The plot follows a recently released psychiatric patient who kidnaps an actress in order to make her fall in love with him. He believes his destiny is to marry her and father her children.\n\nThe film was highly successful with both critics and audiences in Spain.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 106</ref> Its United States release was entangled in controversy, instrumental in the implementation by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] of a new rating category, [[List of NC-17 films|NC-17]], for films of an explicit nature that were previously unfairly regarded as pornographic because of the [[X rating]].<ref name=\"Edwards 107\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 107</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRicky, a 23-year-old psychiatric patient, has been deemed cured and is released from a [[mental institution]]. Until then he has been the lover of the woman director of the hospital. An orphan, free, and alone, his goal is to have a normal life with Marina Osorio, an actress, former [[Pornographic film actor|porn star]], and recovering drug addict, whom he once slept with during an escape from the asylum.\n\nRicky discovers Marina's whereabouts from a film journal announcement of the start of her next film. He goes to the studio where Marina is in her last day at work filming ''The Midnight Phantom'', a Euro-horror film about a hideously mutilated, masked muscleman in love with Marina's character. The film is directed by M\u00e1ximo Espejo, an old film director confined to a wheelchair after a stroke. M\u00e1ximo is a gentle mentor to Marina and threatens to throw out a journalist who mentions the words \"porn\" and \"junkie\" in Marina's presence. His protection of the actress is not completely innocent since he is sexually attracted to Marina and lusts after her, enjoying what could be his last experience of directing a sexy female lead.\n\nWhen Ricky comes to the set, he steals a few necessary items including the keys to Marina's apartment, and before long, he is an unwelcome presence in her life. Ricky, with a long-haired wig, does a handstand to try to capture her attention. Marina does not remember him and quickly dismisses him.\n\nAfter filming the last scene, Marina goes home to change for the post-shoot party. Ricky follows her to her apartment. When she answers the door, Ricky forces his way in. He grabs her and headbutts her to silence her when she screams; he tapes her mouth and binds her with rope. Marina wakes with a terrible toothache, which normal painkillers do not relieve as she is addicted to stronger drugs. Ricky explains that he has captured her so that when she gets to know him better she will fall in love and they will get married and have children. \"I'll never love you, ever,\" says Marina, understandably enraged at being handcuffed, gagged and lashed to the bed. \"We'll see,\" says Ricky, who would do anything to win her heart.\n\nMarina is shocked and in pain, and eventually persuades Ricky to take her to a doctor who can give her the necessary painkillers. Ricky barely leaves her alone with the doctor, and she is unable to communicate her plight. They cannot get the drugs in the pharmacy so Ricky goes off to get them on the black market. However, rather than paying the street price, he attacks the dealer to get the tablets.\n\nDuring the [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap party]], Marina's sister, Lola, who is the assistant director of ''The Midnight Phantom'', steals the show with a musical number. Increasingly worried about her sister's disappearance, Lola visits Marina's apartment and leaves a note. To avoid being discovered, Ricky moves Marina to her next door neighbor's apartment. The apartment is empty, but the owner has left his keys with Lola so she can water his plants while he is away during the summer.\n\nIn the street again, Ricky is spotted by the dealer who he had attacked. Ricky is then seriously beaten, robbed and left unconscious. During his absence Marina makes a desperate but somewhat halfhearted attempt to escape from her captivity. However, when Ricky returns covered with blood and cuts, she sees his vulnerability and devotion to her, no matter how misguided. She cares for him, cleaning and sterilizing his wounds, and is suddenly struck by the realization that she has fallen in love with her captor. They make love at length and Ricky seems to be on the verge of achieving his aim. They decide to take a trip together to his native village.\n\nWhen he is about to leave to steal a car for the trip, Marina, who still considers herself his prisoner, tells him to keep her tied up so that she will not try to escape. However, in Ricky's absence, Lola reenters the apartment and discovers Marina tied up and rescues her. Marina informs her sister that she is in love with her captor. Lola is astonished to learn that Marina really no longer wants to be rescued, but once convinced, she agrees to drive Marina to Ricky's birthplace. They find him there in the ruins of his family house in a deserted village, then the three climb into Lola's car to return to the city. Lola promises Ricky she will find him a job within the week, Marina cries with happiness, and they drive off together into the distance, singing like a normal family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Victoria Abril]] as Marina Osorio\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Ricky\n* [[Loles Le\u00f3n]] as Lola Osorio\n* [[Francisco Rabal]] as M\u00e1ximo Espejo\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Alma Espejo\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Berta, doctor\n* [[Rossy de Palma]] as drug dealer on scooter\n* Lola Cardona as Hospital director\n* Francisca Caballero as Marina's mother\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' marked Almod\u00f3var's breaking-up with his longtime star, [[Carmen Maura]], in a rift that took many years to heal. In any case, at 44 Maura was too old to play the protagonist, a role that demanded a younger actress.<ref name=\"Strauss 92\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var'', p. 92</ref>  \u00a1''Atame''! was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration with  [[Victoria Abril]]. Almod\u00f3var had previously considered her for the role of Cristal, the prostitute neighbor in ''[[What Have I Done to Deserve This? (film)|What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]'' and Candela, the model fleeing a relationship with a terrorist in ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]''.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\" /> Victoria Abril had a cameo role in ''[[Law of Desire]]''.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo 71\">D\u2019Lugo, '' Pedro Almod\u00f3var'', p. 71</ref> She was already a well established actress identified with strong female characters.<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 111\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 111</ref>\n\nThe male lead was played by Banderas in his fifth and most important collaboration with Almod\u00f3var.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\" /> His role in ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' launched his career in American films. [[Loles L\u00e9on]], a stand-up comedian, plays Marina's sassy sister Lola. She had previously appeared as the meddlesome telephonist in ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]''. [[Francisco Rabal]], one of Spain's foremost actors, took the role of the film director. Almod\u00f3var cast his own mother, Francisca Caballero, as Marina's mother. [[Rossy de Palma]], the actress of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]esque appearance discovered by Almod\u00f3var in 1986, plays the small role of the drug dealer.\n\n===Analysis===\nThe Spanish title ''\u00a1\u00c1tame!'' literally means \"Tie me up!\", while the second part of the English title, \"Tie Me Down!\", is presumably intended to suggest the idea of a lasting relationship.<ref name=\"Edwards 207\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 207</ref> Almod\u00f3var has consistently denied that ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''\u2019s ropes have any links with sadomasochism.<ref name=\"Smith 114\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 114</ref> There is no erotic charge to the ropes and gags.<ref name=\"Smith 114\" /> Almod\u00f3var explained:\" ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' is essentially a love story, or rather a story of how someone attempts to construct a love story in the same way as he might study for a degree: by means of effort, will power, and persistence... when you have nothing, like my main character, you have to force everything. Including love. Ricky has only (as the flamenco singers say) the night, the day, and the vitality of an animal.\"<ref name=\"Smith 107\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 107</ref>\n\nRicky's stated ambition is to be a good husband to Marina and a good father to their children. Indeed, the relationship between Marina and Ricky is meant, ultimately, to be a parody of how such relationships work, as if heterosexuality (and its consequence, marriage) are almost inevitably equivalent in character to the infamous [[Stockholm syndrome]].<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 111\" /> The cords that tie us one to another become literal ropey metaphors in the film. It is a tale not of kinky sex, but of a sweeter human bondage, of loose ends tied into lover's knots.\n\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' follows in the myth of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and the notion that the savagery of the Beast is, in the presence of Beauty, tamed by gentler feelings.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /> This has been a recurrent theme in films like ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''  and ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]''.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /> This theme is also present in [[Spanish Literature]]. In [[Calderon de la Barca]]'s famous play ''[[Life is a dream]]'', the main character, Segismundo, a half-man, half-beast who has been imprisoned for his whole twenty years, once released into the world finds that his violence is tamed by female beauty.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" />\n\nThe abduction narrative has some similarities with the film ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]'' (1965) directed by [[William Wyler]], in which a butterfly specialist abducts a young woman in order to add her to his collection. ''The Collector'' was adapted from the eponymous novel written by [[John Fowles]]. In style, theme and plot details, ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' differs greatly from Wyler's film and the novel that inspired it.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /><ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 110\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 110</ref> [[Bride kidnapping#In film|Bride kidnapping]] is also a central plot device in the Hollywood musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'' (1954).\n\n===Genre===\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' combines two different film genres: [[romantic comedy]] and [[horror film]]. In spite of some dark elements, It can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's clearest love story. Almod\u00f3var described the film as a \"romantic fairy tale\".<ref name=\"Strauss 100\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var'', p. 100</ref>  Ricky, in his violent courtship of Marina follows, in an exaggerated manner, the path of the romantic film genre like those made popular in the late 1950s by [[Doris Day]] with  various male film stars: ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959) with [[Rock Hudson]];'' [[Move Over, Darling]]'' (1963), with [[James Garner]]; and ''[[That Touch of Mink]]'' (1962), with [[Cary Grant]].<ref name=\"Edwards 114\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 114</ref>\n\nThe film is also rooted on the tradition of the horror film genre.<ref name=\"Edwards 109\" /> Marina plays the lead in the horror film ''Midnight Phantom'', in which she defeats the Phantom's attempt to kill her, overcoming him and thus subverting the horror film tradition of a woman as victim in a way that parallels Marina's relationship with Ricky. While filming ''The Midnight Phantom'', Lola notes that the film they are working on is \"more a love story than a horror story\", to which Maximo the director replies, \"sometimes they\u2019re indistinguishable\". ''Midnight Phantom'', is not simply a film within the film: just as the girl in ''Midnight Phantom'' defeats the monster, so ultimately Marina will succeed in taming Ricky. In a way, ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' is an extension of ''Midnight Phantom'' and both films mix horror and romance and variant versions of ''Beauty and the Beast''. ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' also makes reference to two horror films: ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956) and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 108\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 108</ref> M\u00e1ximo Espejo has a poster of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in his editing room and Marina watches ''Night of the Living Dead'' while Ricky is away.<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 108\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Ennio Morricone]] in the style of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] and is reminiscent of [[Bernard Herrmann]]\u2019s score for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\u2019s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.<ref name=\"Epps & Kakoudaki 109\">Epps & Kakoudaki, '' All about Almod\u00f3var'', p. 109</ref><ref name=\"Allison 196\">Allison, ''A Spanish Labyrinth'', p. 196</ref> Almod\u00f3var admired Morricone's soundtracks for westerns, but found the music for ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' conventional and uninspiring, too similar to Morricone's work for the film ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'', and used only half of Morricone's music.<ref name=\"Strauss 115\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var'', p. 115</ref>\n\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down''! prominently features two songs. The film closes with the theme ''Resistire'' (I will resist) by [[D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico]], a Spanish pop duo from the 1960s, suggesting Marina\u2019s happy resistance to Ricky\u2019s unconventional courtship.<ref name=\"Allison 199\">Allison, ''A Spanish Labyrinth'', p. 199</ref><ref name=\"Smith 118\">Smith, ''Desire Unlimited'', p. 118</ref> The wrap party scene breaks the hardship of the kidnapping scene. It presents Lola, Marina\u2019s sister, played by Loles Le\u00f3n, singing the bolero ''Canci\u00f3n del Alma'', a song popularized in Latin America by [[Alfredo Sadel]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'', Almod\u00f3var\u2019s eighth film, was completed in late 1989.<ref name=\"Edwards 106\" /> Its [[Film premiere|premiere]] at the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1990/02_programm_1990/02_Programm_1990.html |title=Berlinale: 1990 Programme |accessdate=15 March 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> in early 1990, was inauspicious. The projector broke down and in the following press conference Almod\u00f3var, whose films have not been well understood in Germany,<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" /> was subjected to heavy questioning about his homosexuality, drug abuse, and the Spanishness of his film.<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" />\n\nReleased in Spain in January 1990, ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' was an enormous success, becoming the highest-grossing domestic film of its year, reaching an audience of over a million. It had twice the audience of the most critically acclaimed Spanish film of that year, [[Carlos Saura]]\u2019s  ''[[\u00a1Ay Carmela! (film)|\u00a1Ay Carmela!]]'', a film starring Almod\u00f3var\u2019s former muse [[Carmen Maura]].\n\nThe film was generally well received by the Spanish critics.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo 74\">D\u2019Lugo, '' Pedro Almod\u00f3var'', p. 74</ref> Lluis Bonet, writing in ''La Vanguardia'', called the film \"a terrible tender love story\", agreeing with the director that the best scene was that in which Marina, initially held hostage by Ricky against her will, finally asks to be tied up by him so she will not be tempted to flee from the love he has successfully provoked in her.<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" /> Critic Javier Maqua in ''Cinco Dias'' called Marina's request evidence of \"the greatest intensity of love\".<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" /><ref name=\"Smith 108\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 108</ref> Rosy de Palma, who plays a drug dealer in the film, explained that the film's kidnapping was not to be imitated in real life and was only justified by the \"exceptional nature of the characters\".<ref name=\"Smith 108\" />\n\nBritish critics took time to warm up to Almod\u00f3var's films and dismissed ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''. Lawrence O\u2019Toole in [[Sight and Sound]], described it as:\" fairly banal, schematic and essentially humorless\".<ref name=\"Edwards 109\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 109</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the film seemed to offend the American sense of obscenity with a lengthy sex scene and by a couple of sequences in which Marina and later her sister Lola sit on the toilet to urinate.<ref name=\"Edwards 107\" />  Particularly controversial was the shot of Marina in a bath tub pleasuring herself with a scuba diver toy.\n\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' was entangled in a rating classification battle and was the subject of heated debate. Eventually released unrated, the film was decried by [[Feminism|feminists and women's advocacy groups]] for what they perceived as its [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochist]] undertones and victimization of women. Nevertheless, the film grossed $4,087,361 at the North American box office, a respectable amount for a foreign language film.\n\n==Controversy==\nThere was a legal battle over the decision by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), which determines film ratings in the United States, to give ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' an [[X rating]], which was normally reserved for [[pornography]].<ref name=\"Smith 117\">Smith, '' Desire Unlimited'', p. 117</ref> This marginalized its distribution and reduced its chance of box-office success.<ref name=\"D\u2019Lugo 75\">D\u2019Lugo, ''Pedro Almod\u00f3var'', p. 75</ref> The film's distribution company in North America, [[Miramax]], filed a lawsuit against the MPAA over the X rating. When the case came to court in New York, it gave rise to a general debate on cinema, censorship, and sexuality in the United States.<ref name=\"Smith 117\" />\n\nThe attorney for Miramax claimed that the AAP (Average American Parent) was not well served by a system that was lenient on films with hard violence and drug use while being harsh with films depicting sex.<ref name=\"Smith 117\" /> Miramax lost its case in court and the film was ultimately released unrated. However, numerous other filmmakers had complained about the X rating given to their films, and in September 1990 the MPAA dropped the X rating and replaced it with the [[NC-17]] rating, with ''[[Henry & June]]'' as the first film released with the new rating. This was especially helpful to films of an explicit nature that were previously assumed to be pornographic because of the X rating.<ref name=\"Smith 117\" />\n\n==Home media==\n''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' was released on Region 1 [[DVD]] in Spanish with English subtitles. It includes the film's [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]], but there are no other extras. The region 2 DVD released in the U.K. includes an interview of Almod\u00f3var by Banderas, footage of the premiere in [[Madrid]], poster and still galleries, and trailers.\n\nOn August 19, 2014, the film was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray by the [[Criterion Collection]] in the United States. A new documentary produced by Criterion was included among the extras, including some that were ported over from previous releases.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Allinson, Mark.

Wilson Lane]], just northwest of the [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]] limits. The yeshiva moved to its present location in 1968. Their previous location was in Baltimore City at 4411 Garrison Boulevard. The large size of their present campus, which is nearly 100 acres, provides ample space for outdoors recreation.\n\nNer Israel has two central study halls, one for the high school (known as the Mechina) and one much larger for the [[beis medrash]] and the [[kollel]] (also doubling as the main prayer sanctuaries). There is an additional study hall/multi-purpose room of a smaller size that is called the \"Friedman Beis Medrash\". Enrollment is approximately 250 students in its high school division, 300 students in its beis medrash/undergraduate division, and about 200 members in its kollel/postgraduate division.\n\nThe dining hall is located in a separate building known as the Sindler/Wolf Dining Hall. The dining hall is scheduled for a significant expansion and renovation in 2019. There are also three dormitory buildings on campus.\n\nThere is faculty housing on campus for members of the faculty and some members of the kollel.

The high school was dedicated by the philanthropic Beren family in memory of Israel Henry Beren who died in 1994.\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A student studying inside the Bais Medrash]]\n\n===Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)===\nThe yeshiva's studies are primarily [[Talmud]] texts and relevant rabbinic literature. The yeshiva has a rotating cycle of nine different Talmudic [[tractate]]<nowiki/>s it covers in the course of nine years: Bava Kamma 1, Yevamos, Bava Basra, Gittin, Bava Kamma 2, Nedarim, Bava Metzia, Kiddushin, Kesubos. There are additional tractates that are sometimes studied in the spring semester. These include Succah, Pesachim, and Makkos.\n\nAs is true in many Lithuanian-style Yeshivos, the methodology of the study of the Talmud is based on the [[Brisker method]]. Other Lithuanian-style Yeshivos follow almost exclusively the Rabbi [[Boruch Ber Leibowitz]] style of the Brisker method. Although Rabbi Lebowitz's works are studied in Ner Yisrael, his specific style of study is not the only approach in Ner Yisroel as Ner Yisroel subscribes to a more eclectic approach to Talmudic Lomdus. Hour-long [[Shiur (Torah)|Shiurim]] (lessons) on Talmud are given daily. The Shiurim are delivered in a dialect of English known as [[Yeshivish]]. The highest level shiur is taught by [[Tzvi Berkowitz|Rabbi Tzvi Berkowitz.]]\n\nAdditionally, half an hour per day is dedicated to the study of [[Musar literature]].\n\n\n===Kollel Avodas Levi===\n[[Kollel]] Avodas Levi is a department of the Yeshiva that is composed of older students, mostly married, who are engaged in advanced studies. Established in 1959, the Kollel was later named \"Avodas Levi\" in memory of Rabbi Ruderman who authored a [[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]] of the same name.  Most of the 250+ members, known as yungerleit, learn within the framework of a study group, called a \"chabura\", that is focused on a specific topic and led by a senior member of the Kollel. Ner Yisroel confers [[Semikhah|Semicha]] (Rabbinic Ordination) upon qualified members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nirc.edu/kollel/|title=Kollel|website=Ner Israel Rabbinical College|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref>\n\nRabbi Ezra Neuberger, son of Rabbi Herman became Rosh Kollel/Dean of the Kollel/Graduate school in his father's lifetime.<ref name=NerNeuWorld.NYT611/><ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/ner-israel-rabbinical-college-000_10030862.aspx\n   |title=Ner Israel Rabbinical College - Graduate Programs\n   |quote=Contact Rabbi Ezra Neuberger}}</ref>\n\n===The Mechina's Masechta Bechina===\nThe Mechina High School studies two tractates every year. One is studied in depth (Iyyun), and the other one is studied in its entirety at a faster pace which is known as the study of Bekius. At the end of the school year, the students take an exam on the entire tractate that was studied in the Bekius program. This exam is called the \"Masechta Bechina\".

Rabbi Azriel Hauptman (son-in-law of Rabbi Yosef Tendler) is the General Studies principal (replacing Mr. Jacob Schuchman).\n\n==Campus==\nThe yeshiva campus is located at [[Mount Wilson Lane|Mt. Wilson Lane]], just northwest of the [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]] limits. The yeshiva moved to its present location in 1968. Their previous location was in Baltimore City at 4411 Garrison Boulevard. The large size of their present campus, which is nearly 100 acres, provides ample space for outdoors recreation.\n\nNer Israel has two central study halls, one for the high school (known as the Mechina) and one much larger for the [[beis medrash]] and the [[kollel]] (also doubling as the main prayer sanctuaries). There is an additional study hall/multi-purpose room of a smaller size that is called the \"Friedman Beis Medrash\". Enrollment is approximately 250 students in its high school division, 300 students in its beis medrash/undergraduate division, and about 200 members in its kollel/postgraduate division.\n\nThe dining hall is located in a separate building known as the Sindler/Wolf Dining Hall. The dining hall is scheduled for a significant expansion and renovation in 2019. There are also three dormitory buildings on campus.\n\nThere is faculty housing on campus for members of the faculty and some members of the kollel. This section of the campus is known as \"Yeshiva Lane\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rabbiavishafran.com/unreal/|title=Unreal - Rabbi Avi Shafran|date=2013-06-11|work=Rabbi Avi Shafran|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe renaissance of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community in Baltimore is closely related to the presence of Ner Yisroel, as many graduates who originate from other regions settled in the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jewishtimes.com/46794/baltimores-jewish-architecture-testament-to-character-conviction-mobility-of-its-people/news/|title=Baltimore\u2019s \u2018Jewish\u2019 Architecture  Testament to Character, Conviction, Mobility of Its People|website=jewishtimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Activity outside of Baltimore==\nIn 1959, Rabbi Sholom Gold established a branch of Ner Yisroel in [[Toronto]].

The high school was dedicated by the philanthropic Beren family in memory of Israel Henry Beren who died in 1994.\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A student studying inside the Bais Medrash]]\n\n===Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)===\nThe yeshiva's studies are primarily [[Talmud]] texts and relevant rabbinic literature. The yeshiva has a rotating cycle of nine different Talmudic [[tractate]]<nowiki/>s it covers in the course of nine years: Bava Kamma 1, Yevamos, Bava Basra, Gittin, Bava Kamma 2, Nedarim, Bava Metzia, Kiddushin, Kesubos. There are additional tractates that are sometimes studied in the spring semester. These include Succah, Pesachim, and Makkos.\n\nAs is true in many Lithuanian-style Yeshivos, the methodology of the study of the Talmud is based on the [[Brisker method]]. Other Lithuanian-style Yeshivos follow almost exclusively the Rabbi [[Boruch Ber Leibowitz]] style of the Brisker method. Although Rabbi Lebowitz's works are studied in Ner Yisrael, his specific style of study is not the only approach in Ner Yisroel as Ner Yisroel subscribes to a more eclectic approach to Talmudic Lomdus. Hour-long [[Shiur (Torah)|Shiurim]] (lessons) on Talmud are given daily. The Shiurim are delivered in a dialect of English known as [[Yeshivish]]. The highest level shiur is taught by [[Tzvi Berkowitz|Rabbi Tzvi Berkowitz.]]\n\nAdditionally, half an hour per day is dedicated to the study of [[Musar literature]].\n\n\n===Kollel Avodas Levi===\n[[Kollel]] Avodas Levi is a department of the Yeshiva that is composed of older students, mostly married, who are engaged in advanced studies. Established in 1959, the Kollel was later named \"Avodas Levi\" in memory of Rabbi Ruderman who authored a [[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]] of the same name.  Most of the 250+ members, known as yungerleit, learn within the framework of a study group, called a \"chabura\", that is focused on a specific topic and led by a senior member of the Kollel. Ner Yisroel confers [[Semikhah|Semicha]] (Rabbinic Ordination) upon qualified members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nirc.edu/kollel/|title=Kollel|website=Ner Israel Rabbinical College|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref>\n\nRabbi Ezra Neuberger, son of Rabbi Herman became Rosh Kollel/Dean of the Kollel/Graduate school in his father's lifetime.<ref name=NerNeuWorld.NYT611/><ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/ner-israel-rabbinical-college-000_10030862.aspx\n   |title=Ner Israel Rabbinical College - Graduate Programs\n   |quote=Contact Rabbi Ezra Neuberger}}</ref>\n\n===The Mechina's Masechta Bechina===\nThe Mechina High School studies two tractates every year. One is studied in depth (Iyyun), and the other one is studied in its entirety at a faster pace which is known as the study of Bekius. At the end of the school year, the students take an exam on the entire tractate that was studied in the Bekius program. This exam is called the \"Masechta Bechina\". An exam on an entire tractate is considered a major accomplishment due to the amount and complexity of the information contained in each tractate. Former students recount how decades later they still have an incredible recall of the tractates that they studied in the Mechina's Bekius program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://rabbiyoni.com/2012/02/the-waters-from-which-i-drank-in-memory-of-rabbi-yosef-tendlerrosh-mechinat-ner-yisrael/|title=The Waters From Which I Drank: In Memory of Rabbi Yosef Tendler\u2013Rosh Mechinat Ner Yisrael|date=2012-02-12|work=RabbiYoni.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAdvanced students complete the Iyyun tractate on their own as an extracurricular project.

Rabbi Herman Neuberger was very instrumental in bringing to the United States over 1,000 young Persian men, most of whom studied in Ner Yisroel. Ner Yisroel still maintains a special [[minyan]] on [[Shabbat|Shabbos]] for Persian students. There are large communities of Orthodox Persian Jews in Baltimore, Los Angeles, and New York that are a direct result of Rabbi Neuberger's efforts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jewishtimes.com/36708/hanging-on-to-heritage/news/|title=Hanging on to Heritage|website=jewishtimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>\n\n===South American Students===\nThere are many South American students in the Yeshiva.

The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and began aiming for a career in [[Formula One]] four years later. He achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in Formula One with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]]. In retirement, Rosberg moved into [[Coach (sport)|driver management]], television [[pundit]]ry, and became an [[Ecopreneurship|eco-entrepreneur]]. He was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year]] and was inducted into the [[FIA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal background and

racing driver who won the [[2016 Formula One World Championship]] driving for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport]]. The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and began aiming for a career in [[Formula One]] four years later. He achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in Formula One with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]]. In retirement, Rosberg moved into [[Coach (sport)|driver management]], television [[pundit]]ry, and became an [[Ecopreneurship|eco-entrepreneur]]. He was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year]] and was inducted into the [[FIA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal background and
