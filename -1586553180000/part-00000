First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.

{"title_page": "Foil kite", "text_new": "[[Image:Foilkite.svg|thumb|Diagram of '''Foil Kite''']]\n\n'''Foil kites''' are soft [[Kite flying|kites]] based on the design of the [[parafoil]]. They are widely recognised as being aerodynamically inferior compared to inflatable kites. They consist of a number of cells running fore to aft, some or all of which are open at the front to allow air to inflate the kite so it takes on an [[airfoil|aerofoil]] section. Due to the amount of power that these kites can generate, they can be used for a variety of different activities including [[kitesurfing]], [[kite landboarding]], [[snowkiting]], [[kite buggying]], kite-energy systems or [[airborne wind energy]], and recreational kiting.\n\nFoil kites are flown with various line set-ups that includes 2-, 3- and 4-line systems; 2-line systems consisting of rings, wrist bands or bar compared to depowerable 4-line systems using a bar or handles. (See also: [[kite control systems]])\n\nIn order to make them suitable for use on water some foils have limited air inlets in the centre of the leading edge, with valves to keep the air in and (hopefully) the water out. Internal holes in the cell sides allow the whole kite to inflate. These kites are naturally slower to inflate than an open-fronted foil.\n\nFoils are the most efficient of the [[power kite]]s. The aerofoil section means that they can still provide significant lift when parked overhead, unlike [[leading edge inflatable kite]]s.\n\n==Development and history of foil kites==\nOne of the first popular foil-based kites was the development of a two-line power kite by Ray Merry and Andrew Jones in the early 1970s in England <ref>[http://www.cobrakite.com/flxhstry.html Flexifoil History]</ref> which became known as the ''Flexifoil'' (and later the [[Flexifoil]] company). Merry and Jones also experimented with kite pulled vehicles,<ref>[http://www.cobrakite.com/oldbggy.html Early Kite Buggy]</ref> a concept which was further developed by [[Peter Lynn]] and popular today in its current form as [[kite buggying]].\n\nThe ''Flexifoil'' kite, still sold today as a 'Stacker' has a solid carbon spar in its leading edge to maintain its shape as it flies.\n\nThe second-generation two-line parafoil was called the ''Sparless Stunter'', designed by Ted Dougherty. Development began mid-1985 and was available for sale in mid-1988. These parafoil kites were square in shape and had 6 cells. In September 1988 a 460-square-foot (43 m\u00b2) version was flown at the Ocean City Sunfest breaking the record for the World's Largest Stunt kite. In January 1989 the ''Sparless Stunter'' was introduced at the KTA show as the first totally sparless parafoil stunt kite. The Sparless Stunter saw a very brief history as kite technology evolved by May 1990 the first version of the original ''Quadrifoil'' was flown in competition at Wildwood, NJ. The first ''Quadrifoil'' was essentially two ''Sparless Stunter''s sewn together with a swept back shape. Later generations were refined into the widely known \u201cclassic.\u201d\n\nPeter Lynn introduced a similar foil-based kite in 1991 for kite traction with the Peter Lynn ''Peel''<ref>[http://www.kites.tug.com/kites/Bb+p/21.txt Peel History]</ref> - this was a completely soft foil kite without any spars.  The ''Peel'' was a popular kite traction kite in the early to mid-1990s and continued to sell into the late 1990s and was sold in sizes up to 10m\u00b2. The Peel was also a two-line kite flown in the same style as the ''Flexifoil''.\n\nThe next evolution on the foil kites for traction activities was the development of the 4-line foil kite. While 2-line kites require sometimes significant push and pull arm movement to fly (especially true the larger the kite), the development of the 4-line kite required less arm movement. 4-line kites are flown with two lines on each handle: a top line (or power line), and a bottom line (or brake line). 4-line kites can still be flown with push and pull arm movement, but if the bottom brake line is pulled in the bottom edge of the kite stalls and will cause the kite to turn on that bottom edge. This results in tighter turns with less arm movement - this is important if sitting in a [[kite buggy]].\n\nOne of the first available 4-line kites was the ''Quadrifoil'', designed by Ted Dougherty, popular as a buggy kite in the mid-1990s. The ''Quadrifoil'' in its original design became known as the 'Classic' - the kite was rectangular in shape in contrast to today's more elliptical designs. Later evolutions of the kite were sold as the Competition (more elliptical in design - C1, C3), Q2000 range, and lastly the ''Competition X'' range (XXS, XS, XM, XL and the XXL). Although these were sold under the Quadrifoil brand-name by Active People, none of these were designed by Dougherty himself.\n\nDougherty's next kite after the ''Quadrifoil'' was the ''QuadTrac'' built and sold by Skynasaur in the US<ref>[http://www.windwizard.com/bn2-3.html Buggy Newz 2.3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the mid-1990s.\n\nFollowing the success of the ''Quadrifoil'', Ray Merry (of ''Flexifoil'' fame) designed the ''Skytiger'' range of 4-line kites that was the dominant 4-line traction kite of the mid to late 1990s. This too was a rectangular design and a very solid and stable flying kite. The design was refined for more pull with the introduction of the 'Hi' series with an increased [[aspect ratio (wing)]]. Commonly available were the Hi-22, Hi-40 (3.7 metre) and the Hi-60 (5.6 metre). A Hi-80 and Hi-100 were also available although not commonly seen. The 'Hi' series was available in regular [[ripstop nylon]], or also available made from 'Icarex', a lightweight polyester material that allowed the kites to fly in much lower winds.\n\nIn Europe in the late 1990s the kite buggy scene was becoming popular and there were a large number of traction kite designs from a large number of European companies. The designs took two different directions - those that were steady and reliable in most winds and typically resistant to '[[luffing]]' in gusty or unreliable winds, and those that were tuned to produce maximum pull at the cost of stability (known as 'race kites'). In the UK in the late 1990s, the 'Predator' kite designed by Peter Mirkovic of Sky Kites<ref>[http://www.aeolian.co.uk/kites/shops/skykites.html AEOLIAN.CO.UK - Misc - Kite Shops - Shop Profile: Sky Kites<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was the most popular and successful traction kite amongst people competing in buggy races, winning the majority of races at this time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000308223218/http://www.skykites.demon.co.uk/achieve.html Achievements<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.aeolian.co.uk/kites/features/mark-kingshott.html AEOLIAN.CO.UK - Misc - Features - Mark Kingshott<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBy late 1990s/early 2000s a number of new companies entered the traction kite market that had prior experience with development of [[paraglider]]s, and used this knowledge and experience for the development of traction kites.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bow kite]]\n*[[Kite]]\n*[[Stunt kite]]\n*[[Kite surfing]]\n*[[Kite landboarding]]\n*[[Kite buggying]]\n*[[LEI kite]]\n*[[Arc kite]]\n*[[Parafoil]]\n*[[Power kite]]\n*[[Windsports]]\n*[[Kite types]]\n*[[Kite mooring]]\n*[[Kite applications]]\n\n== References ==\n*[http://www.blueskylark.org/zoo/single/paraf Parafoil kites at the Virtual Kite Zoo.]\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nautikites.net/blog/index.php?entry=entry091117-182426 Nautikites Blog (http://www.nautikites.net/blog/index.php?entry=entry091117-182426)] - The compared evolution of kitesurfing and other great air & water sports.\n* [http://www.extremekites.com.au Extreme Kites (www.ExtremeKites.com.au)] - Leading Power Kite Information Portal, Forums, Videos, Reviews, News and Galleries.\n\n{{Kites|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foil Kite}}\n[[Category:Kites]]\n[[Category:Kitesurfing]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Foilkite.svg|thumb|Diagram of '''Foil Kite''']]\n\n'''Foil kites''' are soft [[Kite flying|kites]] based on the design of the [[parafoil]].

These states can coincide with social lives and daily routines, making it more difficult to maintain.

Irritability is considered an emotion and can affect the mood in a negative way.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIrritability is associated with anxiety disorders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms/irritability.shtml|title=Irritability Anxiety Symptom|last=anxietycentre.com|website=anxietycentre.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> The fight or flight responses triggered in the brain can make irritability easily developed and result in severe grouchiness and aggravation towards other people.

It has been known that mismatch between expected and actual reward (also called \"negative prediction error\"), can lead to a state of frustration.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThis \"frustrative nonreward\" was first described by [[Abram Amsel]] in the 1950s and demonstrated in animal experiments by [[Nathan Azrin]] in 1966.<ref name=\"jama\"/> It is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved behavior linking prediction error and aggression.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nNegative prediction errors cause decreases in [[dopamine]] neuron firing. On the one hand this reduces the valuation of a stimulus, and thus helps learning, on the other hand it could increase the likelihood of aggression. Neurobiologically irritability can be adaptive and productive, motivating the living organism to overcome barriers or to dominate the environment. It can be non-productive, resulting in maladaptive behavior when prolonged or disproportionate.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThere appear to be different brain mechanisms associated irritability in children: First, irritability diminishes from toddlerhood through school age with increasing maturity of [[prefrontal cortex]]. Also, brain signatures of children with [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD), anxiety disorders, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] are similar, while they differ from those with childhood bipolar disorder.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\nCauses may range from physiological causes like sleep deprivation, hormone imbalance maladaptation to stress and poor lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} \nIrritability is a symptom in mental disorders throughout the life span, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], dementia, [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], traumatic brain injury and borderline personality disorder.<ref name=\"jama\" />\n\n== Treatments ==\nThe only US [[Food and Drug Administration]]\u2013approved medications for irritability are [[risperidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] in the context of autism. Stimulants and [[serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] are used, as well as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[parent management training]].<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nA change of lifestyle habits can assist in relieving the condition of irritability. Recommendations include reducing dietary intake of sodium and sugar. Managing sleep is crucial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/symptom/irritable-mood|title=Irritable mood: Causes, Symptoms and Diagnosis|website=www.healthline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention ==\nOffering help to others and being more sympathetic can change emotions to positive feelings.

These states can coincide with social lives and daily routines, making it more difficult to maintain. Someone is considered for to be irritable when they have a short temper and easily become frustrated in their situation and do not know how to stay calm in a pressured situation. Irritability is considered an emotion and can affect the mood in a negative way.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIrritability is associated with anxiety disorders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms/irritability.shtml|title=Irritability Anxiety Symptom|last=anxietycentre.com|website=anxietycentre.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> The fight or flight responses triggered in the brain can make irritability easily developed and result in severe grouchiness and aggravation towards other people.

It has been known that mismatch between expected and actual reward (also called \"negative prediction error\"), can lead to a state of frustration.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThis \"frustrative nonreward\" was first described by [[Abram Amsel]] in the 1950s and demonstrated in animal experiments by [[Nathan Azrin]] in 1966.<ref name=\"jama\"/> It is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved behavior linking prediction error and aggression.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nNegative prediction errors cause decreases in [[dopamine]] neuron firing. On the one hand this reduces the valuation of a stimulus, and thus helps learning, on the other hand it could increase the likelihood of aggression. Neurobiologically irritability can be adaptive and productive, motivating the living organism to overcome barriers or to dominate the environment. It can be non-productive, resulting in maladaptive behavior when prolonged or disproportionate.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThere appear to be different brain mechanisms associated irritability in children: First, irritability diminishes from toddlerhood through school age with increasing maturity of [[prefrontal cortex]]. Also, brain signatures of children with [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD), anxiety disorders, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] are similar, while they differ from those with childhood bipolar disorder.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\nCauses may range from physiological causes like sleep deprivation, hormone imbalance maladaptation to stress and poor lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} \nIrritability is a symptom in mental disorders throughout the life span, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], dementia, [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], traumatic brain injury and borderline personality disorder.<ref name=\"jama\" />\n\n== Treatments ==\nThe only US [[Food and Drug Administration]]\u2013approved medications for irritability are [[risperidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] in the context of autism. Stimulants and [[serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] are used, as well as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[parent management training]].<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nA change of lifestyle habits can assist in relieving the condition of irritability. Recommendations include reducing dietary intake of sodium and sugar. Managing sleep is crucial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/symptom/irritable-mood|title=Irritable mood: Causes, Symptoms and Diagnosis|website=www.healthline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention ==\nOffering help to others and being more sympathetic can change emotions to positive feelings.
