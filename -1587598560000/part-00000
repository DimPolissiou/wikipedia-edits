The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia.

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\".

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and [[safe house]]s, all of them maintained by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist sympathizers]] and communicated by [[word of mouth]]. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \"Conductors\" on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included [[free people of color|free-born blacks]], white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or [[manumission|manumitted]]), and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/undergroundrailroad/|title=The Underground Railroad|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-16|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Miles|first=Tiya|date=Summer 2011|title=Of Waterways and Runaways: Reflections on the Great Lakes in Underground Railroad History|magazine=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=3|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0050.320}}</ref> Church clergy and congregations of the North often played a role, especially the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]), [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]], and [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterians]], as well as the anti-slavery branches  of [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream denominations]] which split over the issue, such the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and the [[American Baptists|Baptists]].

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. In this case, the authorities were tricked into going to the regular location (station) in an attempt to intercept the runaways, while Still met them at the correct station and guided them to safety. They eventually escaped either to the North or to Canada, where slavery had been abolished during the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Still, William| title=The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts| date=1872| url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243533-the-underground-railroad?from_search=true&search_version=service_impr| asin=B00264GNTU}}</ref>\n\n===National Underground Railroad Network===\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990, in 1997, Congress passed H.R. 1635, which President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law, and which authorized the [[United States National Park Service]] to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it. The National Park Service has designated many sites within the network, posted stories about people and places, sponsors an essay contest, and holds a national conference about the Underground Railroad in May or June each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/index.htm|title=Network to Freedom Homepage|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Arrival in Canada===\n[[File:UndergroundRailroadmonumentWindsor.jpg|175px|thumb|''International Underground Railroad Memorial'' in [[Windsor, Ontario]]]]\n[[File:John Brown by Levin Handy, 1890-1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] participated in the Underground Railroad as an abolitionist.]]\n\nEstimates vary widely, but at least 30,000 slaves, and potentially more than 100,000, escaped to Canada via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"CAN\">{{cite web| url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166| work=[[Historica Minutes]]| quote=Between 1840 and 1860, more than 30,000 American slaves came secretly to Canada and freedom| title=Settling Canada Underground Railroad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106114439/http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166 |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=January 30, 2018 }}</ref> The largest group settled in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario), called [[Canada West]] from 1841.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 379</ref> Numerous [[Black Canadian]] communities developed in [[Southern Ontario]].

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\". Slavery in [[Upper Canada]] (now Ontario) was outlawed in 1793; in 1819, [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]], the Attorney General of Upper Canada, declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| title=Black History-From Slavery to Settlement| website=Archives.gov.on.ca| accessdate=June 7, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214020850/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| archivedate=February 14, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref> protect their freedom.

A report of the LEAD Fellows' Study Group on the Oil Spill (SGOS) alleges that a port expansion would lead to future damage on the maritime environment such as [[Oil spill|oil spills]] and other human [[industrial waste]] pouring into the sea, also alleging that Pakistan's laws on maritime pollution have weak penalties and lack of institutional responsibility.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Tasman Spirit Oil Spill in Retrospect: Salvaging Lessons from the Disaster : a Report of the LEAD Fellows' Study Group on the Oil Spill (SGOS).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oj7bAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Lead, Pakistan|isbn=978-969-8529-26-0}}</ref>\n\nThis sentiment was shared by Syed Fazl-E-Haider. In his publication in ''Pakistan and the Gulf Economist'', Haider put forth the argument that the sea water on the Baloch coast was pollution free due to the lack of human presence and activity.
