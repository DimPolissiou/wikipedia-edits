This case is noteworthy because the judge lists a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism that he used to determine the case:\n\nIn [[Charles Haddon-Cave]]'s findings he wrote:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Extremist Islamic positions \n118. In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Connection to Kharijites ==\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate= 2 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|date=6 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== {{visible anchor|Active Islamic extremist groups|Active_Islamic_Extremist_Groups}} ==\nSome of the proponents of [[Islam]] emphasise peaceful political processes, whereas [[Sayyid Qutb]] in particular called for violence, and those followers are generally considered '''Islamic extremists''' and their stated goal is [[Islamic revolution]] with the intent to force implementation of [[Sharia law]] and/or an [[Islamic state|Islamic State Caliphate]].\n\nThere are over 120 such groups active today.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Below is a list of major groups active.\n\n=== Groups ===\n{{Expand list|date=October 2016}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Group Name\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|Banner\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Home Base\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|Leaders\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Strength\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Casualties\n! style=\"width:35%;\"|Ideology\n|-\n| '''[[Al-Qaeda]]'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Flag of al-Qaeda.svg|90px]]\n| [[Afghanistan]] Region\n| |[[Abdallah Azzam]] (founder)<br />[[Osama bin Laden]] (1989\u20132011)<br />[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] (present)\n| 300\u20133,000<ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Roggio|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2011/04/how_many_al_qaeda_operatives_a.php |title=How many al Qaeda operatives are now left in Afghanistan? \u2013 Threat Matrix |publisher=Longwarjournal.org |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/21/al-qaeda-afghanistan-comeback_n_1997994.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023084738/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/21/al-qaeda-afghanistan-comeback_n_1997994.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 October 2012 |title=Al Qaeda in Afghanistan Is Attempting A Comeback |work=The Huffington Post |date=21 October 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2014 }}</ref>\n| 4,400 casualties <ref>{{cite web|url=http://npsglobal.org/eng/news/29-non-state-actors/1034-al-qaeda-attackss-death-toll-more-than-4400-lives.html|title=Death toll of Al Qaeda attacks: more than 4,400 lives|publisher=}}</ref>\n| To restore Islam and establish \"true Islamic states,\" implement [[Sharia law]], and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences and other teachings of Islamic author [[Sayyid Qutb]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0 |url-access=registration|quote=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam.|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press.|ref=GKJTPI2002}}</ref> The title translates to \"Organization of the Base of Jihad.\"\n|-\n| '''[[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]]'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Flag of al-Qaeda.svg|90px]]\n|  [[Kabylie|Kabylie Mountains, Algeria]]\n| [[Abdelmalek Droukdel]]\n| 800\u20131,000+<ref>{{cite web| title =Profile: Al-Qaeda in North Africa| url =https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17308138| website =BBC| date = 17 January 2013|accessdate = 2 July 2015}}</ref>\n| 200+\n| '''AQIM''' is an Islamist militant organization which aims to overthrow the  [[Algeria|Algerian government]] and institute an [[Caliphate|Islamic state]].\n|-\n| '''[[Al-Mourabitoun (militant group)|Al-Mourabitoun]]'''<br />a.k.a.

This case is noteworthy because the judge lists a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism that he used to determine the case:\n\nIn [[Charles Haddon-Cave]]'s findings he wrote:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Extremist Islamic positions \n118. In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Connection to Kharijites ==\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims.

It is situated in the historical region of [[Bukovina]]. Solca is the smallest town in the county and the third smallest town in Romania, with a population of 2,143 inhabitants, according to the 2011 census. Its name is derived from that of the river flowing through it, in turn derived from Slavic ''sol'' (\"salt\") \u2013 in reference to the area's salty springs. Solca is known for its high quality air, for being a former spa and for the beer that was manufactured here.\n\n==Geography==\nSolca is located in the central-eastern part of Suceava County, at the foot of the eastern part of Obcina Mare Mountains, in Solca-Cacica Depression. The town is situated at the border of Suceava Plateau and the Eastern Carpathians, at an average altitude of 522 metres. Solca River crosses the town. Solca is a place known for the beauty of the natural landscape and the high quality of its air.\n\nSolca borders with the following communes: [[Marginea]] (in north-west), [[Arbore]] (in north and north-east), [[Poieni-Solca]] (in south and south-east), [[Cacica]] (in south) and [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]] (in west). The town is situated at a distance of 23&nbsp;km from the city of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]], 32&nbsp;km from the town of [[Gura Humorului]], 48&nbsp;km from the city of [[Suceava]] (the county seat) and 464&nbsp;km from [[Bucharest]].\n\nThe town is celebrated for its monumental [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] church, the former Sts. Peter and Paul's Monastery (1613\u20131623), also knowns as Solca Monastery, built by Voievod (Ruling Prince) \u0218tefan Tom\u0219a II of Moldavia and closed by the Habsburgs in 1785, and a beer factory that ranks among the oldest in the country (1810). Salt springs are located in the northern forested area. Solca is also relatively close to the [[Cacica]] salt mine and the [[Arbore]] church.\n\nIn Solca there is a Romanian traditional house which dates from the 17th century. This house was transformed in museum in 1971. Other points of interest are the motel (known as Hanul Solca), the sanatorium with the summer garden, the central park, Tom\u015fa Vod\u0103 High School, the Roman Catholic Church (which dates from 1868) and Pietrele Muierilor (a monument of nature located near the town). \n\nDespite the fact it has the status of a town, Solca has a rural aspect in many areas of its. During the Communist regime, there were built around 10 apartment blocks along the two main roads that cross the town: ''Tom\u0219a Vod\u0103'' Street and ''Republicii'' Street. Solca isn't connected to the Romanian national railway system.\n\nThe town administered the village of [[Poieni-Solca]]. Following a local referendum held in August 2004, Poieni-Solca was split from the town of Solca in March 2007 and became a [[Communes of Romania|commune]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Solca vue generale.jpg|thumb|right|280px|View of the town, from the northern hill]]\nThe settlement of Solca was first mentioned in a document issued by [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Alexandru cel Bun]] on January 15, 1418. On March 7, 1502, the [[boyar]] Luca Arbore bought the village from the grandchildren of C\u00e2rstea Horae\u021b and \u015eandru Gherman. Subsequently, Metropolitan Gheorghe Movil\u0103 offers this village to the [[Sucevi\u021ba Monastery]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the village is bought by the Moldavian Prince \u015etefan Tom\u015fa II (1611\u20131615, 1621\u20131623) and he builds here a monastery (known as Sts. Peter and Paul's Monastery or Solca Monastery). In the following centuries, Solca becomes a [[market town]] for the surrounding area. \n\nIn 1775, together with the rest of Bukovina, Solca becomes part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], and is eventually part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. During this period, many German, Polish and Jewish families establish here. Solca becomes a well known summer resort, its renowned fresh air helping the settlement to develop during the following century. In 1810, one of the oldest beer factories in Romania opens in Solca. The Solca Beer becomes the main symbol of this locality.\n\nAt the initiative of doctors Eduard Beilich (1845) and Hermann Poras (1876) a sanatorium for lung diseases is opened, with an additional summer garden, so the tourism industry increases and the settlement becomes a well known spa of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Solca is the scene of [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] battles between the armies of Austria-Hungary and the [[Russian Empire]]. After 1918, Solca (along with the rest of Bukovina) becomes part of [[Kingdom of Romania]] and remains a seeking resort, especially for those with lung diseases. Solca was officially declared a town in 1926.\n \nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Solca has a period of regression. The sanatorium is turned in a chronic diseases hospital and eventually, in 2011, in an asylum for the aged. The beer factory and the summer garden are abolished, the high school decreases in prestige and quality of teaching. Today, Solca isn't a resort anymore and the main occupation of its inhabitants is agriculture.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1930 |2822\n|1948 |2212\n|1956 |2384\n|1966 |2550\n|1977 |4541\n|1992 |4762\n|2002 |4687\n|2011 |2188\n}}\n\nAccording to the 2011 census data, 2,188 inhabitants live in Solca, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, when the town had a population of 4,456 inhabitants. The main cause of the drastic population decline is that Poieni-Solca, the village administered by Solca, was split from the town in March 2007 and became a commune.\n\nSolca is the smallest town in [[Suceava County]] and the third smallest town in [[Romania]]. Only [[B\u0103ile Tu\u0219nad]] and [[Nucet]] are smaller than Solca.\n\n==Natives==\n* [[Ilie E.

Subsequently, Metropolitan Gheorghe Movil\u0103 offers this village to the [[Sucevi\u021ba Monastery]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the village is bought by the Moldavian Prince \u015etefan Tom\u015fa II (1611\u20131615, 1621\u20131623) and he builds here a monastery (known as Sts. Peter and Paul's Monastery or Solca Monastery). In the following centuries, Solca becomes a [[market town]] for the surrounding area. \n\nIn 1775, together with the rest of Bukovina, Solca becomes part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], and is eventually part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. During this period, many German, Polish and Jewish families establish here. Solca becomes a well known summer resort, its renowned fresh air helping the settlement to develop during the following century. In 1810, one of the oldest beer factories in Romania opens in Solca. The Solca Beer becomes the main symbol of this locality.\n\nAt the initiative of doctors Eduard Beilich (1845) and Hermann Poras (1876) a sanatorium for lung diseases is opened, with an additional summer garden, so the tourism industry increases and the settlement becomes a well known spa of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Solca is the scene of [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] battles between the armies of Austria-Hungary and the [[Russian Empire]]. After 1918, Solca (along with the rest of Bukovina) becomes part of [[Kingdom of Romania]] and remains a seeking resort, especially for those with lung diseases. Solca was officially declared a town in 1926.\n \nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Solca has a period of regression. The sanatorium is turned in a chronic diseases hospital and eventually, in 2011, in an asylum for the aged. The beer factory and the summer garden are abolished, the high school decreases in prestige and quality of teaching. Today, Solca isn't a resort anymore and the main occupation of its inhabitants is agriculture.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1930 |2822\n|1948 |2212\n|1956 |2384\n|1966 |2550\n|1977 |4541\n|1992 |4762\n|2002 |4687\n|2011 |2188\n}}\n\nAccording to the 2011 census data, 2,188 inhabitants live in Solca, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, when the town had a population of 4,456 inhabitants. The main cause of the drastic population decline is that Poieni-Solca, the village administered by Solca, was split from the town in March 2007 and became a commune.\n\nSolca is the smallest town in [[Suceava County]] and the third smallest town in [[Romania]]. Only [[B\u0103ile Tu\u0219nad]] and [[Nucet]] are smaller than Solca.\n\n==Natives==\n* [[Ilie E.

The film's plot was inspired by the 1972 Tamil movie ''[[Pattikada Pattanama]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThis film depicts the story of a farmer named \"Putnanja\" ([[V. Ravichandran|Ravichandran]]), living with his grandmother named Putmalli ([[Umashri]]) near [[Nanjangud]] town in [[Mysore]] district. Putnanja was a man respected by everyone in the village and was well-known to all for his kindness towards poor and backward. When Putnanja hears a news regarding arrival of Roja ([[Meena (actress)|Meena]]) to India (who went to America for studies during childhood and whom Putnanja likes and wants to marry) he rushes towards her place to propose her to marry him. When Putnanja goes and proposes her, she does not even recognize him, and suggests not to talk about their marriage in future days. Putnanja's mother-in-law wants her daughter Roja to marry a rich, educated person and hence opposes Putnanja's proposal, but his father-in-law ([[Lokesh]]) wants her daughter to marry him since he is very kind and a good man. [[Lokesh]] can't do anything he wants since he would be working as slave to his wife.\n\nOnce Putnanja proposes Roja's family to come to their village festival and spend some days with them, Taara refuses to go, but due to her daughter's stubborn she accepts to go to their village. Roja likes the tour very much and she even starts liking Ravichandran due to his kindness towards people. After returning to the city Lokesh manages to convince Roja to marry Putnanja even though her mother opposes it. As day passes Roja tries to enjoy life in village in the city manner neglecting all the rules that has to be followed in the village and one day she reaches above limit range by burning the plouge which is treated as god by the villagers. Then Putnanja slaps her for performing this event which makes Roja to leave the village. One day she comes to know that she is going to give birth to a child and she decides to take care of the child without any help from Putnanja. As soon as she gives birth to a child, Putmalli ([[Umashri]]) takes the child and goes to her village. When Roja realizes that she can't live without Putnanja and her child she rushes towards his village and both of them lead a happy life...\n\n==Cast==\n* [[V.

Furthermore, this group grows the tallest and produces very few to no flowers.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n[[Cultivar]]s can be classified by harvest time or by the depth of rhizomes into these types:\n* Pre-mature (early) cultivars are harvested before the end of July, serotinous (late) cultivars from September on and mid-serotinous or mid-matutinal cultivars are in between these harvest times. Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and therefore be sold for a higher price.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* Ad littoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} depth and are often pre-mature. They develop faster due to higher temperature in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September. Rhizomes of adlittoral cultivars are crisp and good for [[frying]] purposes. Deep cultivars grow more than {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} deep. They are often serotinous and can harvest high yield. Their rhizomes are [[starch]]-rich.<ref name=\":6\" />\nThe main popular ''Nelumbo nucifera'' cultivars in China are Elian 1, Elian 4, Elian 5, 9217, Xin 1 and 00\u201301.

Flower types differ in the number of [[petal]]s (single petals, double petals or multi-petals) and their colours range from single colour in white, yellow, pink, red to bi-colour, most often of white petals with pink tip or highlights.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Farming ===\nAbout 70% of lotus for the human consumption is produced in China. In 2005, the cultivation area in China was estimated at {{convert|300000|ha}}.<ref name=\":5\" /> A majority of lotus production takes place in managed farming systems in ponds or flooded fields like [[rice]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe most widely used system is [[crop rotation]] with rice and [[vegetable]]s. This system is applicable if the [[propagule]] (small piece of rhizome) can be planted early in the year. The rhizomes are harvested in July, after which rice can be planted into the same field.  Rice is then harvested in October. From November until March, the field stays either free, or a [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] vegetable, such as cabbage or spinach, is planted. Alternatively, the vegetable can also be planted after the [[harvest]] of lotus.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother alternative way is to not harvest the lotus [[rhizome]], although it is ripe. A terricolous vegetable is planted between the rhizomes into the [[Drainage|drained field]]. The rhizomes are then harvested next March.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nA third way is to plant lotus in ponds or fields and raise aquatic animals such as [[fish]], [[shrimp]] or [[crab]] in the same field.<ref name=\":6\" /> A more efficient use of the water for both, the [[aquatic animal]] and the lotus production, has been identified with this planting pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Assessing lotus for wastewater bioremediation|date=2009|publisher=Rural Industries Research and Development Corp|others=Seymour, Evizel., Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (Australia)|isbn=978-1741518887|location=Canberra|oclc=682913738}}</ref>\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Lotus Nelumbo nucifera Water Drops 2654px.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Lotus effect]] on ''nelumbo nucifera'' hybrid]]\n\n=== Human consumption ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Rhizomes ====\n[[File:Lotus root.jpg|thumb|Lotus [[rhizomes]]]]\n[[File:JaRenkonLotus11R.jpg|thumb|Boiled, sliced lotus roots used in various Asian cuisines]]\n\nThe rhizomes of lotus are consumed as a vegetable in Asian countries, extensively in China and Japan: sold whole or in cut pieces, fresh, frozen, or canned.

Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and therefore be sold for a higher price.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* Ad littoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} depth and are often pre-mature. They develop faster due to higher temperature in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September.

Nevertheless, he became a popular player among spectators; and, upon joining Fitzroy, when he was initially sitting by himself in the change rooms (due to this ostracism), he was befriended by [[Haydn Bunton, Sr.]] who ensured he was made welcome within the team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110679183 |title=A legend in his time. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=ACT |date=25 September 1971 |accessdate=24 August 2015 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianrules.com.au/2003stories/buntonstory.html |title=Haydn Bunton \u2013 legend and myth |last=Mansell |first=Ken |date=17 June 2003 |accessdate=9 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726052821/http://australianrules.com.au/2003stories/buntonstory.html |archivedate=26 July 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLike his close relative [[Lynch Cooper]], Nicholls was also a very capable sprinter. He competed in gift races around Victoria during the athletics seasons, and in 1928 he won both the Nyah and Warracknabeal Gifts.<ref name=\"victor\" /> Following this, the race organisers paid him an appearance fee, board and expenses to enter races.

To earn a living during the rest of the year, he [[boxing|boxed]] with [[Jimmy Sharman]]'s Boxing Troupe, a travelling sideshow in which Sharman offered his fighters for challenge against all comers.\n\nDuring World War II, Nicholls was an adept [[boomerang]] thrower, teaching that skill to some members of the United States military.

Following his mother's death he took a renewed interest in Christianity and was baptised at Northcote [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] (now Northern Community Church of Christ) in 1935. He officiated at church and hymn services as a [[lay preacher]] at the Gore Street Mission Centre in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]].\n\nIn 1941 Nicholls received his call-up notice and he joined the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|29th Battalion]] but, in 1942, at the request of the Fitzroy police, he was released from his unit to work as a [[social worker]] in the Fitzroy Aboriginal community. He cared for those trapped in [[alcohol abuse]], gambling, and other social problems, and those who were in trouble with the police. Indigenous people gathered to him and eventually the group was so large that he became the pastor of the first Aboriginal [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] in Australia. In recognition of the ministry he was already expressing, he was ordained as a minister.\n\nIn a letter to the editor, in 1953, it was noted that Opposition Leader, [[H. V.

Following his mother's death he took a renewed interest in Christianity and was baptised at Northcote [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] (now Northern Community Church of Christ) in 1935. He officiated at church and hymn services as a [[lay preacher]] at the Gore Street Mission Centre in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]].\n\nIn 1941 Nicholls received his call-up notice and he joined the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|29th Battalion]] but, in 1942, at the request of the Fitzroy police, he was released from his unit to work as a [[social worker]] in the Fitzroy Aboriginal community. He cared for those trapped in [[alcohol abuse]], gambling, and other social problems, and those who were in trouble with the police. Indigenous people gathered to him and eventually the group was so large that he became the pastor of the first Aboriginal [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] in Australia. In recognition of the ministry he was already expressing, he was ordained as a minister.\n\nIn a letter to the editor, in 1953, it was noted that Opposition Leader, [[H. V. Evatt]], had asked the Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]], on 26 February, in Federal Parliament, 'for an invitation to be extended to Capt. Reg Saunders or some other outstanding representative of the aborigines' to be included in the official [[Australia]]n contingent to the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II]]. The author suggested Nicholls, as an ordained minister, and for his community work in the areas of [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]] and [[Mooroopna, Victoria|Mooroopna]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64434531 |title=ABORIGINE FOR CORONATION?. |newspaper=[[Portland Guardian|Portland Guardian (Vic. : 1876 - 1953)]] |location=Vic. |date=16 April 1953 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |page=4 Edition: MIDDAY |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957 Nicholls became a field officer for the [[Aborigines Advancement League]]. He edited their magazine, ''Smoke Signals'', and helped draw Aboriginal issues to the attention of Government officials and the general public. He pleaded for dignity for Aboriginal people as human beings. Support for the AAL grew rapidly.\n\nNicholls helped set up hostels for Aboriginal children, holiday homes for Aboriginal people at [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] and was a founding member and Victorian Secretary of the [[Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders]] (FCAATSI). In response to protests in the 1950s and 60s for an independent, Aboriginal-run farming cooperative at [[Lake Tyers Mission]] he campaigned on their behalf, but when the board moved to close Lake Tyers, Nichols resigned his position in protest.<ref name=\"ABC\">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-21/lake-tyers-history-piece/5170896 A brief history of the Lake Tyers Aboriginal community, By Jeff Waters, ABC Radio, 21 Dec 2013]</ref>\n\nNicholls was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].<ref name=\"bio\">[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Indigenous/BIOGRAPHIES_FOR_NICHOLLS.DOC Biographies of Doug and Gladys Nicholls] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730211511/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Indigenous/BIOGRAPHIES_FOR_NICHOLLS.DOC |date=30 July 2008 }}, Council of Melbourne (accessed 14 January 2008)</ref>\n\n==Governor of South Australia==\nNicholls was appointed [[Governor of South Australia]] on 1 December 1976, on the nomination of Premier [[Don Dunstan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131798665|title=Historic, says Sir Douglas|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=2 December 1976}}</ref> He was the first non-white person to serve as the governor of an Australian state, and is the only Aboriginal person to have held viceregal office.

Siret (actually the nearby border passing point called Vic\u0219ani{{snd}}Vadul Siret) is one of the few places in Romania which provides a [[Gauge conversion|gauge change equipment]], allowing transportation without transfer.\n\nSiret is situated at the half distance between [[Chernivtsi]] and [[Suceava]], on the right banks of [[Siret River]]. The [[European route E85]] crosses the city.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Biserica Sf. Treime din Siret13.jpg|thumb|right|Holy Trinity Church (1352), one of the oldest in Romania]]\n\nDuring the period 1211\u20131225, on a hill near Siret a fortress was built by the [[Teutonic Knights]]. The town and the Teutonic castle were destroyed by the [[Tatars]] in 1241. The first document of Siret dates back to 1339, according to some historical sources. The town was the capital of the former principality of [[Moldavia]], in the late 14th{{nbsp}}century.\n\nThe Russian imperial Army occupied the town in 1770, and, as a consequence, an epidemic of [[cholera]] broke out. Together with the rest of [[Bukovina]], Siret was under the imperial rule of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) from 1775 to 1918.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Siret was captured on 3{{nbsp}}April 1944 by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]].\n\n== Religions ==\nGiven the 14th century decline of the [[Byzantine empire]] as Orthodox regional superpower-ally and Latin mendicant orders missions since the 13th century, prince [[Bogdan I of Moldavia]] obtained virtual independence in 1359 as founding ''[[voivode]]'' (autonomous prince), seeking aid and protection from [[Poland]], welcomed Latin missionaries, Francescans (founding a monastery at Siret in 1340) and Dominicans. His son and indirect successor [[La\u021bcu of Moldavia]] (1365-1373) promised Rome his and the people's conversion to Catholicism and asked [[Pope Urban V]] to send missionaries and erect a Latin diocese in his principality's capital, Siret, which happened in 1371, initially directly subject to the [[Holy See]] until 1412 when it was made suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Archbishopric of Lviv]] (Lemberg in German; now in [[Ukraine]]). This [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Siret]] started to decline in 1388 when prince [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] transferred the Moldavian voivode's capital from Siret to [[Suceava]], and was effectively suppressed, but from circa 1418, the Holy See erected another Moldavian bishopric, the [[Diocese of Baia]], which inherited its territory (1434?).\n\nThere was a Jewish community by the mid-16th century. Zionist activity began at the turn of the 20th{{nbsp}}century, a time when most of the local Jews worked in commerce. From 1912 to 1918, the mayor was Jewish and the town council included Jews. During World War{{nbsp}}I, Jews fled in advance of the Imperial Russian Army, and found their property destroyed when they returned. After the union of Bukovina with Romania, the new authorities revoked licenses for Jewish members of the free professions and removed Jewish officials from their posts. In 1930, there were 2,121 Jews or 14% of the town's population. In 1936, Baruch Hager of the [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz dynasty]] was named rabbi and opened a yeshiva. During the interwar period, there was activity by Zionist youth movements. On June{{nbsp}}20, 1941, just before Romania's [[Operation Barbarossa|entry]] into World War{{nbsp}}II, the authorities of the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime forced the Jews of Siret to march to [[Dorne\u0219ti]] before transporting them to [[Craiova]] and [[Calafat]] and finally [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]] (''see [[The Holocaust in Romania]]'').

Siret (actually the nearby border passing point called Vic\u0219ani{{snd}}Vadul Siret) is one of the few places in Romania which provides a [[Gauge conversion|gauge change equipment]], allowing transportation without transfer.\n\nSiret is situated at the half distance between [[Chernivtsi]] and [[Suceava]], on the right banks of [[Siret River]]. The [[European route E85]] crosses the city.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Biserica Sf. Treime din Siret13.jpg|thumb|right|Holy Trinity Church (1352), one of the oldest in Romania]]\n\nDuring the period 1211\u20131225, on a hill near Siret a fortress was built by the [[Teutonic Knights]]. The town and the Teutonic castle were destroyed by the [[Tatars]] in 1241. The first document of Siret dates back to 1339, according to some historical sources. The town was the capital of the former principality of [[Moldavia]], in the late 14th{{nbsp}}century.\n\nThe Russian imperial Army occupied the town in 1770, and, as a consequence, an epidemic of [[cholera]] broke out. Together with the rest of [[Bukovina]], Siret was under the imperial rule of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) from 1775 to 1918.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Siret was captured on 3{{nbsp}}April 1944 by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]].\n\n== Religions ==\nGiven the 14th century decline of the [[Byzantine empire]] as Orthodox regional superpower-ally and Latin mendicant orders missions since the 13th century, prince [[Bogdan I of Moldavia]] obtained virtual independence in 1359 as founding ''[[voivode]]'' (autonomous prince), seeking aid and protection from [[Poland]], welcomed Latin missionaries, Francescans (founding a monastery at Siret in 1340) and Dominicans. His son and indirect successor [[La\u021bcu of Moldavia]] (1365-1373) promised Rome his and the people's conversion to Catholicism and asked [[Pope Urban V]] to send missionaries and erect a Latin diocese in his principality's capital, Siret, which happened in 1371, initially directly subject to the [[Holy See]] until 1412 when it was made suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Archbishopric of Lviv]] (Lemberg in German; now in [[Ukraine]]). This [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Siret]] started to decline in 1388 when prince [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] transferred the Moldavian voivode's capital from Siret to [[Suceava]], and was effectively suppressed, but from circa 1418, the Holy See erected another Moldavian bishopric, the [[Diocese of Baia]], which inherited its territory (1434?).\n\nThere was a Jewish community by the mid-16th century. Zionist activity began at the turn of the 20th{{nbsp}}century, a time when most of the local Jews worked in commerce. From 1912 to 1918, the mayor was Jewish and the town council included Jews. During World War{{nbsp}}I, Jews fled in advance of the Imperial Russian Army, and found their property destroyed when they returned. After the union of Bukovina with Romania, the new authorities revoked licenses for Jewish members of the free professions and removed Jewish officials from their posts. In 1930, there were 2,121 Jews or 14% of the town's population. In 1936, Baruch Hager of the [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz dynasty]] was named rabbi and opened a yeshiva. During the interwar period, there was activity by Zionist youth movements. On June{{nbsp}}20, 1941, just before Romania's [[Operation Barbarossa|entry]] into World War{{nbsp}}II, the authorities of the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime forced the Jews of Siret to march to [[Dorne\u0219ti]] before transporting them to [[Craiova]] and [[Calafat]] and finally [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]] (''see [[The Holocaust in Romania]]''). Soviet troops liberated 460 Siret Jews there in 1944; 400 of them subsequently [[Aliyah|left]] for Palestine.<ref>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: Seredina-Buda-Z'', p. 1186-87.

It was born during the 90s as a music bar and began with a license for just 80 people, opened by two Spanish brothers, Deogracias lara Moreno and Antonio Lara Moreno. In 1999, two Italian promoters; Antonio Carbonaro and Andrea Pelino, joined in force, creating during the same year the Circoloco brand, which would soon become the iconic event of DC10 and would then begin it\u2019s  residency each Monday during each Ibiza season. <ref name=\"DC10Article\"/>\n\nThroughout the years, the four entrepreneurs have grown DC10 to such a level, that it has now become a reference point for the world of what the Ibiza music scene has to offer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nWith a series of investments throughout the years, they have changed the structure of the nightclub to make it a space that holds a capacity of 4000 people, which is broken down into three distinct rooms; La Terrace, The Main Room and The Open Air Garden, each of which have been divided by musical genre.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe work of the group of entrepreneurs has also led to a substantial modification of the license which now goes from a music bar to an event hall.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\u00a0\n\n==History==\n\n=== Inauguration and early years (1999\u20132000s) ===\n\nThe infamous ''Circoloco'' parties first started in July 1999. In their original format, sessions began at 6 am, as [[Space (Ibiza nightclub)|Space]]'s 24-hour Sunday session ended. Italian promoters Andrea and Antonio programmed using a roster of non-mainstream European DJs, and as awareness of the party developed, artists such as [[Danny Tenaglia]], [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]], [[Steve Lawler]] and [[Pete Tong]] were offering to play the club for free.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Lg dc10.jpg|130px|thumb|left|The old logo, showing the hangar theme of the club.]]\n[[File:DC10 Terrace 2007.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The open top floor of the club in 2007.]]\nBy the 2002 season, the club's reputation had been documented by the international dance music press. The club's reputation grew rapidly along with the resurgence of the popularity of the [[minimal techno]] genre, with many of the club's residents at the forefront of this, including Tania Vulcano, [[Luciano (DJ)|Luciano]], [[Ricardo Villalobos]], Cirillo, [[Loco Dice]], Jose De Divina and later, the Romanian trio Arpiar, Zip, Matthias Tanzmann, Jamie Jones, Clive Henry, Dan Ghenacia, Sossa, Damian Lazarus, Andrew Grant & System Of Survival. The club also attracted high-profile regular guests such as [[Richie Hawtin]], [[Josh Wink]], Magda and Dinky. At its height, it was arguably responsible for the wider birth of the European minimal techno sound that became dominant in the second half of the decade.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe club's popularity also rested on its perceived existence outside the established group of Ibiza \"superclubs\", such as [[Space (Ibiza nightclub)|Space]], [[Amnesia (nightclub)|Amnesia]], [[Privilege Ibiza]], and [[Pacha Group|Pacha]]. The underground spirit of ''Circoloco'' meant that it did not conform to the huge, polished, purpose-built corporate identities of the larger clubs, and in terms of music and atmosphere it was far closer to the warehouse and open-air raves of the [[acid house]] era.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Originally with a completely uncovered terrace (until it was covered completed in 2006) and spartan appearance, with planes flying low over the club (its location was barely a kilometre from the end of the airport runway) and clubbers of a more European make-up than bigger venues, it had a hedonistic outlook and attitude.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Luciano began his residency at DC10 in 2006.\n\n=== 2008\u20132010 seasons ===\nAfter difficulties in 2007,<ref name=\"dcnclosuresref\"/> on 6 October 2008, the venue was shut down by the Spanish authorities after previous closures and court battles with the government.  This was due mainly to the venue only having a license for 65 people (which it regularly exceeded).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The 2008 season closing party was held at [[Privilege (nightclub)|Privilege]] nightclub after the surprise closure, due to many tourists having pre-booked flights and accommodation in anticipation of the final party.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 2009, Spanish authorities levied a 300,000 euro fine and another year's closure upon the club. On 8 September 2009, rumors about the reopening of the club were confirmed by owner Andrea who announced that the club would reopen on Tuesday, 6 October for ''Circoloco'', the day the previous ban expired.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Against expectations, the club reopened in 2010 for the season on 31 May, with parties continuing every Monday (''Circoloco'') and Friday (''Pandemonium'') until closing on 4 October, reopening doors on [[New Year's Eve]] 2011.

This was due mainly to the venue only having a license for 65 people (which it regularly exceeded).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The 2008 season closing party was held at [[Privilege (nightclub)|Privilege]] nightclub after the surprise closure, due to many tourists having pre-booked flights and accommodation in anticipation of the final party.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 2009, Spanish authorities levied a 300,000 euro fine and another year's closure upon the club. On 8 September 2009, rumors about the reopening of the club were confirmed by owner Andrea who announced that the club would reopen on Tuesday, 6 October for ''Circoloco'', the day the previous ban expired.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Against expectations, the club reopened in 2010 for the season on 31 May, with parties continuing every Monday (''Circoloco'') and Friday (''Pandemonium'') until closing on 4 October, reopening doors on [[New Year's Eve]] 2011.
