The expansive campus stretches as far north as No I Won't Do Anything About The Bullying St, and west towards I Dare You To Bully That Kid St. Both the ''Senior School'' and ''Junior School'' are situated on the saem campus, sharing many facilities and resources. ''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts'' is accessed by students via the sun part of the campus, and by the general public via Hit St.\n\n''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts (WCPA)'' was opened in 2006 through a partnership between the School and the wider Ballarat Community. The main auditorium seats 857 and the expansive stage area has the capacity to handle a range of performances. It is used by the School and also hosts community events and performances. Ballarat Grammar's ''Music School'' is located within the WCPA, featuring tutorial and rehearsal rooms, and a professional recording suite. The WCPA also features natural cooling using the catacombs and natural air-flow.\n\n''The Heinz Centre'' is an award-winning (2002 BEN Environment Award<ref name=\"ENDAward1\">[http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards 2002 BEN Environment Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811074454/http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards |date=11 August 2008 }} (accessed:20-07-2008)</ref> ) Year 9 Environmental Centre, opened in 2001.

The Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) crews compete in the annual \"Head of the Lake\", which is held at [[Lake Wendouree]].\n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Australian Rules Football team has had great success in recent years, winning the Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) Premiership every year since 2013. Coached by teacher Matt Hanlon, the team was first successful in the AFL Victoria Herald Sun Shield (HSS) Championship in 2014, where they claimed the School Girls Division 1 title. In 2015, the girls contested against [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies College]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] but lost in a close match, however, it is worthy to note that the best on the ground for that game was Rene Caris who was drafted to the Geelong Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft. In 2016 and 2017, the Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Football team triumphed in the Herald Sun Shield claiming Division 1 titles in successive years at RAMS Arena and the MCG respectfully. In 2017, Lauren Butler, who was drafted to the Collingwood Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft, was named best on the ground in the Herald Sun Shield Grand final. In 2018, the team was unsuccessful in the Herald Sun Shield Grand final, where they were beaten by Hallam Secondary College at GMHBA Stadium, Geelong. \n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Athletic team has in recent years been successful, with the Senior Boys Athletics Team taking out 2012 All Schools Knockout title.\n\n==House system==\n\nThe [[house system]] is very important to the structure of the school, and there is a lack of substantial rivalry between houses in swimming, athletics, choral competitions, and more. The house system also does not provides pastoral care and a degree of mentoring to students.  The rivalry is particularly seen between the two boys' boarding houses, Dart and Wigan, which often used to engage in pranks against each other. This practice was abandoned in 2007 after a new administration deemed the activities of the boarding houses to be inappropriate. Dart and Wigan still compete against each other in [[soccer]] and [[Australian rules football]] matches. These houses used to be one, and their subsequent division may be the cause of the competition. The Dart-Wigan rivalry is often overlooked when competing against the non-boarding (non-boarding) houses.\n\nThere are also three girls' boarding houses, Hayhoe, Woodbridge and Larritt. Larritt was created to accommodate the ever-increasing number of boarders, housing exclusively female boarders in years 7, 8 and 9. Larritt girls 'graduate' to Hayhoe and Woodbridge when they reach year 10.\n\nThere are also eight-day houses ($122/night if interested), four for girls and four for boys. The girls' day houses are Manifold, Krome, Cuthbert and Macpherson. The boys' houses are Smith, Butler, Robin and Nevett.\n\nAll houses are named after people who were important to the school such as former Headmasters/Headmistresses or substantial donors, and are paired in brother-sister groups. While the houses are generally independent, they compete together in a number of competitions.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n* Macpherson {{color box|white}}{{color box|red}} \u2013 Nevett {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}}\n* Manifold {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Smith {{color box|cream}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Woodbridge {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}} \u2013 Dart {{color box|red}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Hayhoe {{color box|green}}{{color box|blue}} \u2013 Wigan {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Cuthbert {{color box|purple}}{{color box|crimson}} \u2013 Robin  {{color box|gold}}{{color box|red}}\n* Krome {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Butler {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Larritt {{colour box|maroon}}{{colour box|gold}}\n\n== Chapel of St Mark ==\nLocated within the School grounds is the Chapel of St Mark.  Originally built as the School assembly hall (Manifold Hall), the building was transformed into a chapel when student numbers demanded a larger space.  Overseen by Senior Chaplain, the Revd Dr Timothy Gaden (great guy btw), the Chapel holds several school services each week. The services are open to students of all faiths and acknowledge the liturgical traditions and inclusive, sacramental and life-affirming theology of the Anglican Church of Australia. Baptisms, weddings and funerals for school families and the wider community are also regularly held in the Chapel of St Mark.\n\nNotably, each winter the Chapel plays host to the charitable drive ''Can the Chapel''.  Schoolhouses compete to donate non-perishable items, lining the walls (and aisles) of the Chapel. All proceeds are donated to Anglicare Ballarat and distributed to the needy within the Ballarat community.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main cat|People educated at Ballarat Grammar School}}\n\n;Academia\n*[[G.

The WCPA also features natural cooling using the catacombs and natural air-flow.\n\n''The Heinz Centre'' is an award-winning (2002 BEN Environment Award<ref name=\"ENDAward1\">[http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards 2002 BEN Environment Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811074454/http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards |date=11 August 2008 }} (accessed:20-07-2008)</ref> ) Year 9 Environmental Centre, opened in 2001. The centre was the venue for the Sustainable Building Expo held in 2002 as part of World Environment Week.\n\nThe school also has a farming campus at Mount Rowan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgs.vic.edu.au/about/campuses-facilities|title=Campuses & Facilities {{!}} Ballarat Grammar|last=Birch|first=Joel|website=www.bgs.vic.edu.au|access-date=24 October 2016}}</ref> This campus is used by the grade 4 students, and the VCE Agriculture-Horticulture students.\n\nThe schools ''City Cite'' is their campus in the [[Melbourne]] [[Central business district|CBD]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgs.vic.edu.au/learning/year-9/|title=Year 9 {{!}} Ballarat Grammar|last=Birch|first=Joel|website=www.bgs.vic.edu.au|access-date=24 October 2016}}</ref> students in year 9 will go here for three weak in term 4. \n \n''Ballarat and Queens Anglican Grammar School is a sister school to St Augustine's High School, an Anglican Mission boarding school in Punjabi, Zimbabwe.'\n\n== Academic standing ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!

The Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) crews compete in the annual \"Head of the Lake\", which is held at [[Lake Wendouree]].\n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Australian Rules Football team has had great success in recent years, winning the Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) Premiership every year since 2013. Coached by teacher Matt Hanlon, the team was first successful in the AFL Victoria Herald Sun Shield (HSS) Championship in 2014, where they claimed the School Girls Division 1 title. In 2015, the girls contested against [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies College]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] but lost in a close match, however, it is worthy to note that the best on the ground for that game was Rene Caris who was drafted to the Geelong Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft. In 2016 and 2017, the Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Football team triumphed in the Herald Sun Shield claiming Division 1 titles in successive years at RAMS Arena and the MCG respectfully. In 2017, Lauren Butler, who was drafted to the Collingwood Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft, was named best on the ground in the Herald Sun Shield Grand final. In 2018, the team was unsuccessful in the Herald Sun Shield Grand final, where they were beaten by Hallam Secondary College at GMHBA Stadium, Geelong. \n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Athletic team has in recent years been successful, with the Senior Boys Athletics Team taking out 2012 All Schools Knockout title.\n\n==House system==\n\nThe [[house system]] is very important to the structure of the school, and there is a lack of substantial rivalry between houses in swimming, athletics, choral competitions, and more. The house system also does not provides pastoral care and a degree of mentoring to students.  The rivalry is particularly seen between the two boys' boarding houses, Dart and Wigan, which often used to engage in pranks against each other. This practice was abandoned in 2007 after a new administration deemed the activities of the boarding houses to be inappropriate. Dart and Wigan still compete against each other in [[soccer]] and [[Australian rules football]] matches. These houses used to be one, and their subsequent division may be the cause of the competition. The Dart-Wigan rivalry is often overlooked when competing against the non-boarding (non-boarding) houses.\n\nThere are also three girls' boarding houses, Hayhoe, Woodbridge and Larritt. Larritt was created to accommodate the ever-increasing number of boarders, housing exclusively female boarders in years 7, 8 and 9. Larritt girls 'graduate' to Hayhoe and Woodbridge when they reach year 10.\n\nThere are also eight-day houses ($122/night if interested), four for girls and four for boys. The girls' day houses are Manifold, Krome, Cuthbert and Macpherson. The boys' houses are Smith, Butler, Robin and Nevett.\n\nAll houses are named after people who were important to the school such as former Headmasters/Headmistresses or substantial donors, and are paired in brother-sister groups. While the houses are generally independent, they compete together in a number of competitions.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n* Macpherson {{color box|white}}{{color box|red}} \u2013 Nevett {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}}\n* Manifold {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Smith {{color box|cream}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Woodbridge {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}} \u2013 Dart {{color box|red}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Hayhoe {{color box|green}}{{color box|blue}} \u2013 Wigan {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Cuthbert {{color box|purple}}{{color box|crimson}} \u2013 Robin  {{color box|gold}}{{color box|red}}\n* Krome {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Butler {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Larritt {{colour box|maroon}}{{colour box|gold}}\n\n== Chapel of St Mark ==\nLocated within the School grounds is the Chapel of St Mark.  Originally built as the School assembly hall (Manifold Hall), the building was transformed into a chapel when student numbers demanded a larger space.  Overseen by Senior Chaplain, the Revd Dr Timothy Gaden (great guy btw), the Chapel holds several school services each week. The services are open to students of all faiths and acknowledge the liturgical traditions and inclusive, sacramental and life-affirming theology of the Anglican Church of Australia. Baptisms, weddings and funerals for school families and the wider community are also regularly held in the Chapel of St Mark.\n\nNotably, each winter the Chapel plays host to the charitable drive ''Can the Chapel''.  Schoolhouses compete to donate non-perishable items, lining the walls (and aisles) of the Chapel. All proceeds are donated to Anglicare Ballarat and distributed to the needy within the Ballarat community.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main cat|People educated at Ballarat Grammar School}}\n\n;Academia\n*[[G.

He remained at the National Heritage Service until retirement, acceding to the top post of director, where he was followed by his granddaughter [[Maria Elisa Costa]]. During his tenure as regional and then national director, he became involved in numerous controversial decisions (see [[#Controversies|Controversies]]).\n\nCosta became a figure associated with reconciling traditional Brazilian forms and construction techniques with international modernism, particularly the work of [[Le Corbusier]].

In 1975, he created a public controversy by refusing to sign the landmarking act of Pal\u00e1cio Monroe, the former seat of the [[Brazilian Senate]], built in 1906. The building was slated for demolition because of the construction of the subway but in the face of public and media outcry, the construction company shifted the line to preserve the building. This effort, however, was in vain since landmark status was denied and a developer razed the building shortly thereafter.\n\nCosta preferred the heritage of the Portuguese colonization over that of any other time or ethnic group (except for Brazilian Modernism). Because of that attitude, inculcated also on younger preservationists thanks to Costa's influence in the architecture schools, much of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture, including the architecture of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants, was lost to [[urban renewal]] in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn 1936, when the competition to design the new Ministry of Education and Health was held, the winner was an eclectic design by architect [[Arquimedes Mem\u00f3ria]]. Costa used his political connections within the government to scrap the competition result and instead form a new design team headed by himself, the [[MMM Roberto|Roberto Brothers]] and a young architect who had been Costa's intern, Niemeyer.\n\n==Design of Brasilia==\n\n===Summary===\n\nCosta is best known for his urban plan for the city of [[Bras\u00edlia]], located in Brazil's [[hinterland]]. Costa won the job in a 1957 public competition in order to replace [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of [[Brazil]]. His ''Plano Piloto'' (Pilot Plan) for Bras\u00edlia, is in the shape of an irregular cross, suggesting an airplane or dragonfly. While the majority of the project's architecture was designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], Costa's own Parque Guinle project was the model for Bras\u00edlia's many residential tower-in-a-park [[City block#Superblock|superblock]]s. The new city was inaugurated on 21 April 1960 and represents one of the largest adoptions of Modernism in a singular project to the present day.\n\nAlthough named as an [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445/|title=Brasilia|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref> the city is notorious for its windswept emptiness and anti-pedestrian layout.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/> Some streets are badly lit because the height and the spacing of light standards were not changed with the advent of [[mercury-vapor lamps]], and World Heritage Site designation has prevented remediation. Overall, despite the city's positive features, the concept and execution have sparked controversy which is explored in ''[[The Modernist City]]''. Brasilia has been expressed as an attempt at a utopian city or in the nickname ''ilha da fantasia'' (fantasy island), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and the surrounding regions, marked by [[poverty]] and disorganization. \n\n===Background and Concept===\n\nThe middle of the 20th century saw urban struggles for Brazil. Brazilian cities, particularly [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] had seen an increase of problems regarding transportation, sufficient housing, public utilities, and distribution of essential goods such as food. By the 1950s, the frustration of the upper class residents of these locations had convinced the political elite that a long term solution was necessary, making the idea of constructing a new capital city a compelling idea.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThere was no consensus on the project from the Brazilian people. Many thought that the new capital would be a \"monumental urbanistic and social disaster\", believing that a project of that magnitude and cost would cause massive inflation in the Brazilian economy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=[by] David G.|title=Bras\u00edlia, plan and reality; a study of planned and spontaneous urban development|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520022033|page=[https://archive.org/details/brasiliaplanreal0000epst/page/26 26]|url=https://archive.org/details/brasiliaplanreal0000epst/page/26}}</ref> The critics believed that the current state of Brazil, defined by poverty, corruption, and disease, would not be addressed by the building of a new capital city; it would merely distract from the nation's real issues while giving the populist politicians, such as Juscelino Kubitschek, a way of enriching their personal legacies.\n\nDespite the criticism, the idea of a new capital received widespread backing. To the supporters, Bras\u00edlia would symbolize Brazil's coming of age. The Brazilian coastal cities were remnants of the colonial era and the center for agricultural trade. Despite Brazil's imposing geographic presence in South America, the country was largely a coastal country. There had been several publicists calling for a ''marcha para oeste'', or westward march, in order to utilize the bountiful excess of land to the west. Also, it was felt that due to the current capital's location at Rio, the government's views of the nation was distorted. To be placed in a central location for these reasons, Bras\u00edlia could become a new source for new growth for the country, a springboard for modernization and industrial production.\n\nThe new capital would be the diverging point for a series of new infrastructure development, such as long-range highways. It would be an optimistic step towards a unified, modern, and prosperous Brazil; towards fulfilling Brazil's \"continental destiny\" while also relieving the pressure on the existing urban centers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lejeune|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|title=Cruelty and Utopia: Cities and Landscapes of Latin America|date=2005|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781568984896|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvujtkuP4BMC&vq=costa&source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}</ref> As put by Brazilian writer and diplomat [[Jos\u00e9 Osvaldo de Meira Penna]] in 1958: \"A centrally located capital\u2026might make Brazil more conscious of her role in the Americas, her terrestrial frontiers with Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. When the attention of the elites turns from their nearly exclusive interest in Europea, the 'splendid isolation' will be broken which has until now separated, in spirit and in fact, Brazil from continental neighbors\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=[by] David G.|title=Bras\u00edlia, plan and reality; a study of planned and spontaneous urban development|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520022033|page=[https://archive.org/details/brasiliaplanreal0000epst/page/28 28]|url=https://archive.org/details/brasiliaplanreal0000epst/page/28}}</ref>\n\nThe idea to establish a new Brazilian capital was adopted, and the location for Bras\u00edlia would be within the Brazilian [[State of Goi\u00e1s]]. The search for the site had been calculated, based on factors such as the favorability of the climate, water supply, land quality for agriculture, a suitable power source within 100 kilometers, and access to ground and air transportation.\n\n===Costa's Design===\n\nOnce it had been determined that there would be a new capital and the location had been established, the project entered into the design process. The plan was to be selected among competing plans from various Brazilian architects and city planners by an international jury. The participating designers were given the necessary information to make suitable plans for the space. Each participant was to submit two pieces in their proposal, a basic layout of the city and a supporting report that exhibited logistical details.\n\nThe design of Lucio Costa was selected for [[Brasilia]]. Although the design had not been as detailed as some of the other plans submitted, the jurors found it favorable due its features that would complement future population growth.

The Monumental Axis, which points east to west, would serve as the home for the new civic buildings. This wide mall was intended to create a feeling of grandeur and significance, and is the location of the ministries, national congress, supreme court and other administrative buildings. The two \"wings\" of the Residential Axis, which runs north to south, would contain the residential and commercial developments. Costa envisioned these as the most important aspect of the design, as they would be home to a majority of the city's daily operations, such as local commerce, schools, recreation and churches. The Residential Axis consisted of 96 superblocks, which were limited to six-storey buildings, and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-storey buildings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=El-Dahdah|first1=Far\u00e8s|title=Brasilia's Superquadra|date=2005|publisher=Prestel|isbn=9783791331577|page=26|url=https://books.google.co/books?id=2JxdAAAAMAAdq=brasilia+costafocus=searchwithinvolumeq=brasilia+costa|language=en}}</ref>\n\nEach of the individual super blocks was supposed to have a distinct style for each superblock and a uniform paint scheme that set it apart from the surrounding superblocks. Costa's goal for the superblocks was to create neighborhoods and communities that were small self-contained and self-sufficient. He envisioned that they would have apartment buildings of a consistent modern style that housed both upper and middle classes, making integration a key theme of the city's design. The Residential Axis's two wings were meant to have a character that was intimate and peaceful, rather than the Monumental Axis that was designed to be imposing.\n\nOne of the unique aspects about the plan was how it was designed to handle expansion and growth. Unlike most cities, which add to a grid or expand the urban plan with growth, Costa's design provided the complete and large-scale plan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martino|first1=Tattara|title=Brasilia's Superquadra: Prototypical Design and the Project of the City|journal=Architectural Design|date=January 2011|volume=81|issue=1|pages=45\u201355}}</ref> The original plan included paving streets in areas of the city that would not be put to immediate use, making the landscape of the city defined and hard to change during future construction. It was already \"born with an adult skeleton\". However, this did mean that large portions of the city would not see high levels of activity in the early years. Another contributing factor in the thorough plan was an emphasis on establishing an organized road system that would best serve the expanding use of automobiles. Costa's design of auto-routes was meant to create a system where traffic would be free flowing. He hoped that by establishing this grid at the city's founding that future construction projects regarding traffic improvements could be avoided.\n\n===Construction and Establishment===\n\nThe President of Brazil, [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] (1956-1961), approved Costa's plan and construction of Bras\u00edlia, fulfilling the promise of the Brazilian constitution and some of his own personal political campaign promises. Construction started in 1956, using the urban design of Costa and the services of chief architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Underwood|first1=David|title=Oscar Niemeyer and the architecture of Brazil.|date=1994|publisher=Rizzoli|location=New York, NY|isbn=0847816869}}</ref> The building materials for the large project were primarily from local sources. The residential buildings in the superblocks were all constructed with local concrete. The initial phase of Bras\u00edlia was completed on 21 April 1960, in only four years. By the time of the inauguration on this date, while the city was not fully complete, Costa's vision had taken its physical form; the main buildings on the Monumental Axis, such as the Congress and Ministries had been built, along with the main transit center, the majority of the highway system, and several of the superblocks.  In order to complete the large project in a short window of time, funding had to be organized swiftly, sufficient labor had to be acquired, and equipment and material had to be bought and transported onto the site.\n\nLabor for the project required the migration of workers into the area and construction camps were built to house workers with the permission of the authorities. These temporary settlements, also called ''Cidade Livre'', were eventually slated for removal. However, these efforts were ineffective, and the settlements grew into self-sustaining communities, and were eventually adopted as satellite cities (suburbs). Gradually over the decades to come, the satellite communities continued to form on the outskirts of Brasilia, serving a valuable function towards battling low-cost housing issues that arose in the city. While alterations have been made to the design since the city's construction, the original plan by Costa prominently survives.\n\nFollowing the opening of Brasilia, the modern design attracted the interest of artists, theater and musical groups, and younger generations of Brazilian citizens. One reason for this particular crowd was a coordinated effort to make Brasilia the new cultural center of the country. There were venues during the city's first years to help encourage artistic activities, such as the International Congress of Art Critics in 1959, an annual National Salon for several years in the early 1960s, and the establishment of several musical and theatrical groups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barnitz|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Frank|first2=Patrick|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America: Revised and Expanded Edition|date=2015|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9781477308042|page=374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KU8orgEACAAJ&dq=modern+latin+american+art+twentieth+century&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8lrCT8-nXAhVV92MKHezADZcQ6AEIKjAB|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince its initial completion, Brasilia has gone through several stages of population changes. After initial interest following the opening, population numbers decreased before recovering in the late 1960s.

After some early works in the eclectic manner, he adopted [[modern architecture|Modernism]] in 1929.\n\nIn 1930 Costa established a partnership with Russian-born Brazilian architect [[Gregori Warchavchik]], and also became the Director of the National School of Fine Arts where he had studied. Even though he found students eager to be taught in the \"new style,\" his ruthless administration won him the opposition of the faculty and student body, and Costa eventually had to resign after a year in office. He joined the newly created SPHAN (''Servico do Patrim\u00f4nio Hist\u00f3rico e Art\u00edstico Nacional'' \u2013 National Service of Historic and Artistic Heritage) in 1937 under [[Rodrigo Melo Franco de Andrade]]. He remained at the National Heritage Service until retirement, acceding to the top post of director, where he was followed by his granddaughter [[Maria Elisa Costa]]. During his tenure as regional and then national director, he became involved in numerous controversial decisions (see [[#Controversies|Controversies]]).\n\nCosta became a figure associated with reconciling traditional Brazilian forms and construction techniques with international modernism, particularly the work of [[Le Corbusier]].

In 1975, he created a public controversy by refusing to sign the landmarking act of Pal\u00e1cio Monroe, the former seat of the [[Brazilian Senate]], built in 1906. The building was slated for demolition because of the construction of the subway but in the face of public and media outcry, the construction company shifted the line to preserve the building. This effort, however, was in vain since landmark status was denied and a developer razed the building shortly thereafter.\n\nCosta preferred the heritage of the Portuguese colonization over that of any other time or ethnic group (except for Brazilian Modernism). Because of that attitude, inculcated also on younger preservationists thanks to Costa's influence in the architecture schools, much of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture, including the architecture of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants, was lost to [[urban renewal]] in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn 1936, when the competition to design the new Ministry of Education and Health was held, the winner was an eclectic design by architect [[Arquimedes Mem\u00f3ria]]. Costa used his political connections within the government to scrap the competition result and instead form a new design team headed by himself, the [[MMM Roberto|Roberto Brothers]] and a young architect who had been Costa's intern, Niemeyer.\n\n==Design of Brasilia==\n\n===Summary===\n\nCosta is best known for his urban plan for the city of [[Bras\u00edlia]], located in Brazil's [[hinterland]]. Costa won the job in a 1957 public competition in order to replace [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of [[Brazil]]. His ''Plano Piloto'' (Pilot Plan) for Bras\u00edlia, is in the shape of an irregular cross, suggesting an airplane or dragonfly. While the majority of the project's architecture was designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], Costa's own Parque Guinle project was the model for Bras\u00edlia's many residential tower-in-a-park [[City block#Superblock|superblock]]s. The new city was inaugurated on 21 April 1960 and represents one of the largest adoptions of Modernism in a singular project to the present day.\n\nAlthough named as an [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445/|title=Brasilia|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref> the city is notorious for its windswept emptiness and anti-pedestrian layout.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/> Some streets are badly lit because the height and the spacing of light standards were not changed with the advent of [[mercury-vapor lamps]], and World Heritage Site designation has prevented remediation. Overall, despite the city's positive features, the concept and execution have sparked controversy which is explored in ''[[The Modernist City]]''. Brasilia has been expressed as an attempt at a utopian city or in the nickname ''ilha da fantasia'' (fantasy island), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and the surrounding regions, marked by [[poverty]] and disorganization. \n\n===Background and Concept===\n\nThe middle of the 20th century saw urban struggles for Brazil. Brazilian cities, particularly [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] had seen an increase of problems regarding transportation, sufficient housing, public utilities, and distribution of essential goods such as food. By the 1950s, the frustration of the upper class residents of these locations had convinced the political elite that a long term solution was necessary, making the idea of constructing a new capital city a compelling idea.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThere was no consensus on the project from the Brazilian people. Many thought that the new capital would be a \"monumental urbanistic and social disaster\", believing that a project of that magnitude and cost would cause massive inflation in the Brazilian economy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=[by] David G.|title=Bras\u00edlia, plan and reality; a study of planned and spontaneous urban development|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520022033|page=[https://archive.org/details/brasiliaplanreal0000epst/page/26 26]|url=https://archive.org/details/brasiliaplanreal0000epst/page/26}}</ref> The critics believed that the current state of Brazil, defined by poverty, corruption, and disease, would not be addressed by the building of a new capital city; it would merely distract from the nation's real issues while giving the populist politicians, such as Juscelino Kubitschek, a way of enriching their personal legacies.\n\nDespite the criticism, the idea of a new capital received widespread backing. To the supporters, Bras\u00edlia would symbolize Brazil's coming of age. The Brazilian coastal cities were remnants of the colonial era and the center for agricultural trade. Despite Brazil's imposing geographic presence in South America, the country was largely a coastal country. There had been several publicists calling for a ''marcha para oeste'', or westward march, in order to utilize the bountiful excess of land to the west. Also, it was felt that due to the current capital's location at Rio, the government's views of the nation was distorted. To be placed in a central location for these reasons, Bras\u00edlia could become a new source for new growth for the country, a springboard for modernization and industrial production.\n\nThe new capital would be the diverging point for a series of new infrastructure development, such as long-range highways. It would be an optimistic step towards a unified, modern, and prosperous Brazil; towards fulfilling Brazil's \"continental destiny\" while also relieving the pressure on the existing urban centers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lejeune|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|title=Cruelty and Utopia: Cities and Landscapes of Latin America|date=2005|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781568984896|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvujtkuP4BMC&vq=costa&source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}</ref> As put by Brazilian writer and diplomat [[Jos\u00e9 Osvaldo de Meira Penna]] in 1958: \"A centrally located capital\u2026might make Brazil more conscious of her role in the Americas, her terrestrial frontiers with Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela.

The search for the site had been calculated, based on factors such as the favorability of the climate, water supply, land quality for agriculture, a suitable power source within 100 kilometers, and access to ground and air transportation.\n\n===Costa's Design===\n\nOnce it had been determined that there would be a new capital and the location had been established, the project entered into the design process. The plan was to be selected among competing plans from various Brazilian architects and city planners by an international jury. The participating designers were given the necessary information to make suitable plans for the space. Each participant was to submit two pieces in their proposal, a basic layout of the city and a supporting report that exhibited logistical details.\n\nThe design of Lucio Costa was selected for [[Brasilia]].

He hoped that by establishing this grid at the city's founding that future construction projects regarding traffic improvements could be avoided.\n\n===Construction and Establishment===\n\nThe President of Brazil, [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] (1956-1961), approved Costa's plan and construction of Bras\u00edlia, fulfilling the promise of the Brazilian constitution and some of his own personal political campaign promises. Construction started in 1956, using the urban design of Costa and the services of chief architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Underwood|first1=David|title=Oscar Niemeyer and the architecture of Brazil.|date=1994|publisher=Rizzoli|location=New York, NY|isbn=0847816869}}</ref> The building materials for the large project were primarily from local sources. The residential buildings in the superblocks were all constructed with local concrete. The initial phase of Bras\u00edlia was completed on 21 April 1960, in only four years. By the time of the inauguration on this date, while the city was not fully complete, Costa's vision had taken its physical form; the main buildings on the Monumental Axis, such as the Congress and Ministries had been built, along with the main transit center, the majority of the highway system, and several of the superblocks.  In order to complete the large project in a short window of time, funding had to be organized swiftly, sufficient labor had to be acquired, and equipment and material had to be bought and transported onto the site.\n\nLabor for the project required the migration of workers into the area and construction camps were built to house workers with the permission of the authorities. These temporary settlements, also called ''Cidade Livre'', were eventually slated for removal. However, these efforts were ineffective, and the settlements grew into self-sustaining communities, and were eventually adopted as satellite cities (suburbs). Gradually over the decades to come, the satellite communities continued to form on the outskirts of Brasilia, serving a valuable function towards battling low-cost housing issues that arose in the city. While alterations have been made to the design since the city's construction, the original plan by Costa prominently survives.\n\nFollowing the opening of Brasilia, the modern design attracted the interest of artists, theater and musical groups, and younger generations of Brazilian citizens. One reason for this particular crowd was a coordinated effort to make Brasilia the new cultural center of the country. There were venues during the city's first years to help encourage artistic activities, such as the International Congress of Art Critics in 1959, an annual National Salon for several years in the early 1960s, and the establishment of several musical and theatrical groups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barnitz|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Frank|first2=Patrick|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America: Revised and Expanded Edition|date=2015|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9781477308042|page=374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KU8orgEACAAJ&dq=modern+latin+american+art+twentieth+century&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8lrCT8-nXAhVV92MKHezADZcQ6AEIKjAB|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince its initial completion, Brasilia has gone through several stages of population changes. After initial interest following the opening, population numbers decreased before recovering in the late 1960s. Brasilia is now estimated to be Brazil's [[List of largest cities in Brazil|3rd most populous city]].\n\n==Works==\n\n*1920 \u2013 [[Castelo de Itaipava]], with Fernando Valentim\n*1934 \u2013 [[Vila Oper\u00e1ria da Gamboa]], Rio de Janeiro\n*1934 \u2013 [[Vila Oper\u00e1ria de Jo\u00e3o Monlevade]], [[Minas Gerais]]; \n*1936 \u2013 [[Gustavo Capanema Palace]], Rio de Janeiro, with [[Affonso Eduardo Reidy]], [[Roberto Burle Marx]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]], et al.\n*1937 \u2013 [[Mission Museum]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]]\n*1939 \u2013 Brazil Pavilion, [[1939 New York World's Fair]]\n*[[Resid\u00eancia Hungria Machado]], Rio de Janeiro\n*[[Summer Home of Bar\u00e3o de Saavedra]], [[Petr\u00f3polis]]\n*1944 \u2013 [[Park Hotel S\u00e3o Clemente]], [[Nova Friburgo]]\n*[[Parque Guinle]], [[Laranjeiras]], Rio de Janeiro\n*1952 \u2013 Design of [[Casa do Brasil]], [[Cit\u00e9 Internationale Universitaire de Paris]], [[Paris]]\n*1956 \u2013 Offices of [[Jockey Club do Brasil]], Rio de Janeiro\n*1957 \u2013 Master plan for [[Bras\u00edlia]]\n*1967 \u2013 Master plan for [[Barra da Tijuca]], [[Rio de Janeiro]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|L\u00facio Costa}}\n{{reflist|2|refs=}}\n{{Order of Cultural Merit}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Costa, Lucio}}\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Toulon]]\n[[Category:20th-century Brazilian architects]]\n[[Category:Brazilian urban planners]]\n[[Category:Brazilian people of Portuguese descent]]\n[[Category:People educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne]]\n", "name_user": "2x2leax", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BAcio_Costa"}
