At restaurants, the soups are followed by an appetizer such as [[herring]] (prepared in either cream, oil, or in [[aspic]]); or other cured meats and vegetable salads. The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as [[roast]], [[kotlet schabowy|breaded pork cutlet]], or chicken, with a [[coleslaw]]-like ''sur\u00f3wka'' {{IPA-pl|su\u02c8rufka|}}, shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, [[Searing|seared]] beetroot) or [[sauerkraut]].

It was known above all for abundant use of salt from [[Wieliczka Salt Mine|Wieliczka]] and permanent presence of [[groat (grain)|groat]]s (''[[kasza]]''). A high calorific value of dishes and drinking [[Beer in Poland|beer]] or [[Mead in Poland|mead]] as a basic drink  was typical of Middle Ages Polish cuisine.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] the cuisine of [[Poland]] was heavy and spicy. Two main ingredients were meat (both [[game (food)|game]] and beef) and cereal. The latter consisted initially of [[proso millet]], but later in the Middle Ages other types of cereal became widely used. Most commoners did not use bread and instead consumed cereals in the forms of kasza or various types of [[flatbread]], some of which (for instance [[ko\u0142acz]]) are considered traditional recipes even in the 21st century. Apart from cereals, a large portion of the daily diet of mediaeval Poles consisted of beans, mostly [[Vicia faba|broad beans]] and [[pea]]s. As the territory of Poland was densely forested, usage of [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], forest berries, nuts and wild honey was also widespread. Among the delicacies of the Polish nobility were honey-braised [[bear]] paws served with [[horseradish]]-flavoured salad (now species protected in Poland), smoked bear tongue and bear [[Curing (food preservation)|bacon]].<ref name=\"Strybel-350\">Robert Strybel, Maria Strybel.

Although native vegetable foods were an ancient and intrinsic part of the cuisine, this began a period in which vegetables like [[lettuce]], [[leek]]s, [[celeriac]] and [[cabbage]] were more widely used. Even today, some of those vegetables are referred to in [[Polish language|Polish]] as ''w\u0142oszczyzna'', a word derived from ''W\u0142ochy'', the Polish name of [[Italy]]. During this period the use of spices, which arrived in Poland via Western Asian trade routes, was common among those who could afford them, and dishes considered elegant could be very spicy. However, the idea that Queen Bona was the first to introduce vegetables to Poland is false. While her southern cooks may have helped elevate and expand the role of various vegetables in royal Polish cuisine, records show that the court of king [[Jogaila]] (in Polish W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, who died in 1434, over 80 years before her reign) enjoyed a variety of vegetables including lettuce, beets, cabbage, turnip, carrots, peas and cauliflower.\n[[File:07715 ogorki kiszone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Og\u00f3rki kiszone]] (pickled cucumbers) without vinegar]]\n\nPolish-style [[pickled cucumber]] (''og\u00f3rek kiszony'') is a variety developed in the northern part of [[Central Europe]]. It has been exported worldwide and is found in the cuisines of many countries. It is usually preserved in wooden barrels. A cucumber only pickled for a few days is different in taste (less sour) than one pickled for a longer time and is called og\u00f3rek ma\u0142osolny, which means \"lightly salted cucumber\". Another kind of pickled cucumber, popular in [[Poland]], is ''og\u00f3rek konserwowy'' (preserved cucumber) which is preserved with vinegar rather than pickled and uses different spices creating a sweet and sour taste.\n\nThe only indisputable fact is that the court of Queen Bona was fed in an Italian fashion, because she exclusively employed Italian cooks, some of whom were originally hired to prepare parties for aristocratic families but who were soon serving typical Italian dishes as part of the court's daily menus. Court records show that Queen Bona imported large volumes of southern European, American and Western Asian fruits (oranges, lemons, pomegranates, olives, figs, tomatoes), vegetables (potatoes and corn), nuts (chestnuts, raisins and almonds, including [[marzipan]]), along with grains (such as rice), cane sugar and Italian olive oil. The court also imported various herbs and spices including black pepper, fennel, saffron, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon.<ref name=\"wplywy\">{{cite web | url=http://newsgastro.pl/jerzy-pasikowski-radzi/88908-wpywy-kuchni-innych-narodow-na-ksztat-kuchni-polskiej.html | title=Wp\u0142ywy kuchni innych narod\u00f3w na kszta\u0142t kuchni polskiej (Influences of cuisines of other nations in Polish cuisine) | publisher=Portal Gastronomiczny NewsGastro | year=2011 | accessdate=July 16, 2011 | author=Jerzy Pasikowski | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327182357/http://newsgastro.pl/jerzy-pasikowski-radzi/88908-wpywy-kuchni-innych-narodow-na-ksztat-kuchni-polskiej.html | archivedate=March 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth===\nUntil the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] perpetrated by the neighbouring empires, [[Poland]] was one of the largest countries in the world, and encompassed many regions with their own, distinctive culinary traditions.<ref name=\"wplywy\" /> Two consecutive Polish kings, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] and [[John II Casimir]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Jan II Kazimierz Waza) married the same French Duchess, [[Marie Louise Gonzaga]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Ludwika Maria), daughter of [[Charles I, Duke of Mantua]]; persecuted by King [[Louis XIII of France]] for her affiance to his opponent [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]].

In the mid-18th century on Polish tables appeared the French [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]].<ref name=\"wplywy\" /> Also, among the most influential in that period were [[Lithuanian cuisine|Lithuanian]], [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[German cuisine|German]] and [[Hungarian cuisine]], not to mention [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], which arrived in Poland before the 17th century along with many settlers especially in the south-eastern part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]].<ref name=\"wplywy\" /> Signature dishes of the Western Asia reached Polish tables thanks to the Armenian trade and cultural exchange with Poland's neighbour - the Ottoman Empire. Rare delicacies were brought to royal court as gifts from sultans and royal envoys. The strongest influences were noted in the cities of [[Lw\u00f3w]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Kamieniec Podolski]] and [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]] due to many Armenians living there permanently.<ref name=\"wplywy\" /> Also, because of the close contact with the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[coffee]] (''kawa'') and [[boza]] became popular.\n\nWith the subsequent decline of [[Poland]], and the grain production crisis that followed [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]], potatoes began to replace the traditional use of cereal.\nThe oldest surviving Polish cook-book, ''[[Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw]]'' (\"Collection of Dishes\") by [[Stanis\u0142aw Czerniecki]] was published in Krak\u00f3w in 1682.<ref>Robert Strybel, Maria Strybel.

This included [[Russian cuisine|Russian]] and [[German cuisine|German]] cuisines, but also the culinary traditions of most nations of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empire. The 19th century also saw the creation of many Polish cookbooks, by Jan Szyttler, [[Anna Ciundziewicka]], Wincenta Zawadzka, [[Lucyna \u0106wierczakiewiczowa]] and others.\n\n===After World War II===\n[[File:Pierogi in london feb 10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Most enduring of Polish culinary traditions are the [[pierogi]], a national dish of Poland, originating in the ancient culinary traditions of the former Polish eastern territories ([[Kresy]])<ref>\"Jako zakonnik \u015awi\u0119ty Jacek dzia\u0142a\u0142 w Polsce i na Rusi, by\u0142 tak\u017ce przeorem w Kijowie, a stamt\u0105d w\u0142a\u015bnie przysz\u0142y do nas wigilijne pierogi, knysze, kulebiaki. ...\" [in:] Helena Szymanderska. Polska wigilia. 2000</ref>]]\nAfter the end of [[World War II]], [[Poland]] fell under Soviet / Communist occupation. Some restaurants were [[nationalization|nationalized]]. The communists envisioned a net of [[lunch room]]s called \"bufet\" for the workers at various companies, and [[Bar mleczny|milk bars]] for the public. The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace lunch rooms promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups of all kinds, meatballs and pork chops, and staples such as placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), placki z jablkami (apple pancakes), kopytka (potato gnocchi), leniwe (farmer's cheese gnocchi served sweet) and [[pierogi]]. A typical second course consisted of meat [[cutlet]] served with potatoes or buckwheat and \"sur\u00f3wka\" (raw, julienned vegetables). The popular Polish ''kotlet schabowy'' is a [[breaded cutlet]] similar to the Austrian [[Wiener schnitzel]] and the Italian and Spanish [[Milanesa]].\n\nWith time, the [[shortage economy]] led to scarcity of [[meat]], [[coffee]], [[tea]] and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like [[chocolate]], [[sugar]] and meat were rationed, with a specific limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, so much of the food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine.<ref>[http://culture.pl/en/article/10-surprising-eating-habits-from-the-communist-regime-era 10 Surprising Eating Habits from the Communist-Regime Era|Culture.pl]</ref> Tropical fruits (citrus, [[banana]], [[pineapple]], etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, [[cabbage]], root vegetables and frozen products. Other food products (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices.\n\nThis situation led in turn to gradual replacement of traditional Polish cuisine with food prepared from anything available at the moment. Among the popular dishes introduced by the public restaurants was \"kotlet mielony\"'' meatball'', a sort of a [[hamburger]] often served with beet puree and fresh carrots. The traditional recipes were mostly preserved during the [[Wigilia]] feast ([[Christmas Eve]]), for which many families tried to prepare 12 traditional courses.\n\nA popular form of fish dish was, and still is, [[paprykarz szczeci\u0144ski]] from the city of [[Szczecin]], usually added to sandwiches.\n[[File:Polish \"Zapiekanka\".jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Zapiekanka]], a baguette with melted cheese, meat, mushrooms, onions and ketchup. A popular [[street food]] to this day which originated in the 1970s]]\n\n===Modern era===\nWith the [[fall of communism in Poland]] in 1989, a wave of new restaurants opened and the basic foodstuffs were once again easily obtainable. This led to a gradual return of rich traditional Polish cuisine, both in home cooking and in restaurants. At the same time, restaurants and supermarkets promoted the use of ingredients typical of other cuisines of the world. Among the most notable foods that started to become common in Poland were [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]]s, [[zucchini]] and all kinds of fish. During communist times, these were available fresh mostly in the seaside regions.\n\nRecent years have seen the advent of a [[slow food]] movement, and a number of [[TV]] programmes devoted to other cuisine and as well as traditional Polish cuisine have gained popularity. In 2011 a nostalgic cookbook (written in English) combining a child's memories growing up in the [[Gierek]] era with traditional Polish recipes was published in [[London]].<ref>Rose Petal Jam - Recipes and Stories from a Summer in Poland, by Beata Zatorska and [[Simon Target]], published by Tabula Books 2011</ref><ref>Rzeczpospolita {{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/636290.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004130611/http://www.rp.pl/artykul/636290.html |archivedate=October 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAmerican food in Poland, most commonly [[McDonald's]], [[KFC]] and [[Pizza Hut]], are declining in popularity as [[Poles|Polish]] people prefer their own cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Meanwhile, [[Doner kebab]]s are gaining popularity.

Traditional Polish doughnuts are filled with rose petal jam, plum jam or apple and covered with icing with orange peel or powdered with [[icing sugar]]. Fat Thursday used to mark the beginning of a \"Fat Week\", a period of great gluttony during which Polish ancestors consumed dishes served with ''smalec'' (lard), bacon and all kinds of meat.\n\nThe original doughnuts, popular until the 16th century, were made of the same dough as bread, would be filled with pork and fried on ''smalec''.

It has been an essential part of them both for centuries. Today bread remains one of the most important foods in the Polish cuisine. The main ingredient for Polish bread is [[rye]] or [[wheat]]. Traditional bread has a crunchy crust, is soft but not too soft inside, and has unforgettable aroma. Such bread is made with [[sourdough]], which lends it a distinctive taste. It can be stored for a week or so without getting too hard and is not crumbly when cut.\n\nIn Poland, welcoming with bread and salt (\"''chlebem i sol\u0105''\") is often associated with the traditional hospitality (\"''staropolska go\u015bcinno\u015b\u0107''\") of the Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]''), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century [[Polish poet]], [[Wespazjan Kochowski]], wrote in 1674: \"O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!\"<!--\"O dobry\u017c chleb, gdy jest z sol\u0105 dany go\u015bciom z dobr\u0105 wol\u0105\"--> Another poet who mentioned the custom was [[Wac\u0142aw Potocki]].[http://www.republika.pl/o_chlebie/potocki.html] The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish [[proverb]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130517011924/http://www.culture.pl/kalendarz-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/L6vx/content/chlebem-i-sola-dawne-uczty-polskie chlebem-i-sola-dawne-uczty-polskie]</ref> Nowadays, the tradition is mainly observed on wedding days, when newlyweds are greeted with bread and salt by their parents on returning from the church [[wedding]].\n\n==Desserts and sweets==\n{{Main|List of Polish desserts}}\n[[File:Bejgli1.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Poppy seed roll|Makowiec]] (poppy seed roll)]]\n[[File:06872 tradition of cakes in Sanok, 2011.png|thumb|right|190px|[[Cheesecake|Sernik]] (cheesecake)]]\n[[File:Kremowki dwie.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Napoleonka]] (cream pie)]]\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski]] (apple croissant)]]\n* ''[[Poppy seed roll|Makowiec]]'' - Sweet poppy-seed swirl cake, with raisins and walnuts.\n* ''[[Racuchy]]'' - Small pancakes often stuffed with apples and served with [[powdered sugar]].\n* ''[[P\u0105czki|P\u0105czek]]'' - Closed donut filled with rose petal jam or other fruit conserves.\n* ''[[Pierniki]]'' - Soft gingerbread shapes iced or filled with marmalade of different fruit flavours and sometimes covered with chocolate.\n* ''[[Cheesecake|Sernik]]'' - Sernik ([[powdered sugar|cheesecake]]) is one of the most popular desserts in Poland.

At restaurants, the soups are followed by an appetizer such as [[herring]] (prepared in either cream, oil, or in [[aspic]]); or other cured meats and vegetable salads.

It was known above all for abundant use of salt from [[Wieliczka Salt Mine|Wieliczka]] and permanent presence of [[groat (grain)|groat]]s (''[[kasza]]''). A high calorific value of dishes and drinking [[Beer in Poland|beer]] or [[Mead in Poland|mead]] as a basic drink  was typical of Middle Ages Polish cuisine.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] the cuisine of [[Poland]] was heavy and spicy. Two main ingredients were meat (both [[game (food)|game]] and beef) and cereal. The latter consisted initially of [[proso millet]], but later in the Middle Ages other types of cereal became widely used. Most commoners did not use bread and instead consumed cereals in the forms of kasza or various types of [[flatbread]], some of which (for instance [[ko\u0142acz]]) are considered traditional recipes even in the 21st century. Apart from cereals, a large portion of the daily diet of mediaeval Poles consisted of beans, mostly [[Vicia faba|broad beans]] and [[pea]]s. As the territory of Poland was densely forested, usage of [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], forest berries, nuts and wild honey was also widespread. Among the delicacies of the Polish nobility were honey-braised [[bear]] paws served with [[horseradish]]-flavoured salad (now species protected in Poland), smoked bear tongue and bear [[Curing (food preservation)|bacon]].<ref name=\"Strybel-350\">Robert Strybel, Maria Strybel.

Although native vegetable foods were an ancient and intrinsic part of the cuisine, this began a period in which vegetables like [[lettuce]], [[leek]]s, [[celeriac]] and [[cabbage]] were more widely used. Even today, some of those vegetables are referred to in [[Polish language|Polish]] as ''w\u0142oszczyzna'', a word derived from ''W\u0142ochy'', the Polish name of [[Italy]]. During this period the use of spices, which arrived in Poland via Western Asian trade routes, was common among those who could afford them, and dishes considered elegant could be very spicy. However, the idea that Queen Bona was the first to introduce vegetables to Poland is false. While her southern cooks may have helped elevate and expand the role of various vegetables in royal Polish cuisine, records show that the court of king [[Jogaila]] (in Polish W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, who died in 1434, over 80 years before her reign) enjoyed a variety of vegetables including lettuce, beets, cabbage, turnip, carrots, peas and cauliflower.\n[[File:07715 ogorki kiszone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Og\u00f3rki kiszone]] (pickled cucumbers) without vinegar]]\n\nPolish-style [[pickled cucumber]] (''og\u00f3rek kiszony'') is a variety developed in the northern part of [[Central Europe]]. It has been exported worldwide and is found in the cuisines of many countries. It is usually preserved in wooden barrels. A cucumber only pickled for a few days is different in taste (less sour) than one pickled for a longer time and is called og\u00f3rek ma\u0142osolny, which means \"lightly salted cucumber\". Another kind of pickled cucumber, popular in [[Poland]], is ''og\u00f3rek konserwowy'' (preserved cucumber) which is preserved with vinegar rather than pickled and uses different spices creating a sweet and sour taste.\n\nThe only indisputable fact is that the court of Queen Bona was fed in an Italian fashion, because she exclusively employed Italian cooks, some of whom were originally hired to prepare parties for aristocratic families but who were soon serving typical Italian dishes as part of the court's daily menus. Court records show that Queen Bona imported large volumes of southern European, American and Western Asian fruits (oranges, lemons, pomegranates, olives, figs, tomatoes), vegetables (potatoes and corn), nuts (chestnuts, raisins and almonds, including [[marzipan]]), along with grains (such as rice), cane sugar and Italian olive oil.

Marie Louise arrived in Warsaw in 1646, was widowed, and married again in 1649. Ludwika brought along with her a court full of Frenchmen including courtiers, secretaries, army officers, physicians, merchants, craftsmen, as well as many cooks. \n[[File:Bigos polonia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bigos]] (hunter's stew), Polish national dish with various cuts of meat and sausages, cabbage, sauerkraut, often whole or pur\u00e9ed tomatoes, honey and mushrooms]]\n\nRecords show that her visiting guests were entertained with the following fowl: [[waxwing]]s, [[fieldfare]]s, [[snow bunting]], [[hazel grouse]], [[partridge]]s, [[black grouse]], [[capercaillie]]s, forest game, fish and molluscs [[loach]], [[trout]]s, [[grayling (species)|grayling]], [[salmon]] fresh and smoked, [[flounder]]s, salted [[herring]], [[lamprey]]s in vinegar, [[oyster]]s, [[snail]]s, and Genoese p\u00e2t\u00e9, not to mention fresh fruit and [[chestnut]]s.

The royal court with all its innovations exerted a broad influence over the rest of aristocratic residences and noble palaces across Poland.

The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace lunch rooms promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups of all kinds, meatballs and pork chops, and staples such as placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), placki z jablkami (apple pancakes), kopytka (potato gnocchi), leniwe (farmer's cheese gnocchi served sweet) and [[pierogi]]. A typical second course consisted of meat [[cutlet]] served with potatoes or buckwheat and \"sur\u00f3wka\" (raw, julienned vegetables). The popular Polish ''kotlet schabowy'' is a [[breaded cutlet]] similar to the Austrian [[Wiener schnitzel]] and the Italian and Spanish [[Milanesa]].\n\nWith time, the [[shortage economy]] led to scarcity of [[meat]], [[coffee]], [[tea]] and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like [[chocolate]], [[sugar]] and meat were rationed, with a specific limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, so much of the food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine.<ref>[http://culture.pl/en/article/10-surprising-eating-habits-from-the-communist-regime-era 10 Surprising Eating Habits from the Communist-Regime Era|Culture.pl]</ref> Tropical fruits (citrus, [[banana]], [[pineapple]], etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, [[cabbage]], root vegetables and frozen products. Other food products (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices.\n\nThis situation led in turn to gradual replacement of traditional Polish cuisine with food prepared from anything available at the moment. Among the popular dishes introduced by the public restaurants was \"kotlet mielony\"'' meatball'', a sort of a [[hamburger]] often served with beet puree and fresh carrots. The traditional recipes were mostly preserved during the [[Wigilia]] feast ([[Christmas Eve]]), for which many families tried to prepare 12 traditional courses.\n\nA popular form of fish dish was, and still is, [[paprykarz szczeci\u0144ski]] from the city of [[Szczecin]], usually added to sandwiches.\n[[File:Polish \"Zapiekanka\".jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Zapiekanka]], a baguette with melted cheese, meat, mushrooms, onions and ketchup. A popular [[street food]] to this day which originated in the 1970s]]\n\n===Modern era===\nWith the [[fall of communism in Poland]] in 1989, a wave of new restaurants opened and the basic foodstuffs were once again easily obtainable. This led to a gradual return of rich traditional Polish cuisine, both in home cooking and in restaurants. At the same time, restaurants and supermarkets promoted the use of ingredients typical of other cuisines of the world. Among the most notable foods that started to become common in Poland were [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]]s, [[zucchini]] and all kinds of fish. During communist times, these were available fresh mostly in the seaside regions.\n\nRecent years have seen the advent of a [[slow food]] movement, and a number of [[TV]] programmes devoted to other cuisine and as well as traditional Polish cuisine have gained popularity. In 2011 a nostalgic cookbook (written in English) combining a child's memories growing up in the [[Gierek]] era with traditional Polish recipes was published in [[London]].<ref>Rose Petal Jam - Recipes and Stories from a Summer in Poland, by Beata Zatorska and [[Simon Target]], published by Tabula Books 2011</ref><ref>Rzeczpospolita {{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/636290.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004130611/http://www.rp.pl/artykul/636290.html |archivedate=October 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAmerican food in Poland, most commonly [[McDonald's]], [[KFC]] and [[Pizza Hut]], are declining in popularity as [[Poles|Polish]] people prefer their own cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Meanwhile, [[Doner kebab]]s are gaining popularity.

Traditional Polish doughnuts are filled with rose petal jam, plum jam or apple and covered with icing with orange peel or powdered with [[icing sugar]]. Fat Thursday used to mark the beginning of a \"Fat Week\", a period of great gluttony during which Polish ancestors consumed dishes served with ''smalec'' (lard), bacon and all kinds of meat.\n\nThe original doughnuts, popular until the 16th century, were made of the same dough as bread, would be filled with pork and fried on ''smalec''.

It has been an essential part of them both for centuries. Today bread remains one of the most important foods in the Polish cuisine. The main ingredient for Polish bread is [[rye]] or [[wheat]]. Traditional bread has a crunchy crust, is soft but not too soft inside, and has unforgettable aroma. Such bread is made with [[sourdough]], which lends it a distinctive taste. It can be stored for a week or so without getting too hard and is not crumbly when cut.\n\nIn Poland, welcoming with bread and salt (\"''chlebem i sol\u0105''\") is often associated with the traditional hospitality (\"''staropolska go\u015bcinno\u015b\u0107''\") of the Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]''), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century [[Polish poet]], [[Wespazjan Kochowski]], wrote in 1674: \"O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!\"<!--\"O dobry\u017c chleb, gdy jest z sol\u0105 dany go\u015bciom z dobr\u0105 wol\u0105\"--> Another poet who mentioned the custom was [[Wac\u0142aw Potocki]].[http://www.republika.pl/o_chlebie/potocki.html] The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish [[proverb]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130517011924/http://www.culture.pl/kalendarz-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/L6vx/content/chlebem-i-sola-dawne-uczty-polskie chlebem-i-sola-dawne-uczty-polskie]</ref> Nowadays, the tradition is mainly observed on wedding days, when newlyweds are greeted with bread and salt by their parents on returning from the church [[wedding]].\n\n==Desserts and sweets==\n{{Main|List of Polish desserts}}\n[[File:Bejgli1.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Poppy seed roll|Makowiec]] (poppy seed roll)]]\n[[File:06872 tradition of cakes in Sanok, 2011.png|thumb|right|190px|[[Cheesecake|Sernik]] (cheesecake)]]\n[[File:Kremowki dwie.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Napoleonka]] (cream pie)]]\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski]] (apple croissant)]]\n* ''[[Poppy seed roll|Makowiec]]'' - Sweet poppy-seed swirl cake, with raisins and walnuts.\n* ''[[Racuchy]]'' - Small pancakes often stuffed with apples and served with [[powdered sugar]].\n* ''[[P\u0105czki|P\u0105czek]]'' - Closed donut filled with rose petal jam or other fruit conserves.\n* ''[[Pierniki]]'' - Soft gingerbread shapes iced or filled with marmalade of different fruit flavours and sometimes covered with chocolate.\n* ''[[Cheesecake|Sernik]]'' - Sernik ([[powdered sugar|cheesecake]]) is one of the most popular desserts in Poland.

Tea is usually served with a slice of lemon and sweetened with either sugar or honey.

[[Kvass]] is also consumed in parts of Poland, especially in the east. Even though not as popular, it is increasingly being sold in bars and restaurants. It is typically made from rye bread, usually known as [[black bread]], and is not classified as an alcoholic beverage in Poland, as its alcohol content usually ranges from 0.5-1% or 1-2 proof. There are many variations of the drink, however, a traditional Polish recipe exists.<ref>http://sigma-not.net/download.php?token=xd75ad42df2385c74a075712318d1b5fc</ref><ref>https://kuchnia.wp.pl/co-warto-wiedziec-o-kwasie-chlebowym-6054630961177729g/2</ref><ref>http://weekend.gazeta.pl/weekend/1,152121,16109091,Zdrowe_orzezwienie__Powraca_moda_na_kwas_chlebowy.html</ref> Frequently consumed beverages also include: [[buttermilk]], [[kefir]], [[soured milk]], [[instant coffee]], various [[mineral water]]s, [[juice]]s and numerous brands of [[soft drink]].\n\n==Lists of common Polish dishes found on a national level==\n* [[List of Polish cuisine dishes#Soups|List of common Polish soups]]\n* [[List of Polish cuisine dishes#Main course|Common main courses]]\n* [[List of Polish cuisine dishes#Dessert|Common desserts]]\n* [[List of Polish cuisine dishes#Beverages|Common beverages]]\n* [[List of Polish cuisine dishes#Folk medicine|Common folk medicine]]\n\n==Selected ingredients==\n* ''Kapusta kiszona'' - [[sauerkraut]]\n* ''[[polish style pickled cucumber|Og\u00f3rek kiszony]]'' - salted sour [[cucumber]], a [[Pickling|pickle]] prepared in a similar way to ''sauerkraut''\n* ''[[kielbasa|Kie\u0142basa]]'' - Polish sausage, comes in a wide variety of versions\n* ''[[smetana (dairy product)|\u015amietana]]'' - sour cream\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[List of Polish desserts]]\n* [[List of Polish dishes]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Cuisine of Poland}}\n{{wikiquote|Food and drink in Pan Tadeusz}}\n* [http://www.polishmeals.com Polish traditional meals with video recipes]\n* [http://www.polishdeli.info/polish,cuisine.php Short summary of the Polish Cuisine]\n* [http://culture.pl/en/tag/culinary-art-0 Polish Culinary Art]\n\n{{Poland topics}}\n{{Polish cheeses}}\n{{European topic|| cuisine}}\n{{cuisine}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Polish Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Polish cuisine| ]]\n", "name_user": "GalacticShoe", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor formatting change.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_cuisine"}
{"title_page": "Cornelius Herz", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=August 2010}}\n[[File:Corn\u00e9lius Herz.jpg|thumb|Corn\u00e9lius Herz in 1893]]\n'''Cornelius Herz'''  (formerly written ''Hertz'') was born in Besan\u00e7on, France on September 3, 1845 and he died in Bournemouth, England on July 6, 1898. He was a French-American doctor, electrician, businessman and famous politician of Jewish [[Germans|German]] descent, implicated in the [[Panama scandals]].\n\n==Personal life==\nCornelius\u2019s [[Germany|German]] parents, Adelaide (n\u00e9e Friedmann from [[Bavaria]]) and Leopold Herz, emigrated from [[Hesse]] to the United States in 1848. They settled in the State of New York and by 1853 they had all become naturalized American citizens in New York City. Cornelius entered the [[New York University|College of the City of New York]] in 1858 and in 1861 he was a lieutenant in the United States army. He graduated with honours from the College of the City of New York in 1864. With a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts, he went to study at the Universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and of [[University of Paris|Paris]]. After matriculating at the School of Medicine of Paris, he became surgeon-major on the staff of General Chanzy in the French army of the Loire when the Franco-German War broke out in 1870 and was made Knight of the Legion of Honour in January 1871, for his distinguished services. In the spring of the same year he was appointed medical officer of the Maritime Hospital of Berck-sur-Mer.\n\nIn the fall of 1871 Cornelius returned to America and arrived in Chicago, where his parents were living at the time, to witness the [[Great Chicago Fire]]. He was immediately charged with a medical sanitary mission in connection with, and during, its reconstruction. In 1872, he was elected Chief Medical Officer of the [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York. In 1873 he married in Boston the daughter of one of his patients, Bianca Saroni, and the following year they moved to San Francisco, where he was appointed a member of the Board of Health. Here he specialized in nervous illnesses and his attention was drawn to the adaptation of electricity to practical purposes and he founded the California Electrical Works. In September 1877, with George Prescott, Thomas Edison signs an agreement with Stephen Field and Cornelius Herz regarding European quadruplex patents.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1877 Cornelius and Bianca Saroni returned to Paris with their two infant daughters, Irma and Edna. Their son Ralph was born here, who later became a famous stage actor and three more daughters, Olga, Sybil and Adelaide. In Paris he became the head of the movement for extending the use of electricity, which had its headquarters there. He founded the Electric-Force Transmission Company under the Marcel Deprez patents. According to an article by Sir Edward James Reed, which appeared in the Fortnightly Review of January, 1897:\n{{quote|\n\u201cIn 1878 Cornelius created and was elected President of the well-known French syndicate of electricity, which founded vast electrical organizations in Europe, and culminated in the great scheme worked out by Dr. Herz and carried out by the French Government at his urgent request \u2013 the first [[International Exposition of Electricity, Paris|International Exposition of Electricity (Paris, 1881)]], that marvelous record of the scientific progress of the age. }}\n\nHe founded and edited the first scientific reviews on electricity, La Lumiere Electrique and the Journal d\u2019Electricite`. At this time he also, with the most important banks of Paris, founded societies for electric lighting and for telephony in many European countries. In conjunction with the banking house of Rothschilds, the Northern Railway of France, and the Creuzot Works, he established the Society for the Construction and Maintenance of Electrical Machinery, Apparatus, Cables, etc., the Society for Brazing by Electricity, the Society for the Manufacture of a Special System of Small-bore Guns, the Society for the Application of Electric Light to Railway Trains, the Society for the Construction of Telephone Apparatus, etc. He was the originator and principal founder of the Society for Working the State Telephonic-Telegraphic Trunk Lines, with a capital of 100,000,000 francs, a gigantic scheme to interconnect the 36,000 communes of France by a perpetual day and night uninterrupted telephonic-telegraphic service, and to connect villages and the smallest hamlets at a uniform rate (names and addresses free) of  one half-penny per word.\u201d\n\nIn 1878 the Government made him Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]]. President Garfield appointed Dr. Herz an official representative of the United States Government to the International Congress of Electricians in Paris in 1881 and that same year he was raised to the rank of Commander of the Legion of Honour. In 1879 he formed the Paris Electric-Light Company and in 1880 he invented a telephone system that assured a better transmission of the voice over long distance. In 1883 Herz was the founder, along with [[Alphonse de Rothschild]], of the American Syndicate of Electricity, which afterwards amalgamated with the Westinghouse Syndicate. In 1886, he became Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.\n\nDr. Herz\u2019s whole life up to 1892 was devoted to work, to great enterprises, and to science, and his efforts in these paths were applauded by the vast majority of the members of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], by different Governments, and by many of the world\u2019s greatest men. He received high distinctions from the Government of Bavaria, where he was made Commander of the Holy Order of St. Michael, and from [[King Umberto I]] who created him Grand Cross of the Order of St. Maurice and Lazare of Italy. He soon acquired a prominent position in the political world of France.\n\n==Panama scandal==\nDr. Herz was in England, where they had always passed the winter, with his family in 1892, when the [[Panama scandals]] broke upon France. Dr. Herz was appealed to by members of the Government then in power to return to France, which he did. Soon after, Baron [[Jacques de Reinach]] committed suicide and Dr. Herz returned to the Tankerville Hotel in Bournemouth. Some believe that a perfectly innocent man, Dr. Herz, was made a scapegoat for certain foreign intrigues which had grown very powerful. It was common knowledge in Paris that Baron Reinach and Dr. Herz had been associated together during a dozen years and more in vast commercial undertakings, involving financial transactions amounting to many millions. The pursuit of Dr. Herz was aided by the greed of some persons in the camp of the Reinachs, who sought to acquire fortune through the downfall of a man whom they now were only too willing to consider an adversary by taking advantage, of the tragic circumstances attending the Baron\u2019s death, and of the confusion in which he had left his affairs. It was also believed that Dr. Herz held evidence against conspicuous politicians and financiers.\n\n[[Georges Clemenceau]]'s political judgement was called into question by his flirtation with the demagogic General Boulanger and by his friendship with the \"crooked financier\", Cornelius Herz, who was heavily implicated in the Panama Scandal. Clemenceau blamed Herz for having lost his seat in the 1893 parliamentary elections, he looked for a time to be politically finished.\n\nThe charge thus artificially fixed upon by the French Government was alleged extortion from the late Baron Reinach \u2013 a preposterous charge that was never adduced by the Baron himself in his lifetime, and had no visible foundation in law or in fact. But first, in order to evade the legion of Honour difficulty, which prohibited an ordinary magistrate from acting, the French Government were compelled to resort to having Dr. Herz struck off the rolls of the Legion of Honour, which they did, in spite of the statutes of the Order of the Legion, without a prior hearing. In order to stop his counsel from producing his proofs of Baron de Reinach\u2019s debt to Dr. Herz (consisting of documents on stamped paper duly dated and signed by the Baron, and held by the Rothschilds in their bank) the presiding Judge took advantage of the technicality that the documents were insufficiently stamped, a pure oversight doubtless on the part of men of business, and required that a fine amounting to about L 50,000 sterling should be paid before their introduction as evidence be admitted. This was prohibitory, and absolute conclusive evidence of a debt was, although examined by the Judges and tacitly admitted to be true, suppressed by the Court. Shortly afterwards another occasion presented itself to impoverish Dr. Herz by compelling his wife to transfer to him property which had always stood in her name. The pretext for this course seems to have been that the Judges of the Court alleged that the property was purchased with Dr. Herz\u2019s money, and therefore should have been in his name. Various properties of Dr. and Mrs. Herz in Paris and Aix-lesBains were practically confiscated and torn from him. His Paris property, which had been constantly increasing in importance, was sold for several million francs less than its true value. It is also a fact that during the very time the French were persecuting Dr. Herz, by processes in the Civil and Criminal Courts in Paris, by utilizing the Extradition Treaty with England, and by public vilification through the Parisian Press \u2013 who accused him of being a traitor, a spy in the pay of England, an incendiary, a murderer, and guilty of a whole host of minor crimes \u2013 prominent members of the various Governmental and Opposition groups were constantly giving assurances to Madame Herz, and friends of the Doctor, as well as to his legal representatives, that all would soon be \u201cset right.\u201d After keeping Dr. Herz under wrongful arrest for three and a half years, the French Government withdrew their charges and said they had made a mistake. The shocking treatment for so many years inflicted upon Dr. Herz was pronounced an absolute prosecution. In 1906, eight years after his death, he was exonerated completely.\n\n==Tomb==\nThe embalmed bodies of Cornelius and his father Leopold were supposed to be kept temporarily at Willesden Jewish Cemetery in London, before being taken to America, but the relocation did not happen and eventually the bodies were buried at Willesden: Leopold in section B, row R1, grave 8, on 24 August 1896; Cornelius in section K, row G, grave 3, on 11 July 1898.<ref>Francesca Kautz e-mail 29 August 2019</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite encyclopedia\n| title = HERZ, CORNELIUS\n| encyclopedia = JewishEncyclopedia.com\n| accessdate = 2013-11-10\n| date = 2011\n| url = http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7622-herz-cornelius\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n| title = California Electrical Works\n| work = From the Journal of the Telegraph, November 1, 1877\n| accessdate = 2013-11-10\n| url = http://www.telegraph-history.org/manufacturers/misc/calif1.htm\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n| title = Chronology: 1847-1878 - The Edison Papers\n| accessdate = 2013-11-10\n| url = http://edison.rutgers.edu/chron1.htm#77\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n| title = Ralph Herz - Biography\n| work = IMDb\n| accessdate = 2013-11-10\n| url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0381234/bio\n}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bLmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA68|year=1898|pages=68\u2013}}\n*{{Cite web\n| title = La Lumiere Electrique, 5 Feb. 1881\n| work  = CNUM - P84.3 : p.97\n| accessdate = 2013-11-10\n| url = http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?P84.3/101/100/468/0/0\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n| title = DR.

The away goals rule is again applied after extra time; i.e., if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored.

week 25 derby match [[Hajduk Split|Hajduk]] vs. [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] on 4 May 1980 at [[Poljud Stadium]] featured a mass display of public grief. Played on a Sunday afternoon, the contest was in the 41st minute when three men entered the pitch, signaling the referee Husref Muharemagi\u0107 from [[Janja]] to stop the match. Mayor of Split Ante Skataretiko took the microphone, informing the 50,000+ crowd that Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]] had died. What followed were sudden scenes of mass crying with even some players such as Hajduk's twenty-one-year-old striker [[Zlatko Vujovi\u0107]] collapsing down to the ground and weeping.

week 25 derby match [[Hajduk Split|Hajduk]] vs. [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] on 4 May 1980 at [[Poljud Stadium]] featured a mass display of public grief. Played on a Sunday afternoon, the contest was in the 41st minute when three men entered the pitch, signaling the referee Husref Muharemagi\u0107 from [[Janja]] to stop the match. Mayor of Split Ante Skataretiko took the microphone, informing the 50,000+ crowd that Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]] had died. What followed were sudden scenes of mass crying with even some players such as Hajduk's twenty-one-year-old striker [[Zlatko Vujovi\u0107]] collapsing down to the ground and weeping. The crowd then launched into a rendition of \"Dru\u017ee Tito, mi ti se kunemo\", a popular [[personality cult]] song that professes loyalty and devotion to Comrade Tito. The match was halted and never resumed. The decision was made to void the match and re-play it two and a half weeks later on Wednesday, 21 May 1980 at the same stadium.

Rogers's career spanned fifty-seven years, from 1930 to 1987.\n\nInitially signing with [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1930, she quickly opted out of her contract and worked for several studios, most notably for [[Warner Brothers]] in musicals ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933) and ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' (1933), during this time she was named one of [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]]. In 1932 Ginger co-starred with comedian Joe E. Brown in the movie, \"You Said A Mouthful\". In 1933, Rogers signed with [[RKO Radio Pictures]], where she was paired with dancer [[Fred Astaire]] in commercially successful ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933).<ref name=Flying/> The pair achieved  greater success in subsequent musicals ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), ''[[Swing Time (1936 film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), and ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), totaling 8 films made between 1933 and 1939.\n\nWithout Astaire, Rogers starred in critically and commercially successful non-musicals throughout the remainder of the 1930s such as ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937) with [[Katharine Hepburn]], ''[[Vivacious Lady]]'' (1938) with [[James Stewart]], and ''[[Bachelor Mother]]''  (1939) with [[David Niven]], culminating with an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940).\n\nRogers flourished throughout the 1940s, becoming one of the most popular and highest paid actresses of the decade. She starred in comedies ''[[Tom, Dick and Harry (1941 film)|Tom, Dick and Harry]]'' (1941) and ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942; this was an adaptation of the 1926 non-musical play ''[[Chicago (play)|Chicago]]'', and later the inspiration for [[Chicago (musical)|the hit 1975 musical]] and [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film adaptation]]), dramas ''[[Tender Comrade]]'' (1943) and ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (1944 film)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'' (1944) and in director [[Billy Wilder|Billy Wilder's]] American film debut ''[[The Major and the Minor]]'' (1942).\n\nShe was reunited with Fred Astaire for MGM's ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' (1949).\n\nIn the 1950s, Rogers' film career had faltered, due to lesser demand for older actresses. She co-starred with popular [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'' (1952) but her career continued to wane throughout the decade. She ended her film career with one of two fictionalized biographies on actress [[Jean Harlow]] in 1965's ''[[Harlow (Magna film)|Harlow]]''. Beginning the following year, she found success by returning to [[musical theatre]], including a stint as one of several replacements for [[Carol Channing]] in the long-running ''[[Hello, Dolly!

Rogers's career spanned fifty-seven years, from 1930 to 1987.\n\nInitially signing with [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1930, she quickly opted out of her contract and worked for several studios, most notably for [[Warner Brothers]] in musicals ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933) and ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' (1933), during this time she was named one of [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]]. In 1932 Ginger co-starred with comedian Joe E. Brown in the movie, \"You Said A Mouthful\". In 1933, Rogers signed with [[RKO Radio Pictures]], where she was paired with dancer [[Fred Astaire]] in commercially successful ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933).<ref name=Flying/> The pair achieved  greater success in subsequent musicals ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), ''[[Swing Time (1936 film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), and ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), totaling 8 films made between 1933 and 1939.\n\nWithout Astaire, Rogers starred in critically and commercially successful non-musicals throughout the remainder of the 1930s such as ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937) with [[Katharine Hepburn]], ''[[Vivacious Lady]]'' (1938) with [[James Stewart]], and ''[[Bachelor Mother]]''  (1939) with [[David Niven]], culminating with an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940).\n\nRogers flourished throughout the 1940s, becoming one of the most popular and highest paid actresses of the decade. She starred in comedies ''[[Tom, Dick and Harry (1941 film)|Tom, Dick and Harry]]'' (1941) and ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942; this was an adaptation of the 1926 non-musical play ''[[Chicago (play)|Chicago]]'', and later the inspiration for [[Chicago (musical)|the hit 1975 musical]] and [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film adaptation]]), dramas ''[[Tender Comrade]]'' (1943) and ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (1944 film)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'' (1944) and in director [[Billy Wilder|Billy Wilder's]] American film debut ''[[The Major and the Minor]]'' (1942).\n\nShe was reunited with Fred Astaire for MGM's ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' (1949).\n\nIn the 1950s, Rogers' film career had faltered, due to lesser demand for older actresses. She co-starred with popular [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'' (1952) but her career continued to wane throughout the decade. She ended her film career with one of two fictionalized biographies on actress [[Jean Harlow]] in 1965's ''[[Harlow (Magna film)|Harlow]]''. Beginning the following year, she found success by returning to [[musical theatre]], including a stint as one of several replacements for [[Carol Channing]] in the long-running ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]].<ref name=IBDB/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ginger Rogers Thirteenth Guest.jpg| In ''[[The Thirteenth Guest (film)|The Thirteenth Guest]]'' (1932)\nFile:Norman Foster and Ginger Rogers in Rafter Romance.jpg| With [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]] in<br>''[[Rafter Romance]]'' (1933)\nFile:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg| [[Una Merkel]], [[Ruby Keeler]] and Rogers in ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933)\nFile:Poster - Flying Down to Rio 01 Crisco restoration.jpg|''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933)\nFile:Follow the Fleet (1936) trailer 5.jpg| With [[Fred Astaire]] in<br>''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936)\nFile:Stage-Door-1937.jpg| With [[Katharine Hepburn]] in<br>''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937)\nFile:Ginger Rogers in Kitty Foyle trailer.jpg| ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940), an [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award winner for Best Actress]] \nFile:The Barkleys of Broadway (1949) trailer 2.jpg| With [[Fred Astaire]] in<br>''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' (1949)\nFile:Monkey Business trailer.JPG| L-R: Rogers, [[Robert Cornthwaite (actor)|Robert Cornthwaite]], [[Cary Grant]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'' (1952)\n</gallery>\n\n==Films==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
