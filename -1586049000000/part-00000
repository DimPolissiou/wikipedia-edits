Also known as ''Sheer Thursday'' in the United Kingdom, it is traditionally a day of cleaning and giving out Maundy money there.  Holy Thursday is part of [[Holy Week]].\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Thursdays are dedicated to the [[Apostles]] and [[Saint Nicholas]]. The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains [[hymn]]s on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Thursdays throughout the year.  At the end of [[Divine Services]] on Thursday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure [[Theotokos|Mother]], of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles, of our [[Holy Fathers|Father]] among the [[saint]]s Nicholas, [[Archbishop]] of [[Myra]] in [[Lycia]], the [[Wonder-worker]]\u2026\"\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension Thursday]] is 40 days after Easter, when Christ ascended into [[Heaven]].\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islam]], Thursdays are one of the days in a week in which Muslims are encouraged to do [[Fasting in Islam#Days of voluntary fasting|voluntary fasting]], the other being Mondays.

The [[Didache]] warned early [[Christians]] not to fast on Thursdays to avoid [[Judaizers|Judaizing]], and suggested Fridays instead.\n\nIn Judaism the [[Torah]] is read in public on Thursday mornings, and special penitential prayers are said on Thursday, unless there is a special occasion for happiness which cancels them.\n\n===Practices in Countries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn Buddhist Thailand Thursday is considered the \"Teacher's Day\", and it is believed that one should begin one's education on this auspicious day.

And graduation day in Thai universities, which can vary depending on each university, almost always will be held on a Thursday.\n\nIn the [[Thai solar calendar]], the colour associated with Thursday is orange.\n\nIn the United States, [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] is an annual festival celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.\n\n===Conventional weekly events===\nIn Australia, most cinema movies premieres are held on Thursdays. Also, most Australians are paid on a Thursday, either weekly or fortnightly.

In [[Sanskrit]] language, the day is called '''B\u1e5bhaspativ\u0101saram''' (day of [[B\u1e5bhaspati]]). In Nepali language, the day is called ''Bihiv\u0101ra'' as derived from the Sanskrit word. In [[Thai language|Thai]], the word is ''Wan Pharuehatsabodi'' , also in [[Old Javanese]] as ''Respati'' or in [[Balinese language|Balinese]] as ''Wraspati'' \u2013 referring to the Hindu deity B\u1e5bhaspati, also associated with Jupiter.\n[[En (Illyrian god)|En]] was an old [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] deity and in his honor in the [[Albanian language]] Thursday is called \"Enjte\".<ref>Lurker, Manfred.

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], unlike other [[Romance languages]], uses the word ''quinta-feira,'' meaning \"fifth day of liturgical celebration\", that comes from the Latin ''feria quinta'' used in religious texts where it was not allowed to consecrate days to pagan gods.\n\n[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] also uses the term ''fifth day'' (''Fimmtudagur'').\n\nIn the [[Persian language|Persian]] language, Thursday is referred to as ''panj-shanbeh'', meaning 5th day of the week.\n\n[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] refers to Thursday as {{lang|vi|Th\u1ee9 n\u0103m}} (literally means \"day five\").\n\n[[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally referred to Thursday as \"Fifth Day\" eschewing the [[paganism|pagan]] origin of the English name \"Thursday\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iymc.org/calendarnames.html |title=Guide to Quaker Calendar Names |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= |publisher=Iowa Yearly Meeting (Conservative) Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) |access-date=30 March 2017 |quote=In the 20th Century, many Friends began accepting use of the common date names, feeling that any pagan meaning has been forgotten.

Also known as ''Sheer Thursday'' in the United Kingdom, it is traditionally a day of cleaning and giving out Maundy money there.  Holy Thursday is part of [[Holy Week]].\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Thursdays are dedicated to the [[Apostles]] and [[Saint Nicholas]]. The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains [[hymn]]s on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Thursdays throughout the year.  At the end of [[Divine Services]] on Thursday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure [[Theotokos|Mother]], of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles, of our [[Holy Fathers|Father]] among the [[saint]]s Nicholas, [[Archbishop]] of [[Myra]] in [[Lycia]], the [[Wonder-worker]]\u2026\"\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension Thursday]] is 40 days after Easter, when Christ ascended into [[Heaven]].\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islam]], Thursdays are one of the days in a week in which Muslims are encouraged to do [[Fasting in Islam#Days of voluntary fasting|voluntary fasting]], the other being Mondays. There are a number of [[Hadith]] which narrated of prophet [[Muhammad]] fasting on these days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/answers/69781/is-it-better-to-fast-on-mondays-and-thursdays-or-on-three-days-of-each-month|title=Is it better to fast on Mondays and Thursdays or on three days of each month? \u2013 Islam Question & Answer|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamhelpline.net/answer/9054/fasting-on-mondays|title=Fasting on mondays \u2013 Islamhelpline|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n\nIn [[Judaism]], Thursdays are considered auspicious days for fasting.  The [[Didache]] warned early [[Christians]] not to fast on Thursdays to avoid [[Judaizers|Judaizing]], and suggested Fridays instead.\n\nIn Judaism the [[Torah]] is read in public on Thursday mornings, and special penitential prayers are said on Thursday, unless there is a special occasion for happiness which cancels them.\n\n===Practices in Countries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn Buddhist Thailand Thursday is considered the \"Teacher's Day\", and it is believed that one should begin one's education on this auspicious day. Thai students still pay homages to their teachers in specific ceremony always held on a selected Thursday. And graduation day in Thai universities, which can vary depending on each university, almost always will be held on a Thursday.\n\nIn the [[Thai solar calendar]], the colour associated with Thursday is orange.\n\nIn the United States, [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] is an annual festival celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.\n\n===Conventional weekly events===\nIn Australia, most cinema movies premieres are held on Thursdays. Also, most Australians are paid on a Thursday, either weekly or fortnightly. Shopping malls see this as an opportunity to open longer than usual, generally until 9 pm, as most pay cheques are cleared by Thursday morning.\n\nIn Norway, Thursday has also traditionally been the day when most shops and malls are open later than on the other weekdays, although the majority of shopping malls now are open until 8 pm or 9 pm every weekday.\n\nIn the USSR of the 1970s and 1980s Thursday was the \"Fish Day\" ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:\u0420\u044b\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c|\u0420\u044b\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c]]}}, ''Rybny den''), when the nation's [[foodservice]] establishments were supposed to serve fish (rather than meat) dishes.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Irina |last=Petrosian|first2= David |last2=Underwood|year=2006\n|isbn=1411698657|title=Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction & Folklore|series=Armenian Research Center collection\n|edition=2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0oXYX9Qzx9oC&pg=PA115\n|page=115}}</ref>\n\nFor college and university students, Thursday is sometimes referred to as the new Friday.
