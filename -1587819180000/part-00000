The [[Clifford family]] was one of the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century, and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. He was orphaned at twenty years of age when his father was slain by partisans of the [[House of York]] at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the [[first Battle of St Albans|Battle of St Albans]] in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen [[Margaret of Anjou]], consort of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.\n\nClifford had already achieved prominence in the north where, as an ally of the son of the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|earl of Northumberland]], he took part in a feud against the [[House of Neville|Neville family]], the Percy's natural rivals in [[Yorkshire]]. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|duke of York]], whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.\n\nArmed conflict erupted again in 1459, and again Clifford was found on the side of the King and Queen. Clifford took part in [[Parliament of Devils|the parliament that attainted the Yorkists]]&nbsp;\u2013 by now in exile&nbsp;\u2013 and he took a share of the profits from their lands, as well as being appointed to offices traditionally in their keeping. The Yorkist lords returned from exile in June 1460 and subsequently defeated a royal army at [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Northampton]]. As a result of the royalist defeat, Clifford was ordered to surrender such castles and offices as he had from the Nevilles back to them, although it is unlikely that he did so. In fact, he and his fellow northern Lancastrian lords merely commenced a campaign of destruction on Neville and Yorkist estates and tenantry, to such an extent that in December 1460, the duke of York and his close ally, the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|earl of Salisbury]], raised an army and headed north to crush the Lancastrian rebellion. This winter campaign culminated in the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in the last days of the year, and was a decisive victory for the Lancastrian army, of which Clifford was by now an important commander. The battle resulted in the deaths of both York and Salisbury, but was probably most notorious for Clifford's slaying of [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], York's seventeen-year old second son and the younger brother of the future King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. This may have resulted in Clifford's being nicknamed 'Butcher Clifford', although historians disagree as to how widely used by contemporaries this term was.\n\nClifford accompanied the royal army on its march south early the next year, where, although wounded, he played a leading part in the [[second Battle of St Albans]], and then afterwards with the Queen to the north. The Yorkist army, now under the command of Edward of York and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], pursued the Lancastrians to Yorkshire and eventually defeated them at the [[Battle of Towton]] on 29 March 1461. Clifford though was not present; he had been slain in [[Battle of Ferrybridge|a skirmish]] with a Yorkist [[Reconnaissance|advance party]] the previous day. Following the coronation of the by-then victorious Edward IV, he was attainted and his lands confiscated by the Crown.\n\n==Background, youth, marriage and family==\n[[File:Skipton Castle main gate, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Skipton Castle]], seat of the Clifford family; [[Craven]] has been described as \"wild, economically backward and chronically lawless.\"<ref>Dockray, K.

[[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]], for example, has suggested that \"the heirs of the dead lords... now wanted revenge for their fathers' deaths. They were not particular whether by constitutional trial or by [[assassination]].\" Warwick especially was held accountable.<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''Warwick the Kingmaker'' (Oxford, 1998), 129.</ref> [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] imposed a reconciliation between the warring factions of St Albans in early 1458, and commanded the various parties, including Clifford, to London. Clifford arrived there, a contemporary [[chronicle]]r recorded, \"with a grete power,\"<ref name=\":5\"/> and demanded compensation for his father's death.<ref name=\":5\"/> In this, he was accompanied by the other \"yong lordes whoos fadres were sleyne at Seynt Albonys.\"<ref>Davies, J.S.

Thus, Clifford and the others were forced to lodge at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]], between the city and [[Westminster]],<ref name=\":1\">Hicks, M.A., ''Warwick the Kingmaker'' (Oxford, 1998), 132.</ref> probably in a house of one of the various bishops that lined the route.<ref>Maurer, H.E., ''Margaret of Anjou: Queenship and Power in Late Medieval England'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 154.</ref> The king, as [[arbitrator]], resided out of London, at [[Berkhamsted Castle]], and Clifford visited him there on 1 March&nbsp;\u2013 \"presumably to influence the result [but] probably unsuccessfully,\" says Hicks.<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''Warwick the Kingmaker'' (Oxford, 1998), 133.</ref> Clifford later participated in what was known ceremonially as the '[[Loveday (arbitration)|Loveday]]' on the 24th of the month, which saw the king arbitrate a settlement between the warring parties. As a result of this, and as part of a general compensation package between the families of the battle's victors and losers, Clifford was to be paid \u00a3666 by the earl of Warwick. This was to be shared between John and his siblings.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\nKing Henry's attempts at peacekeeping, however, came to little; indeed, it was around this time that Henry's forcible wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]], became more involved in the partisan politics of the day and increasingly influential in government. Summerson has noted how Clifford's youth and energy \"made him an increasingly important supporter of the Lancastrian cause.\"<ref name=\":4\"/> Likewise, a [[Propaganda|pro-Lancastrian]] poem, using a favoured contemporary metaphor for government, the [[ship of State]], referred to Clifford as a \"well good sayl\" of it.<ref>Robbins, R.H. (ed.), ''Historical Poems of the XIVth and XVth Centuries'' (New York, 1959), 192\u20133.</ref> A few months later he was appointed to the [[King\u2019s Bench]] for the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]],<ref name=\":4\"/> but when a great council was summoned for October 1458, it seems that Clifford&nbsp;\u2013 along with other anti-York peers such as the dukes of Somerset and Exeter&nbsp;\u2013 were excluded from it.<ref>Maurer, H.E., ''Margaret of Anjou: Queenship and Power in Late Medieval England'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 161.</ref>\n\n==The Wars of the Roses==\n{{Main|Wars of the Roses}}\n[[File:'The Murder of Rutland by Lord Clifford' by Charles Robert Leslie, 1815.JPG|thumb|left|''The Murder of Rutland by Lord Clifford'' by Charles Robert Leslie, 1815]]\nThe next point at which Clifford appears to have been fully involved in national politics was attending the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] summoned to [[Coventry]] in November 1459. By this time the civil wars had broken out again in earnest: the Neville earl of Salisbury had defeated an attempted [[Lancastrianism|Lancastrian]] ambush of him at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] that September, and had joined with the [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|duke of York]] at the latter's [[Ludlow Castle|castle]] in [[Ludlow]]. There, however, they had been forced into exile by superior crown forces, and as a result a parliament had been called to attend to the Yorkists' [[attainder]]s. This was the [[Parliament of Devils]], and here Clifford swore allegiance to the new heir to the throne, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], on 11 December. As a result of the exiled Yorkists' attainders, their estates were available for redistribution by the crown to those who had remained loyal to it, and Clifford was granted the [[Honour of Penrith]] and the [[Penrith Castle]], which had formerly been held by Salisbury. This was close enough to their own [[estate (law)|estates]] Westmorland&nbsp;\u2013 particularly their ''[[caput]]'' of [[Brougham Castle]], near Penrith&nbsp;\u2013 that it has been suggested that it had been a particular [[wikt:bone of contention|bone of contention]] between the two families.<ref name=\":4\"/> In April the following year he was appointed [[warden of the western marches]],<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), 439.</ref> an important position in the defence of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. It was also a traditional office of the Nevilles, and had most recently been held jointly by the earls of Salisbury and Warwick; now Clifford was [[Commission of array|ordered to raise a force]] to resist the Yorkists.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\nIn June 1460 the exiled Yorkists successfully invaded England, and on 10 July they defeated a royal army at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], and captured the king. As a result, Clifford was now ordered to surrender Penrith castle and Honour back to the earl of Salisbury.<ref name=\":4\"/> But although the now-Yorkist government repeatedly sent messages, orders and instructions to Clifford in the north, he did not acknowledge them, and with Northumberland and [[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros|Lord Roos]], remained in control of most of the region.<ref name=\":3\">Gillingham, J., ''The Wars of the Roses (''London (repr.) 1993), 127.</ref> In October 1460, the duke of York claimed the throne, and a parliament was summoned to discuss this. The result of its deliberations was the [[Act of Accord]], which disinherited the Prince of Wales in favour of York and his heirs. This, it has been said, was 'repugnant' to Clifford and his colleagues and strengthened their support for the queen.<ref name=\":2\" /> It seems that, although Clifford was summoned to attend, he stayed away, and probably met with Queen Margaret in [[Kingston upon Hull]],<ref>Goodman, A., ''The Wars of the Roses: Military Activity and English Society, 1452\u201397'' (USA 1981), 43.</ref> where she was gathering Lancastrian lords and their [[Retainer (medieval)|retainers]] to her. Together, they had soon gathered a fighting force of thousands.<ref>Lander, J.R., ''Government & Community: England 1450\u20131509'' (London, 1980), 212.</ref> Clifford was one of these lords who was subsequently accused of 'systematically' pillaging and looting the Yorkshire estates and tenants of York and Salisbury.<ref name=\":6\" /> In response to these attacks, York, Salisbury, and the latter's son Thomas led an army to the north. Encamped at York's castle at [[Sandal Castle|Sandal]], on 30 December 1460, the two armies met at the [[Battle of Wakefield]],<ref name=\":4\" /> where Clifford commanded one of the wings of the Lancastrian army.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Yorkist army was routed, and all three Yorkist lords were killed. Clifford was [[knight]]ed by the Lancastrian commander, [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]] prior to the battle commencing.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\n===Death of the earl of Rutland===\nOne modern historian has noted, however, that although Rutland's death brought Clifford \"considerable notoriety, much of it [was] first reported only several decades after the event.\"<ref name=\":4\"/> Henry Summerson dates the first published description of 'Butcher Clifford' as being not until the 1540s, by [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] in his ''Itinerary'', when he wrote that \"for killing of men at this bataill [Clifford] was caullid the boucher.\"<ref>Leland, J., ''The Itinerary of John Leland'' I (ed. T. Hearne), (Eton, 1748), 43.</ref> The [[Annals|annalist]] [[William Worcester]], writing contemporaneously says that Clifford killed Rutland on Wakefield Bridge, whilst the latter fled the battle. In the sixteenth century this report was expanded by [[Edward Hall]], which became the source of Shakespeare's account. This included the addition of various confirmed historical inaccuracies, such as describing Rutland as being aged twelve rather than seventeen,<ref name=\":4\" /> and that Clifford also [[behead]]ed York after the battle, whereas the earl almost certainly fell in the fighting.<ref name=\":5\"/> Historian J.R. Lander has said that most of the later descriptions of Clifford at Wakefield \"appear too late to be worthy of much credence.\"<ref>Lander, JR., 'Attainder and Forfeiture, 1453\u20131509', ''The Historical Journal,'' ''4'' (1961), 134 n.55.</ref>\n\n==Death and attainder==\nFollowing the victory at Wakefield, Clifford and other Lancastrian lords in the north attended Queen Margaret's [[Royal council]] in January;<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''Warwick the Kingmaker'' (Oxford, 1998), 235.</ref> they soon led their army south. [[Gregory's Chronicle|Gregory's ''Chronicle'']] reports that everyone wore the Prince of Wales' [[Heraldic badge|cognizance]], the [[ostrich feather badge]].<ref name=\":3\" />  On 17 February 1461 they encountered a Yorkist army, led by Warwick and his brother [[John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu|John Neville]], at [[St Albans]]. This resulted in another resounding victory for the Lancastrians, and Henry VI was captured from Warwick and returned to his wife and son. It is possible that this reunion occurred in John Clifford's own tent after the battle.<ref name=\":4\" /> Instead of marching on London however, the royal army retreated to the north, Clifford with it, and a Yorkist force slowly trailing them from London. On 28 March 1461 portions of the two armies clashed whilst attempting to cross the [[River Aire]] at [[Ferrybridge]], now called the [[Battle of Ferrybridge]]. The Lancastrian force, under Clifford, captured the bridge, but the Yorkists had [[Ford (crossing)|forded]] the river upstream and [[Flanking maneuver|flank-attacked]] Clifford's men. Traditionally, Clifford was killed at Dittingdale, possibly by a headless arrow in the throat, and buried in a common burial pit, along with the rest of the dead from that encounter.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Cockayne, G.E. & V.E.

The [[Clifford family]] was one of the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century, and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. He was orphaned at twenty years of age when his father was slain by partisans of the [[House of York]] at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the [[first Battle of St Albans|Battle of St Albans]] in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen [[Margaret of Anjou]], consort of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.\n\nClifford had already achieved prominence in the north where, as an ally of the son of the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|earl of Northumberland]], he took part in a feud against the [[House of Neville|Neville family]], the Percy's natural rivals in [[Yorkshire]]. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|duke of York]], whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.\n\nArmed conflict erupted again in 1459, and again Clifford was found on the side of the King and Queen. Clifford took part in [[Parliament of Devils|the parliament that attainted the Yorkists]]&nbsp;\u2013 by now in exile&nbsp;\u2013 and he took a share of the profits from their lands, as well as being appointed to offices traditionally in their keeping. The Yorkist lords returned from exile in June 1460 and subsequently defeated a royal army at [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Northampton]]. As a result of the royalist defeat, Clifford was ordered to surrender such castles and offices as he had from the Nevilles back to them, although it is unlikely that he did so. In fact, he and his fellow northern Lancastrian lords merely commenced a campaign of destruction on Neville and Yorkist estates and tenantry, to such an extent that in December 1460, the duke of York and his close ally, the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|earl of Salisbury]], raised an army and headed north to crush the Lancastrian rebellion. This winter campaign culminated in the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in the last days of the year, and was a decisive victory for the Lancastrian army, of which Clifford was by now an important commander. The battle resulted in the deaths of both York and Salisbury, but was probably most notorious for Clifford's slaying of [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], York's seventeen-year old second son and the younger brother of the future King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. This may have resulted in Clifford's being nicknamed 'Butcher Clifford', although historians disagree as to how widely used by contemporaries this term was.\n\nClifford accompanied the royal army on its march south early the next year, where, although wounded, he played a leading part in the [[second Battle of St Albans]], and then afterwards with the Queen to the north. The Yorkist army, now under the command of Edward of York and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], pursued the Lancastrians to Yorkshire and eventually defeated them at the [[Battle of Towton]] on 29 March 1461. Clifford though was not present; he had been slain in [[Battle of Ferrybridge|a skirmish]] with a Yorkist [[Reconnaissance|advance party]] the previous day. Following the coronation of the by-then victorious Edward IV, he was attainted and his lands confiscated by the Crown.\n\n==Background, youth, marriage and family==\n[[File:Skipton Castle main gate, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Skipton Castle]], seat of the Clifford family; [[Craven]] has been described as \"wild, economically backward and chronically lawless.\"<ref>Dockray, K.

[[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]], for example, has suggested that \"the heirs of the dead lords... now wanted revenge for their fathers' deaths.

As a result of this, and as part of a general compensation package between the families of the battle's victors and losers, Clifford was to be paid \u00a3666 by the earl of Warwick. This was to be shared between John and his siblings.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\nKing Henry's attempts at peacekeeping, however, came to little; indeed, it was around this time that Henry's forcible wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]], became more involved in the partisan politics of the day and increasingly influential in government. Summerson has noted how Clifford's youth and energy \"made him an increasingly important supporter of the Lancastrian cause.\"<ref name=\":4\"/> Likewise, a [[Propaganda|pro-Lancastrian]] poem, using a favoured contemporary metaphor for government, the [[ship of State]], referred to Clifford as a \"well good sayl\" of it.<ref>Robbins, R.H.

By this time the civil wars had broken out again in earnest: the Neville earl of Salisbury had defeated an attempted [[Lancastrianism|Lancastrian]] ambush of him at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] that September, and had joined with the [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|duke of York]] at the latter's [[Ludlow Castle|castle]] in [[Ludlow]]. There, however, they had been forced into exile by superior crown forces, and as a result a parliament had been called to attend to the Yorkists' [[attainder]]s. This was the [[Parliament of Devils]], and here Clifford swore allegiance to the new heir to the throne, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], on 11 December. As a result of the exiled Yorkists' attainders, their estates were available for redistribution by the crown to those who had remained loyal to it, and Clifford was granted the [[Honour of Penrith]] and the [[Penrith Castle]], which had formerly been held by Salisbury. This was close enough to their own [[estate (law)|estates]] Westmorland&nbsp;\u2013 particularly their ''[[caput]]'' of [[Brougham Castle]], near Penrith&nbsp;\u2013 that it has been suggested that it had been a particular [[wikt:bone of contention|bone of contention]] between the two families.<ref name=\":4\"/> In April the following year he was appointed [[warden of the western marches]],<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), 439.</ref> an important position in the defence of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. It was also a traditional office of the Nevilles, and had most recently been held jointly by the earls of Salisbury and Warwick; now Clifford was [[Commission of array|ordered to raise a force]] to resist the Yorkists.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\nIn June 1460 the exiled Yorkists successfully invaded England, and on 10 July they defeated a royal army at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], and captured the king. As a result, Clifford was now ordered to surrender Penrith castle and Honour back to the earl of Salisbury.<ref name=\":4\"/> But although the now-Yorkist government repeatedly sent messages, orders and instructions to Clifford in the north, he did not acknowledge them, and with Northumberland and [[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros|Lord Roos]], remained in control of most of the region.<ref name=\":3\">Gillingham, J., ''The Wars of the Roses (''London (repr.) 1993), 127.</ref> In October 1460, the duke of York claimed the throne, and a parliament was summoned to discuss this. The result of its deliberations was the [[Act of Accord]], which disinherited the Prince of Wales in favour of York and his heirs. This, it has been said, was 'repugnant' to Clifford and his colleagues and strengthened their support for the queen.<ref name=\":2\" /> It seems that, although Clifford was summoned to attend, he stayed away, and probably met with Queen Margaret in [[Kingston upon Hull]],<ref>Goodman, A., ''The Wars of the Roses: Military Activity and English Society, 1452\u201397'' (USA 1981), 43.</ref> where she was gathering Lancastrian lords and their [[Retainer (medieval)|retainers]] to her.

This resulted in another resounding victory for the Lancastrians, and Henry VI was captured from Warwick and returned to his wife and son. It is possible that this reunion occurred in John Clifford's own tent after the battle.<ref name=\":4\" /> Instead of marching on London however, the royal army retreated to the north, Clifford with it, and a Yorkist force slowly trailing them from London. On 28 March 1461 portions of the two armies clashed whilst attempting to cross the [[River Aire]] at [[Ferrybridge]], now called the [[Battle of Ferrybridge]]. The Lancastrian force, under Clifford, captured the bridge, but the Yorkists had [[Ford (crossing)|forded]] the river upstream and [[Flanking maneuver|flank-attacked]] Clifford's men.

A portion of that book focuses on the opening of [[seven seals]] and the resulting [[Christian eschatology|apocalyptic events]].  In its various versions, the song quotes several passages from the [[Bible]] in the tradition of American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]].\n\n==Blind Willie Johnson version==\nBlind Willie Johnson recorded \"John the Revelator\" during his fifth and final recording session for [[Columbia Records]] in Atlanta, Georgia on April 20, 1930.  Accompanying Johnson on vocal and guitar is Willie B. Harris (sometimes identified as his first wife), who sings the response parts of the song.  Their vocals add a \"sense of dread and foreboding\" to the song, along with the chorus line \"Who's that a writin', John the Revelator\" \"repeated like a mantra\".<ref name=\"Ward\"/>\n\nJohnson's lyrics reference a number of passages from the Bible:\n{{poemquote|[''call''] Well who's that writin'?

The album was a major success, achieving platinum and gold certification around the world and spawning the hits \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" and \"[[She Bop]]\". In 1985, Lauper released \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", a single from the soundtrack to ''[[The Goonies]]'', and her second album, ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'', was released in 1986. ''True Colors'' was another successful album, along with the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|single of the same name]] and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> A starring role in the film ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' in 1988 led to the release of \"[[Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)]]\", which was a hit in Australia and New Zealand. Lauper's third album, ''[[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper album)|A Night to Remember]]'', was released in 1989. This album was less successful, despite the popularity of the first single, \"[[I Drove All Night]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> The following single, \"[[My First Night Without You]]\"<ref name=allmusic/> managed to chart in the top 60 in the United States.\n\nIn 1992, Lauper appeared in the English version of ''[[Starmania (musical)|Starmania]]'', a French [[rock opera]]. She released a single from the musical, \"[[The World Is Stone]]\", which was a major hit in several countries, particularly France. Her album ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'' was released in 1993 on [[Epic Records]], attaining gold certification in France and Japan. Lauper's greatest hits compilation, ''[[Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some]]'', was released in 1994, with the re-recorded version of \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" reaching number four in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. A compilation of Lauper's music videos and an interview was released at the same time on [[VHS]]. In 1996, she released ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and an original album of Christmas songs, ''[[Merry Christmas...Have a Nice Life]]'' in 1998.<ref name=allmusic/> These two albums were much less successful internationally than her previous releases, but both charted in Japan. ''Sisters of Avalon'' was also certified platinum in Japan.\n\nIn 2001, Lauper planned to release another album, ''[[Shine (Cyndi Lauper album)|Shine]]'', but the record company folded. An [[extended play]] version of the album was released to counter Internet [[Copyright infringement|piracy]], and the full album was released exclusively in Japan in 2004. In 2003, Lauper released her seventh studio album, ''[[At Last (Cyndi Lauper album)|At Last]]'', and a live version in 2004 on [[DVD]], ''Live... At Last''.<ref name=allmusic/> ''At Last'' is a set of covers that reinvent classic songs, such as the title track \"[[At Last]]\", \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" and \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\". The live DVD achieved gold certification in the United States. In 2005, Lauper released ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'', featuring new acoustic versions of her hits, such as a duet of \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" with [[Sarah McLachlan]]. Lauper's 2008 album, ''[[Bring Ya to the Brink]]'', was her first release in seven years containing original material, and met with considerable success. In December 2008 she recorded the duet \"[[A Christmas Duel]]\" with Swedish pop band [[The Hives]], released in Sweden only, where it reached number 4.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sverigetopplistan.se |title=Svenska Topplistan |language=Swedish}}</ref>  ''[[Memphis Blues (album)|Memphis Blues]]'', was released in 2010. It managed to be her highest-charting album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since ''True Colors'' in 1986, spending 13 consecutive weeks at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Blues chart, becoming the highest selling blues album of the year. So far, it has sold 600,000 copies worldwide.  Her most recent album is ''[[Detour (Cyndi Lauper album)|Detour]]'', released in 2016.  It is a country and western album inspired by some of her favourite artists growing up including [[Patsy Cline]].
