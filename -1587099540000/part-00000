Oliveri is perhaps best known as a former member of [[Kyuss]] and later [[Queens of the Stone Age]] from 1998 to 2004. Oliveri is also a solo artist and frequent contributor to his friends' albums and tours, including [[Winnebago Deal]], [[Mark Lanegan|Mark Lanegan Band]], [[Masters of Reality]], [[Turbonegro]] and [[Moistboyz]], among many others. Oliveri is currently the frontman of his project, [[Mondo Generator]], a [[punk (music)|punk]] and [[metal (music)|metal]] hybrid that he formed in 1997.<ref name=\"Nick Oliveri\">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nick-oliveri-mn0000398373#wre \"Nick Oliveri\"]. allmusic.com.

In early 1989, shortly after Oliveri's  departure, the band changed its name to [[Sons of Kyuss EP|Sons of Kyuss]], and after self-releasing an EP in 1990, the band re-recruited Oliveri on bass to replace Cockrell, and shortened their name to [[Kyuss]].\n\nOliveri left the band following completion of ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]'' and was replaced by [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]], who had been approached about joining Kyuss five to six months earlier during a West Coast tour with [[The Obsessed]]. Following his departure from Kyuss, Oliveri joined the [[Dwarves (band)|Dwarves]] as an on again off again bassist under the moniker Rex Everything.\n\n=== Mondo Generator ===\nNick Oliveri (under the moniker ''Rex Everything'') formed Mondo Generator in 1997 and with friends [[Josh Homme]], [[Brant Bjork]], [[Rob Oswald]], Karl Doyle and others, recorded the debut album, ''[[Cocaine Rodeo]]''. The [[album]] wouldn't be released until three years later due to Oliveri and Homme being full-time members of [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. The album was released by cult-favorite [[Southern Lord|Southern Lord Records]] in 2000. There was little support of the album by the way of live shows, and the band gained cult status among the most devoted Queens of the Stone Age fans.\n\nAs of April 2007, Mondo Generator was scheduled to appear on the 12th annual [[Ozzfest]] tour (otherwise known as the \"FreeFest\" tour), but officially dropped off the tour on July 26, 2007 after appearing at four Ozzfest dates. Oliveri stated, \"We can't keep on touring for free! My band's not free, it's costing me.\"{{citequote|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Queens of the Stone Age ===\n[[File:Nick Oliveri V Festival 2003.jpg|thumb|Oliveri performing with [[Queens of the Stone Age]] at the [[V festival#V2003|2003 V Festival]]]]\nOliveri was a core contributor to Queens of the Stone Age from 1998 to 2004, playing bass and providing backup and lead vocals on two of the band's biggest albums, ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]''  and ''[[Songs for the Deaf]],'' in addition to co-writing most of the album's songs with bandmate Josh Homme. He first appeared on the band's [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self titled debut album]] in the form of a voicemail confirming his commitment to the band on the album's final song, \"I Was a Teenage Hand Model\".\n\nOliveri's lead singing can be heard on songs such as \"Auto Pilot\", \"Tension Head\" and \"Quick and to the Pointless\" from ''Rated R'' and \"Another Love Song\", \"Gonna Leave You\", \"Six Shooter\" and \"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar but I Feel Like a Millionaire,\" from ''Songs for the Deaf.''\n\nIn January 2004, following a string of dates touring in Australia, Oliveri was fired from the band, with reasoning at first being aggressive treatment of the band's fans, later being accusations of possible abuse to his girlfriend. Oliveri has said to have come to the conclusion himself that during a sound check at a show in Spain in 2003 he acted too aggressively to Josh Homme over his relationship with then-girlfriend [[Brody Dalle]] after getting too drunk on wine, raising tension between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51dsoWRjOT8|title=Nick Oliveri Quits Kyuss Lives|work=YouTube|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Queens of the Stone Age ===\nSince his firing from Queens of the Stone Age, Oliveri has recorded an acoustic LP entitled ''[[Demolition Day]]'' that was eventually released as a second disk in a limited edition of [[Mondo Generator]]'s latest album, ''[[Dead Planet: SonicSlowMotionTrails]]''. Although now concentrating on the Mondo Generator project, in September 2006 Oliveri stated \"I feel that Queens is something I can contribute to and [[Josh Homme]] needs me to do it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/37152-nick-oliveri-mondo-uncontrollable|title=The Skinny \u2013 Nick Oliveri \u2013 Mondo Uncontrollable|date=October 13, 2006|publisher=Theskinny.co.uk|accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>\n\nThere was speculation that he would return in Queens of the Stone Age during their summer tour due to Josh Homme's dedication of \"New Fang\" to Nick for \"new beginnings\". However, this proved to be false. In March 2011, Oliveri stated: \"The last time I saw them play was a benefit for [[Brian O'Connor (bassist)|Brian O'Connor]] in L.A., from the [[Eagles of Death Metal]]. I was down there and I mentioned to them, \"Why don't I come up and do \"Millionaire\" or something, and sing it and not play bass?\" [Josh] was like, \"Nah, I don't think that's a good idea yet.\" It's kind of in his court for stuff like that. I don't think he wants to give anybody the wrong idea. I don't necessarily know if that would happen. And he's got a good band\u2014he's taking the band in the direction he wants it to go.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/music/kyuss-lives-q-a|title=Nick Oliveri Interview|last=Prato|first=Greg|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=UGO.com|accessdate=2011-07-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180734/http://www.ugo.com/music/kyuss-lives-q-a|archivedate=March 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn late November 2012 Oliveri contributed vocals on the track \"If I Had a Tail\" for his former band Queens of the Stone Age on their album ''[[\u2026Like Clockwork]]''. Upon hearing fellow former Queens member [[Dave Grohl]] would make a return to drums on the album, Oliveri inquired to Josh Homme if he could play bass: \"I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, 'Dude! I wanna play bass on it!' I'd be a fool not to ask. If Dave Grohl was playing drums, then I want in. He's an amazing drummer.

Oliveri is also a solo artist and frequent contributor to his friends' albums and tours, including [[Winnebago Deal]], [[Mark Lanegan|Mark Lanegan Band]], [[Masters of Reality]], [[Turbonegro]] and [[Moistboyz]], among many others. Oliveri is currently the frontman of his project, [[Mondo Generator]], a [[punk (music)|punk]] and [[metal (music)|metal]] hybrid that he formed in 1997.<ref name=\"Nick Oliveri\">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nick-oliveri-mn0000398373#wre \"Nick Oliveri\"]. allmusic.com.

In early 1989, shortly after Oliveri's  departure, the band changed its name to [[Sons of Kyuss EP|Sons of Kyuss]], and after self-releasing an EP in 1990, the band re-recruited Oliveri on bass to replace Cockrell, and shortened their name to [[Kyuss]].\n\nOliveri left the band following completion of ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]'' and was replaced by [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]], who had been approached about joining Kyuss five to six months earlier during a West Coast tour with [[The Obsessed]]. Following his departure from Kyuss, Oliveri joined the [[Dwarves (band)|Dwarves]] as an on again off again bassist under the moniker Rex Everything.\n\n=== Mondo Generator ===\nNick Oliveri (under the moniker ''Rex Everything'') formed Mondo Generator in 1997 and with friends [[Josh Homme]], [[Brant Bjork]], [[Rob Oswald]], Karl Doyle and others, recorded the debut album, ''[[Cocaine Rodeo]]''. The [[album]] wouldn't be released until three years later due to Oliveri and Homme being full-time members of [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. The album was released by cult-favorite [[Southern Lord|Southern Lord Records]] in 2000. There was little support of the album by the way of live shows, and the band gained cult status among the most devoted Queens of the Stone Age fans.\n\nAs of April 2007, Mondo Generator was scheduled to appear on the 12th annual [[Ozzfest]] tour (otherwise known as the \"FreeFest\" tour), but officially dropped off the tour on July 26, 2007 after appearing at four Ozzfest dates. Oliveri stated, \"We can't keep on touring for free! My band's not free, it's costing me.\"{{citequote|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Queens of the Stone Age ===\n[[File:Nick Oliveri V Festival 2003.jpg|thumb|Oliveri performing with [[Queens of the Stone Age]] at the [[V festival#V2003|2003 V Festival]]]]\nOliveri was a core contributor to Queens of the Stone Age from 1998 to 2004, playing bass and providing backup and lead vocals on two of the band's biggest albums, ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]''  and ''[[Songs for the Deaf]],'' in addition to co-writing most of the album's songs with bandmate Josh Homme. He first appeared on the band's [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self titled debut album]] in the form of a voicemail confirming his commitment to the band on the album's final song, \"I Was a Teenage Hand Model\".\n\nOliveri's lead singing can be heard on songs such as \"Auto Pilot\", \"Tension Head\" and \"Quick and to the Pointless\" from ''Rated R'' and \"Another Love Song\", \"Gonna Leave You\", \"Six Shooter\" and \"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar but I Feel Like a Millionaire,\" from ''Songs for the Deaf.''\n\nIn January 2004, following a string of dates touring in Australia, Oliveri was fired from the band, with reasoning at first being aggressive treatment of the band's fans, later being accusations of possible abuse to his girlfriend. Oliveri has said to have come to the conclusion himself that during a sound check at a show in Spain in 2003 he acted too aggressively to Josh Homme over his relationship with then-girlfriend [[Brody Dalle]] after getting too drunk on wine, raising tension between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51dsoWRjOT8|title=Nick Oliveri Quits Kyuss Lives|work=YouTube|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Queens of the Stone Age ===\nSince his firing from Queens of the Stone Age, Oliveri has recorded an acoustic LP entitled ''[[Demolition Day]]'' that was eventually released as a second disk in a limited edition of [[Mondo Generator]]'s latest album, ''[[Dead Planet: SonicSlowMotionTrails]]''. Although now concentrating on the Mondo Generator project, in September 2006 Oliveri stated \"I feel that Queens is something I can contribute to and [[Josh Homme]] needs me to do it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/37152-nick-oliveri-mondo-uncontrollable|title=The Skinny \u2013 Nick Oliveri \u2013 Mondo Uncontrollable|date=October 13, 2006|publisher=Theskinny.co.uk|accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>\n\nThere was speculation that he would return in Queens of the Stone Age during their summer tour due to Josh Homme's dedication of \"New Fang\" to Nick for \"new beginnings\". However, this proved to be false. In March 2011, Oliveri stated: \"The last time I saw them play was a benefit for [[Brian O'Connor (bassist)|Brian O'Connor]] in L.A., from the [[Eagles of Death Metal]]. I was down there and I mentioned to them, \"Why don't I come up and do \"Millionaire\" or something, and sing it and not play bass?\" [Josh] was like, \"Nah, I don't think that's a good idea yet.\" It's kind of in his court for stuff like that. I don't think he wants to give anybody the wrong idea. I don't necessarily know if that would happen.

Upon hearing fellow former Queens member [[Dave Grohl]] would make a return to drums on the album, Oliveri inquired to Josh Homme if he could play bass: \"I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, 'Dude! I wanna play bass on it!' I'd be a fool not to ask. If Dave Grohl was playing drums, then I want in. He's an amazing drummer.

Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional [[Turkish breakfast]]. One type of kaymak is found in the [[Afyonkarahisar]] region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional \"black\" Turkish coffee. Kaymak is traditionally eaten with [[baklava]] and other [[Turkish desserts]], fruit preserve and honey or as a filling in [[pancake]]s.\n\n==Balkans==\n[[File:Cicvara (10274863185).jpg|thumb|''Palenta'', cornmeal mush with kajmak and [[\u010dvarci]]]]\n[[File:Traditional wooden bowls for making kaymak.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Traditional wooden bowls for making and storing kaymak ([[Ethnographic Museum, Belgrade]])]]\nKnown as ''kajmak'', it is almost always made at home, though there is beginning to be commercial production. Kajmak is most expensive when freshest&mdash;only a day or two old.

''Kajmak'' also describes the creamy foam in the Turkish coffee.\n\nIt is usually enjoyed as an [[appetizer]] or for Saturday morning breakfast, as Saturdays are market days with the best kajmak, but also as a [[condiment]]. The simplest recipe is ''lepinja sa kajmakom'' ([[bun]] [[bread]] filled with kaymak in Serbia) consumed for breakfast or as [[fast food]]. [[Bosnians]], [[Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]], and [[North Macedonia|Macedonians]] consider it a national meal. Other traditional dishes with kajmak (sold in restaurants) include ''[[pljeskavica]] sa kajmakom'' (the [[Balkans|Balkan]] version of a hamburger patty topped with melted kajmak), as well as ''ribi\u0107 u kajmaku'' (beef shank, simmered with kajmak).\n\n==Iraq==\n[[File:Iraqi-Gaimar-Kaymak.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Iraqi Gaimar made from [[water buffalo]] milk]]\nIn [[Iraq]], it is called gaimar, geymar or qaimar and is very popular. Iraqi gaimar is usually made from the rich, fatty milk of water buffaloes which are prevalent in the marshes of Southern Iraq. \nIt is available both factory produced and from local vendors (farmers) commonly known as Arab, Arbans or [[Madan (people)|Madan]], thus the product is sometimes referred to as ''gaimar Arab'', ''gaimar maadan'', or farmer's ''gaimar''. \n\nIraqis like to serve Gaimar for breakfast with fresh bread, honey or jam.  However the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called \"Kahi\", smother it with [[date honey]] and then wash it down with hot tea.  Gaimar on kahi with date syrup is a long-standing traditional breakfast all over Baghdad and throughout the whole of Southern Iraq.\n\n==Iran==\nIn [[Iran]], ''sarsheer'' (\u0633\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u0631) is used to describe a different method which does not involve heating the milk, thus keeping enzymes and other cultures of the milk alive. The word ''kaymak'' (''qaymaq'') is also used for the boiled method. ''Qaymaq'' is a Turkish word used to describe this product among the Azari people of Iran.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''Qaimak'' or qaymaq has a thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread. People typically top qaimak with honey, sugar, or mix it with jam. It can be spread on pastries or even added to milk tea. Qaimak can be purchased at grocery stores in Afghanistan or made at home. It is quite a long process to make at home, involving hours of stirring the milk pot. Qaimak can be found at Afghan/Iranian grocery stores in the west, packaged qaimak is not as rich as homemade. While a lot qaimak variations are made from buffalo milk, Afghan qaimak can be made from cows' milk.\n\n==Georgia==\n[[File:Kaimaghi.jpg|thumb|A bucket containing kaimaghi in a home in Keda, Georgia.]]\nIn the [[Adjara]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], bordering Turkey, \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 or ''kaimaghi'' is made from cow milk in homes in the mountainous municipalities of [[Keda, Georgia|Keda]], [[Shuakhevi]], and [[Khulo]]. It is typically eaten with [[Georgian cheese]] and/or bread, and is only rarely served in restaurants.\n\n==Greece==\n''Kaimaki'' in [[Greece]] refers to mastic-flavored ice cream that is widely available and often served alongside traditional desserts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Malai]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928145321/http://editore.slowfood.com/editore/riviste/slowark/EN/25/papavero.html The Poppy Growers of \u0130smailk\u00f6y (2002)]\n* Davidson, Alan.

The word remains as ''kaylgmak'' in Mongolian, and with small variations in Turkic languages as ''qaymaq'' in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], ''qaymoq'' in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], \u049b\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u049b in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Shor language|Shor]], \u043a\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u043a in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], ''kaymak'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]<ref name=\"nisanyansozluk.com\"/>, ga\u00fdmak in [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 (''kaimaghi'') in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and \u03ba\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 (''ka\u00efm\u00e1ki'') in [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\n==Turkey==\nShops in [[Turkey]] have been devoted to kaymak production and consumption for centuries. Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional [[Turkish breakfast]]. One type of kaymak is found in the [[Afyonkarahisar]] region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional \"black\" Turkish coffee. Kaymak is traditionally eaten with [[baklava]] and other [[Turkish desserts]], fruit preserve and honey or as a filling in [[pancake]]s.\n\n==Balkans==\n[[File:Cicvara (10274863185).jpg|thumb|''Palenta'', cornmeal mush with kajmak and [[\u010dvarci]]]]\n[[File:Traditional wooden bowls for making kaymak.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Traditional wooden bowls for making and storing kaymak ([[Ethnographic Museum, Belgrade]])]]\nKnown as ''kajmak'', it is almost always made at home, though there is beginning to be commercial production. Kajmak is most expensive when freshest&mdash;only a day or two old. It can keep for weeks in the fridge but becomes harder and loses quality.<ref name=NIN>{{cite news |title=Sve srpske ka\u0161ike |first=Nikola|last=Vrzi\u0107 |url=http://www.nin.co.rs/2000-12/28/15928.html |work=[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]] |date=December 28, 2000 |accessdate=13 June 2012 |language=Serbian |format=Windows-1250}}</ref> Kajmak can also be matured in dried animal skin sacks; variation is called ''skorup''. ''Kajmak'' also describes the creamy foam in the Turkish coffee.\n\nIt is usually enjoyed as an [[appetizer]] or for Saturday morning breakfast, as Saturdays are market days with the best kajmak, but also as a [[condiment]]. The simplest recipe is ''lepinja sa kajmakom'' ([[bun]] [[bread]] filled with kaymak in Serbia) consumed for breakfast or as [[fast food]]. [[Bosnians]], [[Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]], and [[North Macedonia|Macedonians]] consider it a national meal. Other traditional dishes with kajmak (sold in restaurants) include ''[[pljeskavica]] sa kajmakom'' (the [[Balkans|Balkan]] version of a hamburger patty topped with melted kajmak), as well as ''ribi\u0107 u kajmaku'' (beef shank, simmered with kajmak).\n\n==Iraq==\n[[File:Iraqi-Gaimar-Kaymak.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Iraqi Gaimar made from [[water buffalo]] milk]]\nIn [[Iraq]], it is called gaimar, geymar or qaimar and is very popular. Iraqi gaimar is usually made from the rich, fatty milk of water buffaloes which are prevalent in the marshes of Southern Iraq. \nIt is available both factory produced and from local vendors (farmers) commonly known as Arab, Arbans or [[Madan (people)|Madan]], thus the product is sometimes referred to as ''gaimar Arab'', ''gaimar maadan'', or farmer's ''gaimar''. \n\nIraqis like to serve Gaimar for breakfast with fresh bread, honey or jam.  However the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called \"Kahi\", smother it with [[date honey]] and then wash it down with hot tea.  Gaimar on kahi with date syrup is a long-standing traditional breakfast all over Baghdad and throughout the whole of Southern Iraq.\n\n==Iran==\nIn [[Iran]], ''sarsheer'' (\u0633\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u0631) is used to describe a different method which does not involve heating the milk, thus keeping enzymes and other cultures of the milk alive. The word ''kaymak'' (''qaymaq'') is also used for the boiled method. ''Qaymaq'' is a Turkish word used to describe this product among the Azari people of Iran.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''Qaimak'' or qaymaq has a thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread. People typically top qaimak with honey, sugar, or mix it with jam. It can be spread on pastries or even added to milk tea. Qaimak can be purchased at grocery stores in Afghanistan or made at home. It is quite a long process to make at home, involving hours of stirring the milk pot. Qaimak can be found at Afghan/Iranian grocery stores in the west, packaged qaimak is not as rich as homemade. While a lot qaimak variations are made from buffalo milk, Afghan qaimak can be made from cows' milk.\n\n==Georgia==\n[[File:Kaimaghi.jpg|thumb|A bucket containing kaimaghi in a home in Keda, Georgia.]]\nIn the [[Adjara]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], bordering Turkey, \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 or ''kaimaghi'' is made from cow milk in homes in the mountainous municipalities of [[Keda, Georgia|Keda]], [[Shuakhevi]], and [[Khulo]]. It is typically eaten with [[Georgian cheese]] and/or bread, and is only rarely served in restaurants.\n\n==Greece==\n''Kaimaki'' in [[Greece]] refers to mastic-flavored ice cream that is widely available and often served alongside traditional desserts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Malai]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928145321/http://editore.slowfood.com/editore/riviste/slowark/EN/25/papavero.html The Poppy Growers of \u0130smailk\u00f6y (2002)]\n* Davidson, Alan.

Chomedey's [[city hall]] became the city hall for all of Laval. The merger project was first launched by the administration of the city of L'Abord \u00e0 Plouffe. On August 10, 1960, it passed a resolution expressing its desire to merge the three municipalities and the city of [[Laval-des-Rapides]], under the name \"Cit\u00e9 de Laval\".\n\nEight days later, [[Laval-des-Rapides]], withdrew from the merger project. Hesitation was also felt the city of Renaud, where a referendum was held on the issue. On January 16, 1961 The referendum was won by the \"fusionist\", and the birth of the new city was celebrated by civic festivities, held from October 8 to 15, 1961.\n\nFrom then and onward, Chomedey stood out as a modern city, whose residential and industrial development excelled. The growth of Chomedey on the industrial front was rapid: the city had welcomed 1 new industry per month for 2 consecutive years, between 1962 and 1964.\n\nIn short, Chomedey quickly became a city in its own right. This amalgamated municipality was already expanding, shortly after its creation. In 1963, the new city studied the possibility of annexing her two neighbors, the towns of [[Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e, Quebec|Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e]] and [[Fabreville, Quebec|Fabreville]].\n\nIn 1964, the city inaugurated the new city hall. The building, designed according to the plans of the architects Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold and Sise, was to be part of an architectural ensemble that would constitute the Civic Center of Chomedey to house various services, including a library, a theater and an art center. The planned complex was not realized until the creation of the City of Laval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laval.ca/histoire-et-patrimoine/Pages/Fr/chomedey.aspx|title=La cr\u00e9ation de la cit\u00e9 de Chomedey |website=www.laval.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nChomedey is bordered on the south by the [[Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies]], on the east by [[Laval-des-Rapides]], [[Duvernay, Quebec|Duvernay]] and [[Vimont, Quebec|Vimont]], on the north by [[Sainte-Rose, Quebec|Sainte-Rose]], on the north-west by [[Fabreville, Quebec|Fabreville]] and on the west by [[Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e, Quebec|Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050407114402/http://www.ville.laval.qc.ca/geomatique/citoyens/viewer.htm?Service=Citoyens_hv Interactive map of Laval from the official website] Shows both the borders and names of the 14 former municipalities (purple) and the borders only of the current 6 sectors (maroon), tick off both boxes beside \"Limite administrative\".</ref>\n\nChomedey is bordered by the [[Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies|Prairies River]] to the South, approximately by [[Quebec Autoroute 13|Autoroute 13]] to the West, [[Quebec Autoroute 440 (Laval)|Autoroute 440]] to the North, [[Quebec route 335|Des Laurentides Boulevard]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 15|Autoroute 15]] to the East.\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince the 1960s, Chomedey is the most multicultural neighbourhood of Laval. It includes a large number of Jews, Christians, Muslims, Portuguese, Lebanese, Algerians, Moroccans, Syrians, Egyptians, Haitians, Italians, Armenians and the largest Greek community of Quebec. Mirroring the geographic linguistic divisions in [[Montreal]], there are more English-speakers in the west of [[Ile Jesus]] than in the east, and Chomedey has been home to the city's [[English-speaking Quebecker|Anglophone]] and allophone minorities, notably a large community of [[Greeks]].<ref>http://www.laval.ca/Documents/Pages/Fr/A-propos/cartes-statistiques-et-profil-socioeconomique/statistiques-et-profil-socioeconomique/recensement-laval-2011.pdf</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Home Language ([[Canada 2006 Census|2006]])<ref name=\"SC2006\">{{cite web|title=2006 Census: Data Products|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/index-eng.cfm|publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> \n!

Since 2000, it is not uncommon to find yourself in a traffic jam on many of main thoroughfares. Cur\u00e9-Labelle Blvd, Chomedey Blvd, Saint-Martin Blvd, Notre-Dame Blvd and Le Corbusier Blvd are often subject to traffic jams, but the creation of reserved bus lanes, an expanded bike path network as well as the extension of the Metro into Laval are all helping Chomedians to favor more sustainable transit alternatives.\n\nTraffic is a common problem, with many residents travelling to Montreal combined with Laurentians-Montreal commuter and cottage traffic.\n\n==Education==\n[[Commission scolaire de Laval]] operates French-language public schools.\n\nSecondary schools:\n* [[\u00c9cole secondaire Alphonse-Desjardins]]\n* [[\u00c9cole secondaire Saint-Martin]]\n* [[\u00c9cole secondaire Saint-Maxime]]\n* [[\u00c9cole d'\u00e9ducation internationale de Laval]]\n\nPrimary schools:\n* \u00c9cole primaire Coursol<ref>\"[http://www2.cslaval.qc.ca/spip.php?article44 Coursol].\" [[Commission scolaire de Laval]].

On January 16, 1961 The referendum was won by the \"fusionist\", and the birth of the new city was celebrated by civic festivities, held from October 8 to 15, 1961.\n\nFrom then and onward, Chomedey stood out as a modern city, whose residential and industrial development excelled. The growth of Chomedey on the industrial front was rapid: the city had welcomed 1 new industry per month for 2 consecutive years, between 1962 and 1964.\n\nIn short, Chomedey quickly became a city in its own right. This amalgamated municipality was already expanding, shortly after its creation. In 1963, the new city studied the possibility of annexing her two neighbors, the towns of [[Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e, Quebec|Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e]] and [[Fabreville, Quebec|Fabreville]].\n\nIn 1964, the city inaugurated the new city hall. The building, designed according to the plans of the architects Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold and Sise, was to be part of an architectural ensemble that would constitute the Civic Center of Chomedey to house various services, including a library, a theater and an art center. The planned complex was not realized until the creation of the City of Laval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laval.ca/histoire-et-patrimoine/Pages/Fr/chomedey.aspx|title=La cr\u00e9ation de la cit\u00e9 de Chomedey |website=www.laval.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nChomedey is bordered on the south by the [[Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies]], on the east by [[Laval-des-Rapides]], [[Duvernay, Quebec|Duvernay]] and [[Vimont, Quebec|Vimont]], on the north by [[Sainte-Rose, Quebec|Sainte-Rose]], on the north-west by [[Fabreville, Quebec|Fabreville]] and on the west by [[Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e, Quebec|Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050407114402/http://www.ville.laval.qc.ca/geomatique/citoyens/viewer.htm?Service=Citoyens_hv Interactive map of Laval from the official website] Shows both the borders and names of the 14 former municipalities (purple) and the borders only of the current 6 sectors (maroon), tick off both boxes beside \"Limite administrative\".</ref>\n\nChomedey is bordered by the [[Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies|Prairies River]] to the South, approximately by [[Quebec Autoroute 13|Autoroute 13]] to the West, [[Quebec Autoroute 440 (Laval)|Autoroute 440]] to the North, [[Quebec route 335|Des Laurentides Boulevard]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 15|Autoroute 15]] to the East.\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince the 1960s, Chomedey is the most multicultural neighborhood of Laval. It includes a large number of Jews, Christians, Muslims, Portuguese, Lebanese, Algerians, Moroccans, Syrians, Egyptians, Haitians, Italians, Armenians and the largest Greek community of Quebec. Mirroring the geographic linguistic divisions in [[Montreal]], there are more English-speakers in the west of [[Ile Jesus]] than in the east, and Chomedey has been home to the city's [[English-speaking Quebecker|Anglophone]] and allophone minorities, notably a large community of [[Greeks]].<ref>http://www.laval.ca/Documents/Pages/Fr/A-propos/cartes-statistiques-et-profil-socioeconomique/statistiques-et-profil-socioeconomique/recensement-laval-2011.pdf</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Home Language ([[Canada 2006 Census|2006]])<ref name=\"SC2006\">{{cite web|title=2006 Census: Data Products|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/index-eng.cfm|publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> \n!

Since 2000, it is not uncommon to find yourself in a traffic jam on many of main thoroughfares. Cur\u00e9-Labelle Blvd, Chomedey Blvd, Saint-Martin Blvd, Notre-Dame Blvd and Le Corbusier Blvd are often subject to traffic jams, but the creation of reserved bus lanes, an expanded bike path network as well as the extension of the Metro into Laval are all helping Chomedians to favor more sustainable transit alternatives.\n\nTraffic is a common problem, with many residents travelling to Montreal combined with Laurentians-Montreal commuter and cottage traffic.\n\n==Education==\n[[Commission scolaire de Laval]] operates French-language public schools.\n\nSecondary schools:\n* [[\u00c9cole secondaire Alphonse-Desjardins]]\n* [[\u00c9cole secondaire Saint-Martin]]\n* [[\u00c9cole secondaire Saint-Maxime]]\n* [[\u00c9cole d'\u00e9ducation internationale de Laval]]\n\nPrimary schools:\n* \u00c9cole primaire Coursol<ref>\"[http://www2.cslaval.qc.ca/spip.php?article44 Coursol].\" [[Commission scolaire de Laval]].
