The territories covered an area of {{cvt|118311|km\u00b2}}, with 10.4 million inhabitants.\n\nAttempts to create German-Austria under these auspices were ultimately unsuccessful, and the new state of the [[First Austrian Republic]] was created in 1919.\n\n== Creation ==\nIn [[Habsburg]] [[Austria-Hungary]], \"German-Austria\" was an unofficial term for the areas of the empire inhabited by Austrian [[Germans]].\n\nOn 12 October 1918 Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] met with the leaders of the largest German parties. German Nationalists wanted a constitutional monarchy of free nations; Christian Socialists wanted to maintain monarchy and a federation of nations; Social Democrats wanted a republic that would either be a part of a federation of nations or join Germany.\n\nOn 16 October 1918 Emperor Charles I published a manifesto which offered to change Austria-Hungary into a federation of nationalities. This came too late as [[Czechs]] and [[Southern Slavs]] were well on their way to creating independent states. However, this gave an impulse to the {{lang|de|Reichsrat}} (Austrian parliament) of German-inhabited areas to meet.\n\nWith the impending collapse of the empire, the 208 ethnic German deputies, elected in 1911 to the [[Cisleithania]]n {{lang|de|[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]}}, met on 21 October 1918 and proclaimed itself to be a \"Provisional National Assembly for German-Austria\" representing the ethnic Germans in all Cisleithanian lands. It elected [[Franz Dinghofer]] of the German National Movement, [[Jodok Fink]] of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], and [[Karl Seitz]] of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] as assembly presidents. The assembly included representatives from [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Austrian Silesia]] who refused to submit to the new state of [[Czechoslovakia]] which had been declared on 28 October 1918. It also proclaimed that \"the German people in Austria are resolved to determine their own future political organization to form an independent German-Austrian state, and to regulate their relations with other nations through free agreements with them\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.lv/books?id=VLSiAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA8&dq=republic+of+germany-austria+1918&hl=lv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig_4af8KrOAhVFFywKHTSUAuEQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&q=republic+of+germany-austria+1918&f=true|title=Post-war German-Austrian Relations: The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1936|first=Mary Margaret|last=Ball|publisher=Stanford University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> On 25 October Provisional Assembly called on all German inhabited Lands to form their own provisional assemblies.\n\nDuring its second meeting on 30 October the Provisional National Assembly created the basic institutions of the new state. The legislative power was assumed by the Provisional National Assembly while the executive power was entrusted to the newly created German-Austrian State Council.\n\nOn 11 November 1918, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] in all but name abdicated, by relinquishing his right to take part in Austrian affairs of state.\n\nThe next day, 12 November, the National Assembly officially declared German-Austria a republic and named Social Democrat [[Karl Renner]] as provisional [[chancellor of Austria|chancellor]]. On the same day it drafted a provisional constitution that stated that \"German-Austria is a democratic republic\" (Article 1) and \"German-Austria is an integral part of the German republic\" (Article 2).<ref>http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180000&page=26 Gesetz \u00fcber die Staatsform. StGBl. Nr. 484/1919</ref>  The latter provision reflected the deputies' view that felt that Austria would lose so much territory in any peace settlement that it would no longer be economically and politically viable as a separate state, and the only course was union with Germany. This was enforced by the refusal of Hungary to sell grain and of Czechoslovakia to sell coal to Austria-Germany.\n\nAs the Empire collapsed and a ceasefire was announced, the Provisional Assembly sought to forestall socialist revolution by organizing a coalition government led by the minority Social Democrats. Karl Renner became Chancellor and [[Victor Adler]] became Foreign Minister. The Social Democrats co-opted newly created soldier and worker councils and used their control over labour unions to implement social policies that blunted the socialist appeal.\n\n==Constitutional Assembly==\n[[1919 Austrian Constitutional Assembly election|Elections to the Constituent Assembly]] were held on 16 February 1919 and for the first time women were allowed to vote.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Out of the 38 German inhabited constituencies only 25 participated and 159 deputies were elected to the 170 seats with Social Democrats as the largest party. Social Democrats won 72 seats, Christians Socials 69 and German Nationalists 26. The Constituent National Assembly first met on 4 March 1919 and on 15 March a new government was formed, once again led by Karl Renner. Austrian Social Democrats, despite being one of the leading Marxist parties with its [[Austromarxism]] current, did not attempt to seize power or to institute socialism. However, the majority of conservative, Catholic politicians still distrusted them and this led to the fatal left-right split that plagued the First Republic and led to its downfall by 1934.\n\nSocial Democrat leader [[Otto Bauer]] wrote: \"German-Austria is not an organism which has followed the laws of historical growth. It is nothing but the remnant of what remained of the old Empire after other nations had broken away from it. It remained as a loose bundle of divergent Lands.\"<ref name=\"Barker1973\">{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Elisabeth|authorlink1=Elisabeth Barker |title=Austria 1918\u20131972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elGuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4|year=1973|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-01429-3|page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Failed union with Germany===\nOn 13 November 1918, German-Austria asked Germany to start negotiations of union and on 15 November sent a telegram to President Wilson to support union of Germany and Austria. This was grounded in the view that Austria had never been a nation in the true sense. While the Austrian state had existed in one form or another for over 700 years (dating to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]), its only unifying force had been the Habsburgs. Apart from being German-inhabited, these Lands had no common \"Austrian\" identity. They were Habsburg-ruled lands that had not joined the Prussian-dominated German Empire after the Austrian Empire lost the [[Austro-Prussian War]].\n\nOn 12 March 1919, the Constituent Assembly re-confirmed an earlier declaration that German-Austria was a constituent part of the German republic. Pan-Germans and Social Democrats supported the union with Germany, while Christian Socialists were less supportive.\n\nDuring spring and summer of 1919, unity talk meetings between German and Austrian representatives continued. All this changed after 2 June 1919 when the draft peace treaty with Austria was presented, which demonstrated that the Western Allies were opposed to any union between Germany and Austria.\n\n===Treaty of Saint Germain===\nAfter submitting a formal note of protest to the Allies against blocking German-Austrian union, on 10 September 1919 Renner signed the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] and it was ratified by the Constituent National Assembly on 17 October. According to its provisions, on 21 October the country changed its name from \"German-Austria\" to \"Republic of Austria\".  It also lost the Sudetenland and German Bohemia to Czechoslovakia, South Tyrol to Italy, and southern Carinthia and Styria to Yugoslavia.\n\nArticle 88 of the treaty, sometimes called a \"pre-''[[Anschluss]]'' attempt\", stated:\n\n{{quote|The independence of Austria is inalienable otherwise than with the consent of the Council of the [[League of Nations]]. Consequently Austria undertakes in the absence of the consent of the said Council to abstain from any act which might directly or indirectly or by any means whatsoever compromise her independence, particularly, and until her admission to membership of the League of Nations, by participation in the affairs of another Power.}}\n\nThis clause effectively foreclosed any attempt by Austria to unite with Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1920/3.html |title=Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Austria; Protocol, Declaration and Special Declaration [1920&#93; ATS 3 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, the [[Treaty of Versailles]], dictating the terms of peace for Germany, forbade any union between Austria and Germany. With these changes and the settling of Austria's frontiers, the era of the [[Republic of Austria (1919\u20131934)|First Republic of Austria]] began.\n\n==Borders==\n{{See also|Austro-Slovene conflict in Carinthia}}\n\nGerman-Austria claimed sovereignty over all the majority-German territory of the former Habsburg realm: a total area of {{convert|118311|km2|abbr=on}} with 10.4 million inhabitants.  This included nearly all the territory of present-day [[Austria]], plus [[South Tyrol]] and the town of [[Tarvisio]], both now in Italy; southern [[Carinthia (Slovenia)|Carinthia]] and southern [[Styria]], now in [[Slovenia]]; [[Sudetenland]] and [[German Bohemia]] (which later became part of [[Sudetenland]]), now in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[East Silesia]] (now divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia). In practice, however, its authority was limited to the Danubian and Alpine provinces of the old Habsburg realm\u2014with few exceptions, most of present-day Austria.\n\nOn 22 November, the national assembly officially laid claim to all ethnic German areas of Cisleithania. However, the [[Allies of World War I]] opposed such a move and German-Austria was largely powerless to resist the forces of Italy, [[Czechoslovakia]], and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] from seizing some of its territory.\n\nCountries on the winning side of the war took many territories with German majorities. The Czechs ignored principles of ethnic borders and insisted on the historic borders of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]; thus three million Germans became Czechoslovak citizens, an indirect precipitant of the [[Sudetenland]] crisis 20 years later. A victor nation, Italy occupied and was awarded [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol|Trentino and South Tyrol]], of which South Tyrol is still majority German-speaking. Yugoslavia was given parts of [[Carinthia]] and [[Styria]]. The Klagenfurt region was retained after a  [[1920 Carinthian plebiscite|plebiscite on 20 October 1920]], when three-fifths of voters voted to remain with Austria.\n\nLater [[plebiscite]]s in the provinces of Tyrol and Salzburg yielded majorities of 98 and 99% in favor of a unification with Germany whereas [[History of Vorarlberg|Vorarlberg]] in May 1919 held a plebiscite where 81% supported accession to Switzerland.\n\nSeveral German minority populations in [[Moravia]], including German populations in Br\u00fcnn ([[Brno]]), Iglau ([[Jihlava]]) and Olm\u00fctz ([[Olomouc]]), as well as the German enclave of [[Gottschee]] in [[Carniola]] also attempted to proclaim their union with German-Austria, but failed. The areas now outside of the current Republic of Austria often had significant non-German minorities and occasionally non-German majorities and were quickly taken by troops of the respective countries they were to eventually join.\n\nRegarding [[East Silesia]], plans for a plebiscite fell through, and the area was divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n\nOn the other hand, ethnic Germans in the western part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] that formed a majority in the area known as [[German West Hungary]] and agitated to join to Austria were successful and the area became the state of [[Burgenland]], with the notable exception of the region around the city of [[\u00d6denburg]] (Sopron) which was also intended to be the state capital, but due to a very contentious plebiscite, remained part of Hungary. The only other part of the former German counties of Burgenland in the Kingdom of Hungary also not to become part of the Austrian Republic due to the treaty was Pre\u00dfburg ([[Bratislava]]) which went to Czechoslovakia (now the capital of [[Slovakia]]).\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nGerman-Austria originally consisted of nine provinces ({{lang|de|Provinzen}}):\n#[[Upper Austria]] ({{lang|de|Ober\u00f6sterreich}}), all of the current Austrian state of Upper Austria plus the [[Bohemian Forest region]] ({{lang|de|B\u00f6hmerwaldgau}}) now in the [[South Bohemian Region]] of the Czech Republic;\n#[[Lower Austria]] ({{lang|de|Nieder\u00f6sterreich}}), all of the current Austrian state of Lower Austria and the city-state of Vienna, plus [[German South Moravia]] ({{lang|de|Deutschs\u00fcdm\u00e4hren}}), now divided between the Czech regions of South Bohemia, [[Vyso\u010dina Region|Vyso\u010dina]], and [[South Moravian Region|South Moravia]];\n#[[German Bohemia]] ({{lang|de|Deutschb\u00f6hmen}}), areas of western Bohemia that were later part of Sudetenland from 1938\u201345, now part of the Czech Republic;\n#[[Province of the Sudetenland|Sudetenland]], parts of the historical regions of [[Moravia]] and [[Austrian Silesia]].

The territories covered an area of {{cvt|118311|km\u00b2}}, with 10.4 million inhabitants.\n\nAttempts to create German-Austria under these auspices were ultimately unsuccessful, and the new state of the [[First Austrian Republic]] was created in 1919.\n\n== Creation ==\nIn [[Habsburg]] [[Austria-Hungary]], \"German-Austria\" was an unofficial term for the areas of the empire inhabited by Austrian [[Germans]].\n\nOn 12 October 1918 Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] met with the leaders of the largest German parties. German Nationalists wanted a constitutional monarchy of free nations; Christian Socialists wanted to maintain monarchy and a federation of nations; Social Democrats wanted a republic that would either be a part of a federation of nations or join Germany.\n\nOn 16 October 1918 Emperor Charles I published a manifesto which offered to change Austria-Hungary into a federation of nationalities. This came too late as [[Czechs]] and [[Southern Slavs]] were well on their way to creating independent states. However, this gave an impulse to the {{lang|de|Reichsrat}} (Austrian parliament) of German-inhabited areas to meet.\n\nWith the impending collapse of the empire, the 208 ethnic German deputies, elected in 1911 to the [[Cisleithania]]n {{lang|de|[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]}}, met on 21 October 1918 and proclaimed itself to be a \"Provisional National Assembly for German-Austria\" representing the ethnic Germans in all Cisleithanian lands. It elected [[Franz Dinghofer]] of the German National Movement, [[Jodok Fink]] of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], and [[Karl Seitz]] of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] as assembly presidents. The assembly included representatives from [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Austrian Silesia]] who refused to submit to the new state of [[Czechoslovakia]] which had been declared on 28 October 1918. It also proclaimed that \"the German people in Austria are resolved to determine their own future political organization to form an independent German-Austrian state, and to regulate their relations with other nations through free agreements with them\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.lv/books?id=VLSiAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA8&dq=republic+of+germany-austria+1918&hl=lv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig_4af8KrOAhVFFywKHTSUAuEQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&q=republic+of+germany-austria+1918&f=true|title=Post-war German-Austrian Relations: The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1936|first=Mary Margaret|last=Ball|publisher=Stanford University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> On 25 October Provisional Assembly called on all German inhabited Lands to form their own provisional assemblies.\n\nDuring its second meeting on 30 October the Provisional National Assembly created the basic institutions of the new state. The legislative power was assumed by the Provisional National Assembly while the executive power was entrusted to the newly created German-Austrian State Council.\n\nOn 11 November 1918, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] in all but name abdicated, by relinquishing his right to take part in Austrian affairs of state.\n\nThe next day, 12 November, the National Assembly officially declared German-Austria a republic and named Social Democrat [[Karl Renner]] as provisional [[chancellor of Austria|chancellor]]. On the same day it drafted a provisional constitution that stated that \"German-Austria is a democratic republic\" (Article 1) and \"German-Austria is an integral part of the German republic\" (Article 2).<ref>http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180000&page=26 Gesetz \u00fcber die Staatsform. StGBl. Nr. 484/1919</ref>  The latter provision reflected the deputies' view that felt that Austria would lose so much territory in any peace settlement that it would no longer be economically and politically viable as a separate state, and the only course was union with Germany. This was enforced by the refusal of Hungary to sell grain and of Czechoslovakia to sell coal to Austria-Germany.\n\nAs the Empire collapsed and a ceasefire was announced, the Provisional Assembly sought to forestall socialist revolution by organizing a coalition government led by the minority Social Democrats. Karl Renner became Chancellor and [[Victor Adler]] became Foreign Minister. The Social Democrats co-opted newly created soldier and worker councils and used their control over labour unions to implement social policies that blunted the socialist appeal.\n\n==Constitutional Assembly==\n[[1919 Austrian Constitutional Assembly election|Elections to the Constituent Assembly]] were held on 16 February 1919 and for the first time women were allowed to vote.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Out of the 38 German inhabited constituencies only 25 participated and 159 deputies were elected to the 170 seats with Social Democrats as the largest party. Social Democrats won 72 seats, Christians Socials 69 and German Nationalists 26. The Constituent National Assembly first met on 4 March 1919 and on 15 March a new government was formed, once again led by Karl Renner. Austrian Social Democrats, despite being one of the leading Marxist parties with its [[Austromarxism]] current, did not attempt to seize power or to institute socialism. However, the majority of conservative, Catholic politicians still distrusted them and this led to the fatal left-right split that plagued the First Republic and led to its downfall by 1934.\n\nSocial Democrat leader [[Otto Bauer]] wrote: \"German-Austria is not an organism which has followed the laws of historical growth. It is nothing but the remnant of what remained of the old Empire after other nations had broken away from it. It remained as a loose bundle of divergent Lands.\"<ref name=\"Barker1973\">{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Elisabeth|authorlink1=Elisabeth Barker |title=Austria 1918\u20131972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elGuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4|year=1973|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-01429-3|page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Failed union with Germany===\nOn 13 November 1918, German-Austria asked Germany to start negotiations of union and on 15 November sent a telegram to President Wilson to support union of Germany and Austria. This was grounded in the view that Austria had never been a nation in the true sense. While the Austrian state had existed in one form or another for over 700 years (dating to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]), its only unifying force had been the Habsburgs. Apart from being German-inhabited, these Lands had no common \"Austrian\" identity. They were Habsburg-ruled lands that had not joined the Prussian-dominated German Empire after the Austrian Empire lost the [[Austro-Prussian War]].\n\nOn 12 March 1919, the Constituent Assembly re-confirmed an earlier declaration that German-Austria was a constituent part of the German republic. Pan-Germans and Social Democrats supported the union with Germany, while Christian Socialists were less supportive.\n\nDuring spring and summer of 1919, unity talk meetings between German and Austrian representatives continued. All this changed after 2 June 1919 when the draft peace treaty with Austria was presented, which demonstrated that the Western Allies were opposed to any union between Germany and Austria.\n\n===Treaty of Saint Germain===\nAfter submitting a formal note of protest to Allies against blocking German-Austrian union, on 10 September 1919 Renner signed the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] and it was ratified by the Constituent National Assembly on 17 October. According to its provisions, on 21 October the country changed its name from \"German-Austria\" to \"Republic of Austria\".  It also lost the Sudetenland and German Bohemia to Czechoslovakia, South Tyrol to Italy, and southern Carinthia and Styria to Yugoslavia.\n\nArticle 88 of the treaty, sometimes called a \"pre-''[[Anschluss]]'' attempt\", stated:\n\n{{quote|The independence of Austria is inalienable otherwise than with the consent of the Council of the [[League of Nations]]. Consequently Austria undertakes in the absence of the consent of the said Council to abstain from any act which might directly or indirectly or by any means whatsoever compromise her independence, particularly, and until her admission to membership of the League of Nations, by participation in the affairs of another Power.}}\n\nThis clause effectively foreclosed any attempt by Austria to unite with Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1920/3.html |title=Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Austria; Protocol, Declaration and Special Declaration [1920&#93; ATS 3 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, the [[Treaty of Versailles]], dictating the terms of peace for Germany, forbade any union between Austria and Germany. With these changes and the settling of Austria's frontiers, the era of the [[Republic of Austria (1919\u20131934)|First Republic of Austria]] began.\n\n==Borders==\n{{See also|Austro-Slovene conflict in Carinthia}}\n\nGerman-Austria claimed sovereignty over all the majority-German territory of the former Habsburg realm: a total area of {{convert|118311|km2|abbr=on}} with 10.4 million inhabitants.  This included nearly all the territory of present-day [[Austria]], plus [[South Tyrol]] and the town of [[Tarvisio]], both now in Italy; southern [[Carinthia (Slovenia)|Carinthia]] and southern [[Styria]], now in [[Slovenia]]; [[Sudetenland]] and [[German Bohemia]] (which later became part of [[Sudetenland]]), now in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[East Silesia]] (now divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia). In practice, however, its authority was limited to the Danubian and Alpine provinces of the old Habsburg realm\u2014with few exceptions, most of present-day Austria.\n\nOn 22 November, the national assembly officially laid claim to all ethnic German areas of Cisleithania. However, the [[Allies of World War I]] opposed such a move and German-Austria was largely powerless to resist the forces of Italy, [[Czechoslovakia]], and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] from seizing some of its territory.\n\nCountries on the winning side of the war took many territories with German majorities. The Czechs ignored principles of ethnic borders and insisted on the historic borders of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]; thus three million Germans became Czechoslovak citizens, an indirect precipitant of the [[Sudetenland]] crisis 20 years later. A victor nation, Italy occupied and was awarded [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol|Trentino and South Tyrol]], of which South Tyrol is still majority German-speaking. Yugoslavia was given parts of [[Carinthia]] and [[Styria]]. The Klagenfurt region was retained after a  [[1920 Carinthian plebiscite|plebiscite on 20 October 1920]], when three-fifths of voters voted to remain with Austria.\n\nLater [[plebiscite]]s in the provinces of Tyrol and Salzburg yielded majorities of 98 and 99% in favor of a unification with Germany whereas [[History of Vorarlberg|Vorarlberg]] in May 1919 held a plebiscite where 81% supported accession to Switzerland.\n\nSeveral German minority populations in [[Moravia]], including German populations in Br\u00fcnn ([[Brno]]), Iglau ([[Jihlava]]) and Olm\u00fctz ([[Olomouc]]), as well as the German enclave of [[Gottschee]] in [[Carniola]] also attempted to proclaim their union with German-Austria, but failed. The areas now outside of the current Republic of Austria often had significant non-German minorities and occasionally non-German majorities and were quickly taken by troops of the respective countries they were to eventually join.\n\nRegarding [[East Silesia]], plans for a plebiscite fell through, and the area was divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n\nOn the other hand, ethnic Germans in the western part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] that formed a majority in the area known as [[German West Hungary]] and agitated to join to Austria were successful and the area became the state of [[Burgenland]], with the notable exception of the region around the city of [[\u00d6denburg]] (Sopron) which was also intended to be the state capital, but due to a very contentious plebiscite, remained part of Hungary.

A [[color tool]] or other [[graphics software]] is often used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading [[number sign]] (#).<ref>{{cite book | last = Niederst Robbins | first = Jennifer | title = Web Design in a Nutshell | publisher = O'Reilly |date=February 2006 |page=830 | isbn = 978-0-596-00987-8 |chapter=Appendix D: Specifying Color }}</ref><ref>York, Richard.

[[User agent]]s vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for [[Web-to-print]] applications.\n\n==Hex triplet==\nA '''hex triplet''' is a six-digit, three-[[byte]] [[hexadecimal]] number used in [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the [[24-bit color|24-bit RGB color scheme]]. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:\n*Byte 1: red value (color type red)\n*Byte 2: green value (color type green)\n*Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)\nFor example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.\n\nIf any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.\n\nThe number of colors that can be represented by this system is 16<sup>6</sup> or 256<sup>3</sup> or 2<sup>24</sup> = 16,777,216.\n\n===Shorthand hexadecimal form===\nAn abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.2.1.

This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See [[hexadecimal]] for more details). The remainder gives the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.\n\nConversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern [[operating system]]s. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.\n\n==HTML color names==\nThe [[HTML]] 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, defines 16 named colors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=HTML 4.01 Specification section 6.5 \"Colors\"|date=|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):\n{{Colornames}}\n\nThese 16 were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were \"the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] palette.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#body |title=HTML 3.2 Specification \"The BODY element\" |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==X11 color names==\n[[File:SVG Recognized color keyword names.svg|thumbnail|SVG Version of X11 color names]]\n{{main|X11 color names}}\nA number of colors are defined by [[web browser]]s. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of [[X11 color names]] distributed with the [[X Window System]]. These colors were standardized by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG 1.0]], and are accepted by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Full]] user agents. They are not part of [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Tiny]].\n\nThe list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple [[RGB color model|RGB]] (hence, no particular color space), rather than [[sRGB]]. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2002Apr/0052.html |title=Public discussion on SVG mailing list ''Re: color names in SVG-1.0 conflict with /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt'' |publisher=Lists.w3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe list of web \"X11 colors\" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below.

When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not one available, a different one had to be used. This can be done by either using the closest color, or by using [[dither]]ing.\n\nThere were various attempts to make a \"standard\" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).\n\nThe list of colors is presented as if it had special properties that render them immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications can actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they choose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Another editor left a comment stating, &quot;not really, it was pretty much a disaster&quot; - Why? Please clarify}}\n\n\"Web-safe\" colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as [[X Window System|X11]] where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5\u00d75\u00d75 or 4\u00d74\u00d74) were allocated by browsers\u2014the \"web safe\" colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to [[Color quantization|quantize]] the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, personal computers typically<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp |title=Browser Display Statistics |publisher=W3schools.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> have 24-bit ([[24-bit color|TrueColor]]) and the use of \"web-safe\" colors has fallen into practical disuse.\n\nThe \"web-safe\" colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an [[RGB]] triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ 6 shades of each color\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Hex\n! scope=\"col\" | Decimal\n! scope=\"col\" | Fraction\n|-\n| 0\n| 00\n| 0\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0\n|-\n| 3\n| 33\n| 51\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.2\n|-\n| 6\n| 66\n| 102\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.4\n|-\n| 9\n| 99\n| 153\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.6\n|-\n| C or (12)\n| CC\n| 204\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.8\n|-\n| F or (15)\n| FF\n| 255\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 1\n|}\n\nThe following table shows all of the \"web-safe\" colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish.\n\n===Color table===\n{{Web safe colors}}\n\n===Safest web colors===\nDesigners were encouraged to stick to these 216 \"web-safe\" colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on [[highcolour|16-bit computer displays]]. They called these 22 colors \"the reallysafe palette\"; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and blue, as can be seen in the table below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/color/websafecolors.html |title=Death of the Websafe Color Palette? |publisher=Physics.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%; color:white; width:80%; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|+ style=\"color: black;\" | Safest web colors\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!\n!0\n!3\n!6\n!9\n!C\n!F\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |00\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #000;\" | *000*\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%;\" |\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F00;\" | *F00*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |03\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #003;\" | *003*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F03;\" | *F03*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |0F\n| style=\"background: #00F;\" | *00F*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #F0F;\" | *F0F*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F0\n| style=\"background: #0F0;\" | *0F0*\n|\n| style=\"background: #6F0;\" | *6F0*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FF0;\" | *FF0*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F3\n|\n| style=\"background: #3F3;\" | *3F3*\n| style=\"background: #6F3;\" | *6F3*\n|\n|\n| style=\" background: #FF3;\" | *FF3*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F6\n| style=\"background: #0F6;\" | *0F6*\n| style=\"background: #3F6;\" | *3F6*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #CF6;\" | *CF6*\n| style=\"background: #FF6;\" | *FF6*<ref>{{cite web|title = Web Color Reference - HTML with Style {{!}} 4 {{!}} WebReference|url = http://www.webreference.com/html/reference/color/websafe.html|website = www.webreference.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}</ref>\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FC\n| style=\"background: #0FC;\" | *0FC*\n| style=\"background: #3FC;\" | *3FC*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FF\n| style=\"background: #0FF;\" | *0FF*\n| style=\"background: #3FF;\" | *3FF*\n| style=\"background: #6FF;\" | *6FF*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FFF;\" | *FFF*\n|}\n\n==CSS colors==\nThe [[Cascading Style Sheets]] specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 [[#HTML color names|html colors]], and 124 colors from the Netscape [[#X11 color names|X11 color]] list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html |title=The X11 Color Set |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref> Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape's expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/color/colors.htm |title=Colors in HTML and CSS |author=Brian Wilson |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn CSS 2.1, the color 'orange' (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#color-units |title=CSS 2.1 Specification: Syntax and basic data types: Colors |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2009 }}</ref> The CSS3.0 specification did not include ''orange'' in the \"HTML4 color keywords\" section, which was renamed as \"Basic color keywords\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/PR-css3-color-20101028/#changes |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 \u2013  Proposed Recommendation - 11.

[[User agent]]s vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for [[Web-to-print]] applications.\n\n==Hex triplet==\nA '''hex triplet''' is a six-digit, three-[[byte]] [[hexadecimal]] number used in [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the [[24-bit color|24-bit RGB color scheme]]. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:\n*Byte 1: red value (color type red)\n*Byte 2: green value (color type green)\n*Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)\nFor example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.\n\nIf any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.\n\nThe number of colors that can be represented by this system is 16<sup>6</sup> or 256<sup>3</sup> or 2<sup>24</sup> = 16,777,216.\n\n===Shorthand hexadecimal form===\nAn abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.2.1.

David |editor3-last=Baron |first1=Steven |last1=Pemberton |first2=Brad |last2=Pettit |accessdate=19 March 2013 }}</ref> Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC as presented on the following [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] example:\n\n<source lang=\"css\">\n.threedigit { color: #09C;    }\n.sixdigit   { color: #0099CC; } /* same color as above */\n</source>\n\nThis shorthand form reduces the palette to 4,096 colors, equivalent of 12-bit color as opposed to 24-bit color using the whole six-digit form (16,777,216 colors), this limitation is sufficient for many text based documents.\n\n===Converting RGB to hexadecimal===\n{{See also|Hexadecimal#Conversion}}\nRGB values are usually given in the 0\u2013255 range; if they are in the 0\u20131 range, the values are multiplied by 255 before conversion. This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See [[hexadecimal]] for more details). The remainder gives the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.\n\nConversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern [[operating system]]s. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.\n\n==HTML color names==\nThe [[HTML]] 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, defines 16 named colors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=HTML 4.01 Specification section 6.5 \"Colors\"|date=|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):\n{{Colornames}}\n\nThese 16 were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were \"the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] palette.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#body |title=HTML 3.2 Specification \"The BODY element\" |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==X11 color names==\n[[File:SVG Recognized color keyword names.svg|thumbnail|SVG Version of X11 color names]]\n{{main|X11 color names}}\nA number of colors are defined by [[web browser]]s. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of [[X11 color names]] distributed with the [[X Window System]]. These colors were standardized by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG 1.0]], and are accepted by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Full]] user agents. They are not part of [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Tiny]].\n\nThe list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple [[RGB color model|RGB]] (hence, no particular color space), rather than [[sRGB]]. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2002Apr/0052.html |title=Public discussion on SVG mailing list ''Re: color names in SVG-1.0 conflict with /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt'' |publisher=Lists.w3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe list of web \"X11 colors\" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below.

When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not one available, a different one had to be used. This can be done by either using the closest color, or by using [[dither]]ing.\n\nThere were various attempts to make a \"standard\" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).\n\nThe list of colors is presented as if it had special properties that render them immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications can actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they choose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Another editor left a comment stating, &quot;not really, it was pretty much a disaster&quot; - Why? Please clarify}}\n\n\"Web-safe\" colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as [[X Window System|X11]] where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5\u00d75\u00d75 or 4\u00d74\u00d74) were allocated by browsers\u2014the \"web safe\" colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to [[Color quantization|quantize]] the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, personal computers typically<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp |title=Browser Display Statistics |publisher=W3schools.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> have 24-bit ([[24-bit color|TrueColor]]) and the use of \"web-safe\" colors has fallen into practical disuse.\n\nThe \"web-safe\" colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an [[RGB]] triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ 6 shades of each color\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Hex\n! scope=\"col\" | Decimal\n! scope=\"col\" | Fraction\n|-\n| 0\n| 00\n| 0\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0\n|-\n| 3\n| 33\n| 51\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.2\n|-\n| 6\n| 66\n| 102\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.4\n|-\n| 9\n| 99\n| 153\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.6\n|-\n| C or (12)\n| CC\n| 204\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.8\n|-\n| F or (15)\n| FF\n| 255\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 1\n|}\n\nThe following table shows all of the \"web-safe\" colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish.\n\n===Color table===\n{{Web safe colors}}\n\n===Safest web colors===\nDesigners were encouraged to stick to these 216 \"web-safe\" colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on [[highcolour|16-bit computer displays]]. They called these 22 colors \"the reallysafe palette\"; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and blue, as can be seen in the table below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/color/websafecolors.html |title=Death of the Websafe Color Palette? |publisher=Physics.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%; color:white; width:80%; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|+ style=\"color: black;\" | Safest web colors\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!\n!0\n!3\n!6\n!9\n!C\n!F\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |00\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #000;\" | *000*\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%;\" |\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F00;\" | *F00*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |03\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #003;\" | *003*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F03;\" | *F03*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |0F\n| style=\"background: #00F;\" | *00F*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #F0F;\" | *F0F*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F0\n| style=\"background: #0F0;\" | *0F0*\n|\n| style=\"background: #6F0;\" | *6F0*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FF0;\" | *FF0*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F3\n|\n| style=\"background: #3F3;\" | *3F3*\n| style=\"background: #6F3;\" | *6F3*\n|\n|\n| style=\" background: #FF3;\" | *FF3*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F6\n| style=\"background: #0F6;\" | *0F6*\n| style=\"background: #3F6;\" | *3F6*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #CF6;\" | *CF6*\n| style=\"background: #FF6;\" | *FF6*<ref>{{cite web|title = Web Color Reference - HTML with Style {{!}} 4 {{!}} WebReference|url = http://www.webreference.com/html/reference/color/websafe.html|website = www.webreference.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}</ref>\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FC\n| style=\"background: #0FC;\" | *0FC*\n| style=\"background: #3FC;\" | *3FC*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FF\n| style=\"background: #0FF;\" | *0FF*\n| style=\"background: #3FF;\" | *3FF*\n| style=\"background: #6FF;\" | *6FF*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FFF;\" | *FFF*\n|}\n\n==CSS colors==\nThe [[Cascading Style Sheets]] specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 [[#HTML color names|html colors]], and 124 colors from the Netscape [[#X11 color names|X11 color]] list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html |title=The X11 Color Set |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref> Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape's expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/color/colors.htm |title=Colors in HTML and CSS |author=Brian Wilson |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn CSS 2.1, the color 'orange' (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#color-units |title=CSS 2.1 Specification: Syntax and basic data types: Colors |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2009 }}</ref> The CSS3.0 specification did not include ''orange'' in the \"HTML4 color keywords\" section, which was renamed as \"Basic color keywords\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/PR-css3-color-20101028/#changes |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 \u2013  Proposed Recommendation - 11.

These writers worked under pseudonyms, often changing them after several episodes to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n\nAs well, pseudonyms were sometimes shared between writers, or traded from one writer to another.  In particular, the names \"John Dyson\" and \"Neil R. Collins\" appear to have been assigned to various writers with no special affiliation to any one writer or writing team.\n\n*[[Ring Lardner, Jr.]] wrote the first episode under the name Lawrence McClellan.  This was later changed to the name Eric Heath for UK broadcast.\n*Ring Lardner, Jr. and [[Ian McLellan Hunter]] used a variety of pseudonyms when working individually or collaboratively.  Lardner's notes credit the following pseudonyms to work done by Lardner and/or Hunter:  Eric Heath, Oliver Skene, Samuel B. West, Ian Larkin, John Dyson, Leighton Reynolds, Paul Symonds, Neil R. Collins.\n*[[Waldo Salt]] wrote episodes under the name Arthur Behr, John Dyson and Neil R.

The name Leslie Poynton was used on several episodes; it is unknown which other writers may have used this pseudonym.\n*[[Robert Lees]] wrote several episodes, according to Lardner's papers, as John Dyson.  It has been suggested that C. Douglas Phipps (credited writer of episode 30) is another Lees pseudonym, although this is not confirmed.\n\n===Series 1 (1955\u201356)===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n!style=\"background:#BFF0FF; width:20px\"|N\u00ba\n!style=\"background:#BFF0FF; width:20px\"|Ep \n!style=\"background:#BFF0FF\"|Title\n!style=\"background:#BFF0FF\"|Director\n!style=\"background:#BFF0FF\"|Screenplay\n!style=\"background:#BFF0FF; width:135px\"|Original air date\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=The Coming of Robin Hood\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1955|9|25|df=y}}\n|WrittenBy=Lawrence McClellan (on US prints) <br> Eric Heath (on UK prints) <br>(pseudonym of [[Ring Lardner, Jr.]])\n|DirectedBy=[[Ralph Smart]]\n|ShortSummary=INTRODUCTORY MINSTREL SONG: \"Robin of Locksley, a knight bold and good; back from the Holy Wars, becomes Robin Hood!\" <br />SUMMARY: Sir Robin of Locksley returns to England from fighting in the Crusades to discover that the notorious Sir Roger de Lille ([[Leo McKern]]) has been given his family's lands and castles, and has had Robin declared an outlaw.

In particular, the names \"John Dyson\" and \"Neil R. Collins\" appear to have been assigned to various writers with no special affiliation to any one writer or writing team.\n\n*[[Ring Lardner, Jr.]] wrote the first episode under the name Lawrence McClellan.  This was later changed to the name Eric Heath for UK broadcast.\n*Ring Lardner, Jr. and [[Ian McLellan Hunter]] used a variety of pseudonyms when working individually or collaboratively.

It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nCroatia has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into [[Duchy of Croatia|two duchies]] by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Stuart Foster and Keith Crawford, \u2018Introduction: The Critical Importance of History Textbook Research\u2019, in: What Shall We Tell the Children? : International Perspectives on School History Textbooks, eds.

In response,  a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] developed. This led to the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]], which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nA [[sovereign state]], Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\nCroatia is classified by the World Bank as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] country and ranked 46th on the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2019 |publisher=UNDP|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The [[Croatia's economy|economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]], [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture.

It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nCroatia has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into [[Duchy of Croatia|two duchies]] by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Stuart Foster and Keith Crawford, \u2018Introduction: The Critical Importance of History Textbook Research\u2019, in: What Shall We Tell the Children? : International Perspectives on School History Textbooks, eds.

In response,  a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] developed. This led to the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]], which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nA [[sovereign state]], Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\nCroatia is classified by the World Bank as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] country and ranked 46th on the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2019 |publisher=UNDP|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The [[Croatia's economy|economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]], [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture.
