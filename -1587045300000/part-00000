Porter said in an interview with Ted Haring in 1971 \"But, oh, we had buzz bombs like mad!  Boy!  We had\nthree or four a week while we were over there.\" After entertaning troops in England they went to France, just after [[D Day]]. On the tour with them was [[Dinah Shore]] and [[Edward G Robinson]]. Porter said \"And we gave a big show up on the hill from the beach that night.  And you should have seen the guys!  Well, you've seen the Bob Hope things on TV.  Well, they were spread out acres of guys!  It was the most thrilling thing in the world!  And, oh, did they enjoy it!  Dinah, she was terrific!  In fact, when we first got on the beach, she stood up on the side of a truck and sang five or six (or maybe more) songs, with no accompaniment or anything, for the guys that gathered around.  Other trucks were going by, and the dust was flying.  How she sang in that dust, I'll never know!  Great gal.  Wonderful gal.\" From there the Slickers separated from Shore and Robinson, going out by themselves to entertain.  Porter reported \"We were with the Ninth Air Corps all the time we were in France, playing one landing strip after another.  We had our base camp at one, and we'd start out in the morning, real early.  And at lunch time we'd play one, oh, probably 60 miles away.  We'd have lunch there, and then we'd go on, play one mid-afternoon, and then some place else and play one in the evening.  And then, coming back to our base camp after dark, with no lights but -- you know what cat eyes are on a truck?  They're just a little strip of light.  That's all the light we had.  And these green drivers, these guys that didn't know where they were (Laughs), it was real exciting!  Believe me!  And we had to have a password, every so often.  Somebody would stop us, and you'd have to know the password.  If the guy in the truck ever forgot the password, it was too bad!\"<ref>Ted Hering, interview with Del Porter 1971, Cool and Strange Music magazine, Issue # 16, 1999  </ref>\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"book\">''Spike Jones off the record: The Man Who Murdered Music,'' by Jordan R.

Porter said in an interview with Ted Haring in 1971 \"But, oh, we had buzz bombs like mad!  Boy!  We had\nthree or four a week while we were over there.\" After entertaning troops in England they went to France, just after [[D Day]]. On the tour with them was [[Dinah Shore]] and [[Edward G Robinson]]. Porter said \"And we gave a big show up on the hill from the beach that night.  And you should have seen the guys!  Well, you've seen the Bob Hope things on TV.  Well, they were spread out acres of guys!  It was the most thrilling thing in the world!  And, oh, did they enjoy it!  Dinah, she was terrific!  In fact, when we first got on the beach, she stood up on the side of a truck and sang five or six (or maybe more) songs, with no accompaniment or anything, for the guys that gathered around.  Other trucks were going by, and the dust was flying.  How she sang in that dust, I'll never know!  Great gal.  Wonderful gal.\" From there the Slickers separated from Shore and Robinson, going out by themselves to entertain.  Porter reported \"We were with the Ninth Air Corps all the time we were in France, playing one landing strip after another.  We had our base camp at one, and we'd start out in the morning, real early.  And at lunch time we'd play one, oh, probably 60 miles away.  We'd have lunch there, and then we'd go on, play one mid-afternoon, and then some place else and play one in the evening.  And then, coming back to our base camp after dark, with no lights but -- you know what cat eyes are on a truck?  They're just a little strip of light.  That's all the light we had.  And these green drivers, these guys that didn't know where they were (Laughs), it was real exciting!  Believe me!  And we had to have a password, every so often.  Somebody would stop us, and you'd have to know the password.  If the guy in the truck ever forgot the password, it was too bad!\"<ref>Ted Hering, interview with Del Porter 1971, Cool and Strange Music magazine, Issue # 16, 1999  </ref>\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"book\">''Spike Jones off the record: The Man Who Murdered Music,'' by Jordan R.

The southbound local track is technically known as BB1 while the northbound one is BB4; the BB designation is used for [[New York City Subway chaining|chaining purposes]] along the Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line from 96th Street to 242nd Street.

Today, the concourse is entirely underground, with stairways on either side of Broadway that serve both uptown and downtown trains.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

It lies on the western shore of the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Surat Thani means 'city of good people', a title given to the city by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI).\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ko Mae Ko - Ang Thong.jpg|left|370px|thumb|Panorama of a beach of Ko Mae Ko]]\nNeighbouring provinces are (from north, clockwise) [[Chumphon Province|Chumphon]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Krabi Province|Krabi]], [[Phang Nga Province|Phang Nga]], and [[Ranong Province|Ranong]].\n\nGeographically, the centre of the province is the coastal plain of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]], mostly grassland interspersed with rubber trees and coconut plantations. In the west are the [[limestone]] mountains of the [[Phuket mountain range|Phuket range]] which are  mostly covered with forest. [[Khao Sok National Park]] is found there. To the east the hills of the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat mountain range|Nakhon Si Thammarat (or Bantat)]] mountain range start to rise, protected in the [[Tai Rom Yen National Park]].\n\nMany islands in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] belong to the district, including the tourist islands [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Pha Ngan]] and [[Ko Tao]], as well as the [[Ko Angthong|Ko Ang Thong]] Marine National Park.\n\nThe main rivers of Surat Thani Province are the Tapi River and the [[Phum Duang River]], which join at the town Tha Kham shortly before they flow into [[Bandon Bay]]. The [[river delta|delta]] of these rivers, locally known as ''Nai Bang'' (\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07), is directly north of the city of Surat Thani. It consists of several channels with small islands mostly covered by [[mangroves]] and orchards.\n\nOther protected areas in the province are the [[Khlong Phanom National Park|Khlong Phanom]] and [[Kaeng Krung National Park|Kaeng Krung]] National Park, [[Than Sadet-Ko Pha-Ngan National Park|Than Sadet-Ko Pha Ngan]] Marine National Park, the non-hunting areas [[Khao Tha Phet]] and [[Nong Thung Thong]] and the wildlife sanctuaries [[Khlong Phraya Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Phraya]], [[Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Saeng]], and [[Khlong Yan Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Yan]]. The [[Hat Khanom\u2013Mu Ko Thale Tai National Park|Hat Khanom - Mu Ko Thale Tai]], which has a few small islands south of Ko Samui, is currently being created.\n\n==History==\nThe area of Surat Thani was already inhabited in prehistoric times by [[Semang]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malayan]] tribes. Founded in the 3rd century, the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom dominated the [[Malay Peninsula]] until the 13th century. The city of [[Chaiya]] contains ruins from the Srivijaya period, and it was probably a regional capital of the kingdom. Some Thai historians even argue that it was the kingdom's capital for a time, but this is disputed. [[Wiang Sa District, Surat Thani|Wiang Sa]] was another important settlement of the time.\n\n[[File:Chaiya Wat Kaew.jpg|left|thumb|Wat Kaew in Chaiya, dating from Srivijavan times]]\nAfter the fall of the Srivijaya, the area was divided into the cities (''[[mueang]]'') of Chaiya, Thatong (now [[Kanchanadit]]), and Khirirat Nikhom. Chaiya was administered directly from the Thai capital, while Thatong and Khirirat were controlled by the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]]. In 1899, they were all merged into a single province called Chaiya. In 1915, the court of the [[Monthon]] [[Monthon Surat Thani|Chumphon]] was transferred  to [[Mueang Surat Thani District|Bandon]], which received the new name of ''Surat Thani'' on 29 July 1915, during a visit of King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI). This was likely influenced by the major port city of [[Surat]] in [[Gujarat]], India. The monthon was also renamed Surat. In 1926 it was abolished and incorporated into monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat. The monthon was dissolved in 1933, and the province became a first level administrative subdivision.\n[[File:Borom That Chaiya.jpg|upright|thumb|right|160px|Srivijaya-style pagoda, Chaiya]]\n\nThe provincial administration was in a building in Tha Kham ([[Phunphin District]]). Shortly before [[World War II]], it was moved to the city of Surat Thani, on the banks of the Tapi River, which is named after the Tapi River in southern [[Gujarat]], India. When the Japanese invaded Thailand on 8 December 1941, the administrative building was destroyed during the battle for the city. It was rebuilt in 1954, but on 19 March 1982, a bomb planted by communist rebels blew up the building, killing five people. The third and present building was relocated to the south of the city, and the former site of the provincial hall is now the site of the [[Lak Mueang|city pillar shrine]] (''Lak Mueang'').\n\n==Symbols==\nThe seal of the province shows the [[pagoda]] of [[Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya]], which is believed to have been built 1,200 years ago.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya Ratcha Worawihan, Surat Thani Province |url=https://thailandtourismdirectory.go.th/en/info/attraction/detail/itemid/5196 |website=Thailand Tourism Directory |accessdate=28 November 2019}}</ref> The flag of the province shows the pagoda in middle, placed on a vertically split flag with red color on top and yellow on the bottom.\n\nThe provincial flower is the ''bua phut'' (''[[Rafflesia kerrii]]''), a [[parasite|parasitic]] plant with one of the biggest flowers of all plants. The provincial tree is the ton kiam (''[[Cotylelobium melanoxylon]]'').\n\nThe provincial slogan is \"\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30 \u0e40\u0e07\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48 \u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07 \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e48\u0e07\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e30 \u0e0a\u0e31\u0e01\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e13\u0e35\", 'city of 100 islands, delicious [[rambutan]], big shells and red eggs, center of Buddhism'. \"Red eggs\" are a local culinary specialty of [[pickling|pickled]] duck eggs, while the \"big shells\" refers to historically abundant shellfish available. \"Center of Buddhism\" refers to the Chaiya pagoda and [[Chak Phra]] Festivals.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Amphoe Surat Thani.svg|thumb|300px|Map of 19 districts]]\n\n===Provincial government===\nThe province is divided into 19 districts (''[[amphoe]]s''), which are further divided into 131 subdistricts (''[[tambon]]s'') and 1,028 villages (''[[muban]]s'').\n{|\n|---valign=top\n||\n# [[Mueang Surat Thani District|Mueang Surat Thani]]\n# [[Kanchanadit]]\n# [[Don Sak District|Don Sak]]\n# [[Ko Samui]]\n# [[Ko Pha-ngan]]\n# [[Chaiya]]\n# [[Tha Chana District|Tha Chana]]\n# [[Khiri Rat Nikhom District|Khiri Rat Nikhom]]\n# [[Ban Ta Khun District|Ban Ta Khun]]\n# [[Phanom District|Phanom]]\n||\n<ol start=11>\n<li>[[Tha Chang District, Surat Thani|Tha Chang]]</li>\n<li>[[Ban Na San District|Ban Na San]]</li>\n<li>[[Ban Na Doem District|Ban Na Doem]]</li>\n<li>[[Khian Sa District|Khian Sa]]</li>\n<li>[[Wiang Sa District, Surat Thani|Wiang Sa]]</li>\n<li>[[Phrasaeng District|Phrasaeng]]</li>\n<li>[[Phunphin District|Phunphin]]</li>\n<li>[[Chai Buri District|Chai Buri]]</li>\n<li>[[Vibhavadi District|Vibhavadi]]</li>\n</ol>\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Local government===\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dla.go.th/work/abt/province.jsp |title=Number of local government organizations by province |date=26 November 2019 |website=dla.go.th |publisher=Department of Local Administration (DLA) |access-date=10 December 2019 | quote=67 Surat Thani: 1 PAO, 2 City mun., 3 Town mun., 35 Subdistrict mun., 97 SAO.}}</ref> one Surat Thani Provincial Administration Organisation (''ongkan borihan suan changwat'') and 40 municipal (''thesaban'') areas in the province.

The coconuts are often picked from the tree by specially trained monkeys, mostly [[southern pig-tailed macaque|pig-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca nemestrina''). The monkey school of the late [[Somporn Saekhow]] is the most known training centre. Rambutan trees were first planted in Surat Thani in 1926 by the Chinese Malay Mr. K. Vong in [[Ban Na San District]]. An annual rambutan fair is held in early-August and includes a parade of highly decorated floats on the Tapi River. Rubber tree plantations are also common in the province.\n\nA notable local product is the hand-woven silk cloth from the coastal village Phum Riang in [[Chaiya District]]. Chaiya is also the most famous source of red eggs, a local specialty. Ducks are fed with crabs and fish and the eggs are then preserved by placing them in a soil-salt mixture.\n\nTourism is the major source of provincial income. The province earned 64 billion baht from tourism in 2018. That revenue accounted for 63 percent of Surat Thani's overall tourism income, most of it attributable to its island attractions: [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Pha Ngan]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park]].<ref>{{cite news |title=18km Samui bridge urged |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1849199/18km-samui-bridge-urged |accessdate=3 February 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |date=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Human achievement index 2017==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width:400px;\"\n|- \n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Health\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Education\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Employment\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Income\n|-\n| [[File:Health icon Thai.png|95px]]\n| [[File:Round Landmark School Icon - Transparent.svg|100px]]\n| [[File:Employment icon.png|100px]]\n| [[File:Numismatics and Notaphily icon.png|100px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 28\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 50\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 59\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 15 \n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Housing\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Family\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Transport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Participation \n|-\n| style=\"height:100px;\"| [[File:586-house-with-garden.svg|100px]] \n| [[File:Parents, enfants, famille.png|center|85px]]\n| [[File:Groundtransport inv.svg|100px]]\n| [[File:Icon Sociopol\u00edtica y relaciones internacionales (wikiproyect, es.wp).png|90px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 73\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 37\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 30\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 70  \n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"; style=\"background:black; color:white;\"| Province Surat Thani, with an HAI 2017 value of 0.5476 is \"low\", occupies place 65 in the ranking.\n|}\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the [[Human achievement index]] (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development.

largest of the [[Southern Thailand|southern]] [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]] (''changwat'') of [[Thailand]]. It lies on the western shore of the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Surat Thani means 'city of good people', a title given to the city by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI).\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ko Mae Ko - Ang Thong.jpg|left|370px|thumb|Panorama of a beach of Ko Mae Ko]]\nNeighbouring provinces are (from north, clockwise) [[Chumphon Province|Chumphon]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Krabi Province|Krabi]], [[Phang Nga Province|Phang Nga]], and [[Ranong Province|Ranong]].\n\nGeographically, the centre of the province is the coastal plain of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]], mostly grassland interspersed with rubber trees and coconut plantations. In the west are the [[limestone]] mountains of the [[Phuket mountain range|Phuket range]] which are  mostly covered with forest. [[Khao Sok National Park]] is found there. To the east the hills of the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat mountain range|Nakhon Si Thammarat (or Bantat)]] mountain range start to rise, protected in the [[Tai Rom Yen National Park]].\n\nMany islands in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] belong to the district, including the tourist islands [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Pha Ngan]] and [[Ko Tao]], as well as the [[Ko Angthong|Ko Ang Thong]] Marine National Park.\n\nThe main rivers of Surat Thani Province are the Tapi River and the [[Phum Duang River]], which join at the town Tha Kham shortly before they flow into [[Bandon Bay]]. The [[river delta|delta]] of these rivers, locally known as ''Nai Bang'' (\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07), is directly north of the city of Surat Thani. It consists of several channels with small islands mostly covered by [[mangroves]] and orchards.\n\nOther protected areas in the province are the [[Khlong Phanom National Park|Khlong Phanom]] and [[Kaeng Krung National Park|Kaeng Krung]] National Park, [[Than Sadet-Ko Pha-Ngan National Park|Than Sadet-Ko Pha Ngan]] Marine National Park, the non-hunting areas [[Khao Tha Phet]] and [[Nong Thung Thong]] and the wildlife sanctuaries [[Khlong Phraya Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Phraya]], [[Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Saeng]], and [[Khlong Yan Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Yan]]. The [[Hat Khanom\u2013Mu Ko Thale Tai National Park|Hat Khanom - Mu Ko Thale Tai]], which has a few small islands south of Ko Samui, is currently being created.\n\n==History==\nThe area of Surat Thani was already inhabited in prehistoric times by [[Semang]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malayan]] tribes. Founded in the 3rd century, the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom dominated the [[Malay Peninsula]] until the 13th century. The city of [[Chaiya]] contains ruins from the Srivijaya period, and it was probably a regional capital of the kingdom. Some Thai historians even argue that it was the kingdom's capital for a time, but this is disputed. [[Wiang Sa District, Surat Thani|Wiang Sa]] was another important settlement of the time.\n\n[[File:Chaiya Wat Kaew.jpg|left|thumb|Wat Kaew in Chaiya, dating from Srivijavan times]]\nAfter the fall of the Srivijaya, the area was divided into the cities (''[[mueang]]'') of Chaiya, Thatong (now [[Kanchanadit]]), and Khirirat Nikhom. Chaiya was administered directly from the Thai capital, while Thatong and Khirirat were controlled by the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]]. In 1899, they were all merged into a single province called Chaiya. In 1915, the court of the [[Monthon]] [[Monthon Surat Thani|Chumphon]] was transferred  to [[Mueang Surat Thani District|Bandon]], which received the new name of ''Surat Thani'' on 29 July 1915, during a visit of King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI). This was likely influenced by the major port city of [[Surat]] in [[Gujarat]], India. The monthon was also renamed Surat. In 1926 it was abolished and incorporated into monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat. The monthon was dissolved in 1933, and the province became a first level administrative subdivision.\n[[File:Borom That Chaiya.jpg|upright|thumb|right|160px|Srivijaya-style pagoda, Chaiya]]\n\nThe provincial administration was in a building in Tha Kham ([[Phunphin District]]). Shortly before [[World War II]], it was moved to the city of Surat Thani, on the banks of the Tapi River, which is named after the Tapi River in southern [[Gujarat]], India. When the Japanese invaded Thailand on 8 December 1941, the administrative building was destroyed during the battle for the city. It was rebuilt in 1954, but on 19 March 1982, a bomb planted by communist rebels blew up the building, killing five people. The third and present building was relocated to the south of the city, and the former site of the provincial hall is now the site of the [[Lak Mueang|city pillar shrine]] (''Lak Mueang'').\n\n==Symbols==\nThe seal of the province shows the [[pagoda]] of [[Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya]], which is believed to have been built 1,200 years ago.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya Ratcha Worawihan, Surat Thani Province |url=https://thailandtourismdirectory.go.th/en/info/attraction/detail/itemid/5196 |website=Thailand Tourism Directory |accessdate=28 November 2019}}</ref> The flag of the province shows the pagoda in middle, placed on a vertically split flag with red color on top and yellow on the bottom.\n\nThe provincial flower is the ''bua phut'' (''[[Rafflesia kerrii]]''), a [[parasite|parasitic]] plant with one of the biggest flowers of all plants.

The coconuts are often picked from the tree by specially trained monkeys, mostly [[southern pig-tailed macaque|pig-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca nemestrina''). The monkey school of the late [[Somporn Saekhow]] is the most known training centre. Rambutan trees were first planted in Surat Thani in 1926 by the Chinese Malay Mr. K. Vong in [[Ban Na San District]]. An annual rambutan fair is held in early-August and includes a parade of highly decorated floats on the Tapi River. Rubber tree plantations are also common in the province.\n\nA notable local product is the hand-woven silk cloth from the coastal village Phum Riang in [[Chaiya District]]. Chaiya is also the most famous source of red eggs, a local specialty. Ducks are fed with crabs and fish and the eggs are then preserved by placing them in a soil-salt mixture.\n\nTourism is the major source of provincial income. The province earned 64 billion baht from tourism in 2018. That revenue accounted for 63 percent of Surat Thani's overall tourism income, most of it attributable to its island attractions: [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Pha Ngan]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park]].<ref>{{cite news |title=18km Samui bridge urged |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1849199/18km-samui-bridge-urged |accessdate=3 February 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |date=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Human achievement index 2017==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width:400px;\"\n|- \n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Health\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Education\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Employment\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:100px; background:black; color:white;\"| Income\n|-\n| [[File:Health icon Thai.png|95px]]\n| [[File:Round Landmark School Icon - Transparent.svg|100px]]\n| [[File:Employment icon.png|100px]]\n| [[File:Numismatics and Notaphily icon.png|100px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 28\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 50\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 59\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 15 \n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Housing\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Family\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Transport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| Participation \n|-\n| style=\"height:100px;\"| [[File:586-house-with-garden.svg|100px]] \n| [[File:Parents, enfants, famille.png|center|85px]]\n| [[File:Groundtransport inv.svg|100px]]\n| [[File:Icon Sociopol\u00edtica y relaciones internacionales (wikiproyect, es.wp).png|90px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 73\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 37\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 30\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:black; color:white;\"| 70  \n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"; style=\"background:black; color:white;\"| Province Surat Thani, with an HAI 2017 value of 0.5476 is \"low\", occupies place 65 in the ranking.\n|}\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the [[Human achievement index]] (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development.
