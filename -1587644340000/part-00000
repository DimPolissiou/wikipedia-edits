The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in March 18 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the declaration of the [[Republic of Turkey]] eight years later, with  [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who rose to prominence as a commander at [[Gallipoli]], as [[List of national founders#Turkey|founder]] and president.\n\nThe campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand [[national consciousness]]; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as [[ANZAC Day]], the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing [[Remembrance Day]] ([[Armistice Day]]).{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=32, 38}}{{sfn|Lewis|Balderstone|Bowan|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=198}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n\nOn 27 October 1914, two former German warships, the Ottoman {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, still under the command of German officers, conducted the [[Black Sea Raid]], in which they bombarded the Russian port of [[Odessa]] and sank several ships.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=44}} On 31 October, the Ottomans entered the war and began the [[Caucasus campaign]] against Russia.

Vice Admiral Sir [[Richard Peirse (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Peirse]], [[Commander-in-Chief, East Indies]], ordered Captain Frank Larkin of {{HMS|Doris|1896|6}} to Alexandretta on 13 December 1914. The {{ship|Russian cruiser|Askold|1900|6}} and the French [[cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Requin||2}} were also there. Kitchener was working on the plan as late as March 1915 and was the beginning of the British attempt to incite an [[Arab Revolt]]. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912.{{sfn|Tauber|1993|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nBy late 1914, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the Franco-British counter-offensive of the [[First Battle of the Marne]] had ended and the Belgians, British and French had suffered many casualties in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in Flanders.

Churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships, which could not operate against the German [[High Seas Fleet]], in a Dardanelles operation, with a small occupation force provided by the army. It was hoped that an attack on the Ottomans would also draw [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] (formerly Ottoman possessions) into the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=27\u201328}} On 2 January 1915, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottomans, who were conducting an [[Caucasus campaign|offensive in the Caucasus]].{{sfn|Tamworth Daily Observer|1915|p=2}} Planning began for a naval [[Demonstration (military)|demonstration]] in the Dardanelles, to divert Ottoman troops from Caucasia.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=20}}\n\n==Naval campaign==\n{{main|Naval operations in the Dardanelles campaign}}\n\n===Attempt to force the Straits===\n[[File:Graphic map of the Dardanelles (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Graphic map of the Dardanelles]]\nOn 17 February 1915, a British seaplane from {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|6}} flew a reconnaissance sortie over the Straits.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=40}} Two days later, the first attack on the Dardanelles began when a strong Anglo-French task force, including the British dreadnought {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}}, began a long-range bombardment of Ottoman [[coastal artillery|coastal artillery batteries]].

There was confusion during the battle about the cause of the damage; some participants blamed torpedoes. {{HMS|Ocean|1898|6}} was sent to rescue ''Irresistible'' but was disabled from an artillery shell, struck a mine, and was abandoned, eventually to sink.{{sfn|Fromkin|1989|p=151}}\n\nThe French battleships {{ship|French battleship|Suffren||2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Gaulois||2}} sailed through a new line of mines placed secretly by the Ottoman minelayer ''[[Ottoman minelayer Nusret|Nusret]]'' ten days before and were also damaged.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=33\u201334}} The losses forced de Robeck to sound the \"general recall\" to protect what remained of his force.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=35}} During the planning of the campaign, naval losses had been anticipated and mainly obsolete battleships, unfit to face the German fleet, had been sent. Some of the senior naval officers like the commander of ''Queen Elizabeth'', Commodore [[Roger Keyes]], felt that they had come close to victory, believing that the Ottoman guns had almost run out of ammunition but the views of de Robeck, the [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] and others prevailed.

All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges of the peninsula. There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of the peninsula) and [[Kabatepe|Gaba Tepe]] were the likely areas for landing.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Butler|2011|p=121}}\n\nMustafa Kemal believed that the British would use their naval power to command the land from every side at the tip of the peninsula; at Gaba Tepe, the short distance to the eastern coast meant that the Allies could easily reach the Narrows (the right-angled bend in the middle of the Dardanelles).{{sfn|Kinross|1995|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Bean|1941a|p=179}} Sanders considered [[Be\u015fik Bay, \u00c7anakkale|Besika Bay]] on the Asiatic coast to be the most vulnerable to invasion, since the terrain was easier to cross and was convenient to attack the most important Ottoman batteries guarding the straits and a third of the 5th Army was assembled there.{{sfn|James|1995|p=74}} Two divisions were concentrated at [[Bolay\u0131r|Bulair]] at the north end of the Gallipoli peninsula, to protect supply and communication lines to the defences further down the peninsula.{{sfn|James|1995|p=75}} The [[19th Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|19th Division]] (Kemal) and the 9th Division were placed along the Aegean coast and at Cape Helles on the tip of the peninsula.

A maximum effort to improve land and sea communications was ordered, to move reinforcements swiftly to danger points; troops moved at night to avoid Allied air reconnaissance. Sanders' strategy was opposed by Ottoman commanders, including Kemal, who believed that the defenders were too widely dispersed to defeat the invasion on the beaches.{{sfn|James|1995|p=76}} Sanders was certain that a rigid system of defence would fail and that the only hope of success lay in the mobility of the three groups, particularly the 19th Division near Boghali, in general reserve, ready to move to Bulair, Gaba Tepe or the Asiatic shore.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=154\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R36225, T\u00fcrkei, Dardanellen, Schweres Gesch\u00fctz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Heavy artillery from the German inland gun emplacement 1915]]\nThe time needed by the British to organise the landings meant that Sanders, Colonel [[Hans Kannengiesser]] and other German officers, supported by [[Mehmet Esat B\u00fclkat|Esat Pasha]] ([[III Corps (Ottoman Empire)|III Corps]]) had more time to prepare their defences.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=40}} Sanders later noted, \"the British allowed us four good weeks of respite for all this work before their great disembarkation&nbsp;...

The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August, in the [[Scimitar Hill (battle)|Battle of Scimitar Hill]] and the [[Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)|Battle of Hill 60]]. Control of the hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts but the attacks failed. On 17 August, Hamilton had requested another {{nowrap|95,000 troops}} but a day earlier, the French had announced plans to Kitchener for an autumn offensive in France. A meeting of the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August determined that the French offensive would be supported by a maximum effort, which left only about {{nowrap|25,000 reinforcements}} for the Dardanelles. On 23 August, after news of the failure at Scimitar Hill, Hamilton went onto the defensive as Bulgarian entry into the war, which would allow the Germans to rearm the Turkish army, was imminent and left little opportunity for the resumption of offensive operations. On 20 September 1915, the [[Newfoundland Regiment]] was deployed at Suvla Bay with the 29th Division.{{sfn|Nicholson|2007|pp=155\u201392}} On 25 September, Kitchener detached two British and one French division for service in [[Salonika]] in Greece, which was the beginning of the end of the Allied campaign at Gallipoli.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1992|pp=363\u201376}}\n\n[[Alan Moorehead]] wrote that during the stalemate, an old Ottoman [[Batman (military)|batman]] was regularly permitted to hang his platoon's washing on the barbed wire undisturbed and that there was a \"constant traffic\" of gifts being thrown across no-man's land, dates and sweets from the Ottoman side and cans of beef and packs of cigarettes from the Allied side.{{sfn|Moorehead|1997|p=158}} Conditions at Gallipoli grew worse for everyone as summer heat and poor sanitation resulted in an explosion in the fly population. Eating became extremely difficult as unburied corpses became bloated and putrid. The precarious Allied lodgements were poorly situated, which caused supply and shelter problems.

The untenable nature of the Allied position was made apparent by a rainstorm on 26 November 1915. The downpour at Suvla lasted for three days and there was a blizzard in early December. Rain flooded trenches, drowned soldiers and washed unburied corpses into the lines; the following snow killed still more men from exposure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=255\u201356}} Suvla and Anzac were to be evacuated in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December and ruses, such as [[William Scurry]]'s self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Allied departure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=260}} At Anzac Cove, troops maintained silence for an hour or more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire.

Broadbent describes the campaign as \"a close-fought affair\" that was a defeat for the Allies,{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=268, 269}} while [[Les Carlyon|Carlyon]] views the overall result as a stalemate.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=518}} [[Peter Hart (military historian)|Peter Hart]] disagrees, arguing that the Ottoman forces \"held the Allies back from their real objectives with relative ease\",{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}} while [[Philip Haythornthwaite|Haythornthwaite]] calls it a \"disaster for the Allies\".{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}} The campaign did cause \"enormous damage to&nbsp;...

While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.{{sfn|Brenchley|Brenchley|2001|pp=113\u201314}}\n\nGallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford, but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=233, 270}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p= 259}} The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and [[Harry Chauvel]] ([[1st Light Horse Brigade]], New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=100, 107}}{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=14}} The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest.{{sfn|Cassar|2004|pp=202\u201303, 259, 263}} The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} In [[Mesopotamia]], the Turks surrounded a British expedition at [[Siege of Kut|Kut Al Amara]], forcing their surrender in April 1916.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=94}} Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt.{{sfn|Pick|1990|pp=181, 209}} Defeat at the [[Battle of Romani]], however, and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition.{{sfn|Pick|1990|p=210}} The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair, and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=127}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The Sphinx, one of the battlefield's most distinctive physical landmarks]]\n\nThe lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944 and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the [[Pacific War]] and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that [[interwar period|between the wars]], the campaign \"became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare\" in Britain and United States.{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved \"all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal\".{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}\n\n[[Russell Weigley]] wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to \"a belief among most of the armed forces of the world\" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts]], arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944.{{sfn|Weigley|2005|pp=393\u201396}} Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable, and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|pp=460\u201362}} The memory of Gallipoli weighed heavily upon the Australians during the planning of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in late 1943.

as the '''Dardanelles campaign''', the '''Battle of Gallipoli''' or the '''Battle of \u00c7anakkale''' ({{lang-tr|\u00c7anakkale Sava\u015f\u0131}}), was a campaign of the [[First World War]] that took place on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula ([[Gelibolu]] in modern Turkey), from 17 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in February 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated.

The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August, in the [[Scimitar Hill (battle)|Battle of Scimitar Hill]] and the [[Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)|Battle of Hill 60]]. Control of the hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts but the attacks failed. On 17 August, Hamilton had requested another {{nowrap|95,000 troops}} but a day earlier, the French had announced plans to Kitchener for an autumn offensive in France. A meeting of the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August determined that the French offensive would be supported by a maximum effort, which left only about {{nowrap|25,000 reinforcements}} for the Dardanelles. On 23 August, after news of the failure at Scimitar Hill, Hamilton went onto the defensive as Bulgarian entry into the war, which would allow the Germans to rearm the Turkish army, was imminent and left little opportunity for the resumption of offensive operations. On 20 September 1915, the [[Newfoundland Regiment]] was deployed at Suvla Bay with the 29th Division.{{sfn|Nicholson|2007|pp=155\u201392}} On 25 September, Kitchener detached two British and one French division for service in [[Salonika]] in Greece, which was the beginning of the end of the Allied campaign at Gallipoli.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1992|pp=363\u201376}}\n\n[[Alan Moorehead]] wrote that during the stalemate, an old Ottoman [[Batman (military)|batman]] was regularly permitted to hang his platoon's washing on the barbed wire undisturbed and that there was a \"constant traffic\" of gifts being thrown across no-man's land, dates and sweets from the Ottoman side and cans of beef and packs of cigarettes from the Allied side.{{sfn|Moorehead|1997|p=158}} Conditions at Gallipoli grew worse for everyone as summer heat and poor sanitation resulted in an explosion in the fly population. Eating became extremely difficult as unburied corpses became bloated and putrid. The precarious Allied lodgements were poorly situated, which caused supply and shelter problems. A [[dysentery]] epidemic spread through the Allied trenches at Anzac and Helles, while the Ottomans also suffered heavily from disease which resulted in many deaths.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=314}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nAfter the failure of the August Offensive, the Gallipoli campaign drifted. Ottoman success began to affect public opinion in Britain, with criticism of Hamilton's performance being smuggled out by [[Keith Murdoch]], [[Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett]] and other reporters.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=26}} Stopford and other dissident officers also contributed to the air of gloom and the possibility of evacuation was raised on 11 October 1915.

The untenable nature of the Allied position was made apparent by a rainstorm on 26 November 1915. The downpour at Suvla lasted for three days and there was a blizzard in early December. Rain flooded trenches, drowned soldiers and washed unburied corpses into the lines; the following snow killed still more men from exposure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=255\u201356}} Suvla and Anzac were to be evacuated in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December and ruses, such as [[William Scurry]]'s self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Allied departure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=260}} At Anzac Cove, troops maintained silence for an hour or more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire. A mine was detonated at the Nek, which killed {{nowrap|70 Ottoman}} soldiers.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=208}} The Allied force was embarked, with the Australians suffering no casualties on the final night but large quantities of supplies and stores fell into Ottoman hands.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=93}}\n\n[[File:W Beach Helles Gallipoli.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|[[Landing at Cape Helles|W Beach, Helles]], on 7 January 1916 just prior to the final evacuation]]\n\nHelles was retained for a period but a decision to evacuate the garrison was made on 28 December.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=526}} Unlike the evacuation from Anzac Cove, Ottoman forces were looking for signs of withdrawal.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}} Having used the interval to bring up reinforcements and supplies, Sanders mounted an attack on the British at Gully Spur on 7 January 1916 with infantry and artillery but the attack was a costly failure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=266}} Mines were laid with time fuzes and that night and on the night of 7/8 January, under the cover of a naval bombardment, the British troops began to fall back {{convert|5|mi|km}} from their lines to the beaches, where makeshift piers were used to board boats.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=126}} The last British troops departed from Lancashire Landing around 04:00 on 8 January 1916.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=266}} The Newfoundland Regiment was part of the [[rearguard]] and withdrew on 9 January 1916.{{sfn|Nicholson|2007|p=480}} Among the first to land, remnants of The Plymouth Battalion, Royal Marine Light Infantry were the last to leave the Peninsula.{{sfn|Lockhart|1950|p=17}}\n\nDespite predictions of up to {{nowrap|30,000 casualties,}} {{nowrap|35,268 troops,}} {{nowrap|3,689 horses}} and mules, {{nowrap|127 guns,}} {{nowrap|328 vehicles}} and {{convert|1600|LT|MT}} of equipment were removed;{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=126}} {{nowrap|508 mules}} that could not be embarked were killed so as not to fall into Ottoman hands and {{nowrap|1,590 vehicles}} were left behind with smashed wheels.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1992|p=478}} As at Anzac, large amounts of supplies (including 15 British and six French unserviceable artillery pieces which were destroyed), gun carriages and ammunition were left behind; hundreds of horses were slaughtered to deny them to the Ottomans.

Broadbent describes the campaign as \"a close-fought affair\" that was a defeat for the Allies,{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=268, 269}} while [[Les Carlyon|Carlyon]] views the overall result as a stalemate.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=518}} [[Peter Hart (military historian)|Peter Hart]] disagrees, arguing that the Ottoman forces \"held the Allies back from their real objectives with relative ease\",{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}} while [[Philip Haythornthwaite|Haythornthwaite]] calls it a \"disaster for the Allies\".{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}} The campaign did cause \"enormous damage to&nbsp;... [Ottoman] national resources\",{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}} and at that stage of the war the Allies were in a better position to replace their losses than the Ottomans,{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=98}} but ultimately the Allied attempt at securing a passage through the Dardanelles proved unsuccessful. While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.{{sfn|Brenchley|Brenchley|2001|pp=113\u201314}}\n\nGallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford, but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=233, 270}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p= 259}} The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and [[Harry Chauvel]] ([[1st Light Horse Brigade]], New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=100, 107}}{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=14}} The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest.{{sfn|Cassar|2004|pp=202\u201303, 259, 263}} The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} In [[Mesopotamia]], the Turks surrounded a British expedition at [[Siege of Kut|Kut Al Amara]], forcing their surrender in April 1916.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=94}} Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt.{{sfn|Pick|1990|pp=181, 209}} Defeat at the [[Battle of Romani]], however, and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition.{{sfn|Pick|1990|p=210}} The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair, and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=127}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The Sphinx, one of the battlefield's most distinctive physical landmarks]]\n\nThe lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944 and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the [[Pacific War]] and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that [[interwar period|between the wars]], the campaign \"became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare\" in Britain and United States.{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved \"all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal\".{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}\n\n[[Russell Weigley]] wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to \"a belief among most of the armed forces of the world\" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts]], arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944.{{sfn|Weigley|2005|pp=393\u201396}} Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable, and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|pp=460\u201362}} The memory of Gallipoli weighed heavily upon the Australians during the planning of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in late 1943.

{"title_page": "Fijian traditions and ceremonies", "text_new": "'''Fijian tradition and ceremony''' is a living way of life that has remained intact for millennia, evolving as the [[Fiji]]an nation has modernised over time, with various external influences from Pacific neighbours, and European and Asian society. The term Fijian in this article refers to \"indigenous Fijians\" or ''\"I Taukei\"''<ref>Marshall David Sahlins, ''Apologies to Thucydides'', p. 230.</ref> as the term Fijian generally includes all citizens of Fiji. This article is a general overview of various aspects of Fijian tradition, social structure and ceremony, much of it from the Bauan Fijian tradition. There are variations from province to province. Many social intricacies depend on one's inherited social position and the occasion one is confronted with: each will have a particular social etiquette.  The Fijian terms in this article are most often of the Bauan dialect.\n\n== Social structure ==\nTraditionally, each Fijian villager is born into a certain role in the family unit or Tokatoka. Various heads of the family will administer and lead the family unit within the village community. Each chief of the village will in turn lead the people to fulfill their role to the Vanua.\n\nEach village will have several family units / Tokatoka <ref name=Goulbourne>Harry Goulbourne, ''Race and Ethnicity'', p. 26.</ref> which are part of one clan or Mataqali.<ref name=Goulbourne/> Several Mataqali will make up the larger tribe or Yavusa.<ref name=Goulbourne/><ref name=Dixon>R. M. W. Dixon, ''A Grammar of Boumaa Fijian'', pp. 1-3.</ref> Several Yavusa will belong to a certain land mass and comprise thereby the Vanua<ref name=Goulbourne/> (confederation of Yavusa)<ref name=Dixon/> Dr Asesela Ravuvu (1983, p.&nbsp;76) describes the Vanua as:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe living soul or human manifestation of the physical environment which the members have since claimed to belong to them and to which they also belong. The land is the physical or geographical entity of the people, upon which their survival...as a group depends. Land is thus an extension of the self. Likewise the people are an extension of the land. Land becomes lifeless and useless without the people, and likewise the people are helpless and insecure without land to thrive upon. \n</blockquote>\n\nThe Vanua is headed by a Turaga i taukei,<ref name=Kaplan>Martha Kaplan, \"Embattled People of the Land\", in ''Neither Cargo Nor Cult'', p. 25.</ref> the most prominent chief from the most prominent family. To explain further, a Vanua is the largest collective group of people associated with a particular territory or area of land. A Vanua is divisible into a group of Yavusa / tribes: a Yavusa is a group of Mataqali <ref name=Kaplan/>/ clans: a Mataqali is a group of Tokatoka<ref name=Kaplan/> / family units. Within the Mataqali making up one Yavusa one Mataqali will be predominant and head that Yavusa as a whole. Similarly, one Tokatoka will head that Mataqali and one member of that Tokatoka will be Senior Chieftain / Turaga i Taukei of that Vanua.\n\nMatanitu<ref name=Goulbourne/><ref name=Kaplan/> is a confederation of Vanua,<ref name=Dixon/> not through ancestry or traditional ties, but rather by alliances formed politically or in war and/or united by a common need.\n\n===The feast and the club===\n\nWithin the Fijian Bauan belief system, all Fijians fall into one of the two following categories which will indicate their position and role in the community:\n \n::1. Liga-ni-Magiti (hand of the feast)<ref name=Islands>Marshall David Sahlins, ''Islands of History'', p. 87.</ref> (8) - 3 Turaga (e.g. [[Ratu]]/[[Adi (title)|Adi]]) positions); & 5 Bete {e.g. Matanivanua} positions.\n\n::2. Liga-ni-Wau (hand of the club)<ref name=Islands/> (7)  - 3 Bati (e.g. Tora); 2 Matai (e.g. matavule); 2 Dau (e.g. Tunidau) positions.\n\nThe two categories are further divided into subcategories which are indicated by a number. There is Liga ni Magiti, which is category one and is indicated by the number 8 (Walu), which then has two subcategories; first 3, which is Turaga overall, containing the Ratu and the Adi (Fijian Royalty). These are considered born leaders and administrators. Then, secondly, subcategory 5 of Category 1 is the Bete - priests or heralds; these traditionally are the spokesmen, councillors, advisors of the land and the spiritualists.\n\nCategory 2, Liga ni Wau, is indicated by the number 7 (Vitu). Liga ni Wau has three subcategories. First there is 3, the Bati, traditionally Warriors, they are the wagers of war, the keepers of the peace,  and the instruments of discipline on behalf of the Turaga. Then there is subcategory 2: Matai - a general term for skillful persons, (e.g. carpenters, craftsman, house or canoe builders). The last subcategory, 2 Dau, is  the general term for an expert of some kind (e.g. dau-ni-vucu [Poet], dau-ni-yau [treasurer]). It is said socially, ''\u201cKe na Dau qori\u201d'', meaning \u201cHe is the expert\u201d.\n\n== Relationship terms within Fijian society ==\n\nA first question generally in Fiji is \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d so people may ascertain what relationship they hold with you and how will they interact with you. There are various relationship terms in Fiji. These includeu6yy8yutiy:\n\n\"Tauvu\". Tau (friend); Vu (Spirit); having the same Vu, root or founder. [[Basil Thomson]] (1908:113) suggests \u201cthat groups in Fiji who are tauvu or kalou-vata ie worshippers of the same god, have a common origin\u201d.\n0\nTauvu are allowed reciprocal rights of taking each other's goods and coarse joking with each other, though this is not used inland in Viti-Levu. The following are some Tauvu groupings:\n\n<blockquote>\n#\t[[Lomaloma]] and Moturiki also to Yadrana village on [[Lakeba]] Island and also to                                   [[Moala Island]]\n#\t[[Lomaiviti (archipelago)|Lomaiviti]] and [[Cakaudrove Province|Cakaudrove]]\n#\tCakaudrove and Bua\n#\tLakeba and Noco\n#\tLau and [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]\n#\tCakaudrove and [[Tailevu Province|Tailevu]]\n#\tRa/Nadroga/Kadavu/Ba\n#\tMacuata/[[Naitasiri Province|Naitasiri]]\n#\tSerua/Kadavu\n#\tNadroga/[[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]]\n#\tNadi/Kadavu\n#\tOno-I-Lau/[[Bau Island]]\n#\tOno, Kadavu/Ono-I-Lau\n#       Ono-I-Lau/Oneata\n</blockquote>\n\n===Other terms===\n\"Tako-Lavo\". This relationship relates to people of Colo from Inland [[Viti Levu]] e.g. Serua, [[Namosi Province|Namosi]] areas, The meaning of Tako-Lavo is the Father {Tako} Son {Lavo} relationship. \"Kaivata\" or \"Kai\" may be used generally across the board to all Fijians, if they identify themselves within the same Province. \"Kai-noqu\" may be used when one Fijian is generally addressing another Fijian that they share the same blood somewhere in their lineage.\n\nThe term \"Vasu\" in Fiji refers to an individual's maternal ties to a village, Matagali etc. \nIf a child is of a woman of rank he/she is a ''Vasu Levu'' to that particular area. If both mother and father are Fijian, he/she is a ''Vasu I Taukei''. If both mother and father are Fijian and both are of a very senior chiefly rank from respective areas, then the child's Vasu connection is referred to as ''Turaga na Vasu''. Intermarriage through the Vasu was used to expand kingdoms and unite old enemies or strengthen family links.<ref>Matanitu, Chapter 1, p. 36.</ref><ref>''Fiji and the Fijians'', Chapter 2, pp. 34, 35.</ref>\n\n===An example===\nIf a Fijian was Kai Rewa and Vasu i Lau (paternally from Rewa District of Rewa Province and maternally from Lakeba, Lau), then he/she would be considered from Rewa, which is of the Burebasaga confederacy and Lakeba of the Lau Province, which is of the Tovata confederacy. With respect to his/her matrilineal side, being that of Lakeba, Lau Province of [[Tovata]], the following applies:\n\nIf he/she were to take his/her father's side and purely acknowledge his/her lineage from [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]] Tikina, Rewa Province, of the [[Burebasaga]] confederacy the following would apply:\n\nHe/she would say \"Naita\" to those from [[Tailevu Province|Tailevu]] and Yasayasa Vakara and \"Tauvu\" to those from the Lau group.\n\n== Relationships within the Fijian family ==\nThere is great intricacy of social interaction among families and close tribes, between brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles and the like. The Fijian concept of \"family\" does not align with the Western notion of a normative family. Extended family members will adopt roles and titles of a direct guardian. The iTaukei (Indigenous Fijians) culture is not based on biological lineage but instead on a child's link to a spiritual ancestor. This has proved to be somewhat of a hurdle when attempting to apply Western culture in a Fijian landscape, such as the use of a predominantly Western criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304495447_Child_Sexual_Abuse_in_Fiji_Authority_Risk_Factors_and_Responses|title=Whitehead, John and Roffee, James. Child sexual abuse in Fiji: Authority, risk factors and responses [online]. Current Issues in Criminal Justice, Vol. 27, No. 3, Mar 2016: [323]-334}}</ref>\n\nMegan Lee, in her paper ''Life in a Fijian Village'' while studying social structure and organization of Naivuvuni Village states: \u201cThe kinship system is an essential aspect of Fijian life. The ways in which people interact with each other is based upon how they are related to each other within the family unit. Respect and avoidance relationships are critical to the kinship system. Respect is based on three main concepts: age, sex and social distance. The older a person is, the more respect they command, regardless of sex or social rank. The amount of respect displayed also depends on the amount of social distance between people. People who interact with one another on a regular basis tend to be more relaxed and less strict about the proper respect relationships. People who do not see each other as often and are less familiar with each other follow the expected rules more stringently.\u201d\n\nThe following terms (with variation between provinces) are used among close family members:\n\nThe term \"Yaca\" is used to refer to one's \"namesake\" when a child in memory of a relative who has passed on. Children are also named after a living relative. The term is even more loosely used today among friends if you share the same name, though this is not used in its correct context.\n\nAnne E. Becker in her book ''Body, Self, and Society: the view from Fiji'' writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn the event that a kin relationship cannot be conjured from the meeting, the respective parties will invoke one of many other relationships that associate them in some way for instances they may be mutual namesakes (Yaca) or their respective regional ancestral spirits (Vu) May have been friends so by syllogism they are Tauvu and address each other as Tau.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe term \"Tavale\" is used by those who are cross cousins for example the son or daughter of a father's sister or mother's brother.\n\nMegan Lee in her paper \"Life in a Fijian Village\", in Chapter 2, Social Structure and Organization of Naivuvuni Village, writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nTraditionally, it was from this group of relatives that a man would choose his wife although today this practice is not usually followed. Male and female cross cousins are referred to as tavale. Men also refer to female cross cousins as tavale and women call men by the same instead of using their real name. A woman refers to another female cross cousin as \"dauve\", or sister-in-law, because a female cross cousin's brother could become a husband. Similarly, a female refers to her male cross cousin's wife as \"karua\", which means second wife, because if she were to die, a cross cousin could become his new wife. Cross cousins also have the responsibility of burying one another when they die. \n</blockquote>\n\nAlso [[William Halse Rivers]] in his book ''The History of Melanesian Society'' states:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn Fiji the term of the coastal people are determined by their cross cousin marriage, viz., Tavale, davola and dauve but among the [[mountain people]] there are number of other terms including daku, vitabui, vaidakavi, veilavi and vikila though Tavale of the coastal people is frequently used.\n</blockquote>\n\n\"Tata, Nana, Nei\" and \"Momo\".\nParents of cross cousins are treated the same as biological parents, a child's mother's younger sister is referred to as nana Lailai or little mother. If she is older than the child's own mother, then she is referred to as Nana levu or big mother. Likewise, the child father's brothers are called Tata Lailai and Tata Levu according to seniority.\n\nA child's father's sister is referred to as Nei or aunt whereas a child's mother's brother is referred to as Momo. The relationship with the parents of one's cross cousins is relaxed, while keeping in mind that respect must be shown Momo and Nei because they are older.\n\nThe above are but simple examples and further intricacies exist.\n\n==Fijian ceremonies==\nFijian social interactions are filled with ceremony of varying degrees. Depending on the occasion and situation, three key ceremonies, which accord with other cultures, are: birth, death, and marriage.\n\n===Births===\nTraditionally speaking, birthdays were not celebrated in Fijian society. However, there are some people's birthdays that have special significance. For example, the first birthday of the first-born child is often celebrated by both sides of the family. The father's side will bring mats that the child sits on during the feast and celebration, and then afterwards the mother's side takes them away and distributes them among themselves. The focus is, unusually, on the different groups and not the individual.\n\n===Engagement===\nA formal engagement (''ai lakovi'') involves the presentation of a [[tabua]] (whale's tooth) from a man to a woman.\n\n===Marriages===\nArranged marriages are rarely practiced in modern Fiji. Traditionally however, a marriage would be arranged by the man's parents and senior members of his Mataqali and would have been based on the relationship that would be created between two clans. It was rarely about the individuals themselves.\n\nDr [[Asesela Ravuvu]] states in his book ''The Fijian Way of Life'' (1983, p.&nbsp;45):\n<blockquote>\n\n\"Marriage was not just a union of two individuals, it was also the 'marriage' of the two groups, who thereby became socially and economically related to one another\". \n</blockquote>\n\nMegan Lee writes in her paper \"Life in a Fijian Village\": \n<blockquote>\nThe woman and man were used as tools to foster the social relations between the two groups. For a man and woman to marry from two groups that had no previous social or economic relationship was uncommon. Marriage was often used to reinforce a tie between two groups that had been united by a marriage several generations past. \n</blockquote>\n\nElopement has become more common but it does cause tension between the wife and her in-laws. If this happens, the following ceremony called ''Bulubulu'' (meaning \"to bury\") must be performed. This reconciles the two families, as it is viewed that the husband committed a theft of sorts. It is costly to perform bulubulu, and is generally not done until some years after the marriage. The wife may not return to her village until it is performed.\n\nIf all protocol is followed, the Tevutevu is performed. It involves both sides of the family, in which they present the couple with mats and other household practical items so they are able to begin their new home. While they are still part of a larger clan this symbolises that they are now a separate and independent family\n\n===Deaths===\nWhen a death occurs, related clans and family come together in a religious and social gathering to share their sorrow and to reaffirm the connections between them.\n\nThe death has the \"Reguregu\", which is the lead-up to the burial, where all the friends and extended family come to pay their respects. The presentation etiquette utilises Mats, Yaqona and Tabua and varies from province to province. After several days of this the actual burial takes place and Mats and masi are placed over the grave site. The death is commemorated at the burial ceremony and again on the fourth and tenth nights thereafter. One hundred days after the death the mourning is lifted and the various Taboos, or in Fijian ''Tabu'', are lifted from the family members in what is called the ''Vakataraisulu'' ceremony. The grave site is then cemented in. A further ceremony is held one year later. Each of the gatherings mentioned above include both the mother's and the father's sides being brought together.\n\nThese ceremonies are not as stringent today as in times past. Each province follows a similar pattern but with specific variations.\n\n==Ceremonial items and etiquette==\n\nItems that will be shared generally across the Fiji group in ceremony and social interactions are Yaqona, Tabua, Mats, Masi, the following will discuss this in further details.\n\n===Yaqona===\n{{main|Kava}}\nYaqona is a cousin of the pepper plant. The root and stem are washed and dried thoroughly, then pounded into a powder to be mixed with water and filtered through a silk cloth. Before the introduction of silk special reeds were used.\n\nYaqona is a central and ancient part of Fijian ceremony. Whereas Yaqona was once only for use by priests (Bete), chiefs and elders, it is now consumed by all. The following outlines a Yaqona ceremony in the Bauan manner ([[Bau Island|Bau]]: a prominent island and village of the [[Kubuna|Kubuna Confederacy]] in the province of Tailevu).\n\nYaqona is consumed seated on a rectangular Pandanus mat. At one end is a Tanoa (wooden or clay mixing bowl). The front area has Magimagi (coconut fiber rope) and cowry shells attached to the Magimagi. This rope is laid out toward the chief, while next to the chief will be his spokesman and other senior men. Behind the Tanoa will generally be three people: one mixing and two to serve and gather water as needed.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KavaB.jpg|thumb|right|235px|A traditional Kava Ceremony for a Chief \"Yaqona Vaka Turaga\"]] -->\nOnce the person mixing has all he needs in front of him, he will sit cross-legged and upright, touch the Tanoa and say, ''\u201cQai vakarau lose Saka Na Yaqona vaka Turaga\u201d'' (I will respectfully mix the Yaqona for the Chieftain). After mixing, he takes the coconut shell bowl and fills it with Yaqona. He lifts it high and then lets the Yaqona pour back into the Tanoa so the Chief's herald can see the Yaqona. The herald, on seeing it is too sosoko (strong) will exclaim ''\u201cWai\u201d''. On hearing this the mixer will add more water and repeat the same action until he hears the herald say ''\u201cWai donu\u201d''. He then knows the Yaqona is a good mix and is ready to be served. He puts his hands together and circles the Tanoa with his hands, saying, ''\u201cQai darama saka tu na Yaqona Vakaturaga\u201d'' (With respect the chiefs Yaqona is ready to drink). Then he cups his hands, claps three times and begins to serve the Yaqona in a Bilo (coconut shell cup). This will then be carefully taken to the chief in his personal bilo (all others will drink of the same cup). The chief will receive the bilo of Yaqona by cupping his hands and clapping with a deep, dignified sound. Then he will take his bilo and drink. As he is drinking everyone will clap in slow time, and when he is finished the herald will exclaim ''\u201cMaca\u201d'' and all will clap three times. The same will be repeated for the herald, but all will clap only twice when he is finished. For a time this process will be repeated, then once he feels it appropriate the herald will signal to the mixer to open the drinking of the Yaqona to everyone. He touches either side of the Tanoa and says ''\u201cTaki vakavo Na Yaqona vaka Turaga\u201d'' ( Now all may drink of the chiefs Yaqona) and will then clap twice. All will then be allowed to drink, following the order of seniority. If someone comes in the middle of drinking he must bring a small offering (sevusevu) of Kava/Yaqona as a sign of respect. He will announce himself with a respectful greeting and then the senior members drinking will invite him to join in. He will say a few words of respect when he places his Yaqona on the mat before the others. Then a member of the drinking party, generally the herald, will touch the Yaqona and say a few words ending with ''\u201cTarai Saka tu na sevusevu Levu\u201d'' as an acceptance of the token of respect (Sevusevu) and the drinking session will continue along with the telling of many stories. Once the Tanoa is empty and the herald sees it fit to end the drinking session and not to mix again, he will signal to the mixer, who will then say: ''\u201cQai maca saka tu na Yaqona Vakaturaga\u201d'' (respectfully to you all, the chiefly Yaqona is finished).\n\nAmong family and friend gatherings this etiquette is more loosely followed and dialect and social etiquette can vary from place to place.\n\n===Tabua===\n{{main|Tabua}}\nThe Tabua is a whale's tooth and is a valued gift in ceremonial presentations,<ref>Karen J. Brison, ''Our Wealth Is Loving Each Other: Self and Society in Fiji'', p. 37; also read through the chapter \"Defining the community through ceremony\".</ref> the greater number of teeth presented the greater the gift. It is important for the presenter to always play down the offering, but those receiving will always talk up the offering: if it is small they will say it is great, the point is eloquence and humility.\n\n===Mats===\n\nMats are generally rectangular and vary in design between provinces. They are made from the Pandanus plant, a saltwater marsh plant also found throughout the Pacific and South East Asia. The leaves are boiled, pounded with a heavy wooden mallet and then dried and rolled into bundles. They are then woven into mats of varying design. The colours are normally an earthy beige and black or brown with dyes used from the mangrove tree, though now, some modern materials are used such as coloured yarn to make frilled edges. The exchanging of mats has been common practice in all forms of Fijian ceremony from ancient times.\n\nMasi is made from the bark of the mulberry tree. The outer layer is separated from the core of the stalk/stem and the dark outer bark is scraped off. The strips of fibre are placed on a wooden anvil like a low stool, or on any flat hard surface, and the fibre is beaten with wooden clubs, beating and folding it repeatedly until it is almost half a metre wide. Pieces are then overlapped and beaten at the joints to form larger pieces. The resulting cloth is dried in the sun.\n\nThe dyes, generally variations of earthy browns and blacks, are obtained from mangrove sap, terracotta clay and specially prepared soot. Masi can also be smoked over a sugarcane fire to produce the tan-coloured masi kuvui. The designs vary from province to province. The most famous and intricate designs are from the island of Vatulele. The Lau group is also renowned for its crafts and particularly for the art of making fine Masi. The finest white masi considered to originate from Tonga. The Masi can be used as a permanent decorative piece in a house or a temporary decorative piece at various ceremonies.\n\nOne of the uses of Masi is to wrap the newborn baby collected from hospital, while at the other end of the life cycle it decorates the room where the body lies before burial. It also covers the coffin, and is spread over the grave.\n\n===Other items===\nWhile Tabua, Yaqona and Mats are crucial items in ceremony and social gatherings, many other items are included, such as various root crops and now flour, bread, tinned foods, kerosene, soaps and the like for rural and distant areas. These help to meet physical needs whereas Tabua and Yaqona are items of respect and hold a spiritual significance.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Culture of Fiji]]\n*[[Religion in Fiji]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=ScuTytmgE6MC&pg=PA87&ots=zabSUwoeoZ&dq=Liga+Ni+Magiti&sig=Rgl4MG7PawInCxzJrIE60Wno5lU#PPA87,M1 Marshall Sahlins, ''Islands of History'', University of Chicago Press, 1987, p. 87.] Details in the terms Liga ni Magiti and Liga ni Wau, among other details on Fijian social structure.\n* ''The Journal of General Psychology'', By [[Edward Bradford Titchener]], Contributor Edward Bradford Titchner, Carl Allanmore Murchison, Journal Press, 1928.

The term Fijian in this article refers to \"indigenous Fijians\" or ''\"I Taukei\"''<ref>Marshall David Sahlins, ''Apologies to Thucydides'', p. 230.</ref> as the term Fijian generally includes all citizens of Fiji. This article is a general overview of various aspects of Fijian tradition, social structure and ceremony, much of it from the Bauan Fijian tradition. There are variations from province to province. Many social intricacies depend on one's inherited social position and the occasion one is confronted with: each will have a particular social etiquette.  The Fijian terms in this article are most often of the Bauan dialect.\n\n== Social structure ==\nTraditionally, each Fijian villager is born into a certain role in the family unit or Tokatoka. Various heads of the family will administer and lead the family unit within the village community. Each chief of the village will in turn lead the people to fulfill their role to the Vanua.\n\nEach village will have several family units / Tokatoka <ref name=Goulbourne>Harry Goulbourne, ''Race and Ethnicity'', p. 26.</ref> which are part of one clan or Mataqali.<ref name=Goulbourne/> Several Mataqali will make up the larger tribe or Yavusa.<ref name=Goulbourne/><ref name=Dixon>R. M. W. Dixon, ''A Grammar of Boumaa Fijian'', pp. 1-3.</ref> Several Yavusa will belong to a certain land mass and comprise thereby the Vanua<ref name=Goulbourne/> (confederation of Yavusa)<ref name=Dixon/> Dr Asesela Ravuvu (1983, p.&nbsp;76) describes the Vanua as:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe living soul or human manifestation of the physical environment which the members have since claimed to belong to them and to which they also belong. The land is the physical or geographical entity of the people, upon which their survival...as a group depends. Land is thus an extension of the self. Likewise the people are an extension of the land. Land becomes lifeless and useless without the people, and likewise the people are helpless and insecure without land to thrive upon. \n</blockquote>\n\nThe Vanua is headed by a Turaga i taukei,<ref name=Kaplan>Martha Kaplan, \"Embattled People of the Land\", in ''Neither Cargo Nor Cult'', p. 25.</ref> the most prominent chief from the most prominent family. To explain further, a Vanua is the largest collective group of people associated with a particular territory or area of land. A Vanua is divisible into a group of Yavusa / tribes: a Yavusa is a group of Mataqali <ref name=Kaplan/>/ clans: a Mataqali is a group of Tokatoka<ref name=Kaplan/> / family units. Within the Mataqali making up one Yavusa one Mataqali will be predominant and head that Yavusa as a whole. Similarly, one Tokatoka will head that Mataqali and one member of that Tokatoka will be Senior Chieftain / Turaga i Taukei of that Vanua.\n\nMatanitu<ref name=Goulbourne/><ref name=Kaplan/> is a confederation of Vanua,<ref name=Dixon/> not through ancestry or traditional ties, but rather by alliances formed politically or in war and/or united by a common need.\n\n===The feast and the club===\n\nWithin the Fijian Bauan belief system, all Fijians fall into one of the two following categories which will indicate their position and role in the community:\n \n::1. Liga-ni-Magiti (hand of the feast)<ref name=Islands>Marshall David Sahlins, ''Islands of History'', p. 87.</ref> (8) - 3 Turaga (e.g. [[Ratu]]/[[Adi (title)|Adi]]) positions); & 5 Bete {e.g. Matanivanua} positions.\n\n::2. Liga-ni-Wau (hand of the club)<ref name=Islands/> (7)  - 3 Bati (e.g. Tora); 2 Matai (e.g. matavule); 2 Dau (e.g. Tunidau) positions.\n\nThe two categories are further divided into subcategories which are indicated by a number. There is Liga ni Magiti, which is category one and is indicated by the number 8 (Walu), which then has two subcategories; first 3, which is Turaga overall, containing the Ratu and the Adi (Fijian Royalty). These are considered born leaders and administrators. Then, secondly, subcategory 5 of Category 1 is the Bete - priests or heralds; these traditionally are the spokesmen, councillors, advisors of the land and the spiritualists.\n\nCategory 2, Liga ni Wau, is indicated by the number 7 (Vitu). Liga ni Wau has three subcategories. First there is 3, the Bati, traditionally Warriors, they are the wagers of war, the keepers of the peace,  and the instruments of discipline on behalf of the Turaga. Then there is subcategory 2: Matai - a general term for skillful persons, (e.g. carpenters, craftsman, house or canoe builders). The last subcategory, 2 Dau, is  the general term for an expert of some kind (e.g. dau-ni-vucu [Poet], dau-ni-yau [treasurer]). It is said socially, ''\u201cKe na Dau qori\u201d'', meaning \u201cHe is the expert\u201d.\n\n== Relationship terms within Fijian society ==\n\nA first question generally in Fiji is \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d so people may ascertain what relationship they hold with you and how will they interact with you. There are various relationship terms in Fiji. These include:\n\n\"Tauvu\". Tau (friend); Vu (Spirit); having the same Vu, root or founder. [[Basil Thomson]] (1908:113) suggests \u201cthat groups in Fiji who are tauvu or kalou-vata ie worshippers of the same god, have a common origin\u201d.\n0\nTauvu are allowed reciprocal rights of taking each other's goods and coarse joking with each other, though this is not used inland in Viti-Levu. The following are some Tauvu groupings:\n\n<blockquote>\n#\t[[Lomaloma]] and Moturiki also to Yadrana village on [[Lakeba]] Island and also to                                   [[Moala Island]]\n#\t[[Lomaiviti (archipelago)|Lomaiviti]] and [[Cakaudrove Province|Cakaudrove]]\n#\tCakaudrove and Bua\n#\tLakeba and Noco\n#\tLau and [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]\n#\tCakaudrove and [[Tailevu Province|Tailevu]]\n#\tRa/Nadroga/Kadavu/Ba\n#\tMacuata/[[Naitasiri Province|Naitasiri]]\n#\tSerua/Kadavu\n#\tNadroga/[[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]]\n#\tNadi/Kadavu\n#\tOno-I-Lau/[[Bau Island]]\n#\tOno, Kadavu/Ono-I-Lau\n#       Ono-I-Lau/Oneata\n</blockquote>\n\n===Other terms===\n\"Tako-Lavo\". This relationship relates to people of Colo from Inland [[Viti Levu]] e.g. Serua, [[Namosi Province|Namosi]] areas, The meaning of Tako-Lavo is the Father {Tako} Son {Lavo} relationship. \"Kaivata\" or \"Kai\" may be used generally across the board to all Fijians, if they identify themselves within the same Province. \"Kai-noqu\" may be used when one Fijian is generally addressing another Fijian that they share the same blood somewhere in their lineage.\n\nThe term \"Vasu\" in Fiji refers to an individual's maternal ties to a village, Matagali etc. \nIf a child is of a woman of rank he/she is a ''Vasu Levu'' to that particular area. If both mother and father are Fijian, he/she is a ''Vasu I Taukei''. If both mother and father are Fijian and both are of a very senior chiefly rank from respective areas, then the child's Vasu connection is referred to as ''Turaga na Vasu''. Intermarriage through the Vasu was used to expand kingdoms and unite old enemies or strengthen family links.<ref>Matanitu, Chapter 1, p. 36.</ref><ref>''Fiji and the Fijians'', Chapter 2, pp. 34, 35.</ref>\n\n===An example===\nIf a Fijian was Kai Rewa and Vasu i Lau (paternally from Rewa District of Rewa Province and maternally from Lakeba, Lau), then he/she would be considered from Rewa, which is of the Burebasaga confederacy and Lakeba of the Lau Province, which is of the Tovata confederacy. With respect to his/her matrilineal side, being that of Lakeba, Lau Province of [[Tovata]], the following applies:\n\nIf he/she were to take his/her father's side and purely acknowledge his/her lineage from [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]] Tikina, Rewa Province, of the [[Burebasaga]] confederacy the following would apply:\n\nHe/she would say \"Naita\" to those from [[Tailevu Province|Tailevu]] and Yasayasa Vakara and \"Tauvu\" to those from the Lau group.\n\n== Relationships within the Fijian family ==\nThere is great intricacy of social interaction among families and close tribes, between brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles and the like. The Fijian concept of \"family\" does not align with the Western notion of a normative family. Extended family members will adopt roles and titles of a direct guardian. The iTaukei (Indigenous Fijians) culture is not based on biological lineage but instead on a child's link to a spiritual ancestor. This has proved to be somewhat of a hurdle when attempting to apply Western culture in a Fijian landscape, such as the use of a predominantly Western criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304495447_Child_Sexual_Abuse_in_Fiji_Authority_Risk_Factors_and_Responses|title=Whitehead, John and Roffee, James.

Current Issues in Criminal Justice, Vol. 27, No. 3, Mar 2016: [323]-334}}</ref>\n\nMegan Lee, in her paper ''Life in a Fijian Village'' while studying social structure and organization of Naivuvuni Village states: \u201cThe kinship system is an essential aspect of Fijian life. The ways in which people interact with each other is based upon how they are related to each other within the family unit. Respect and avoidance relationships are critical to the kinship system. Respect is based on three main concepts: age, sex and social distance. The older a person is, the more respect they command, regardless of sex or social rank. The amount of respect displayed also depends on the amount of social distance between people. People who interact with one another on a regular basis tend to be more relaxed and less strict about the proper respect relationships. People who do not see each other as often and are less familiar with each other follow the expected rules more stringently.\u201d\n\nThe following terms (with variation between provinces) are used among close family members:\n\nThe term \"Yaca\" is used to refer to one's \"namesake\" when a child in memory of a relative who has passed on. Children are also named after a living relative. The term is even more loosely used today among friends if you share the same name, though this is not used in its correct context.\n\nAnne E. Becker in her book ''Body, Self, and Society: the view from Fiji'' writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn the event that a kin relationship cannot be conjured from the meeting, the respective parties will invoke one of many other relationships that associate them in some way for instances they may be mutual namesakes (Yaca) or their respective regional ancestral spirits (Vu) May have been friends so by syllogism they are Tauvu and address each other as Tau.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe term \"Tavale\" is used by those who are cross cousins for example the son or daughter of a father's sister or mother's brother.\n\nMegan Lee in her paper \"Life in a Fijian Village\", in Chapter 2, Social Structure and Organization of Naivuvuni Village, writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nTraditionally, it was from this group of relatives that a man would choose his wife although today this practice is not usually followed. Male and female cross cousins are referred to as tavale. Men also refer to female cross cousins as tavale and women call men by the same instead of using their real name. A woman refers to another female cross cousin as \"dauve\", or sister-in-law, because a female cross cousin's brother could become a husband. Similarly, a female refers to her male cross cousin's wife as \"karua\", which means second wife, because if she were to die, a cross cousin could become his new wife. Cross cousins also have the responsibility of burying one another when they die. \n</blockquote>\n\nAlso [[William Halse Rivers]] in his book ''The History of Melanesian Society'' states:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn Fiji the term of the coastal people are determined by their cross cousin marriage, viz., Tavale, davola and dauve but among the [[mountain people]] there are number of other terms including daku, vitabui, vaidakavi, veilavi and vikila though Tavale of the coastal people is frequently used.\n</blockquote>\n\n\"Tata, Nana, Nei\" and \"Momo\".\nParents of cross cousins are treated the same as biological parents, a child's mother's younger sister is referred to as nana Lailai or little mother. If she is older than the child's own mother, then she is referred to as Nana levu or big mother. Likewise, the child father's brothers are called Tata Lailai and Tata Levu according to seniority.\n\nA child's father's sister is referred to as Nei or aunt whereas a child's mother's brother is referred to as Momo. The relationship with the parents of one's cross cousins is relaxed, while keeping in mind that respect must be shown Momo and Nei because they are older.\n\nThe above are but simple examples and further intricacies exist.\n\n==Fijian ceremonies==\nFijian social interactions are filled with ceremony of varying degrees. Depending on the occasion and situation, three key ceremonies, which accord with other cultures, are: birth, death, and marriage.\n\n===Births===\nTraditionally speaking, birthdays were not celebrated in Fijian society. However, there are some people's birthdays that have special significance. For example, the first birthday of the first-born child is often celebrated by both sides of the family. The father's side will bring mats that the child sits on during the feast and celebration, and then afterwards the mother's side takes them away and distributes them among themselves. The focus is, unusually, on the different groups and not the individual.\n\n===Engagement===\nA formal engagement (''ai lakovi'') involves the presentation of a [[tabua]] (whale's tooth) from a man to a woman.\n\n===Marriages===\nArranged marriages are rarely practiced in modern Fiji. Traditionally however, a marriage would be arranged by the man's parents and senior members of his Mataqali and would have been based on the relationship that would be created between two clans. It was rarely about the individuals themselves.\n\nDr [[Asesela Ravuvu]] states in his book ''The Fijian Way of Life'' (1983, p.&nbsp;45):\n<blockquote>\n\n\"Marriage was not just a union of two individuals, it was also the 'marriage' of the two groups, who thereby became socially and economically related to one another\". \n</blockquote>\n\nMegan Lee writes in her paper \"Life in a Fijian Village\": \n<blockquote>\nThe woman and man were used as tools to foster the social relations between the two groups. For a man and woman to marry from two groups that had no previous social or economic relationship was uncommon. Marriage was often used to reinforce a tie between two groups that had been united by a marriage several generations past. \n</blockquote>\n\nElopement has become more common but it does cause tension between the wife and her in-laws. If this happens, the following ceremony called ''Bulubulu'' (meaning \"to bury\") must be performed. This reconciles the two families, as it is viewed that the husband committed a theft of sorts. It is costly to perform bulubulu, and is generally not done until some years after the marriage. The wife may not return to her village until it is performed.\n\nIf all protocol is followed, the Tevutevu is performed. It involves both sides of the family, in which they present the couple with mats and other household practical items so they are able to begin their new home. While they are still part of a larger clan this symbolises that they are now a separate and independent family\n\n===Deaths===\nWhen a death occurs, related clans and family come together in a religious and social gathering to share their sorrow and to reaffirm the connections between them.\n\nThe death has the \"Reguregu\", which is the lead-up to the burial, where all the friends and extended family come to pay their respects. The presentation etiquette utilises Mats, Yaqona and Tabua and varies from province to province. After several days of this the actual burial takes place and Mats and masi are placed over the grave site. The death is commemorated at the burial ceremony and again on the fourth and tenth nights thereafter. One hundred days after the death the mourning is lifted and the various Taboos, or in Fijian ''Tabu'', are lifted from the family members in what is called the ''Vakataraisulu'' ceremony. The grave site is then cemented in. A further ceremony is held one year later. Each of the gatherings mentioned above include both the mother's and the father's sides being brought together.\n\nThese ceremonies are not as stringent today as in times past. Each province follows a similar pattern but with specific variations.\n\n==Ceremonial items and etiquette==\n\nItems that will be shared generally across the Fiji group in ceremony and social interactions are Yaqona, Tabua, Mats, Masi, the following will discuss this in further details.\n\n===Yaqona===\n{{main|Kava}}\nYaqona is a cousin of the pepper plant. The root and stem are washed and dried thoroughly, then pounded into a powder to be mixed with water and filtered through a silk cloth. Before the introduction of silk special reeds were used.\n\nYaqona is a central and ancient part of Fijian ceremony. Whereas Yaqona was once only for use by priests (Bete), chiefs and elders, it is now consumed by all. The following outlines a Yaqona ceremony in the Bauan manner ([[Bau Island|Bau]]: a prominent island and village of the [[Kubuna|Kubuna Confederacy]] in the province of Tailevu).\n\nYaqona is consumed seated on a rectangular Pandanus mat. At one end is a Tanoa (wooden or clay mixing bowl). The front area has Magimagi (coconut fiber rope) and cowry shells attached to the Magimagi. This rope is laid out toward the chief, while next to the chief will be his spokesman and other senior men. Behind the Tanoa will generally be three people: one mixing and two to serve and gather water as needed.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KavaB.jpg|thumb|right|235px|A traditional Kava Ceremony for a Chief \"Yaqona Vaka Turaga\"]] -->\nOnce the person mixing has all he needs in front of him, he will sit cross-legged and upright, touch the Tanoa and say, ''\u201cQai vakarau lose Saka Na Yaqona vaka Turaga\u201d'' (I will respectfully mix the Yaqona for the Chieftain). After mixing, he takes the coconut shell bowl and fills it with Yaqona. He lifts it high and then lets the Yaqona pour back into the Tanoa so the Chief's herald can see the Yaqona. The herald, on seeing it is too sosoko (strong) will exclaim ''\u201cWai\u201d''. On hearing this the mixer will add more water and repeat the same action until he hears the herald say ''\u201cWai donu\u201d''. He then knows the Yaqona is a good mix and is ready to be served. He puts his hands together and circles the Tanoa with his hands, saying, ''\u201cQai darama saka tu na Yaqona Vakaturaga\u201d'' (With respect the chiefs Yaqona is ready to drink). Then he cups his hands, claps three times and begins to serve the Yaqona in a Bilo (coconut shell cup). This will then be carefully taken to the chief in his personal bilo (all others will drink of the same cup). The chief will receive the bilo of Yaqona by cupping his hands and clapping with a deep, dignified sound. Then he will take his bilo and drink. As he is drinking everyone will clap in slow time, and when he is finished the herald will exclaim ''\u201cMaca\u201d'' and all will clap three times. The same will be repeated for the herald, but all will clap only twice when he is finished. For a time this process will be repeated, then once he feels it appropriate the herald will signal to the mixer to open the drinking of the Yaqona to everyone. He touches either side of the Tanoa and says ''\u201cTaki vakavo Na Yaqona vaka Turaga\u201d'' ( Now all may drink of the chiefs Yaqona) and will then clap twice. All will then be allowed to drink, following the order of seniority. If someone comes in the middle of drinking he must bring a small offering (sevusevu) of Kava/Yaqona as a sign of respect. He will announce himself with a respectful greeting and then the senior members drinking will invite him to join in. He will say a few words of respect when he places his Yaqona on the mat before the others. Then a member of the drinking party, generally the herald, will touch the Yaqona and say a few words ending with ''\u201cTarai Saka tu na sevusevu Levu\u201d'' as an acceptance of the token of respect (Sevusevu) and the drinking session will continue along with the telling of many stories. Once the Tanoa is empty and the herald sees it fit to end the drinking session and not to mix again, he will signal to the mixer, who will then say: ''\u201cQai maca saka tu na Yaqona Vakaturaga\u201d'' (respectfully to you all, the chiefly Yaqona is finished).\n\nAmong family and friend gatherings this etiquette is more loosely followed and dialect and social etiquette can vary from place to place.\n\n===Tabua===\n{{main|Tabua}}\nThe Tabua is a whale's tooth and is a valued gift in ceremonial presentations,<ref>Karen J. Brison, ''Our Wealth Is Loving Each Other: Self and Society in Fiji'', p. 37; also read through the chapter \"Defining the community through ceremony\".</ref> the greater number of teeth presented the greater the gift. It is important for the presenter to always play down the offering, but those receiving will always talk up the offering: if it is small they will say it is great, the point is eloquence and humility.\n\n===Mats===\n\nMats are generally rectangular and vary in design between provinces. They are made from the Pandanus plant, a saltwater marsh plant also found throughout the Pacific and South East Asia. The leaves are boiled, pounded with a heavy wooden mallet and then dried and rolled into bundles. They are then woven into mats of varying design. The colours are normally an earthy beige and black or brown with dyes used from the mangrove tree, though now, some modern materials are used such as coloured yarn to make frilled edges. The exchanging of mats has been common practice in all forms of Fijian ceremony from ancient times.\n\nMasi is made from the bark of the mulberry tree. The outer layer is separated from the core of the stalk/stem and the dark outer bark is scraped off. The strips of fibre are placed on a wooden anvil like a low stool, or on any flat hard surface, and the fibre is beaten with wooden clubs, beating and folding it repeatedly until it is almost half a metre wide. Pieces are then overlapped and beaten at the joints to form larger pieces. The resulting cloth is dried in the sun.\n\nThe dyes, generally variations of earthy browns and blacks, are obtained from mangrove sap, terracotta clay and specially prepared soot. Masi can also be smoked over a sugarcane fire to produce the tan-coloured masi kuvui. The designs vary from province to province. The most famous and intricate designs are from the island of Vatulele. The Lau group is also renowned for its crafts and particularly for the art of making fine Masi. The finest white masi considered to originate from Tonga. The Masi can be used as a permanent decorative piece in a house or a temporary decorative piece at various ceremonies.\n\nOne of the uses of Masi is to wrap the newborn baby collected from hospital, while at the other end of the life cycle it decorates the room where the body lies before burial. It also covers the coffin, and is spread over the grave.\n\n===Other items===\nWhile Tabua, Yaqona and Mats are crucial items in ceremony and social gatherings, many other items are included, such as various root crops and now flour, bread, tinned foods, kerosene, soaps and the like for rural and distant areas. These help to meet physical needs whereas Tabua and Yaqona are items of respect and hold a spiritual significance.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Culture of Fiji]]\n*[[Religion in Fiji]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=ScuTytmgE6MC&pg=PA87&ots=zabSUwoeoZ&dq=Liga+Ni+Magiti&sig=Rgl4MG7PawInCxzJrIE60Wno5lU#PPA87,M1 Marshall Sahlins, ''Islands of History'', University of Chicago Press, 1987, p. 87.] Details in the terms Liga ni Magiti and Liga ni Wau, among other details on Fijian social structure.\n* ''The Journal of General Psychology'', By [[Edward Bradford Titchener]], Contributor Edward Bradford Titchner, Carl Allanmore Murchison, Journal Press, 1928.

Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses,<ref>[[Most common words in English]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamu.si/polysemy_top_100|title=Polysemy in top 100 Oxford English Corpus words within Wiktionary|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> which makes the odds of a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'. Particularly \"tu\".|website=Reddit|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> Since its English reference material contains only \"you\" forms, it has difficulty translating a language with \"you all\" or formal \"you\" variations.\n\nDue to differences between languages in investment, research, and the extent of digital resources, the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some languages produce better results than others. Most languages from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well-financed European languages, with Afrikaans and Chinese being the high-scoring exceptions from their continents.<ref name=\"Kamu.si\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freitas|first=Connor|last2=Liu|first2=Yudong|date=December 15, 2017|title=Exploring the Differences between Human and Machine Translation|url=https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=wwu_honors|journal=Western Washington University|volume=|pages=5|via=}}</ref> No languages indigenous to Australia or the Americas are included within Google Translate. Higher scores for European can be partially attributed to the [[Europarl Corpus]], a trove of documents from the [[European Parliament]] that have been professionally translated by the mandate of the [[European Union]] into as many as 21 languages.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.\n\nIn its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.<ref name=\":52\" /> Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMoreover, like all machine translation programs, Google Translate struggles with [[polysemy]] (the multiple meanings a word may have)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#polysemy|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Polysemy|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> and [[multiword expression]]s (terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#party-terms|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Party Terms|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language.

Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses,<ref>[[Most common words in English]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamu.si/polysemy_top_100|title=Polysemy in top 100 Oxford English Corpus words within Wiktionary|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> which makes the odds of a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'. Particularly \"tu\".|website=Reddit|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> Since its English reference material contains only \"you\" forms, it has difficulty translating a language with \"you all\" or formal \"you\" variations.\n\nDue to differences between languages in investment, research, and the extent of digital resources, the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some languages produce better results than others. Most languages from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well-financed European languages, with Afrikaans and Chinese being the high-scoring exceptions from their continents.<ref name=\"Kamu.si\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freitas|first=Connor|last2=Liu|first2=Yudong|date=December 15, 2017|title=Exploring the Differences between Human and Machine Translation|url=https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=wwu_honors|journal=Western Washington University|volume=|pages=5|via=}}</ref> No languages indigenous to Australia or the Americas are included within Google Translate.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.\n\nIn its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.<ref name=\":52\" /> Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMoreover, like all machine translation programs, Google Translate struggles with [[polysemy]] (the multiple meanings a word may have)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#polysemy|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Polysemy|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> and [[multiword expression]]s (terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#party-terms|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Party Terms|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit in 918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> Its purpose was to take into account and defend the estates within the historic [[Anglican_Diocese_of_Worcester|See of Worcester]], held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 7) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 8: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit in 918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> Its purpose was to take into account and defend the estates within the historic [[Anglican_Diocese_of_Worcester|See of Worcester]], held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Fig 2 showed that Worcestershire would have witnessed the formation of a county administration and a loss of Yardley, Shipston-on-Stour and Tredington to Warwickshire.<ref>The Times, 4 January 1889</ref> The Act also legislated for Dudley to reunite with the rest of the county, through a transfer of [[Rowley Regis]] and [[Cradley Heath]] from Staffordshire. The proposals would have also seen [[Smethwick]] join Worcestershire, plus [[Burford,_Shropshire|Burford]] (uniting all of [[Tenbury]] [[rural sanitary district]] into one county), [[Ipsley]], [[Upper Arley]], [[Pebworth]] and [[West Malvern]]. The proposed border with Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Herefordshire would have seen considerable exchanges of parishes, thus eliminating all of Worcestershire's exclaves/enclaves.<ref>''The Boundary Commission'', The Times, 28 March 1888</ref> This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative ''[[Local Government Act 1888]]''.

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 7) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 8: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.
