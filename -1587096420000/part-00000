{"title_page": "International World War Peace Tree", "text_new": "{{one source|date=March 2014}}\nThe '''International World War Peace Tree''' is a [[Tilia|linden tree]] on the southwestern edge of [[Darmstadt, Indiana]], serving as a reminder of [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Germany's armistice]] with the United States in 1918.\n\n==Description==\nThe tree stands on the northwest corner of St. Joseph Avenue and Orchard Road, surrounded by [[cornfields]]. Its relative isolation from the nearby forests makes it easy to identify. In front of the tree is a wooden sign reading, \"International World War Peace Tree - Nov. 11, 1918\".  The date marks the end of [[World War I]]. The tree is {{convert|40|ft}} tall and is at least {{age|1912|12|31}} years old.<ref name=\"courier\" />\n\nThe sign in front of the tree is frequently adorned with small [[American flag]]s, particularly around patriotic holidays such as [[Memorial Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], and [[Veterans Day]].<ref name = \"courier\">{{cite news|title = Family still tends to WWI 'peace tree'|url=http://www.courierpress.com/lifestyle/family-still-tends-ww-i-peace-tree |first=Rich |last=Davis |journal = [[Evansville Courier & Press]]|date=May 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe tree has its origins in Germany. It was brought to the United States in 1912 as a [[seedling]] by [[Joseph Freudenburg]], prior to World War I.

After he presents his plan to strengthen the country economically and militarily, the king cedes the throne to him and Souma finds himself saddled with ruling the nation! What's more, he's betrothed to the king's daughter now...?! In order to get the country back on its feet, Kazuya calls the wise, the talented, and the gifted to his side. Five people gather before the newly crowned Souma. Just what are the many talents and abilities they possess...?! What path will his outlook as a realist take Kazuya and the people of his country down?

Now king, Kazuya begins radical reforms in order to improve the [[standard of living]] in the kingdom. In the One Week War, Kazuya finds himself in a civil war between himself and Dukes Georg Carmine and Castor Vargas while also having to fight the Principality of Amidonia. Through a series of military strategies, Kazuya emerges victorious and annexes Amidonia (although this was entirely unplanned on his part) to create the '''Unified Kingdom of Elfrieden and Amidonia''', otherwise known as the ''Kingdom of Friedonia''. He then forges a secret alliance with Empress Maria Euphoria of the Gran Chaos Empire.\n\n;{{nihongo|'''Liscia Elfrieden'''|\u30ea\u30fc\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3|R\u012bshia Erufur\u012bden}}\n: The crown princess of the Elfriedon Kingdom and Kazuya's first fianc\u00e9e, Liscia was at Kazuya's side from the very beginning. Initially dissatisfied with the unannounced engagement, Liscia soon softens and eventually develops deep feelings for Kazuya. Following the end of the One Week War, both Kazuya and Liscia affirm their love for each other, which results with the beginning of a series of nightly activities. Liscia is extremely tolerant of Kazuya's philandering, even encouraging him to take more wives, however, she remains adamant about wanting to remain the first wife.\n\n;{{nihongo|'''Aisha Udgard'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30a6\u30c9\u30ac\u30eb\u30c9|A\u012bsha Udogarudo}}\n: Daughter of the Chief of the Dark Elves of the God Protected Forest, Aisha Udgard is one of the 5 people discovered during the gathering of the Gifted People, the first policy Kazuya implemented upon his impromptu accession to the throne. She serves as Kazuya's bodyguard and falls deeply in love with him during the [[landslide]] incident that struck her home. Following the One Week War, Aisha becomes Kazuya's second fianc\u00e9e in recognition for her actions in that war concerning the hostile Principality of Amidonia. She is an utter glutton and Kazuya himself thinks of her as a cute pet.\n\n;{{nihongo|'''Juna Doma'''|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ca\u30fb\u30c9\u30fc\u30de|Juna D\u014dma}}\n: Also known as '''Lady Canaria''' of the Elfrieden Navy's Marine force, Juna Doma is the granddaughter of Duchess Excel Walters who was sent to spy on Souma when he was first announced as the new King. She is one of the 5 people discovered during the gathering of the Gifted People. She primarily aids Kazuya in both war and in peace by being the Prima Lorelei, Kazuya's implementation of the concept of the [[Japanese idol]]. After falling in love with Kazuya, she is secretly made into his fourth fianc\u00e9e with the reason for withholding the fact of their betrothal is the possibility of starting riots when the commonfolk discovers that the famous idol is being wed.\n\n;{{nihongo|'''Roroa Amidonia'''|\u30ed\u30ed\u30a2\u30fb\u30a2\u30df\u30c9\u30cb\u30a2|Roroa Amidonia}}\n: The princess of the former Principality of Amidonia, Roroa Amidonia's craftiness had forced Kazuya to not only take her as his third fianc\u00e9e but also annex the entirety of Amidonian territory instead of just the capital in order to prevent the Turgis Republic and the Orthodox Papal State of Lunaria from getting their claws on the territory after the Principality had lost the war.

He has been the only [[African Americans|African American]] Mayor of Los Angeles, and his 20 years in office mark the longest tenure by any mayor in the city's history; barring any change to the City Charter, no other future mayor of Los Angeles will serve longer than Bradley. His [[Los Angeles mayoral election, 1973|1973 election]] made him the second African-American mayor of a major U.S. city. Bradley retired in 1993, after his approval ratings began dropping subsequent to the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]]. Bradley unsuccessfully ran for [[Governor of California]] in [[California gubernatorial election, 1982|1982]] and [[California gubernatorial election, 1986|1986]] and was defeated each time by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George Deukmejian]]. The racial dynamics that appeared to underlie his narrow and unexpected loss in 1982 gave rise to the political term \"the [[Bradley effect]].\" In 1985, he was awarded the [[Spingarn Medal]] from the [[NAACP]].<ref>[http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners NAACP Spingarn Medal]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802063355/http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners |date=2014-08-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nBradley, the grandson of a slave, was born on December 29, 1917, to Lee Thomas and Crenner Bradley, poor sharecroppers who lived in a small log cabin outside [[Calvert, Texas]]. He had four siblings \u2014 Lawrence, Willa Mae, Ellis (who had [[cerebral palsy]]) and Howard. The family moved to Arizona to pick cotton and then in 1924 to the Temple-Alvarado area of Los Angeles, where Lee was a [[Santa Fe Railroad]] porter and Crenner was a maid.<ref name=NYTObituary1998.09.30/><ref name=LATObituary1998.09.30Screen5>[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/30/news/mn-27873/5 Jean Merl and Bill Boyarsky, \"Mayor Who Reshaped L.A.

He became one of the \"just 400 blacks\" among the department's 4,000 officers.

You could not work with a white officer, and that continued until 1964.<ref name=LATObituary1998.09.30Screen7/></blockquote>\n\nBradley and Ethel Arnold met at the New Hope Baptist Church and were married May 4, 1941. They had three daughters, Lorraine,  Phyllis and a baby who died on the day she was born.

The club was part of the [[California Democratic Council]], a liberal, reformist group organized in the 1950s by young Democrats energized by [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai E. Stevenson]]'s presidential campaigns. It was predominantly white and had many Jewish members, thus marking the beginnings of the coalition, which along with Latinos, that would carry him to electoral victory so many times.\n\nHis choice of a Democratic circle also put him at odds with another political force in the African American community, representatives of poor, all-black areas who were associated with the political organization of [[Jesse M. Unruh]], then an up-and-coming state assemblyman. The early stage of Bradley's political career was marked by clashes with African American leaders like onetime California Lieutenant Governor and former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Mervyn Dymally]], an Unruh ally.\n\n===City Council===\nBradley applied for the [[Los Angeles City Council District 10|10th District]] seat in June 1961, when he was still a police lieutenant living at 3397 Welland Avenue; the post had been vacated by [[Charles Navarro]] when he was elected city [[comptroller|controller]].<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/167894287 \"12 Apply for Navarro City Council seat,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 6, 1961, page 21] <code><nowiki>Library card required</nowiki></code></ref> The City Council, which had the power to fill a vacancy, instead appointed [[Joe E.

There were only two candidates, Hollingsworth and Bradley, and also two elections \u2014 one for the unexpired term left by Controller Navarro, ending June 30, and one for a full four-year term starting July 1. Bradley won by 17,760 votes to 10,540 in the first election and by 17,552 votes to 10,400 in the second.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/168247102 \"Complete Returns,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 4, 1963, page 2] <code><nowiki>Library card required</nowiki></code></ref> By then he had retired from the police force, and he was sworn in as a councilman at the age of 45 on April 15, 1963, \"the first Negro ever elected to the council.\"<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/168348780 \"First Negro Elected to City Council Sworn In,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 16, 1963, page A-2]  <code><nowiki>Library card required</nowiki></code></ref>\n\nOne of the first votes he made on a controversial subject was his opposition to a proposed study by City Attorney [[Roger Arnebergh]] and Police Chief [[William H.

Armed with key endorsements (including the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''), Bradley held a substantial lead over Yorty in the primary, but was a few percentage points shy of winning the race outright. However, Yorty pulled an amazing come from behind victory to win reelection. Yorty questioned Bradley's credibility in fighting crime and painted a picture of Bradley, his fellow Democrat, as a threat to Los Angeles because he would supposedly open up the city to feared Black Nationalists. Bradley did not use his record as a police officer in the election. With the racial factor, even many [[Liberalism|liberal]] white voters became hesitant to support Bradley. It would be another four years, in 1973, before Bradley would unseat Yorty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-tom-bradley-19980930-story.html|title=From the Archives: Mayor Who Reshaped L.A.

However  Yorty pulled an amazing come from behind victory to win reelection. Yorty questioned Bradley's credibility in fighting crime and painted a picture of Bradley, his fellow Democrat, as a threat to Los Angeles because he would supposedly open up the city to feared Black Nationalists. Bradley did not use his record as a police officer in the election. With the racial factor, even many [[Liberalism|liberal]] white voters became hesitant to support Bradley.

Most of the national burden of health care is taken up by private health providers.\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] defines health care as an overall maintenance and solution to the health needs of a person, family, or community. It is a system that addresses these health needs are fulfilled through prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.<ref>\"Primary Health Care.\" World Health Organization. Accessed March 29, 2019. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/primary-health-care.</ref> WHO states that the system needs financial stability, well-trained human resources (along with proper salary), proper information/data, and proper maintenance of up to date facilities to be able to deliver quality services, medicine, and researches.<ref>https://www.who.int/topics/health_systems/en/\"Health Systems.\" World Health Organization. January 18, 2018. Accessed March 29, 2019.</ref>\n\nHealth care in the Philippines has been defined by the WHO as \"fragmented\", meaning there's a large gap between the quality and quantity of health services for the poor and the rich. With different reasons such as low budget, low number of man power, or general neglect for the poor, the Philippines has always been unable to keep up with the high standards of healthcare abroad. Comparing data from 2014 between Philippines, United States of America, and Canada, Philippines only spent 4.7% of their GDP on health while USA and Canada spent 17.1% and 10.4%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/countries/phl/en/|title=Philippines|website=World Health Organization|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/countries/usa/en/|title=United States of America|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/countries/can/en/|title=Canada|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> Efforts are being performed to bridge the gap. Last February 20, 2019, The Universal Health Care (UHC) Bill was signed into all, aiming to provide proper healthcare services for all.\n\n== History ==\n=== The Pre-Spanish Era: Pre 1565 ===\nHealth care in the Philippines extends as far back as the 15th century. Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, life and by extension health care, was centered around the animate and inanimate world.\n\nTraditional Filipino medicinal herbs were used for a wide variety of ailments. Anonas leaves were applied to the stomach for indigestion. Betel-nuts leaves and areca nut leaves were common for injuries, chewed and then applied. Sambong was used to treat kidney stones, rheumatism, coughs, colds, hypertension, and diarrhea .<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=24 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \n[[File:Sambong (Blumea balsamifera).jpg|thumb|Sambong (Blumea balsamifera)]]\n\nSpanish historian Miguel de Loarca said the natives were \u201cgood physicians and had a remedy for every poison.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=25 |edition=2nd }}</ref> The seeds of the igasud were chewed as an antidode for poison.

To combat this, they created hospitals specially for their health. Some of the first health institutions in the country were handled by Spanish friars.\n\n==== Hospital Real ====\nBuilt in Cebu in 1565, Hospital Real was the first hospital in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=29 |edition=2nd }}</ref> It was relocated to the Manila to accompany the government. The hospital aimed to nurse the Spanish army and navy, those inflicted with disease, and military casualties. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi had permission from King Philip II to set up the hospital exclusively for Spanish soldiers and sailors, whereas it denied service to Spanish and mestizo women.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=29 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \nAlthough Hospital Real received funding from the Spanish Government, it lacked finances, manpower, and supplies. Administration of Hospital Real was transferred to both [[Franciscans|the Order of St. Francis]] and the Confraternity of La Misericordia.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=30 |edition=2nd }}</ref> Hospital Real was destroyed during [[List of earthquakes in the Philippines#19th century|an earthquake on June 3, 1863]].\n\n==== Hospital de Naturales ====\nFray Juan Clemente, a 54-year-old botanist and lay brother, was instrumental in conception of the Hospital de Naturales. He often made medicine for the many people who begged outside the convent, until eventually the number of patients grew too large for accommodations. Clemente raised funds in order to build better facilities. In 1578, two wards of nipa and bamboo were constructed by Clemente.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=31 |edition=2nd }}</ref>\nCalled the Hospital de los Indios Naturales, or Hospital de Naturales, the hospital flourished under Clemente. Friars tended to the sick, as well as their spiritual needs. The hospital also provided free medical supplies such as oils, herbs, and ointments. Hospital de Naturales was also able to provide medical supplies to other infirmaries and hospitals. Hospital De Naturales came under the patronage of King Philip II, earning it government subsidy. Protection was also guaranteed by the governor-general. \nClemente died after 20 years of working at Hospital de Naturales. A few years after, a fire destroyed the hospital once more (the first time in 1583). The reconstruction of the hospital led to the development of the Hospital de San Lazaro.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=34 |edition=2nd }}</ref>\n\n==== Hospital de San Lazaro ====\nAlthough previously the Hospital de Naturales, the hospital was renamed after Japanese emperor Iemitsu sent 150 lepers.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=44 |edition=2nd }}</ref> Although viewed as a hostile act to the church for its growing influence in Japan, the lepers were taken care of by the hospital, the clergy, and the community. As such, the Hospital de Naturales became known as the Hospital de San Lazaro, after [[Lazarus of Bethany|the patron saint of lepers]]. \nThe Hospital de San Lazaro was demolished twice. Initially when the city of Dilao was threatened by invasion from Chinese pirate Chen Ch\u2019e Kung, and finally after it was taken over and utilized by the British as a military vantage point.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=46 |edition=2nd }}</ref> San Lazaro can now be found at [[Rizal Avenue]].

The Department of Public Instruction, one of the four executive departments of the government, was in charge of the Philippine Health Service.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=67 |edition=2nd }}</ref> The Department of Public Instruction was managed by [[Victor Heiser|Dr. Victor Heiser]], during whose term the [[Philippine General Hospital]] was put up.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=67 |edition=2nd }}</ref> The Filipinization of Health Services started when Dr. Vicente de Jesus, the first Filipino Assistant Director of the Department of Public Instruction, became Director in 1919.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=67 |edition=2nd }}</ref>\n\nSucceeding Harrison was [[Leonard Wood]].

Facilities and trained medical personnel were insufficient to care for the almost ten million Filipinos.

Most of the national burden of health care is taken up by private health providers.\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] defines health care as an overall maintenance and solution to the health needs of a person, family, or community. It is a system that addresses these health needs are fulfilled through prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.<ref>\"Primary Health Care.\" World Health Organization.

With different reasons such as low budget, low number of man power, or general neglect for the poor, the Philippines has always been unable to keep up with the high standards of healthcare abroad. Comparing data from 2014 between Philippines, United States of America, and Canada, Philippines only spent 4.7% of their GDP on health while USA and Canada spent 17.1% and 10.4%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/countries/phl/en/|title=Philippines|website=World Health Organization|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/countries/usa/en/|title=United States of America|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/countries/can/en/|title=Canada|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> Efforts are being performed to bridge the gap.

Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, life and by extension health care, was centered around the animate and inanimate world.\n\nTraditional Filipino medicinal herbs were used for a wide variety of ailments. Anonas leaves were applied to the stomach for indigestion. Betel-nuts leaves and areca nut leaves were common for injuries, chewed and then applied. Sambong was used to treat kidney stones, rheumatism, coughs, colds, hypertension, and diarrhea .<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=24 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \n[[File:Sambong (Blumea balsamifera).jpg|thumb|Sambong (Blumea balsamifera)]]\n\nSpanish historian Miguel de Loarca said the natives were \u201cgood physicians and had a remedy for every poison.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=25 |edition=2nd }}</ref> The seeds of the igasud were chewed as an antidode for poison.

To combat this, they created hospitals specially for their health. Some of the first health institutions in the country were handled by Spanish friars.\n\n==== Hospital Real ====\nBuilt in Cebu in 1565, Hospital Real was the first hospital in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=29 |edition=2nd }}</ref> It was relocated to the Manila to accompany the government. The hospital aimed to nurse the Spanish army and navy, those inflicted with disease, and military casualties. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi had permission from King Philip II to set up the hospital exclusively for Spanish soldiers and sailors, whereas it denied service to Spanish and mestizo women.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=29 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \nAlthough Hospital Real received funding from the Spanish Government, it lacked finances, manpower, and supplies. Administration of Hospital Real was transferred to both [[Franciscans|the Order of St. Francis]] and the Confraternity of La Misericordia.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=30 |edition=2nd }}</ref> Hospital Real was destroyed during [[List of earthquakes in the Philippines#19th century|an earthquake on June 3, 1863]].\n\n==== Hospital de Naturales ====\nFray Juan Clemente, a 54-year-old botanist and lay brother, was instrumental in conception of the Hospital de Naturales. He often made medicine for the many people who begged outside the convent, until eventually the number of patients grew too large for accommodations. Clemente raised funds in order to build better facilities. In 1578, two wards of nipa and bamboo were constructed by Clemente.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=31 |edition=2nd }}</ref>\nCalled the Hospital de los Indios Naturales, or Hospital de Naturales, the hospital flourished under Clemente. Friars tended to the sick, as well as their spiritual needs. The hospital also provided free medical supplies such as oils, herbs, and ointments. Hospital de Naturales was also able to provide medical supplies to other infirmaries and hospitals. Hospital De Naturales came under the patronage of King Philip II, earning it government subsidy. Protection was also guaranteed by the governor-general. \nClemente died after 20 years of working at Hospital de Naturales. A few years after, a fire destroyed the hospital once more (the first time in 1583). The reconstruction of the hospital led to the development of the Hospital de San Lazaro.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=34 |edition=2nd }}</ref>\n\n==== Hospital de San Lazaro ====\nAlthough previously the Hospital de Naturales, the hospital was renamed after Japanese emperor Iemitsu sent 150 lepers.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=44 |edition=2nd }}</ref> Although viewed as a hostile act to the church for its growing influence in Japan, the lepers were taken care of by the hospital, the clergy, and the community. As such, the Hospital de Naturales became known as the Hospital de San Lazaro, after [[Lazarus of Bethany|the patron saint of lepers]]. \nThe Hospital de San Lazaro was demolished twice. Initially when the city of Dilao was threatened by invasion from Chinese pirate Chen Ch\u2019e Kung, and finally after it was taken over and utilized by the British as a military vantage point.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Legacy of Public Health |isbn=978-971-784-003-1 |page=46 |edition=2nd }}</ref> San Lazaro can now be found at [[Rizal Avenue]].

The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}).

The university offers undergraduate and [[graduate degrees]], including [[Doctorate|doctoral]] and [[professional degree]]s and [[Online degree|online masters]] as well.\n\nThe university was founded in 1829 and is the tenth largest private university in the country in terms of full-time students. It is internationally known for its science, computer, engineering, and art programs, as well as for the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]], a leading deaf-education institution that provides educational opportunities to more than 1000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students. RIT is known for its Co-op program that gives students professional and industrial experience. It has the fourth oldest and one of the largest Co-op programs in the world.\n\nRIT student population is approximately 19,000 students, about 16,000 undergraduate and 3000 graduate. Demographically, students attend from all 50 states in the United States and from more than 100 countries around the world. The university has more than 4000 active faculty and staff members who engage with the students in a wide range of academic activities and research projects. It also has branches abroad, its global campuses, located in China, Croatia, United Arab Emirates ([[Dubai]]), and Kosovo.\n\nThirteen RIT alumni and faculty members have been recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rit.edu/about-rit#key-facts| title = Key facts about RIT|website=rit.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe university began as a result of an 1891 merger between '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um''', a [[literary society]] founded in 1829 by [[Nathaniel Rochester|Colonel Nathaniel Rochester]] and associates, and '''The Mechanics Institute''', a Rochester school of practical [[Vocational education|technical training]] for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including [[Henry Lomb|Captain Henry Lomb]], co-founder of [[Bausch & Lomb]]. The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}). Its art department was originally located in the [[Bevier Memorial Building]]. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the [[New York (state)|New York]] Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university's campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, an unanticipated donation of $3.27&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3270000|1961|r=0}}}} today) from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT's dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new {{convert|1300|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus several miles south along the east bank of the [[Genesee River]] in suburban [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]]. Upon completion in 1968, the university moved to the new suburban campus, where it resides today.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{Cite book|last=Gordon|first=Dane R.|title=Rochester Institute of Technology: Industrial Development and Educational Innovation in an American City, 1829\u20132006|year=2007|publisher=RIT Cary Graphic Arts Press|isbn=978-1-933360-23-2}}</ref><ref name=\"rit_timeline\">{{cite web | url=http://www2.rit.edu/175/timeline.html | title=RIT Timeline | author=Rochester Institute of Technology | accessdate=December 26, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226103733/http://www2.rit.edu/175/timeline.html | archive-date=February 26, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, RIT was selected by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] to be the site of the newly founded [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]] (NTID).<ref>{{Cite news | title=ROCHESTER TO GET U.S. DEAF COLLEGE | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 15, 1966 | page=22  }}</ref> NTID admitted its first students in 1968, concurrent with RIT's transition to the Henrietta campus.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Marschark | first = Marc | last2 = Lang | first2 = Harry G. | year = 2002 | title = Educating Deaf Students: From Research to Practice | location = [[New York City]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | page = 35 | isbn = 978-0-19-512139-1 | oclc = 45668968 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, RIT took over [[Eisenhower College]], a liberal arts college located in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]].

These symbols represent time to infinity.{{dubious|date=August 2015}} The Quarter Mile is actually {{convert|0.41|mi|km}} long when measured between the mobius sculpture and the sundial.
