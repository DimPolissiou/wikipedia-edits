Attendees of Pink Dot events gather to form a \"pink dot\" to show support for inclusiveness, diversity and the freedom to love.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Pink Dot SG|url=http://pinkdot.sg/about-pink-dot/|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref> In addition to the titular formation, Pink Dot events usually feature concert performances and booths sponsored by organizations supporting the LGBT community and cause.\n\nOther Pink Dot events followed in several other cities, so that the Singapore event became known as Pink Dot SG. It has been held each year in Singapore from 2009 to 2019 at [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] on a Saturday in May, June or July. The 2019 event was held on 29 June.\n\n==History==\nIn September 2008, the rules governing activities conducted at Singapore's [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] at [[Hong Lim Park]] were relaxed, allowing demonstrations organised by Singaporeans to be held at the park, providing that all participants are either citizens or permanent residents.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | title=Singapore Statutes Online - 493 - Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (No. 2) Order 2011 | publisher=Statutes.agc.gov.sg | accessdate=2 September 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072855/http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | archivedate=18 May 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all}}</ref> This allowed the first Pink Dot SG event to take place at the Speakers' Corner on 16 May 2009. A total of nine Pink Dot events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in May, June or July. Many organisations around the world modeled LGBT events after the Pink Dot concept, often borrowing the \"Pink Dot\" prefix. For distinction, the Singapore events became known as Pink Dot SG.\n\nThe design of the Pink Dot SG mascot \"Pinkie\", a personification of the pink dot, was provided by graphic designer Soh Ee Shaun.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pinkdot.sg Mascot|url=http://www.gardensilly.com/projects/2009/pinkdot.sg-mascot|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mulangallery.com.sg/src/pdf/Lookin%20In%20is%20the%20Only%20Way%20Out-catalogue.pdf | title=Looking in is the Only Way Out | accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\nEach event from 2009 to 2019 took place on a Saturday at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park.\n\n===Pink Dot SG 2009===\nPink Dot SG 2009 was held on 16 May, launched with a campaign video titled \"RED + WHITE = PINK\".

One response to the event was FamFest, or the Red Dot Family Movement, which was organised by LoveSingapore, a network of Singaporean churches. FamFest was initially planned to be held on the same day as Pink Dot 2014 at the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]. However, the event was cancelled after its application was rejected by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, which deemed the location unsuitable. FamFest continued as a virtual rally on Facebook.\n\nIn response to the appearance of a Muslim woman in the Pink Dot SG 2014 campaign video, Islamic religious teacher Ustaz Noor Deros called for a Wear White campaign in defence of traditional Islamic values. Notably, an evening prayer marking the fasting month coincided with the Pink Dot SG 2014 event. [[Faith Community Baptist Church]] (FCBC) and the LoveSingapore network of churches also called on their members to join local Muslims in the campaign to dress in white,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/06/christians-join-muslims-in-protest-against-pink-dot/|title=Christians join Muslims in protest against Pink Dot|author=Howard Lee|website=The Online Citizen|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> and worshipers at the mosque and the two churches were seen wearing white in the days following the event.\n\nIn light of possible unrest, security personnel were deployed at Pink Dot SG 2014 for crowd management purposes.<ref name=\"channelnewsasia.com\"/> However, the event proceeded without interference, with Wear White campaign organisers telling supporters to keep at a distance from the Pink Dot gathering and the FCBC announcing that its members did not intend to picket the event.<ref name=\"todayonline.com\"/>\n\nSince 2014, Pink Dot has continued to experience opposition from the Wear White campaign.\n\n===Other religious groups and Pink Dot 2014===\nLeading up to Pink Dot SG 2014, and in response to other reactions about the event, other religious groups in Singapore made statements about their stands on LGBT issues.\n\nOn behalf of the Muslim community, the [[Islamic Religious Council of Singapore]] (MUIS) advised Muslims not to be confrontational towards the LGBT community. The MUIS indicated that it does not approve of the \"pervasiveness\" of the LGBT lifestyle, but cautioned against mosques being involved in the Pink Dot or Wear White initiatives. Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs [[Yaacob Ibrahim]] issued a statement saying that Singaporeans who wanted to express support for a cause or lifestyle choice should express it in a way that does not divide the community. He emphasized tolerance and the need \"to keep the social fabric as tight as possible\".<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/church-must-work-with/1199056.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627040832/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/church-must-work-with/1199056.html|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) stated:  The Council also wishes to state that while it does not condone homosexual or bi-sexual practices, it also does not condemn those who are struggling with their gender identity and sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-council-of/1208378.html|title=National council of churches issues statement on Pink Dot controversy |accessdate=29 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628180817/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-council-of/1208378.html |archivedate=28 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn behalf of the Catholic Church, Archbishop [[William Goh]] stated:\n{{quote|This kind of lifestyle should not be promoted by Catholics as it is detrimental to society, is not helpful to integral human development and contrary to Christian values.

The involvement of corporations in the local LGBT scene drew criticism from various socially conservative groups.\n\nIn 2015 furniture retailer [[IKEA]], upon receiving feedback from pro-LGBT groups, announced a review of its support for a magic show staged by a pastor known for his views against homosexuality. The pastor was also responsible for previous anti-Pink Dot movements, while IKEA is known globally to be a supporter of the LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/04/magic-shows-ikea-and-the-corporatisation-of-lgbt-politics/|title=Magic shows, Ikea and the corporatisation of LGBT politics|author=Terry Xu|website=The Online Citizen|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/ikea-singapore-reviewing-support-pastors-magic-show-afte|title=Ikea Singapore reviewing support for pastor's magic show after backlash from gay rights groups|author=RACHEL AU-YONG|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> However, after the review, IKEA Singapore decided to continue support for the magic show.

Attendees of Pink Dot events gather to form a \"pink dot\" to show support for inclusiveness, diversity and the freedom to love.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Pink Dot SG|url=http://pinkdot.sg/about-pink-dot/|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref> In addition to the titular formation, Pink Dot events usually feature concert performances and booths sponsored by organizations supporting the LGBT community and cause.\n\nOther Pink Dot events followed in several other cities, so that the Singapore event became known as Pink Dot SG. It has been held each year in Singapore from 2009 to 2019 at [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] on a Saturday in May, June or July. The 2019 event was held on 29 June.\n\n==History==\nIn September 2008, the rules governing activities conducted at Singapore's [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] at [[Hong Lim Park]] were relaxed, allowing demonstrations organised by Singaporeans to be held at the park, providing that all participants are either citizens or permanent residents.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | title=Singapore Statutes Online - 493 - Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (No. 2) Order 2011 | publisher=Statutes.agc.gov.sg | accessdate=2 September 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072855/http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | archivedate=18 May 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all}}</ref> This allowed the first Pink Dot SG event to take place at the Speakers' Corner on 16 May 2009. A total of nine Pink Dot events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in May, June or July.

One response to the event was FamFest, or the Red Dot Family Movement, which was organised by LoveSingapore, a network of Singaporean churches. FamFest was initially planned to be held on the same day as Pink Dot 2014 at the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]. However, the event was cancelled after its application was rejected by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, which deemed the location unsuitable. FamFest continued as a virtual rally on Facebook.\n\nIn response to the appearance of a Muslim woman in the Pink Dot SG 2014 campaign video, Islamic religious teacher Ustaz Noor Deros called for a Wear White campaign in defence of traditional Islamic values. Notably, an evening prayer marking the fasting month coincided with the Pink Dot SG 2014 event. [[Faith Community Baptist Church]] (FCBC) and the LoveSingapore network of churches also called on their members to join local Muslims in the campaign to dress in white,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/06/christians-join-muslims-in-protest-against-pink-dot/|title=Christians join Muslims in protest against Pink Dot|author=Howard Lee|website=The Online Citizen|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> and worshipers at the mosque and the two churches were seen wearing white in the days following the event.\n\nIn light of possible unrest, security personnel were deployed at Pink Dot SG 2014 for crowd management purposes.<ref name=\"channelnewsasia.com\"/> However, the event proceeded without interference, with Wear White campaign organisers telling supporters to keep at a distance from the Pink Dot gathering and the FCBC announcing that its members did not intend to picket the event.<ref name=\"todayonline.com\"/>\n\nSince 2014, Pink Dot has continued to experience opposition from the Wear White campaign.\n\n===Other religious groups and Pink Dot 2014===\nLeading up to Pink Dot SG 2014, and in response to other reactions about the event, other religious groups in Singapore made statements about their stands on LGBT issues.\n\nOn behalf of the Muslim community, the [[Islamic Religious Council of Singapore]] (MUIS) advised Muslims not to be confrontational towards the LGBT community. The MUIS indicated that it does not approve of the \"pervasiveness\" of the LGBT lifestyle, but cautioned against mosques being involved in the Pink Dot or Wear White initiatives. Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs [[Yaacob Ibrahim]] issued a statement saying that Singaporeans who wanted to express support for a cause or lifestyle choice should express it in a way that does not divide the community.

The pastor was also responsible for previous anti-Pink Dot movements, while IKEA is known globally to be a supporter of the LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/04/magic-shows-ikea-and-the-corporatisation-of-lgbt-politics/|title=Magic shows, Ikea and the corporatisation of LGBT politics|author=Terry Xu|website=The Online Citizen|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/ikea-singapore-reviewing-support-pastors-magic-show-afte|title=Ikea Singapore reviewing support for pastor's magic show after backlash from gay rights groups|author=RACHEL AU-YONG|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> However, after the review, IKEA Singapore decided to continue support for the magic show.
