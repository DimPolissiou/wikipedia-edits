There is an option to play as three characters, all who were brutally murdered by the order of the king and want revenge on him.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe story follows a trio of knights: Romulus Blood ([[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]), a human knight and former head of the House of Blood who made a Faustian bargain with an unseen demon known as The Beast ([[Steve Blum]]), along with his younger brother Remus (Andrew Kashino) and Remus' wife and princess of Cavalier named Sylvia Gradis ([[Megan Hollingshead]]) while they are at the end of their lives after the entire House of Blood is slaughtered under the orders of the king Kirk Gladys (Also voiced by [[Steve Blum]]) and his charismatic, tyrannical wife Fatima (Wendy Braun). Over the course of the game, The Beast grants each of the three characters a second chance at life as necromancers with the ability to turn their still living enemies into undead soldiers.\n\nThe trio first go after Duke Gloucester, a former war hero who became a corrupt glutton and fight against him. Gollaster attempted to send a demon out to kill them in a desperate attempt, but he was soon killed by the knights. The trio soon discover that as a result of the bargain with the Beast, they have started to become more demonic as they go on their path of revenge.\n\nAs the story progresses, each one of the three knights goes after several individuals responsible for taking part in their deaths and soon discover a fruit known as the Fruit of the [[Holy Tree]], a demonic fruit that turns its user into a demon. Captain Gerrard, a leader of a trio of knights who praise Fatima as a saint, uses the Fruit of the Holy Tree after finding out his daughter was killed in a battle with the Undead Knights and becomes a giant demon known as the Nephilim. In his dying words, Gerard reveals that Fatima also controls a portion of undead servants of her own, having long since forsaken the land of Cavalier for her own selfish goals.\n\nLater, the undead knights encounter various genetically engineered soldiers called Ouroboros created by the mad, egocentric wizard Lord Follis ([[Liam O'Brien]]), who attempted to convince the knights to join them, only to be told off. A battle ensues in which Follis uses the Fruit of the Holy Tree to mutate into a demon known as Venom Angel and is killed by the knights.\n\nAfter the battle, Fatima's younger brother the Jester (Thomas Brownhead) reveals that Romulus was the one who was inadvertently responsible for the deaths of Sylvia and Remus. During the attack on the House of Blood, Romulus was one of the knights participating in the attack and was searching for the two of them in the midst of the chaos. When Kirk's knights captured them, Romulus summoned up all of his rage induced bloodlust and slaughtered everyone in his path, but accidentally killed Sylvia and Remus during his rampage. Having earned the forgiveness of Sylvia and Remus, the three knights go to finally confront The Jester, who reveals himself to be a product of Fatima's experiments with the occult. Another battle ensues and the knights succeed in killing the jester. They soon find a trio of knights whom they had killed earlier also revived into undead, defeating them in the process and ultimately kill Kirk Gradis, who had lost everything and became horrified by the uncontrollable powers Fatima had given him, but regretted ever betraying the House of Blood.\n\nIn the finale, the truth of Fatima's rise to power and the dark powers she gave to her subordinates is finally revealed: Fatima herself was once a human who made a pact with The Beast in a demonic realm called The Void (eventually learning to control the blood's power to the point where she retained her current human appearance and intellect) and that the demonic power The Beast gave them was not really magic as Lord Follis had said, but it was an infection created from the Beast's blood. Fatima also reveals that she created the Holy Tree from the Beast's blood in order to get rid of humanity's fear of death and creating her own ideal world where humans are immortal and will no longer bear the burden of life. When the knights oppose her goal of creating a world of undead demons, Fatima fuses herself with the tree and becomes a demon called Yggdrasil, only to be killed by the knights.\n\nIn her last breath, Fatima offers a crystallized stone made of demon blood to protect the knights from The Beast's influence, fearing that they will be hunted for what they have done in the name of vengeance. The trio soon realizes that The Beast had been using them as assassins right from the start while The Beast tells them that they are beyond redemption after all they have done. This leads them to destroy the crystal Fatima had given them in an act of defiance towards The Beast's wish of keeping them as slaves. Furious with their rebuke, The Beast warns the knights that they will die again and that they will go to hell after their deaths with the Beast saying he will \"keep a spot nice and warm for (them).\" In the game's epilogue, the trio admits that they will serve the punishment for their sins in vengeance as \"undead knights\".\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\n\nOn October 1, 2009, the ''Undead Knights'' demo was mistakenly replaced with the full game on the PlayStation Store, giving consumers an opportunity to download the full game for free.<ref>{{cite web| author=Polybren | date=October 1, 2009 | title=Free Undead Knights 'demo' contained full game | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6230802.html | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=January 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe reception was very mixed: the reviewers expressed extreme opinions with regards to the most controversial elements of the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/undead-knights/critic-reviews|title=Undead Knights|website=Metacritic|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref> Some of them scorned the inconsistencies with the decorum of the genre and condemned the mixture of the underground death/black metal soundtrack<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://darkzero.co.uk/game-reviews/undead-knights-psp/|title=Undead Knights (PSP).

Wall controlled Tampa from the neighborhood known as [[Ybor City, Tampa, Florida|Ybor City]], he employed Italians, Cubans and men of other ethnicities into his organization. Charlie Wall's only competition was Tampa's earliest Mafia boss Ignacio Antinori.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\">{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317|title= Deitche, Scott. \"The Mob\" April 26, 2001|author=|date=|website=creativeloafing.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Antinori gang===\nThe first Italian gang in the [[Tampa Bay]] area was created by [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925. Antinori, a [[Palermo, Sicily|Sicilian]]-born immigrant, became a well-known drug kingpin and the Italian crime boss of Tampa in the late 1920s. A smaller Italian gang in the area was controlled by [[Santo Trafficante Sr.]], who had lived in Tampa since the age of 18. Trafficante had already set up [[Bolita]] games throughout the city and was a very powerful man. Antinori took notice of Santo Trafficante and invited him into his organization and together they expanded the Bolita games across the state. By the 1930s Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as \"Era of Blood\". Wall's closest associate, [[Evaristo \"Tito\" Rubio]], was shot on his porch on March 8, 1938. The war ended in the 1940s with Ignacio Antinori being shot and killed with a sawn-off shotgun. Both Wall's and Antinori's organizations were weakened leaving Santo Trafficante as one of the last and most powerful bosses in Tampa.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/>\n\n===Trafficante Sr. era===\n[[Santo Trafficante Sr.]] had now taken over a majority of the city and started to teach his son Santo Trafficante Jr. how to run the city. In Trafficante Sr.'s adult life he only portrayed himself as a successful Tampa cigar factory owner.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Cigar\">Deitche, Scott. \"Cigar City Mafia: A Complete History of the Tampa Underworld\". New York: Barricade Books. 2004</ref> Santo was being watched closely by police and made Salvatore \"Red\" Italiano the acting boss. With the untimely [[Kefauver]] hearings and Charlie Wall testifying in 1950, both Trafficantes fled to [[Cuba]]. He always wanted to make it big in Cuban casinos and dispatched his son, Santo, Jr., to [[Havana]] in 1946 to help operate a mob owned [[casino]]. The Tampa mob made a lot of money in Cuba, but never achieved its ambition of making the island part of its own territory. After the hearings ended the Trafficantes returned to Tampa to find out that Italiano had just fled to Mexico leaving Jimmy Lumia the biggest mobster in the city. Santo had Lumia killed after finding out he was bad mouthing him while he was in Cuba and he took over again. In 1953 Santo Jr. survived a shooting. The family suspected it was Charlie Wall and they had him killed in 1955. Trafficante remained the boss of Tampa until he died of natural causes in 1954.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/><ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\">Deitche, Scott. \"The Silent Don: The Criminal Underworld of Santo Trafficante Jr\".

Wall controlled Tampa from the neighborhood known as [[Ybor City, Tampa, Florida|Ybor City]], he employed Italians, Cubans and men of other ethnicities into his organization. Charlie Wall's only competition was Tampa's earliest Mafia boss Ignacio Antinori.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\">{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317|title= Deitche, Scott. \"The Mob\" April 26, 2001|author=|date=|website=creativeloafing.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Antinori gang===\nThe first Italian gang in the [[Tampa Bay]] area was created by [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925. Antinori, a [[Palermo, Sicily|Sicilian]]-born immigrant, became a well-known drug kingpin and the Italian crime boss of Tampa in the late 1920s. A smaller Italian gang in the area was controlled by [[Santo Trafficante Sr.]], who had lived in Tampa since the age of 18. Trafficante had already set up [[Bolita]] games throughout the city and was a very powerful man. Antinori took notice of Santo Trafficante and invited him into his organization and together they expanded the Bolita games across the state. By the 1930s Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as \"Era of Blood\". Wall's closest associate, [[Evaristo \"Tito\" Rubio]], was shot on his porch on March 8, 1938. The war ended in the 1940s with Ignacio Antinori being shot and killed with a sawn-off shotgun. Both Wall's and Antinori's organizations were weakened leaving Santo Trafficante as one of the last and most powerful bosses in Tampa.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/>\n\n===Trafficante Sr. era===\n[[Santo Trafficante Sr.]] had now taken over a majority of the city and started to teach his son Santo Trafficante Jr. how to run the city. In Trafficante Sr.'s adult life he only portrayed himself as a successful Tampa cigar factory owner.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Cigar\">Deitche, Scott. \"Cigar City Mafia: A Complete History of the Tampa Underworld\". New York: Barricade Books. 2004</ref> Santo was being watched closely by police and made Salvatore \"Red\" Italiano the acting boss. With the untimely [[Kefauver]] hearings and Charlie Wall testifying in 1950, both Trafficantes fled to [[Cuba]]. He always wanted to make it big in Cuban casinos and dispatched his son, Santo, Jr., to [[Havana]] in 1946 to help operate a mob owned [[casino]]. The Tampa mob made a lot of money in Cuba, but never achieved its ambition of making the island part of its own territory. After the hearings ended the Trafficantes returned to Tampa to find out that Italiano had just fled to Mexico leaving Jimmy Lumia the biggest mobster in the city. Santo had Lumia killed after finding out he was bad mouthing him while he was in Cuba and he took over again. In 1953 Santo Jr. survived a shooting. The family suspected it was Charlie Wall and they had him killed in 1955. Trafficante remained the boss of Tampa until he died of natural causes in 1954.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/><ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\">Deitche, Scott. \"The Silent Don: The Criminal Underworld of Santo Trafficante Jr\".
