Shor's algorithms runs much (almost exponentially) faster than the best known classical algorithm for factoring, the [[general number field sieve]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Grover's algorithm runs quadratically faster than the best possible classical algorithm for the same task,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} a [[linear search]].\n\n==Overview==\nQuantum algorithms are usually described, in the commonly used circuit model of quantum computation, by a [[quantum circuit]] which acts on some input [[qubit]]s and terminates with a [[measurement]]. A quantum circuit consists of simple [[quantum gate]]s which act on at most a fixed number of qubits. The number of qubits has to be fixed because a changing number of qubits implies non-unitary evolution. Quantum algorithms may also be stated in other models of quantum computation, such as the [[Hamiltonian oracle model]].<ref name=Hamiltonian_NAND_Tree>{{cite arXiv\n | last = Farhi | first = E.\n | last2 = Goldstone |first2=J.\n | last3 = Gutmann |first3=S.\n | date = 2007\n | title = A Quantum Algorithm for the Hamiltonian NAND Tree\n | eprint = quant-ph/0702144\n}}</ref>\n\nQuantum algorithms can be categorized by the main techniques used by the algorithm. Some commonly used techniques/ideas in quantum algorithms include [[phase kick-back]], [[quantum phase estimation algorithm|phase estimation]], the [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum walk]]s, [[amplitude amplification]] and [[topological quantum field theory]]. Quantum algorithms may also be grouped by the type of problem solved, for instance see the survey on quantum algorithms for algebraic problems.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Childs|first=Andrew M.|author-link=Andrew Childs|last2=van Dam|first2=W.|year=2010|title=Quantum algorithms for algebraic problems|url=|journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]|volume=82|issue=1|pages=1\u201352|arxiv=0812.0380|bibcode=2010RvMP...82....1C|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.82.1}}</ref>\n\n==Algorithms based on the quantum Fourier transform==\nThe [[quantum Fourier transform]] is the quantum analogue of the [[discrete Fourier transform]], and is used in several quantum algorithms. The [[Hadamard transform]] is also an example of a quantum Fourier transform over an n-dimensional vector space over the field [[GF(2)|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>]].

If we allow both bounded-error quantum and classical algorithms, then there is no speedup since a classical probabilistic algorithm can solve the problem with a constant number of queries with small probability of error. The algorithm determines whether a function ''f'' is either constant (0 on all inputs or 1 on all inputs) or balanced (returns 1 for half of the input domain and 0 for the other half).\n\n===Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm===\n{{main|Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm}}\n\nThe Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm is the first quantum algorithm that is exponentially more efficient than classical algorithms.

The best known classical algorithm for estimating these sums takes exponential time.

The boy does not speak but appears to understand everything. Frances allows him to bathe and eat, then buys him new clothes the next day. That night the boy visits his parents and younger siblings then returns to his small apartment with his older sister Nina and explains what has happened to him.\n\nThe next day the boy returns bearing homemade cookies and unexpectedly encounters the maid, Mrs. Parnell. Frances invites him in and sends Mrs. Parnell away. Mrs. Parnell remarks that the cookies are burnt before leaving but Frances opens an expensive bottle of wine to accompany the cookies. She holds one-sided conversations and flirts with the boy, developing a strong attachment. The following day the boy allows his sister Nina to use Frances's bath while Frances is away having a [[Diaphragm (birth control)|contraceptive diaphragm]] fitted and dispensed at a local [[family planning]] clinic.\n\nWhen Charles, an older suitor from Frances's [[lawn bowls]] group, visits that night, Frances locks the door to the boy's room while she rebuffs the man's advances until he leaves. She then inserts the diaphragm and enters the boy's room and asks him to make love to her but is distraught to find that the bed is merely stuffed with dolls.\n\nThe boy sneaks back into his room at Frances's house and sleeps until the next day, when he finds that all of the doors and windows are nailed shut. He confronts Frances and she apologizes but insists that she wants things to remain as they are, leaving him locked in the house as she goes out to a bar. She notices a woman sitting alone and invites her to come spend the night with the boy but the woman becomes upset. A man overhears and helps Frances find a prostitute named Sylvia at a nearby diner. Frances brings Sylvia home and locks her in the room with the boy then listens through the door as they have intercourse. Overcome with emotion, Frances enters the room and stabs Sylvia through the heart, killing her. The boy desperately searches for an exit but Frances tells him that he can stay with her and that he does not have to be afraid.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandy Dennis]] - Frances Austen\n* [[Michael Burns (actor)|Michael Burns]] - The Boy\n* [[Susanne Benton]] - Nina\n* [[David Garfield]] - Nick (billed as John Garfield, Jr.)\n* [[Luana Anders]] - Sylvia\n* [[Edward Greenhalgh]] - Dr. Stevenson\n* [[Lloyd Berry]] - Mr. Parnell \n* [[Rae Brown]] - Mrs. Parnell \n* [[Linda Sorenson]] - Prostitute\n* [[Doris Buckingham]] - Mrs. Ebury\n* Frank Wade - Mr. Ebury\n* [[Alicia Ammon]] - Mrs. Pitt\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] - The Rounder\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1969]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0065086|title=That Cold Day in the Park}}\n* [https://archive.is/20130129025343/http://moviemorlocks.com/2006/11/25/the-robert-altman-that-got-away.html The Robert Altman Film That Got Away (TCM Movie Morlocks)]\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214110954/http://www.cinematheque.bc.ca/sept_oct_06/turner.html |date=February 14, 2007 |title=Robert Altman's Vancouver }} (essay by Michael Turner)\n* [http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2013-03-16/cold-day-park-1969 UCLA Film & Television Archive] (note by Shannon Kelley)\n* {{YouTube|p-g1exJB9IU|Interview with Robert Altman and Sandy Dennis about the filming of ''That Cold Day in the Park''}}\n\n{{Robert Altman}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:That Cold Day In The Park}}\n[[Category:1969 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Johnny Mandel]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Altman]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Films set in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n\n\n{{indie-drama-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = That Cold Day in the Park\n| image          = Poster of the movie That Cold Day in the Park.jpg\n| image_size     =\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Robert Altman]]\n| producer       = Donald Factor<br />Leon Mirell\n| writer         = [[Peter Miles (child actor)|Peter Miles]] (novel)<br />[[Gillian Freeman]]\n| narrator       =\n| starring       = [[Sandy Dennis]]\n| music          = [[Johnny Mandel]]\n| cinematography = [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (cinematographer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs]]\n| editing        = [[Danford B.

This CSA plus two additional counties are known as the Iowa City-Cedar Rapids (ICR) Corridor and collectively have a population of over 450,000.\n\nA flourishing center for arts and culture in Eastern Iowa, the city is home to the [[Cedar Rapids Museum of Art]], the [[National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library]], the [[Paramount Theatre (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)|Paramount Theatre]], [[Orchestra Iowa]], [[Theatre Cedar Rapids]], the [[African American Museum of Iowa]], and the [[Iowa Cultural Corridor Alliance]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, several Cedar Rapidians became well-known actors, including [[Bobby Driscoll]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Elijah Wood]], and [[Ron Livingston]]. The city is the setting for the musical ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Cedar Rapids (film)|Cedar Rapids]]''.\n\nCedar Rapids is nicknamed the \"City of Five Seasons\", for the so-called \"fifth season,\" which is time to enjoy the other four.<ref name=motto>{{cite web|title=What is the \"City of Five Seasons\"?|url=http://www.cedar-rapids.org/local_government/about_city_government/city_of_five_seasons.php|accessdate=May 23, 2018|publisher=City of Cedar Rapids}}</ref> The symbol of the five seasons is the Tree of Five Seasons sculpture in downtown along the north river bank.

Shepherd was a squatter who claimed the land without legal title and also a reputed ne\u2019er-do-well, who, if he was not a horse thief himself, definitely consorted with them.  Early on, it appears that he \u201cjumped the claim\u201d of another squatter, Wilbert Stone, who had built a cabin and platted out a town, some distance south of Shepherd's cabin, that he called Columbus.  Shepherd drove Stone across the river, claiming that Stone had built his cabin on Shepherd's land, then sold Stone's cabin to a buyer named Hull.  Shepherd later tried the same tactic with perhaps the first settler on the west side of the river, Robert Ellis, but Ellis happened to be chopping wood at the time and warned that someone would be dead if Shepherd did not retreat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Linn County Iowa, From its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time|last=Brewer|first=Luther|publisher=Forgotten Books|year=2012 |edition=Reprint of 1911 |isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=307, et seq}}</ref>\n\nThe true founders of the city were [[George Greene (law)|George Greene]], Nicholas Brown, and a few others.  Brown had experience as a miller and Greene had surveyed much of eastern Iowa,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Story of Cedar Rapids|last=Murray|first=Janet Stevenson and Frederick Gray|publisher=Stratford House|year=1950|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3}}</ref> so both saw the value of the spot Shepherd had claimed.  It was right next to the rapids\u2014a prime spot to build a mill\u2014the last set of rapids on the river before the Cedar fed into the Iowa River, meaning that goods milled on the spot could be carried by boat down river to the Mississippi.  In 1841, they formed a partnership that bought out Shepherd's claim and platted out a town they called Rapids City.  Brown immediately constructed a primitive dam and then built the town's first mill.  His crude dam soon washed away, prompting Greene to induce Alexander Ely, an engineer from Michigan, to build a proper dam that would create a millrace capable of powering several mills.<ref>Murray, p.3</ref>\n\nAt this time, the city was confined to the east side of the river.\u00a0 The west bank soon contained a village named Kingston for resident David King who early on operated a rope ferry across the river.\n\nThe town was formally incorporated by the Iowa State Legislature on January 15, 1849<ref>Tom Savage (2007). \"a dictionary of Iowa place-names.\"</ref> as Cedar Rapids, named for the [[rapid]]s in the Cedar River (the river itself was named for the large number of [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]] trees that grew along its banks).<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|year=1908|page=54}}</ref>  The population was less than 400.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Czech Village and New Bohemia|last=Rasdal|first=Dave|publisher=The History Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-46711-761-6|location=Charleston, SC|pages=19}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1850s Cedar Rapids grew in size, and it was during this decade that the Czech population became substantial; when the town was reincorporated in 1856, a quarter of its roughly 1600 inhabitants were Czech immigrants.<ref>Rasdal, p. 20</ref>    The availability of cheap land in the new state of Iowa happened to coincide with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]] that caused a large number of Czechs to flee their homeland and emigrate to the U.S.  In 1851 was founded the institution that would eventually become [[Coe College]].  The decade also witnessed attempts by local leaders to improve the city's access to distant markets, first through purchase of a steamboat (aptly named ''Cedar Rapids'') and ultimately through investment in a railroad.

When that scheme proved impractical due to the island's tendency to flood, he conceived the idea of making his island the center of a larger city that spanned the river and convinced the state legislature to officially name the land he had bought there, just south of Kingston, \"West Cedar Rapids.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/portraitbiograph00chap_10|title=Portrait and Biographical Album of Linn County, Iowa|last=|first=|publisher=Chapman Brothers|year=1887|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/portraitbiograph00chap_10/page/761 761]}}</ref>\n\nCedar Rapids [[annexation|annexed]] the community of Kingston in 1870 and constructed an iron bridge across the river along the line of the current Third Avenue bridge.\n\nThe economic growth of Cedar Rapids increased in 1871 upon the founding of the Sinclair [[meatpacking]] company.  The plant allowed for year-round meatpacking because ice could be harvested from the Cedar River in winter to chill an icehouse, and within a few years it became one of the largest factories of its kind in the country, employing 400 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brucemore.org/history/people/sinclair/|title=The Sinclair Family|last=|first=|date=|website=Brucemore.org|access-date=}}</ref>  In 1873 was built the oatmeal mill that would ultimately become the flagship operation of the [[Quaker Oats Company]], and the largest cereal mill in the world.\n\nIn 1909 the city acquired May's Island for the purpose of making it the seat of government; then, as now, there were ill feelings between east- and west-siders in Cedar Rapids, and the city's leaders hoped that putting City Hall in the \"neutral territory\" of the island would help ease tensions.  In 1919, the residents of Linn County voted to move the county seat from [[Marion, Iowa|Marion]] to Cedar Rapids, partially because Cedar Rapids had offered to donate the southern third of the island as a site for a new county courthouse and jail.\n\nIn 2010, the Census Bureau reported Cedar Rapids' population as 87.98% white, and 5.58% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iowa \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|access-date=April 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|archive-date=August 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Flood of 2008===\n[[File:Dairy Queen, Cedar Rapids, June 12 2008.jpg|thumb|right|260px|<center>Flooded Business District June 12, 2008</center>]]\nDuring the [[Iowa flood of 2008]], the Cedar River reached a record high of {{convert|31.12|ft|m}} on June 13 (the previous record was {{convert|20|ft|m}}), surpassing the 500-year [[flood plain]]. 1,126 [[city block]]s were flooded, or more than {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}, and 561 city blocks were severely damaged, on both banks of the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]], comprising 14% of the city's total area.

It is estimated that at least 1,300 properties had to be demolished in the Cedar Rapids area because of the flood, which caused several billions of dollars in damages.

[[Mays Island]], in the middle of the river, is the only area of the city where addresses have no quadrant. Areas outside the city limits that have a Cedar Rapids mailing address do not use the quadrants either.\n\nExcept in the downtown area, 1st Avenue and the Cedar River tend to run diagonally instead of along the cardinal directions. Due to the curving of 1st Avenue, there are some areas in western Cedar Rapids where NW addresses are actually south of SW addresses.\n\nCedar Rapids is divided into 14 [[ZIP Code]]s. Mays Island and the downtown area are covered by 52401. The northeast quadrant is covered by 52402 and 52411. The southeast quadrant is covered by 52403. The southwest quadrant is covered by 52404. The northwest quadrant is covered by 52405. [[Post office box]]es are covered by ZIP codes 52406, 52407, 52408, 52409, and 52410. Several other ZIP codes are for specific businesses ([[Transamerica Corporation|Aegon]] USA, [[Collins Aerospace]], etc.).\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|72.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|70.8|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Czech Village in Cedar Rapids.jpg|thumb|right|Czech Village is at the heart of the city's Czech heritage.

The neighborhoods nearest downtown include Wellington Heights and Oakhill Jackson in the southeast quadrant and Moundview in the northeast quadrant. Also farther north in the northeast quadrant are Noelridge Park and Kenwood Park, which was independent until it was incorporated into the Cedar Rapids city limits. The boundaries of Kenwood are 32nd Street to Oakland Road to Old Marion Road to C Avenue to 40th Street then 1st Avenue between 40th street and 32nd Street.<ref name=\"crneighborhoods\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crneighborhoods.org/|title=CR Neighborhoods|publisher= Home|accessdate=December 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids, there are many informal, unofficial neighborhoods, such as Bowman Woods, Vernon Heights, Stoney Point, [[New Bohemia (NewBo)]] and Wilderness Estates.\n\n[[Czech Village]] is located along 16th Avenue SW, south of the Cedar River. It is home to such Czech-themed businesses as The Czech Cottage, Sykora Bakery, and White Lion Treasures. The [[National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library]] is one of Cedar Rapids' major tourist attractions. The museum's main building was directly on the river and was badly damaged by the 2008 floods. After the flood the museum moved a few blocks to Inspiration Place SW. The Bohemian National Cemetery is located nearby.\n\nThe Cedar Rapids Czech Heritage Foundation is one of many local organizations working to promote and preserve Czech heritage in Cedar Rapids. It supports and sponsors many programs and events throughout the year, including the Miss Czech-Slovak Iowa pageant. Two Miss Czech-Slovak US queens can claim this community as home: Lisa Volesky and Stasia Krivanek.\n\nOlga Drahozal was the famed band leader of the Czech Plus Polka Band, a performing group that frequents the Kosek Band Stand in Czech Village. She, Bessie Duggena, and Leona Podu\u0161ka taught Czech School (''\u010cesk\u00e1 \u0161kola'') at Wilson Middle School.\n\nIn 2003, the African-American Historical Museum and Cultural Center of Iowa opened its doors. Cedar Rapids is also home to the historic 26-acre (105,000 m\u00b2) [[Brucemore|Brucemore Estate]], on which sits a 21-room mansion, and the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Library and Museum.\n\nIn 2009, Cedar Rapids was rated one of the \"Top 10 cities to Grow Up In\" in the United States, partly due to a low crime rate and a good public school system.<ref>[http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/americas-10-best-places-to-grow-up.html Yahoo!

It was one of the few larger American cities remaining to operate under this model. Under this form of government, the council was made up of a public safety commissioner, a streets commissioner, a finance commissioner, a parks commissioner, and a mayor. The council members worked on a full-time basis, served two-year terms, and were considered department heads. [[Don Canney]], the longest-serving mayor in city history, served for twenty-two years under this system.<ref name=gazette>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Smith|title=Corbett is forming committee to name memorial for Don Canney |url=http://thegazette.com/2011/03/24/corbett-is-forming-committee-to-name-memorial-for-don-canney/|work=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]] |publisher= |date=March 24, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref> The last mayor of Cedar Rapids under this form of government was [[Paul Pate]].\n\nIn 2005 the Cedar Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce spearheaded a movement to change from the commission form of government. A panel was appointed by Mayor Pate and the City Council to study the issue, and recommended that voters be presented with three options:\n* Stay with the current commission form of government.\n* Adopt a \"strong mayor form\" where the council would be part-time, the mayor would be full-time, and a city manager would run the day-to-day affairs of the city.\n* Adopt a \"weak mayor form\" of government, in this form the mayor and council would both work on a part-time basis. A full-time city manager would run the day-to-day operations of the city.\nOn June 14, 2005, voters went to the polls to decide whether to adopt a new form of government or continue with the commission form. 28,818 of the 83,514 registered voters (29.72%) cast ballots on the issue.  68.80% of the voters decided to adopt a new form of government.<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web|url=http://www.linncounty.org/files/download.asp?type=Adobe&mode=view&I=1265|title=Election Results|access-date=January 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034208/http://www.linncounty.org/files/download.asp?type=Adobe&mode=view&I=1265|archive-date=July 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Elections were held on November 8, 2005 and 30 candidates ran.

Shepherd was a squatter who claimed the land without legal title and also a reputed ne\u2019er-do-well, who, if he was not a horse thief himself, definitely consorted with them.  Early on, it appears that he \u201cjumped the claim\u201d of another squatter, Wilbert Stone, who had built a cabin and platted out a town, some distance south of Shepherd's cabin, that he called Columbus.  Shepherd drove Stone across the river, claiming that Stone had built his cabin on Shepherd's land, then sold Stone's cabin to a buyer named Hull.  Shepherd later tried the same tactic with perhaps the first settler on the west side of the river, Robert Ellis, but Ellis happened to be chopping wood at the time and warned that someone would be dead if Shepherd did not retreat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Linn County Iowa, From its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time|last=Brewer|first=Luther|publisher=Forgotten Books|year=2012 |edition=Reprint of 1911 |isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=307, et seq}}</ref>\n\nThe true founders of the city were [[George Greene (law)|George Greene]], Nicholas Brown, and a few others.  Brown had experience as a miller and Greene had surveyed much of eastern Iowa,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Story of Cedar Rapids|last=Murray|first=Janet Stevenson and Frederick Gray|publisher=Stratford House|year=1950|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3}}</ref> so both saw the value of the spot Shepherd had claimed.  It was right next to the rapids\u2014a prime spot to build a mill\u2014the last set of rapids on the river before the Cedar fed into the Iowa River, meaning that goods milled on the spot could be carried by boat down river to the Mississippi.  In 1841, they formed a partnership that bought out Shepherd's claim and platted out a town they called Rapids City.  Brown immediately constructed a primitive dam and then built the town's first mill.  His crude dam soon washed away, prompting Greene to induce Alexander Ely, an engineer from Michigan, to build a proper dam that would create a millrace capable of powering several mills.<ref>Murray, p.3</ref>\n\nAt this time, the city was confined to the east side of the river.\u00a0 The west bank soon contained a village named Kingston for resident David King who early on operated a rope ferry across the river.\n\nThe town was formally incorporated by the Iowa State Legislature on January 15, 1849<ref>Tom Savage (2007). \"a dictionary of Iowa place-names.\"</ref> as Cedar Rapids, named for the [[rapid]]s in the Cedar River (the river itself was named for the large number of [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]] trees that grew along its banks).<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|year=1908|page=54}}</ref>  The population was less than 400.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Czech Village and New Bohemia|last=Rasdal|first=Dave|publisher=The History Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-46711-761-6|location=Charleston, SC|pages=19}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1850s Cedar Rapids grew in size, and it was during this decade that the Czech population became substantial; when the town was reincorporated in 1856, a quarter of its roughly 1600 inhabitants were Czech immigrants.<ref>Rasdal, p. 20</ref>    The availability of cheap land in the new state of Iowa happened to coincide with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]] that caused a large number of Czechs to flee their homeland and emigrate to the U.S.  In 1851 was founded the institution that would eventually become [[Coe College]].  The decade also witnessed attempts by local leaders to improve the city's access to distant markets, first through purchase of a steamboat (aptly named ''Cedar Rapids'') and ultimately through investment in a railroad.  The first locomotive rolled into town on June 15, 1859.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tales of the Town: Little Known Anecdotes of Life in Cedar Rapids|last=Clements|first=Ralph|publisher=Stamats Publishing Company|year=1967|isbn=|location=Cedar Rapids, IA|pages=23}}</ref>\n\nRailroads were an important factor in the development of the state and the growth of cities along the rail lines.

The plant allowed for year-round meatpacking because ice could be harvested from the Cedar River in winter to chill an icehouse, and within a few years it became one of the largest factories of its kind in the country, employing 400 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brucemore.org/history/people/sinclair/|title=The Sinclair Family|last=|first=|date=|website=Brucemore.org|access-date=}}</ref>  In 1873 was built the oatmeal mill that would ultimately become the flagship operation of the [[Quaker Oats Company]], and the largest cereal mill in the world.\n\nIn 1909 the city acquired May's Island for the purpose of making it the seat of government; then, as now, there were ill feelings between east- and west-siders in Cedar Rapids, and the city's leaders hoped that putting City Hall in the \"neutral territory\" of the island would help ease tensions.  In 1919, the residents of Linn County voted to move the county seat from [[Marion, Iowa|Marion]] to Cedar Rapids, partially because Cedar Rapids had offered to donate the southern third of the island as a site for a new county courthouse and jail.\n\nIn 2010, the Census Bureau reported Cedar Rapids' population as 87.98% white, and 5.58% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iowa \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|access-date=April 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|archive-date=August 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Flood of 2008===\n[[File:Dairy Queen, Cedar Rapids, June 12 2008.jpg|thumb|right|260px|<center>Flooded Business District June 12, 2008</center>]]\nDuring the [[Iowa flood of 2008]], the Cedar River reached a record high of {{convert|31.12|ft|m}} on June 13 (the previous record was {{convert|20|ft|m}}), surpassing the 500-year [[flood plain]]. 1,126 [[city block]]s were flooded, or more than {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}, and 561 city blocks were severely damaged, on both banks of the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]], comprising 14% of the city's total area.

[[Mays Island]], in the middle of the river, is the only area of the city where addresses have no quadrant. Areas outside the city limits that have a Cedar Rapids mailing address do not use the quadrants either.\n\nExcept in the downtown area, 1st Avenue and the Cedar River tend to run diagonally instead of along the cardinal directions. Due to the curving of 1st Avenue, there are some areas in western Cedar Rapids where NW addresses are actually south of SW addresses.\n\nCedar Rapids is divided into 14 [[ZIP Code]]s. Mays Island and the downtown area are covered by 52401. The northeast quadrant is covered by 52402 and 52411. The southeast quadrant is covered by 52403. The southwest quadrant is covered by 52404. The northwest quadrant is covered by 52405. [[Post office box]]es are covered by ZIP codes 52406, 52407, 52408, 52409, and 52410. Several other ZIP codes are for specific businesses ([[Transamerica Corporation|Aegon]] USA, [[Collins Aerospace]], etc.).\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|72.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|70.8|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Czech Village in Cedar Rapids.jpg|thumb|right|Czech Village is at the heart of the city's Czech heritage. Pictured is Sykora Bakery which is now open to the public.]]\nThere are twelve active neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids. The neighborhoods nearest downtown include Wellington Heights and Oakhill Jackson in the southeast quadrant and Moundview in the northeast quadrant. Also farther north in the northeast quadrant are Noelridge Park and Kenwood Park, which was independent until it was incorporated into the Cedar Rapids city limits. The boundaries of Kenwood are 32nd Street to Oakland Road to Old Marion Road to C Avenue to 40th Street then 1st Avenue between 40th street and 32nd Street.<ref name=\"crneighborhoods\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crneighborhoods.org/|title=CR Neighborhoods|publisher= Home|accessdate=December 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids, there are many informal, unofficial neighborhoods, such as Bowman Woods, Vernon Heights, Stoney Point, [[New Bohemia (NewBo)]] and Wilderness Estates.\n\n[[Czech Village]] is located along 16th Avenue SW, south of the Cedar River. It is home to such Czech-themed businesses as The Czech Cottage, Sykora Bakery, and White Lion Treasures. The [[National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library]] is one of Cedar Rapids' major tourist attractions. The museum's main building was directly on the river and was badly damaged by the 2008 floods. After the flood the museum moved a few blocks to Inspiration Place SW. The Bohemian National Cemetery is located nearby.\n\nThe Cedar Rapids Czech Heritage Foundation is one of many local organizations working to promote and preserve Czech heritage in Cedar Rapids. It supports and sponsors many programs and events throughout the year, including the Miss Czech-Slovak Iowa pageant. Two Miss Czech-Slovak US queens can claim this community as home: Lisa Volesky and Stasia Krivanek.\n\nOlga Drahozal was the famed band leader of the Czech Plus Polka Band, a performing group that frequents the Kosek Band Stand in Czech Village. She, Bessie Duggena, and Leona Podu\u0161ka taught Czech School (''\u010cesk\u00e1 \u0161kola'') at Wilson Middle School.\n\nIn 2003, the African-American Historical Museum and Cultural Center of Iowa opened its doors. Cedar Rapids is also home to the historic 26-acre (105,000 m\u00b2) [[Brucemore|Brucemore Estate]], on which sits a 21-room mansion, and the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Library and Museum.\n\nIn 2009, Cedar Rapids was rated one of the \"Top 10 cities to Grow Up In\" in the United States, partly due to a low crime rate and a good public school system.<ref>[http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/americas-10-best-places-to-grow-up.html Yahoo!

A full-time city manager would run the day-to-day operations of the city.\nOn June 14, 2005, voters went to the polls to decide whether to adopt a new form of government or continue with the commission form. 28,818 of the 83,514 registered voters (29.72%) cast ballots on the issue.  68.80% of the voters decided to adopt a new form of government.<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web|url=http://www.linncounty.org/files/download.asp?type=Adobe&mode=view&I=1265|title=Election Results|access-date=January 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034208/http://www.linncounty.org/files/download.asp?type=Adobe&mode=view&I=1265|archive-date=July 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Elections were held on November 8, 2005 and 30 candidates ran.

However, despite having been sought since the 1930s, the exact nature of florigen is still disputed.\n\n==Mechanism ==\n\nCentral to the hunt for florigen is an understanding of how plants use seasonal changes in day length to mediate flowering\u2014a mechanism known as [[photoperiodism]].

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group=\"nb\"}} was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. The daughter of [[King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival [[Lothair of Supplinburg]].\n\nMeanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda's father and England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from Anglo-Norman barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nIn 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] and her uncle [[King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress' attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled \"Lady of the English\". ({{Lang-la|[[dominus (title)|domina]] Anglorum}}.) Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and was forced to escape across the frozen [[River Isis]] at night to avoid capture. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.\n\nMatilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154, forming the [[Angevin Empire]]. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on her son's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.\n\n==Childhood==\nMatilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]], in Berkshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>{{refn|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age.

She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group=\"nb\"}} was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. The daughter of [[King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival [[Lothair of Supplinburg]].\n\nMeanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda's father and England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from Anglo-Norman barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nIn 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] and her uncle [[King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress' attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled \"Lady of the English\". ({{Lang-la|[[dominus (title)|domina]] Anglorum}}.) Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and was forced to escape across the frozen [[River Isis]] at night to avoid capture. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.\n\nMatilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154, forming the [[Angevin Empire]]. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on her son's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.\n\n==Childhood==\nMatilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]], in Berkshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>{{refn|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age. Older histories suggested that Matilda of Scotland gave birth to a child in the city of Winchester in July 1101. These were based on the writings of the chronicler [[Wace]]; current scholarship, based on the records of the Queen's travels, considers this account to have been impossible, and places Matilda of Scotland at Sutton Courtenay in early February 1102, where the Empress Matilda was probably born.<ref name=\"Chibnall 1991 9\">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=9}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} Henry was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]], who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales.

The historian [[Marjorie Chibnall]] has argued against the theory of the siblings being twins, citing various reasons, including [[William of Malmesbury]] stating they were born on different dates, and the timing of congratulatory messages from the Pope.

The franchise also includes film and print adaptations.\n\nThe main games in the series follow the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the Mishima [[Zaibatsu]], where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company; the conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot, while players explore other characters' motivations in aiming to control the Zaibatsu.\n\nGameplay focuses on hand-to-hand combat with an opponent, with the gameplay system including blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas. ''Tekken'' is noted as being one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation.\n\nJapanese video game developer [[Namco]] began the series in 1994, with the release of the [[Tekken (video game)|self-titled]] first entry. As of 2017, it has nine additional entries, eight spin-off games, and has been adapted into three feature films and other media. ''[[Tekken 2]]'', as well as the third game ''[[Tekken 3]]'', are considered landmark titles; they received critical acclaim for their gameplay and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles have followed this concept, and received generally positive critical responses.\n\nThe series has been universally acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped more than 49 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, and the second best-selling fighting game franchise in history.<ref name=\"sales\">{{Cite tweet |number=1230696020280897537 |user=Harada_TEKKEN |title=TEKKEN7 had achieved Over 5 million sales (Achieved in December 2019)!

Traditional fighting games are usually played with buttons which correspond to the strength of the attack, such as strong punch or weak kick. ''Tekken'', however, dedicates a button to each of the four limbs of the fighter.<ref>{{cite web | title=Tekken A Look Back| url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=5787&pg=1&comments=|date=July 25, 2006|publisher=Gaming Target|author=Swider, Matt| accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> The gameplay system includes blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting.<ref>{{cite web| title=Combat Features of Tekken| url=https://www.playne.com/games/tekken/feature/combat| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224031323/https://www.playne.com/games/tekken/feature/combat| url-status=dead| archive-date=December 24, 2016| date=February 2, 2014| publisher=Playne| accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the original ''Tekken'', players could only block attacks manually. From then on, starting with ''Tekken 2'', characters automatically block while not moving forward or performing actions, a feature called \"neutral guard.\" Standing or retreating characters will block high and middle attacks with no input from the player, while crouching characters will duck high attacks and block low ones. Normal middle attacks will hit crouching players, but some special mid-attacks can be blocked by both stand and crouching neutral guards. Meanwhile, pressing backwards will give the player an \"active guard\" that can withstand certain combo attacks that would normally penetrate the neutral guard. Some characters are equipped with parries and reversals that act like traditional \"press button to block\" systems.\n\n''Tekken 3'' introduced several gameplay possibilities that were retained in later games, including the ability to sidestep into the foreground or background.<ref name=\"ignfeature\">{{cite web | title=The Evolution of Tekken| url=http://games.ign.com/articles/102/1026583p1.html|date=September 18, 2009|publisher=IGN|author=Clements, Ryan| accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> ''Tekken 3'' and later games also reduced recovery time after being knocked down and gave characters rolls to recover instantly after hitting the ground, allowing the player to get back into the fight more quickly at the risk of being hit while rolling. ''Tekken 4'' gave characters even greater mobility by adding true [[3D computer graphics|3D]] movement inside geometrically complex arenas with uneven ground, obstacles, and walls. The 3D gameplay allows damaging side and back throws as a reward for outmaneuvering the opponent, as well as evasive attacks that develop directly from a sidestep.\n\n''Tekken 5'' saw a combination of walled and infinite arenas, while discarding uneven ground. ''Tekken 6'' retains much of the design from ''Tekken 5'' but also includes a \"Rage\" mode, which activates when a character is near the end of his vitality bar and earns a damage multiplier. \"Bound\" hits were also added, in which a player connected with an airborne opponent will place him in an inescapable grounded state, allowing combo extensions. ''Tekken 6'' also has destructible floors and walls that allow the fighters to blast through to new fighting areas when broken. ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' retains these elements while also adding a new kind of stage break (\"balcony breaks\", which is a combination of floor and wall breaks where characters will go through a breakable wall and fall to a lower level in the same sequence). ''Tag 2'' specific features include Tag Assaults (cooperative combos triggered by hitting a Bound and a tag at the same time) and Tag Crashes (an emergency tag occurring when downed and the partner is currently in Rage).\n\n''Tekken 7'' introduces some movement changes to the ''Tekken'' formula. The back walk animation is now similar to ''Tekken Revolution'', featuring a more fluid movement away from the opponent as opposed to a slower shuffle. Regular back rolling from a grounded state has been removed and instead replaced with a new rising animation and performing a \"ankle kick\" (kicking the standing opponent while laying face up on the ground) is now accompanied by a new back roll to help create separation. Balcony breaks from ''Tag Tournament 2'' are present and function similarly to how they did in solo play. New features include \"Power Crushes\" (an attack that cannot be interrupted by regular attacks once the animation has begun) and \"Rage Arts\" (attacks that can only be used when your character has hit a Raged state near the end of their vitality meter, sacrificing the Rage mode to perform the attack). Bound has been mostly removed save for specific situations (certain moves can cause a Bound if not comboed into and all low parries will cause a Bound effect, similar to ''Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion''; floor breaks now result in an effect similar to a Tag Assault in ''Tag 2'' rather than a standard Bound) and instead characters now have more frequent access to an \"Aerial Tailspin\" effect (an attack that throws an opponent backwards onto their head as opposed to straight downwards, although it is still inescapable once triggered which means the combo can continue).\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Mishimafamily.png|thumb|right|The conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot.<ref name=\"mishima\"/> As seen from left to right: Jinpachi Mishima, Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama.]]\n{{main|List of Tekken characters}}\nPlayers can choose from a diverse cast that hails from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and fighting styles.

[[Kazuya Mishima]] was the protagonist in the original game, his father [[Heihachi Mishima]] was the protagonist of ''Tekken 2'' and ''Tekken 7'', and [[Jin Kazama]] has been the protagonist since his debut in ''Tekken 3'' until ''Tekken 6''.

For example, Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima, by virtues of familial connection and studying under the same Advanced Mishima Style Fighting Karate discipline, have very similar moves and a signature \"crouch dash\" stance for pretty much their entire appearances in the series. [[Jin Kazama]], when he debuted, also had the same Mishima fighting style, though he mixed this with Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts as practiced by his mother, [[Jun Kazama]]. For storyline reasons, starting on ''Tekken 4'', he forwent this in favor of Traditional Karate, a completely different discipline that technically made him an entirely different character, while his old movelist was given to his demonic form, Devil Jin. Meanwhile, there are some characters who were formerly clones of each other before they diverged and gained unique moves, such as Lee Chaolan (a clone of Marshall Law), Anna Williams (a clone of her sister, Nina), and Armor King (a clone of King).<ref>{{cite book | title=Trigger happy: videogames and the entertainment revolution |author=Poole, Steven| page=151|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=1-55970-598-1| year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Tekken 4 \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 History| url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/25904/tekken-4-page-2-history/|date=August 29, 2002|publisher=GamePro|author=Drifter, Tokyo| accessdate=August 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905045545/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/25904/tekken-4-page-2-history/| url-status=live|archivedate=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Still further, there are also characters who are replacements or \"successors\" of older characters; this happened principally in ''Tekken 3'' due to the significant time skip, though some older characters later returned alongside their successors anyway.

The franchise also includes film and print adaptations.\n\nThe main games in the series follow the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the Mishima [[Zaibatsu]], where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company; the conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot, while players explore other characters' motivations in aiming to control the Zaibatsu.\n\nGameplay focuses on hand-to-hand combat with an opponent, with the gameplay system including blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas. ''Tekken'' is noted as being one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation.\n\nJapanese video game developer [[Namco]] began the series in 1994, with the release of the [[Tekken (video game)|self-titled]] first entry. As of 2017, it has nine additional entries, eight spin-off games, and has been adapted into three feature films. ''[[Tekken 2]]'', as well as the third game ''[[Tekken 3]]'', are considered landmark titles; they received critical acclaim for their gameplay, as well as for a more immersive experience. Subsequent titles have followed this concept, and received generally positive critical responses.\n\nThe series has been universally acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped more than 49 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, and the second best-selling fighting game franchise in history.<ref name=\"sales\">{{Cite tweet |number=1230696020280897537 |user=Harada_TEKKEN |title=TEKKEN7 had achieved Over 5 million sales (Achieved in December 2019)!

From then on, starting with ''Tekken 2'', characters automatically block while not moving forward or performing actions, a feature called \"neutral guard.\" Standing or retreating characters will block high and middle attacks with no input from the player, while crouching characters will duck high attacks and block low ones. Normal middle attacks will hit crouching players, but some special mid-attacks can be blocked by both stand and crouching neutral guards. Meanwhile, pressing backwards will give the player an \"active guard\" that can withstand certain combo attacks that would normally penetrate the neutral guard. Some characters are equipped with parries and reversals that act like traditional \"press button to block\" systems.\n\n''Tekken 3'' introduced several gameplay possibilities that were retained in later games, including the ability to sidestep into the foreground or background.<ref name=\"ignfeature\">{{cite web | title=The Evolution of Tekken| url=http://games.ign.com/articles/102/1026583p1.html|date=September 18, 2009|publisher=IGN|author=Clements, Ryan| accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> ''Tekken 3'' and later games also reduced recovery time after being knocked down and gave characters rolls to recover instantly after hitting the ground, allowing the player to get back into the fight more quickly at the risk of being hit while rolling. ''Tekken 4'' gave characters even greater mobility by adding true [[3D computer graphics|3D]] movement inside geometrically complex arenas with uneven ground, obstacles, and walls. The 3D gameplay allows damaging side and back throws as a reward for outmaneuvering the opponent, as well as evasive attacks that develop directly from a sidestep.\n\n''Tekken 5'' saw a combination of walled and infinite arenas, while discarding uneven ground. ''Tekken 6'' retains much of the design from ''Tekken 5'' but also includes a \"Rage\" mode, which activates when a character is near the end of his vitality bar and earns a damage multiplier. \"Bound\" hits were also added, in which a player connected with an airborne opponent will place him in an inescapable grounded state, allowing combo extensions. ''Tekken 6'' also has destructible floors and walls that allow the fighters to blast through to new fighting areas when broken. ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' retains these elements while also adding a new kind of stage break (\"balcony breaks\", which is a combination of floor and wall breaks where characters will go through a breakable wall and fall to a lower level in the same sequence). ''Tag 2'' specific features include Tag Assaults (cooperative combos triggered by hitting a Bound and a tag at the same time) and Tag Crashes (an emergency tag occurring when downed and the partner is currently in Rage).\n\n''Tekken 7'' introduces some movement changes to the ''Tekken'' formula. The back walk animation is now similar to ''Tekken Revolution'', featuring a more fluid movement away from the opponent as opposed to a slower shuffle. Regular back rolling from a grounded state has been removed and instead replaced with a new rising animation and performing a \"ankle kick\" (kicking the standing opponent while laying face up on the ground) is now accompanied by a new back roll to help create separation. Balcony breaks from ''Tag Tournament 2'' are present and function similarly to how they did in solo play. New features include \"Power Crushes\" (an attack that cannot be interrupted by regular attacks once the animation has begun) and \"Rage Arts\" (attacks that can only be used when your character has hit a Raged state near the end of their vitality meter, sacrificing the Rage mode to perform the attack). Bound has been mostly removed save for specific situations (certain moves can cause a Bound if not comboed into and all low parries will cause a Bound effect, similar to ''Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion''; floor breaks now result in an effect similar to a Tag Assault in ''Tag 2'' rather than a standard Bound) and instead characters now have more frequent access to an \"Aerial Tailspin\" effect (an attack that throws an opponent backwards onto their head as opposed to straight downwards, although it is still inescapable once triggered which means the combo can continue).\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Mishimafamily.png|thumb|right|The conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot.<ref name=\"mishima\"/> As seen from left to right: Jinpachi Mishima, Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama.]]\n{{main|List of Tekken characters}}\nPlayers can choose from a diverse cast that hails from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and fighting styles.

[[Kazuya Mishima]] was the protagonist in the original game, his father [[Heihachi Mishima]] was the protagonist of ''Tekken 2'' and ''Tekken 7'', and [[Jin Kazama]] has been the protagonist since his debut in ''Tekken 3'' until ''Tekken 6''.

For example, Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima, by virtues of familial connection and studying under the same Advanced Mishima Style Fighting Karate discipline, have very similar moves and a signature \"crouch dash\" stance for pretty much their entire appearances in the series. [[Jin Kazama]], when he debuted, also had the same Mishima fighting style, though he mixed this with Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts as practiced by his mother, [[Jun Kazama]].
