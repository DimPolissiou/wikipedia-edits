Evaluating the mechanisms that regulate blood flow and the process by which [[Angiogenesis|new blood vessels form]], Hudlick\u00e1 recognized that by indirectly using electrical stimulation on skeletal muscles, one could alter the mechanisms which deliver oxygen and nutrients to muscles. The therapeutic implications for patients included resistance to fatigue and increased blood flow, similar to that obtained by exercise training, for patients afflicted with heart failure, hypertension, or stroke. Hudlick\u00e1 authored or co-authored over 200 publications, edited and reviewed works for such publications as ''Microcirculation'', and trained doctoral students.

{"title_page": "Rubik's family cubes of all sizes", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[File:Cube scram to set.png|thumb]]\nThe original Rubik's cube was a mechanical 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube puzzle invented in 1974 by the Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]]. Extensions of the Rubik's cube have been around for a long time and come in both hardware and software forms. The major extension have been the availability of cubes of larger size and the availability of the more complex cubes with marked centres. The properties of Rubik\u2019s family cubes of any size together with some special attention to software cubes is the main focus of this article. Many properties are mathematical in nature and are functions of the cube size variable.\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the main, the terminology used here is in agreement with what is in general use. Elsewhere, some terms are used with different meanings. To avoid misconceptions, the meaning of most terms in use in this article is defined below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Cube size\n|| The standard Rubik's cube is often referred to as a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. That cube will be referred to as a size 3 cube and in general an <math>n\\times n\\times n</math> cube will be referred to as a size <math>n</math> cube.\n|-\n! Rubik cube family\n|| Cubes that have similar rotational properties to the standard Rubik's size 3 cube and obey generalized rules for a size <math>n</math> cube are considered to be members of the Rubik cube family. Cubes of size 2 and above that meet this condition are available.\n|-\n! Cubie\n|| Individual cube elements will be referred to as cubies (others sometimes refer to them as \"cubelets\"). There are three types of cubies: corner cubies (three coloured surfaces), edge cubies (two coloured surfaces), and centre cubies (one coloured surface). The absolute centre cubies for odd size cubes sit on the central axes of the six faces, and their relative positions never change.\n|-\n! Cubicle\n|| A cubicle is the compartment in which a cubie resides. For a permutation (defined below), cubicles are considered to occupy fixed positions in the space occupied by the cube object, but their contents (cubies) may shift position.\n|-\n! Facelet\n|| A facelet is a visible coloured surface of a cubie (corner cubies have three facelets, edge cubies have two, and centre cubies have one).\n|-\n! Cube style\n|| Two cube styles are referred to herein: firstly a standard cube with unmarked centres and secondly a cube with marked centres.\n|-\n! Cube state\n|| A particular arrangement of the cubies will be referred to as a cube state. What looks the same is considered to be the same (unless specific mention to the contrary is made). Each state has equal probability of being produced after a genuine random scrambling sequence. A rotation of the whole cube does not change the state considered herein. In other texts, the various states are often referred to as permutations or arrangements.\n|-\n! Cube layer\n|| A cube layer is a one-cubie-thick slice of the cube perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Outer layers (faces) contain more cubies than inner layers. For a cube of size <math>n</math>, there will be <math>n</math> layers along any given axis.\n|-\n! Cube face\n|| The meaning of a cube face depends on the context in which it is used. It usually means one of the six three-dimensional outer layers but can also refer to just the outside layer's surface which is perpendicular to its axis of rotation. The faces are usually designated as up (U), down (D), front (F), back (B), left (L), and right (R).\n|-\n! Set state\n|| The set (or solved) state of the cube is one for which a uniform colour appears on each of the six faces. For cubes with marked centres, the set state is characterised by a unique arrangement of all centre cubies, and the labelling of those cubies must reflect that.\n|-\n! Scrambled state\n|| The scrambled state is the starting point for unscrambling the cube. It arises when a cube in the set or any other state is subject to a large number of randomly chosen layer rotations.\n|-\n! \"Fixed-in-space\" axes of rotation\n|| There are [[Cartesian coordinate system|three mutually perpendicular axes]] of rotation for the cube. One set of axes defined in terms of D, U, B, F, L, and R terms can be considered to have a fixed orientation in space. Think of these axes as belonging to a cube-shaped container in which the cube object can be positioned in any of 24 orientations. One axis can be drawn through the centres of the D and U faces (the DU axis). The others are the BF and LR axes.\n|-\n! \"Cube object\" axes of rotation\n|| Another set of axes can be defined for the cube object itself. These axes relate to the face colours, the most common being white, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. The axes are usually white-blue, red-orange, and yellow-green. For odd size cubes, these axes are always fixed relative to the internal frame of the cube object. For even size cubes, these axes remain fixed relative to the internal frame of the cube object after initial selections. The origin for the axes is the centre of the cube object.\n|-\n! Layer rotation\n|| The only way that cube state can be changed is by rotations of cube layers about their axes of rotation. All changes of state involve rotation steps that can be considered as a sequence of single layer quarter turns.\n|-\n! Orbit\n|| For a basic quarter turn of a cube layer for cubes of all sizes, sets-of-four cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories. When all the possible trajectories for a given cubie type are considered for the whole cube, we will refer to all the possible movement positions as being in a given orbit. We consider that the size 3 cube has two orbits, one in which the eight corner cubies are constrained to move and one in which the 12 edge cubies are constrained to move. Transfer of cubies between these orbits is impossible.\n\nFor cubes of size 4 and above, we will also define an edge cubie orbit as comprising 12 cubies, but will use the term complementary orbit to describe a pair of orbits between which edge cubies can move. A pair of complementary edge cubie orbits contains a total of 24 cubies. Cubes of size 4 and above include centre cubie orbits that contain 24 cubies. Transfer of cubies between one such orbit and another is not possible (applies to cubes of size 5 and above).\n|-\n! Move\n|| A move is a quarter turn rotation of a layer or a sequence of such quarter turns that a person would apply as a single step.\n|-\n! Move notation\n|| A clockwise quarter turn of an outer layer is usually expressed as U, D, F, B, L, or R. In other respects the notation used varies among authors. For example, a counterclockwise quarter turn of an outer layer could be expressed as U', D', F', B', L', or R'.\n|-\n! Algorithm\n|| An algorithm defines a sequence of layer rotations to transform a given state to another (usually less scrambled) state. Usually an algorithm is expressed as a printable character sequence according to some move notation. An algorithm can be considered to be a \"smart\" move. All algorithms are moves, but few moves are considered to be algorithms.\n|-\n! [[Permutation group|Permutation]]\n|| A permutation of the cube as used herein means the act of permuting (i.e. rearranging) the positions of cubies. A permutation is an all-inclusive term which includes a sequence of quarter turns of any length. Even the solving of the cube from a scrambled state represents a permutation. The term \"permutation\" is used extensively by mathematicians who use [[Group (mathematics)|Group Theory]] to quantify the process involved in a rearrangement of cubies. \n\nThe term \"permutation\" is also often used to mean the state of the cube that results after it is rearranged, but that meaning will not be used herein. In such cases, the term \"cube state\" will be used. That allows the term \"permutation\" to be used when the permutation results in no change of state - an area of special interest for Rubik\u2019s family cube permutations.\n|-\n! [[Parity (mathematics)|Parity]]\n|| A cube permutation can be represented by a number of swaps of two cubies. If that number is even, the permutation has even parity, and if the number is odd, the permutation has odd parity.\n|}\n\n==Cube types==\n\n=== Hardware cubes ===\nHardware (physical) cubes are based on the original size 3 cube invented by Erno Rubik in 1974. These cubes usually use coloured stickers on the facelets for cubie identification. The [[Rubik's Cube|size 3]] standard Rubik\u2019s cube gained peak interest in the 1980s and was closely followed by the [[Rubik's Revenge|size 4]] (Rubik's Revenge) cube. Other, usually more recently available, hardware forms of the cube come in [[Pocket Cube|size 2]] (Pocket Cube), [[Professor's Cube|size 5]] (Professor's Cube), [[V-Cube 6|size 6]] (V-Cube 6), and [[V-Cube 7|size 7]] (V-Cube 7). Lesser known hardware cubes of larger sizes have also been produced. Currently, the largest hardware cube made is the size 33, and the largest mass-produced is size 17<ref>https://thecubicle.us/yuxin-huanglong-17x17-p-10097.html</ref>.\n\n===Software cubes===\nIn parallel with the hardware form of the cube there are many software forms available that obey the same rules as the hardware forms. Software cube [[emulator]]s are not subject to the physical restraints that impose a size limit on the hardware forms. Hence the only really big cubes available are those in software form. Also, unlike the hardware forms, a range of cube sizes can easily be accommodated by the one program. The design characteristics of programs that allow users to unscramble cubes vary considerably with such features as the capability to allow the user to save a partially unscrambled state being often available.\n\nSoftware cubes were in use in the 1980s when monochrome monitors were in common use. The lack of colour meant a different way of face identification was required. A [[#Large Freeware cubes|program]] that retained 1980s monochrome capability (using numerals 1 to 6 to identify facelets) for cubes in the size 2 to 11 range was produced in 1991 (together with colour capability in the size 2 to 15 range). More recently developed software cubes use coloured facelets as for hardware cubes.\n\nThe most common, but by no means universal, approach is to emulate the cube by providing a \"three-dimensional\" display of the cube that makes it look like a real hardware cube. A drawback of the \"three-dimensional\" display is that, without some extra enhancements, the state of parts of the cube for any given view is hidden.\n\nOther interactive software approaches that do not emulate a three-dimensional cube are also used by some programmers. Generally, an aim of such approaches is to allow the state of all cubies to be in view all the time but has the disadvantage (for some viewers) that the display does not appear like a real-world cube. A conventional two-dimensional (unfolded) display with all cube elements appearing of equal size is one approach. Another form of display where all cube elements do not appear of equal size is also in use. The upper cube size limit for software cubes is limited by the monitor\u2019s available pixels and what viewers find as acceptable which, in turn, is a function of their visual acuity. For cubes of large size it can be advantageous to allow a portion of the cube to be scrolled out of view.\n\nAll emulators provide a means for the user to change the cube state step-by-step and unscramble the cube. Most emulators use mouse movements to control the rotation of the cube elements, others use keyboard commands, and some use a combination of both.\n\nSoftware cubes present some major capabilities that are not possible with hardware cubes. Instant return to the set state is always available. If the program allows a partially unscrambled state to be saved then, by regularly updating the saved state, users need not despair if they do something that leaves their cube in a mess. They can return to their previously recorded state and continue from there. The bigger the cube the more helpful such a capability becomes.\n\nSome [[Freeware]] large cube (size greater than 10) implementations are [[#Large Freeware cubes|available]].\n\n==Cube design variants==\nWhile there are multiple variants in use only two will be considered here: \n* Standard cubes with unmarked centres.\n* Cubes with marked centres.\n\n=== Standard cubes with unmarked centres ===\nA 2-layer (size 2) cube has corner cubies only.\n \nCubes of size 2 and size 3 have single solutions meaning that all the cube elements can have only one correct location for a solved cube.\n \nCentre cubies differ from the corner and edge cubies in that their orientation or position has multiple possibilities. For cubes of odd size, there will be a centre cubie that is centrally located on the cube face and that cubie has only one correct location for a solved cube. However, multiple locations of all other centre cubies apply for a solved cube. The centre cubies (other than the single central one for cubes of odd size) form sets-of-four on each face and sets-of-24 for the whole cube for the various orbits. These centre cubies have four possible final positions (their orientation changes with position but cannot be changed independently) that would satisfy the solved state. \n\n=== Cubes with marked centres ===\nTypically, hardware cubes with marked centres use images or logos on the faces to designate what centre cubie(s) orientation is required for a solved cube. Such cubes are also referred to as \"supercubes\" and the application of markings of this type is generally restricted to just cubes of very small size.\n \nSolving a cube with marked centres is considerably more complex than that for standard cubes. The use of jig-saw style image marking on cubes of large size would make a difficult task even more difficult. Two possibilities in current use on software cubes are the use of a numerical graphic in the \"1\" to \"4\" range and the use of a corner marking graphic. \n\nThere is a direct correspondence between numerical and corner marking. A top left corner quadrant marking is equivalent to a numerical marking 1, second quadrant to 2, third quadrant to 3, and fourth quadrant to 4. The following image illustrates these different forms of marking. \n\n[[File:Num cnr marking.png|thumb|center|364 px]]\n\nBecause transfer of cubies between orbits is impossible, the same 1-2-3-4 markings can be used for each orbit. With the exception of the absolute centre cubies for cubes of odd size, there are 24 centre cubies (4 per face) in each orbit. If <math>n</math> is cube size, there will be <math>\\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-a}{4}</math> orbits where <math>a</math> is zero if <math>n</math> is even or <math>a</math> is one if <math>n</math> is odd. \n\nNumerical marking is typically applicable for cubes up to about size 32. Corner marking while less user-friendly can allow the marked centres range to be extended beyond the numerical marking limit.\n\nExcept for absolute centre marking for cubes of odd size, numerical marking would provide the best means of centre cubie marking for hardware cubes as their size range is limited. Rotation of the numbers would mean a small inconvenience relative to non-rotated numbers that can be used for software cubes. The big advantage of numbers is that they reduce the complexity of solving the last cube face when markings are in use (e.g. if the set-of-four sequence is 1-3-4-2 (even parity, needs two swaps to become the required 1-2-3-4) then the algorithm requirement is clear. Algorithms have been defined in<ref name=\"fraser_marked\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/cube/solving/markctr.pdf \"Implementing and Solving Rubik's Family Cubes with Marked Centres\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and are, of course, equally applicable to hardware cubes.\n\n==Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes==\nA cube is solvable if the set state has existed some time in the past and if no tampering of the cube has occurred (e.g. by rearrangement of stickers on hardware cubes or by doing the equivalent on software cubes).

Those rules limit what arrangements are possible and mean that, of the possible unrestricted cubie arrangements, the number that are unreachable far outnumber those that are reachable.\n\nCubes of all sizes have three mutually perpendicular axes about which one or more layers can be rotated. All moves for the cube can be considered as a sequence of quarter-turn rotations about these axes. The movement possibilities give rise to a set of rules (or laws) which in most cases can be expressed in analytical terms.\n\nFor a cube of size <math>n</math>:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em;\n|Number of corner cubies\n|<math>8</math>\n|-\n|Number of edge cubies\n|<math>12\\left(n-2\\right)</math>\n|-\n|Number of centre cubies\n|<math>6\\left(n-2\\right)^2</math>\n|-\n|Number of facelets\n|<math>6n^2</math>\n|-\n|Total number of cubies\n|<math>6\\left(n-1\\right)^2+2</math>\n|-\n|Increase in total number of cubies for unit increase in cube size from <math>n</math> to <math>\\left(n+1\\right)</math>\n|<math>12n-6</math>\n|}\nEvery cube move can be considered as a permutation. The relationship between the cube state after a move with that before a move can be expressed mathematically using Group Theory<ref name=\"davis_permut\">Tom Davis, [http://www.geometer.org/rubik/group.pdf \"Group Theory via Rubik\u2019s Cube\"].

Since every move can be considered as a sequence of quarter turn rotations, it is appropriate to examine what is involved in a quarter turn rotation. Except for the absolute centre cubie for odd size cubes, during the quarter turn the cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories (also referred to as a 4-cycle movement since four quarter turns will restore the cubies in the specified trajectory to their original positions). A quarter turn of a 4-cubie set can be represented by three swaps as indicated below where swap 1-2 means the contents of cubicle 1 is swapped with the contents of cubicle 2, etc.{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0 auto}}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Start\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | 1/A\n| width=\"50%\" | 2/B\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | 4/D\n| width=\"50%\" | 3/C\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Swap 1-2\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Swap 1-3\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |Swap 1-4\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe parity<ref>Ryan Heise, [http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/parity.html \"Rubik's Cube Theory - Parity\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> of a permutation refers to whether that permutation is even or odd. An even permutation is one that can be represented by an even number of swaps while an odd permutation is one that can be represented by an odd number of swaps. An odd permutation followed by an odd permutation will represent an overall even permutation (adding two odd numbers always returns an even number). Since a quarter turn is made up of a number of 4-cycles each involving three swaps, if the number of 4-cycles is odd, overall parity of the quarter turn permutation will be odd and vice versa.\n\nQuarter turn permutation parity for a size <math>n</math> cube is given in the following table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:45em; text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom\n! style=\"width:15%\" | {{nowrap|Cube size<br />(odd or even)}}\n! style=\"width:15%\" | {{nowrap|Layer type}} \n! style=\"width:35%\" |Number of 4-cycle movements \n! style=\"width:35%\" |Overall parity\n|-\n| odd||inner||<math>n-1</math>||even\n|-\n| odd||outer||<math>\\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-1}{4}+\\left(n-1\\right)</math>||even{{Efn|name=a}}\n|-\n| even||inner||<math>n-1</math>||odd\n|-\n| even||outer|| <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)^2+\\left(n-1\\right)</math> ||even if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even {{Efn|name=b}}\n<br>odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd\n|-\n| colspan=4 |{{notelist|refs={{efn|name=a|Since <math>\\left(n-2\\right)^2-1</math> equals <math>\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(n-3\\right)</math>, a product of two consecutive even numbers, which must always be evenly divisible by 8.}} {{efn|name=b|Since <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)^2</math> will be odd if <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math> is odd (i.e. if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even) giving overall even since <math>(n-1)</math> is odd. The reverse applies if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd.}}}}\n|}\nSummarising the above parity results we conclude:\n* All permutations for odd size cubes have even overall parity.\n* All individual quarter turns for even size cubes, where half the cube size is an odd number, have odd overall parity.\n* For even size cubes where half the cube size is an even number, inner layer quarter turns have odd overall parity and outer layer quarter turns have even overall parity.\n\nThe above analysis considered the parity for corner (where applicable), edge and centre cubies combined. It is possible to consider these in isolation and when that is done an even combined quarter turn parity will involve a number of odd parity elements.\n\nStandard cubes (i.e. cubes with unmarked centres) of any size greater than 3 behave exactly like the size 3 cube if only outer layer rotations are permitted. Parity rules dictate that, for cubes of odd size, the swapping of the two cubies in a single edge set requires a change in the position of centre cubies. It can be shown<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /> that, for the size 4 cube the swapping and inverting of the two complementary cubies in a single edge set can be achieved without any change in the position of any other cubies. It can also be shown that, for cubes of even size 6 and above, the swapping of the two cubies in a single edge set requires a change in the position of centre cubies.\n\nA permutation as used here takes account of the change in the positions of cubies, not any change in their orientations. For the 24 edge cubie sets (made up of 12 complementary pairs) there is no restriction on position. Orientation is set by position and cannot be changed independently of position.\n\nCorner cubies behave the same for cubes of all sizes. They have three possible orientations made up from a combination of <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> twists where a full twist (about an axis drawn from the cube corner to the cubie's internal corner) returns the corner cubie to its original orientation. If we designate a unit clockwise twist by <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> and a unit counter-clockwise twist by <math>-\\frac{1}{3}</math>, then the twist possibilities for a corner cubie relative to any given initial state (the set state for example) are 0, <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> and <math>-\\frac{1}{3}</math>. The sum of the twist increments across all corner cubies must always be an integer (0, 1 or 2).\n\nWhen inner layer rotations are included for cubes of size greater than 3, some of the edge cubie movement limitations mentioned above no longer apply. These are expanded on in the [[#Final layer problems|Final layer problems]] section.\n\nCubie position and orientation are of special concern when unscrambling the final layer. Edge cubies must always end up in exactly the same positions they occupied in the initial set state before scrambling. If any edge cubie in a given edge set in the final layer has a wrong orientation (only applicable to cubes of size greater than 3), it must be in a wrong position and will need to be swapped with a complementary edge cubie also having wrong orientation. With everything else in place, corner cubies can be in the right position but two or more can have incorrect orientation. For standard cubes of size greater than 3, there is a negligible possibility that centre cubies (other than absolute centre cubies for cubes of odd size) will occupy the same positions they had in the initial set state (assuming the centre cubies are unmarked).\n\nBoth even and odd size cubes with either marked or unmarked centres obey the rule: \"Any permutation that results in only a rearrangement of centre cubies in 24 cubie orbits must have even parity\".\n\nIf permutations of facelets rather than cubies are considered then both position and orientation of cubies will be taken into account. For software cubes, the states (six colour possibilities) of the <math>6n^2</math> facelets (in a <math>6\\times n\\times n</math> array for instance) is what would allow complete information on cube state to be saved for later use.\n\nA cube of any size that is subject to repeats of the same permutation will eventually return to the state (e.g. the set state) it occupied before the first application of the permutation.<ref name=\"davis_permut\" /><ref name=\"davis_gptheory\" /> The number of times that a permutation has to be applied to first return the cube to its initial state is referred to as the order or the cycle length of the permutation and is applicable to cubes of all sizes. An overall permutation that results in no change of state is referred to as an Identity Permutation. A program that allows permutation cycle length of any size cube to be determined is available<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/unravelcube.htm \"Unravelling Cubes of Size 2x2x2 and Above\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and sample cycle length results have been documented.<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /> For a given permutation, cycle length can vary according to:\n* Cube size.\n* Initial cube state (for standard cubes with unmarked centres).\n* Cube style (whether standard or marked centres are in use).\n* Spatial orientation (checking all 24 of these rather than just one may give a different result).\n\nThe parity of an Identity Permutation is always even. That result for cubes of odd size is obviously true since every quarter turn has even parity. The result is less obvious for cubes of even size. For cubes of even size if the scrambling permutation relative to the previous set state is odd, then any permutation to solve the cube must also have odd parity and vice versa.\n\nThe generalized number of possible states for a size <math>n</math> cube is considered in the [[#Reachable states for cubes of all sizes|Reachable states for cubes of all sizes]] section.\n\n==Cube solving==\n\n===Solving by people===\nCube solving involves starting with a scrambled cube and applying step-by-step layer rotations to eventually end up with a solved cube. For cubes with unmarked centres that means all faces would need to appear in uniform colour. For cubes with marked centres a unique arrangement of all centre cubies in addition to the uniform colour requirement would need to apply. Since the starting point is always different, there can never be a unique set of rotations that can be applied to solve a cube. Usually, people work through the solution with the possible use of [[algorithms]], mainly in the latter stage of the unscrambling. In theory, it is possible for a person to write a computer program that \"thinks\" like a human and solves the cube without human intervention (refer to the [[#Solving by computer program|Solving by computer program]] section).\n\nThe aim of most software cube emulators is to provide a means for the user to interact with the program to solve (unscramble) the cube in a similar manner to the way they would unscramble a hardware cube.\n\nEfficient rotation sequences (algorithms) can be developed using Group Theory permutation mathematics. However, there are many references to the relevant rotation sequences required to solve cubes of small size (refer to some for size 3, 4, and 5 cubes<ref>Peter Still, [http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/rubikscubesolution.html \"Beginner Solution to the Rubik's Cube\"].

The steps involved in solving any cube of size greater than 4 are fairly straightforward extensions of those required to solve size 3 and size 4 cubes. However, there is limited availability of generalized instructions that can be applied for solving cubes of any size (particularly the large ones). Generalized guidance on one way of solving standard cubes<ref name=\"fraser_solving_unmarked\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/cube/solving/cubesolving.pdf \"Instructions for Solving Cubes of Various Sizes\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and cubes with marked centres<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> of all sizes is available.\n\nAnybody who can solve a size 4 cube should be able to solve cubes of larger size provided they accept an increased time-to-solve penalty. Software design features, unavailable in hardware cubes, can simplify the cube solving process. For a given set of cube design features the complexity (difficulty) of solving a Rubik\u2019s family cube increases if the number of reachable states increases. Three main properties affect that number:\n# Cube size: The number of cubies to be placed is a [[Quadratic function|quadratic (second order polynomial) function]] of cube size and therefore has a major influence on cube solving complexity.\n# Odd or even size: Even size cubes have an additional effect to just cube size that adds complexity relative to odd size cubes. This effect is relatively small and is independent of cube size (the added contribution when cube size changes from <math>n</math> to <math>\\left(n+1\\right)</math> for <math>n</math> odd is constant). This effect will be expanded upon when the number of reachable states is considered later.\n# Unmarked or marked centre cubies: Centre cubie marking adds complexity to cube solving.\n\nAdditional algorithms to assist users to solve the size 3<ref>Matthew Monroe, [http://www.alchemistmatt.com/cube/rubikcenter.html \"How to handle pictures or logos on the faces\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and to solve any size<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> cube with marked centres have been defined.\n\n===Large cube issues===\nLarge cube emulators claimed to cater for cubes up to and beyond size 100 are available. Irrespective of what upper size limit is claimed, available pixels (that vary according to the monitor in use) and the user's visual acuity are going to impose practical limits on the maximum cube size that a person can handle.\n\nAs indicated in the [[#Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes|Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes]] section, total number of cubies is <math>\\left\\{6\\left(n-1\\right)^2+2\\right\\}</math>, and the number of centre cubies is <math>6\\left(n-2\\right)^2</math>, where <math>n</math> is cube size. For large size cubes, the number of centre cubies becomes very dominant as indicated below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Cube size:\n| width=\"10%\" |4|| width=\"10%\" |8|| width=\"10%\" |16|| width=\"10%\" |32|| width=\"10%\" |64\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Total cubies:\n| width=\"10%\" |56|| width=\"10%\" |296|| width=\"10%\" |1352|| width=\"10%\" |5768|| width=\"10%\" |23816\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Centre cubie proportion of total cubies (%):\n| width=\"10%\" |42.8|| width=\"10%\" |73.0|| width=\"10%\" |87.0|| width=\"10%\" |93.6|| width=\"10%\" |96.8\n|}\n\nIt follows that placement of centre cubies will become increasingly more significant than the placement of other cubies as cube size is increased. The time to solve a cube will rise dramatically with cube size. For example, there are about 24 times as many cubies to place in a size 16 cube than there are in a size 4 cube. If the average time to place a cubie were the same in both cases, that factor of 24 in time would also apply. The 24 factor is likely to be an under-estimation, because the presence of a large number of cubies makes it more difficult (and time-consuming) to identify what belongs where.\n\nProviding a software program that allows the state of cubes of big size to be changed is not much more difficult than doing the same thing for cubes of small size. However, solving big cubes is a much more demanding and time-consuming task than doing the same for small cubes. Therefore, it is likely that most really big software cubes that are available have never been solved.\n\nIdentifying the exact locations to look for cubies (mainly the quadruple centre cubie sets) is a major issue for big cubes. Use of a secondary marker grid<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\" /> can ease identification. For example, a marker grid to form 4\u00d74 segments for a size 16 cube (16 such segments per face) could be used.\n\nA common set of six cubie colours adopted for both hardware cubes and software cubes comprises white, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. This colour set may be non-optimum for software cubes of large size where the number of pixels per cubie is small. For instance, the differentiation between white and yellow may be problematic. Reducing the number of colors in the red to blue range from five to four and adding violet (the colour at the extreme of the\n[[visible spectrum]]) produces a colour set that may be considered more suitable for cubes of large size. Some software cube implementations allow users to change the default colour set, if desired. This is a useful addition for users whose colour perception is at variance with the norm.\n\n===Solving by computer program===\nCube solving by computer program<ref>Eric Dietz(deceased), [http://cubex.sourceforge.net/ \"Rubik's Cube Solver\"]. Retrieved\n2017-02-24.</ref> (as distinct from the normal way people solve a cube) for small size (e.g. size 3) cubes has been developed, and it is equally easy to solve large size cubes by computer.\n\n===Final layer problems===\nA \"final layer problem\" is defined here to mean a need for a rearrangement of final layer edge cubies that cannot be achieved using standard size 3 cube moves. These are often referred to as parity problems or errors, but such terminology may be misleading. If moves were limited to those available to the size 3 cube, such states would be unreachable (break parity rules). There are numerous variations in the way the final layer problems are presented and the algorithms to resolve them, but the correction requirement will be similar to that described below. The problems considered here apply equally to standard cubes and to those with marked centres but in the latter case additional final layer issues arise for aligning centre cubies. The problems for larger cubes can be considered as straightforward extensions of those that apply to the size 4 cube. Basically, two types of problem can arise:\n* There is a need to flip a complementary pair or a complete set of edge cubies in the final edge set. This condition will be referred to as an OLL (orientation of last layer) requirement.\n* There is a need to swap the positions of two edge cubie sets in the final layer. This condition will be referred to as a PLL (permutation of last layer) requirement.\n\nOLL and PLL as used here can be considered to be sub-sets of the [[CFOP method|usual definitions]] of these terms. There are many references to moves that can be used to resolve these problems. Fewer references<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /><ref>Chris Hardwick, [http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve3.html \"Fix parity for 4x4x4 cube\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> demonstrate how these moves satisfy parity rules. From a parity perspective, there is a need to consider the rearrangement of centre cubies which is not readily observable in cubes with unmarked centres. Only OLL parity compliance will be illustrated here.\n\nA typical OLL correction for a size 9 cube is shown. The cubies shown in colour are the only ones in the cube that change positions.\n{| style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:OLL before correction.png|thumb|center|250px|OLL before correction for size 9 cube]]\n| style=\"width:20px\" | \n|[[File:OLL after correction.png|thumb|center|250px|OLL after correction for size 9 cube]]\n|}\nFor the OLL correction there are <math>n-2</math> centre cubie swaps and overall there are <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> swaps when the edge pair is included. For odd size cubes <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> is always even (and conforms with the universal even parity requirement for odd size cubes). For even size cubes <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> is always odd which means in this case a parity reversal always occurs, an allowable parity condition for even size cubes.\n\nFor the complete edge set flip (a requirement that can arise only for cubes of even size), the number of swaps will be <math>\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math>. The overall number of swaps will be even if <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math> is even (i.e. <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd). The overall number of swaps will be odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even. Hence overall parity will be even if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd and odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even.\n\nThe parity of a given algorithm can, of course, also be deduced from its content using the rules detailed in the [[#Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes|Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes]] section.\n\nFor standard cubes the rearrangement of centre cubies to resolve the OLL and PLL problems is unimportant. For cubes with marked centre cubies the effect of this rearrangement of these cubies is a serious drawback. For cubes with marked centres it is not possible (except for the size 4 cube) to align all final layer centre cubies until all edge cubies have been placed in their final positions.\n\n===Algorithms===\nInstructions for people on how to solve Rubik's type cubes are normally conveyed either in purely graphical form or as sequences defined using a printable character notation. A character sequence that can be translated and applied to perform a sequence of layer rotations to transform a given state to another (usually less scrambled) state is often referred to as an [[Algorithms|algorithm]]. Algorithms are most commonly used when unscrambling the latter portion of the cube but can be applied more extensively if desired. Algorithms can be written down as instructions that can be memorized or looked up in a document. The printable characters used (e.g. to indicate an anticlockwise quarter turn, a single layer quarter turn, or a multiple layer quarter turn) in algorithm instructions vary among authors, as does their positions in the instructions. Where people interpret instructions the way they are presented is insignificant. The only time the form of presentation has significance is when computer keyboard entry is used to change the state of software cubes, and automatic updating of the screen image occurs whenever a valid instruction is received. For example, if F\u2032 is used to represent an anticlockwise quarter turn of the front face, then, as the user types in F, a clockwise quarter turn will occur, and a correction will be needed when the user types the \u2032 character. The end result will still be correct, but use of \u2212F rather than F\u2032 would eliminate the superfluous rotation. Any text enhancements, such as superscripts or subscripts, must be avoided in the method of presenting cube rotation sequences when users communicate with software cubes via keyboard commands. When computer keyboard entry of instructions is used, [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] (which map a short input text string to a longer string) can be used<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\" /><ref name=\"fraser_solving_unmarked\" /><ref>Tom Davis, [http://www.geometer.org/rubik/ \"Rubik Test Release\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> as algorithm shortcuts.\n\n===Time to solve cubes===\nSpeedcubing (or speedsolving) is the practice of solving a cube in the Rubik's cube family in the shortest time possible (which usually implies reducing the number of quarter turn moves required). It is most commonly applied to cubes of small size, and there are numerous solving methods that have been documented. An international team of researchers using computer power from Google has found every way the standard size 3 Rubik's cube can be solved and have shown that it is possible to complete the solution in 20 moves or fewer<ref>Tomas Rokicki, Herbert Kociemba, Morley Davidson, and John Dethridge, [http://www.cube20.org/ \"God's Number is 20\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> for any initial scrambled state (where a move here is defined as a quarter or a half turn of a face). Generally, speed solving methods apply more to specialist cubists than typical cubists and are more complex than simple layer-by-layer type methods used by most other people.\n\n==Reachable and unreachable states for cubes of all sizes==\nIf a cube has at some previous time occupied the set state, then any state that can arise after legal moves is considered to be a reachable state. For small size cubes (size 2, 3, or 4), an unreachable state is one that cannot be reached by legal moves. For larger cubes, there needs to be some further qualification on what is meant by an unreachable state. In this article, notional movement between 24-cubie orbits for edge and for centre cubies is excluded.\n\n===Relationship between reachable and unreachable states===\nIf, for a cube of any size, ''m'' represents the number of reachable states, ''u'' represents the number of unreachable states, and ''t'' equals their sum:\n\n:<math>t=u+m</math>\n:<math>t=km</math> where <math>k</math> is a positive integer\n:<math>u=\\left(k-1\\right)m</math>\n\nBoth ''m'' and ''k'' are functions of cube size <math>n</math>. Values for ''m'' and ''k'' will be considered in the following sections. In other texts, \"reachable states\" are often referred to as \"permutations\".\n\n===Reachable states for cubes of all sizes===\nThe number of reachable states is based on:\n* Standard ''permutations and combinations mathematics''.<ref name=\"mason\">Oliver Mason, [http://www.hamilton.ie/ollie/EE304/Counting.pdf \"Some Simple Counting Rules, EE304 - Probability and Statistics\"].

These constants are in agreement with figures frequently quoted for the size 3 and size 4 cubes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=\"58%\" align=\"left\" | Corner cubie possibilities for even size cubes\n| width=\"4%\"  | P\n| width=\"13%\"  | (7!) 3<sup>6</sup>\n| width=\"25%\"  | 3.67416000000000 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Central edge cubie possibilities for odd size cubes, multiplied by 24\n| Q\n| 24 (12!) 2<sup>10</sup>\n| 1.17719433216000 \u00d7 10<sup>13</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Edge cubie possibilities for each dual set (12 pairs)\n| R\n| 24!\n| 6.20448401733239 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Centre cubie possibilities for each quadruple set (6 groups of 4)\n| S\n| (24!)/(4!)<sup>6</sup>\n| 3.24667053711000 \u00d7 10<sup>15</sup>\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"font-size:88%\" | Note: ! is the [[factorial]] symbol (N! means the product 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 N).\n|}\n\nThe value of S may warrant a word of explanation as it is commonly inferred that the number of possible states for centre cubies with identifying markings for a size 4 cube is 24!. Use of that value is guaranteed to yield the wrong answer if cubes with marked centres are under consideration. The first 20 cubies can be arbitrarily placed giving rise to factor 24!/4!. However, for each possible arrangement of edge cubies, only half the 4! hypothetical arrangements for the last four are reachable.<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /><ref name=\"fraser_states\" /> Hence the correct value for the cube with marked centres is 24!/2. If the markings are removed, then a \"permutation with some objects identical\"<ref name=\"mason\" /> applies. For the standard cube the marked cube value needs to be divided by (4!)<sup>6</sup>/2 (the 2 divisor must also be applied here). That gives an overall S value for the size 4 cube of 24!/(4!)<sup>6</sup>. All states for 24-centre-cubie orbits for standard Rubik\u2019s family cubes are reachable (if required, even parity is always achievable by swapping the positions of a couple of centre cubies of the same colour).\n\n:<math>m = \\textrm{P}\\textrm{Q}^a\\textrm{R}^b\\textrm{S}^c</math>\n::where <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> are positive integer [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] (functions of cube size <math>n</math>) as given below.\n::<math>a = n \\textrm{ mod }2</math> (i.e. 0 if <math>n</math> is even or 1 if <math>n</math> is odd)\n::<math>b = \\frac{n-2-a}{2}</math>\n::<math>c = \\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-a}{4}</math>\n\nFor even size cubes <math>\\textrm{Q}^a = 1</math> (see [[exponentiation]]).\n\nFor further simplification, parameter <math>m</math> may also be expressed as <math>m = 10^y</math> where <math>y=\\textrm{log}_{10}m</math>.

The difference is imperceptible except when plotted over a small range of <math>n</math>, as indicated in the graphs reproduced below. Only Rubik\u2019s family values for <math>n</math> equal to 2 and 3 are included in the second graph.\n{| style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n| [[File:Logplot 2to16.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n| width=\"20px\" |\n| [[File:logplot vertex.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n|}\n\nUse of the log function ''y'' provides the only practical means of plotting numbers that vary over such a huge range as that for the Rubik's cube family. The difference between the curves translates as a factor of 505.08471690483 (equal to <math>\\frac{\\textrm{R}^{0.5}\\textrm{S}^{0.25}}{\\textrm{Q}}</math>). This is the factor that defines the effect of even size, relative to odd size, on the number of reachable states for cubes with unmarked centres.\n\nHence, with the logarithmic presentation the number of cube states can be expressed using just four<ref>Math reference, [https://www.reference.com/math/non-integer-6b374df18d851eea \"non-integer\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> numbers (A, B, and the two C values). Furthermore, the number of cube states form a restricted set of values for a more general continuous quadratic (parabolic) function for which <math>n</math> can have non-integer and negative values. Calculating the value of ''m'' from the corresponding value of ''y'' is a straightforward process.\n\nCentre cubies are different from corner or edge cubies in that, unless they have indicative markings, there are multiple possibilities for their final orientation and/or locations. The number of different ways centre cubies can be arranged to yield a solved cube with unmarked centre cubies may be of interest. To calculate that, the impact of centre cubie marking needs to be assessed. Define <math>m_\\textrm{M}</math>, <math>\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M}</math>, and <math>\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M}</math> to be the changed parameters for marked centre cubies (P and R remain unchanged).\n\n:<math>\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{T Q}</math> where <math>\\textrm{T} = \\frac{4^6}{2} = 2048 </math>\n:<math>\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{V S}</math> where <math>\\textrm{V} = \\frac{(4!)^6}{2} = 95551488 </math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{P}\\left(\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M}\\right)^a\\textrm{R}^b\\left(\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M}\\right)^c</math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = m_\\textrm{D}m</math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{T}^a\\textrm{V}^c</math>\n\nParameter <math>m_\\textrm{M}</math> defines the number of reachable states for cubes with marked centres. Factor <math>m_\\textrm{D}</math> gives the number of different arrangements of unmarked centre cubies that will provide a solved size <math>n</math> cube. It is also the factor by which the number of different states for a standard cube needs to be multiplied by when marked centres apply.\n\n===Unreachable states for cubes of all sizes===\nThe number of unreachable states far exceeds the number of reachable states. There are many references to the number of unreachable states for the size 3 cube but very few for larger size cubes.\n\nThe unreachable arrangements for corner and edge cubies are the same for cubes with or without marked centres.\n\nIf a corner cubie for cubes of any size is considered, then a 1/3 twist clockwise leaving everything else unchanged will represent an unreachable state, and similarly for a 1/3 twist counter-clockwise. Hence only 1/3 of the twist possibilities are reachable.\n\nFor the central edge cubie for odd size cubes the behaviour is the same as that for the size 3 cube. Only half the conceivable positions are reachable and only half the conceivable orientations are reachable. Hence only 1/4 of the central edge cubie movement possibilities are reachable.\n\n[[File:Edge cube reach unreach 1.png|thumb|center|554px]]\nEdge cubies that comprise 12 complementary pairs (24 cubies total) behave as if the complementary cubies did not look the same. Any given edge cubie can move to any position in the 24-cubie orbit but for any given position there is one reachable and one unreachable orientation for that cubie. The reverse applies for the complementary edge cubie. For a given cubie (1-2) the reachable and unreachable orientations for a given face for a given orbit for a size 8 cube is illustrated below. One of the 24 reachable possibilities for a given edge cubie matches that of the set cube.\n\nThe number of unreachable states for a 24-edge-cubie set is the same as the number of reachable states (24! in each case).\n\nIn the case of the marked centre cubies only half the conceivable arrangements for each set of 24 cubies for any given orbit are reachable.<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> The same parity rules that apply for marked centre cubies also apply for the unmarked centre cubies. A quarter turn of a set-of-four centre cubies cannot be achieved without changing the arrangement elsewhere to meet the parity requirement. Because there are 95551488 ways of arranging the individual centre cubies so that the resulting arrangement appears exactly the same, parity rules can be met without any observable indication of how the parity compliance is achieved. Hence, for the normal case (24 cubies comprising four of each of six colours) there is no restriction on the achievable states for the centre cubies.\n\nThe following table uses the values noted above to represent the ''k'' component factors for the size <math>n</math> cube.

Extensions of the Rubik's cube have been around for a long time and come in both hardware and software forms. The major extension have been the availability of cubes of larger size and the availability of the more complex cubes with marked centres. The properties of Rubik\u2019s family cubes of any size together with some special attention to software cubes is the main focus of this article. Many properties are mathematical in nature and are functions of the cube size variable.\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the main, the terminology used here is in agreement with what is in general use. Elsewhere, some terms are used with different meanings. To avoid misconceptions, the meaning of most terms in use in this article is defined below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Cube size\n|| The standard Rubik's cube is often referred to as a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. That cube will be referred to as a size 3 cube and in general an <math>n\\times n\\times n</math> cube will be referred to as a size <math>n</math> cube.\n|-\n! Rubik cube family\n|| Cubes that have similar rotational properties to the standard Rubik's size 3 cube and obey generalized rules for a size <math>n</math> cube are considered to be members of the Rubik cube family. Cubes of size 2 and above that meet this condition are available.\n|-\n! Cubie\n|| Individual cube elements will be referred to as cubies (others sometimes refer to them as \"cubelets\"). There are three types of cubies: corner cubies (three coloured surfaces), edge cubies (two coloured surfaces), and centre cubies (one coloured surface). The absolute centre cubies for odd size cubes sit on the central axes of the six faces, and their relative positions never change.\n|-\n! Cubicle\n|| A cubicle is the compartment in which a cubie resides. For a permutation (defined below), cubicles are considered to occupy fixed positions in the space occupied by the cube object, but their contents (cubies) may shift position.\n|-\n! Facelet\n|| A facelet is a visible coloured surface of a cubie (corner cubies have three facelets, edge cubies have two, and centre cubies have one).\n|-\n! Cube style\n|| Two cube styles are referred to herein: firstly a standard cube with unmarked centres and secondly a cube with marked centres.\n|-\n! Cube state\n|| A particular arrangement of the cubies will be referred to as a cube state. What looks the same is considered to be the same (unless specific mention to the contrary is made). Each state has equal probability of being produced after a genuine random scrambling sequence. A rotation of the whole cube does not change the state considered herein. In other texts, the various states are often referred to as permutations or arrangements.\n|-\n! Cube layer\n|| A cube layer is a one-cubie-thick slice of the cube perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Outer layers (faces) contain more cubies than inner layers. For a cube of size <math>n</math>, there will be <math>n</math> layers along any given axis.\n|-\n! Cube face\n|| The meaning of a cube face depends on the context in which it is used. It usually means one of the six three-dimensional outer layers but can also refer to just the outside layer's surface which is perpendicular to its axis of rotation. The faces are usually designated as up (U), down (D), front (F), back (B), left (L), and right (R).\n|-\n! Set state\n|| The set (or solved) state of the cube is one for which a uniform colour appears on each of the six faces. For cubes with marked centres, the set state is characterised by a unique arrangement of all centre cubies, and the labelling of those cubies must reflect that.\n|-\n! Scrambled state\n|| The scrambled state is the starting point for unscrambling the cube. It arises when a cube in the set or any other state is subject to a large number of randomly chosen layer rotations.\n|-\n! \"Fixed-in-space\" axes of rotation\n|| There are [[Cartesian coordinate system|three mutually perpendicular axes]] of rotation for the cube. One set of axes defined in terms of D, U, B, F, L, and R terms can be considered to have a fixed orientation in space. Think of these axes as belonging to a cube-shaped container in which the cube object can be positioned in any of 24 orientations. One axis can be drawn through the centres of the D and U faces (the DU axis). The others are the BF and LR axes.\n|-\n! \"Cube object\" axes of rotation\n|| Another set of axes can be defined for the cube object itself. These axes relate to the face colours, the most common being white, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. The axes are usually white-blue, red-orange, and yellow-green. For odd size cubes, these axes are always fixed relative to the internal frame of the cube object. For even size cubes, these axes remain fixed relative to the internal frame of the cube object after initial selections. The origin for the axes is the centre of the cube object.\n|-\n! Layer rotation\n|| The only way that cube state can be changed is by rotations of cube layers about their axes of rotation. All changes of state involve rotation steps that can be considered as a sequence of single layer quarter turns.\n|-\n! Orbit\n|| For a basic quarter turn of a cube layer for cubes of all sizes, sets-of-four cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories. When all the possible trajectories for a given cubie type are considered for the whole cube, we will refer to all the possible movement positions as being in a given orbit. We consider that the size 3 cube has two orbits, one in which the eight corner cubies are constrained to move and one in which the 12 edge cubies are constrained to move. Transfer of cubies between these orbits is impossible.\n\nFor cubes of size 4 and above, we will also define an edge cubie orbit as comprising 12 cubies, but will use the term complementary orbit to describe a pair of orbits between which edge cubies can move. A pair of complementary edge cubie orbits contains a total of 24 cubies. Cubes of size 4 and above include centre cubie orbits that contain 24 cubies. Transfer of cubies between one such orbit and another is not possible (applies to cubes of size 5 and above).\n|-\n! Move\n|| A move is a quarter turn rotation of a layer or a sequence of such quarter turns that a person would apply as a single step.\n|-\n! Move notation\n|| A clockwise quarter turn of an outer layer is usually expressed as U, D, F, B, L, or R. In other respects the notation used varies among authors. For example, a counterclockwise quarter turn of an outer layer could be expressed as U', D', F', B', L', or R'.\n|-\n! Algorithm\n|| An algorithm defines a sequence of layer rotations to transform a given state to another (usually less scrambled) state. Usually an algorithm is expressed as a printable character sequence according to some move notation. An algorithm can be considered to be a \"smart\" move. All algorithms are moves, but few moves are considered to be algorithms.\n|-\n! [[Permutation group|Permutation]]\n|| A permutation of the cube as used herein means the act of permuting (i.e. rearranging) the positions of cubies. A permutation is an all-inclusive term which includes a sequence of quarter turns of any length. Even the solving of the cube from a scrambled state represents a permutation. The term \"permutation\" is used extensively by mathematicians who use [[Group (mathematics)|Group Theory]] to quantify the process involved in a rearrangement of cubies. \n\nThe term \"permutation\" is also often used to mean the state of the cube that results after it is rearranged, but that meaning will not be used herein. In such cases, the term \"cube state\" will be used. That allows the term \"permutation\" to be used when the permutation results in no change of state - an area of special interest for Rubik\u2019s family cube permutations.\n|-\n! [[Parity (mathematics)|Parity]]\n|| A cube permutation can be represented by a number of swaps of two cubies. If that number is even, the permutation has even parity, and if the number is odd, the permutation has odd parity.\n|}\n\n==Cube types==\n\n=== Hardware cubes ===\nHardware (physical) cubes are based on the original size 3 cube invented by Erno Rubik in 1974. These cubes usually use coloured stickers on the facelets for cubie identification. The [[Rubik's Cube|size 3]] standard Rubik\u2019s cube gained peak interest in the 1980s and was closely followed by the [[Rubik's Revenge|size 4]] (Rubik's Revenge) cube. Other, usually more recently available, hardware forms of the cube come in [[Pocket Cube|size 2]] (Pocket Cube), [[Professor's Cube|size 5]] (Professor's Cube), [[V-Cube 6|size 6]] (V-Cube 6), and [[V-Cube 7|size 7]] (V-Cube 7). Lesser known hardware cubes of larger sizes have also been produced. Currently, the largest hardware cube made is the size 33, and the largest mass-produced is size 17<ref>https://thecubicle.us/yuxin-huanglong-17x17-p-10097.html</ref>.\n\n===Software cubes===\nIn parallel with the hardware form of the cube there are many software forms available that obey the same rules as the hardware forms. Software cube [[emulator]]s are not subject to the physical restraints that impose a size limit on the hardware forms. Hence the only really big cubes available are those in software form. Also, unlike the hardware forms, a range of cube sizes can easily be accommodated by the one program. The design characteristics of programs that allow users to unscramble cubes vary considerably with such features as the capability to allow the user to save a partially unscrambled state being often available.\n\nSoftware cubes were in use in the 1980s when monochrome monitors were in common use. The lack of colour meant a different way of face identification was required. A [[#Large Freeware cubes|program]] that retained 1980s monochrome capability (using numerals 1 to 6 to identify facelets) for cubes in the size 2 to 11 range was produced in 1991 (together with colour capability in the size 2 to 15 range). More recently developed software cubes use coloured facelets as for hardware cubes.\n\nThe most common, but by no means universal, approach is to emulate the cube by providing a \"three-dimensional\" display of the cube that makes it look like a real hardware cube. A drawback of the \"three-dimensional\" display is that, without some extra enhancements, the state of parts of the cube for any given view is hidden.\n\nOther interactive software approaches that do not emulate a three-dimensional cube are also used by some programmers. Generally, an aim of such approaches is to allow the state of all cubies to be in view all the time but has the disadvantage (for some viewers) that the display does not appear like a real-world cube. A conventional two-dimensional (unfolded) display with all cube elements appearing of equal size is one approach. Another form of display where all cube elements do not appear of equal size is also in use. The upper cube size limit for software cubes is limited by the monitor\u2019s available pixels and what viewers find as acceptable which, in turn, is a function of their visual acuity. For cubes of large size it can be advantageous to allow a portion of the cube to be scrolled out of view.\n\nAll emulators provide a means for the user to change the cube state step-by-step and unscramble the cube. Most emulators use mouse movements to control the rotation of the cube elements, others use keyboard commands, and some use a combination of both.\n\nSoftware cubes present some major capabilities that are not possible with hardware cubes. Instant return to the set state is always available. If the program allows a partially unscrambled state to be saved then, by regularly updating the saved state, users need not despair if they do something that leaves their cube in a mess. They can return to their previously recorded state and continue from there. The bigger the cube the more helpful such a capability becomes.\n\nSome [[Freeware]] large cube (size greater than 10) implementations are [[#Large Freeware cubes|available]].\n\n==Cube design variants==\nWhile there are multiple variants in use only two will be considered here: \n* Standard cubes with unmarked centres.\n* Cubes with marked centres.\n\n=== Standard cubes with unmarked centres ===\nA 2-layer (size 2) cube has corner cubies only.\n \nCubes of size 2 and size 3 have single solutions meaning that all the cube elements can have only one correct location for a solved cube.\n \nCentre cubies differ from the corner and edge cubies in that their orientation or position has multiple possibilities. For cubes of odd size, there will be a centre cubie that is centrally located on the cube face and that cubie has only one correct location for a solved cube. However, multiple locations of all other centre cubies apply for a solved cube. The centre cubies (other than the single central one for cubes of odd size) form sets-of-four on each face and sets-of-24 for the whole cube for the various orbits. These centre cubies have four possible final positions (their orientation changes with position but cannot be changed independently) that would satisfy the solved state. \n\n=== Cubes with marked centres ===\nTypically, hardware cubes with marked centres use images or logos on the faces to designate what centre cubie(s) orientation is required for a solved cube. Such cubes are also referred to as \"supercubes\" and the application of markings of this type is generally restricted to just cubes of very small size.\n \nSolving a cube with marked centres is considerably more complex than that for standard cubes. The use of jig-saw style image marking on cubes of large size would make a difficult task even more difficult. Two possibilities in current use on software cubes are the use of a numerical graphic in the \"1\" to \"4\" range and the use of a corner marking graphic. \n\nThere is a direct correspondence between numerical and corner marking. A top left corner quadrant marking is equivalent to a numerical marking 1, second quadrant to 2, third quadrant to 3, and fourth quadrant to 4. The following image illustrates these different forms of marking. \n\n[[File:Num cnr marking.png|thumb|center|364 px]]\n\nBecause transfer of cubies between orbits is impossible, the same 1-2-3-4 markings can be used for each orbit. With the exception of the absolute centre cubies for cubes of odd size, there are 24 centre cubies (4 per face) in each orbit. If <math>n</math> is cube size, there will be <math>\\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-a}{4}</math> orbits where <math>a</math> is zero if <math>n</math> is even or <math>a</math> is one if <math>n</math> is odd. \n\nNumerical marking is typically applicable for cubes up to about size 32. Corner marking while less user-friendly can allow the marked centres range to be extended beyond the numerical marking limit.\n\nExcept for absolute centre marking for cubes of odd size, numerical marking would provide the best means of centre cubie marking for hardware cubes as their size range is limited. Rotation of the numbers would mean a small inconvenience relative to non-rotated numbers that can be used for software cubes. The big advantage of numbers is that they reduce the complexity of solving the last cube face when markings are in use (e.g. if the set-of-four sequence is 1-3-4-2 (even parity, needs two swaps to become the required 1-2-3-4) then the algorithm requirement is clear. Algorithms have been defined in<ref name=\"fraser_marked\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/cube/solving/markctr.pdf \"Implementing and Solving Rubik's Family Cubes with Marked Centres\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and are, of course, equally applicable to hardware cubes.\n\n==Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes==\nA cube is solvable if the set state has existed some time in the past and if no tampering of the cube has occurred (e.g. by rearrangement of stickers on hardware cubes or by doing the equivalent on software cubes).

Those rules limit what arrangements are possible and mean that, of the possible unrestricted cubie arrangements, the number that are unreachable far outnumber those that are reachable.\n\nCubes of all sizes have three mutually perpendicular axes about which one or more layers can be rotated. All moves for the cube can be considered as a sequence of quarter-turn rotations about these axes. The movement possibilities give rise to a set of rules (or laws) which in most cases can be expressed in analytical terms.\n\nFor a cube of size <math>n</math>:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em;\n|Number of corner cubies\n|<math>8</math>\n|-\n|Number of edge cubies\n|<math>12\\left(n-2\\right)</math>\n|-\n|Number of centre cubies\n|<math>6\\left(n-2\\right)^2</math>\n|-\n|Number of facelets\n|<math>6n^2</math>\n|-\n|Total number of cubies\n|<math>6\\left(n-1\\right)^2+2</math>\n|-\n|Increase in total number of cubies for unit increase in cube size from <math>n</math> to <math>\\left(n+1\\right)</math>\n|<math>12n-6</math>\n|}\nEvery cube move can be considered as a permutation. The relationship between the cube state after a move with that before a move can be expressed mathematically using Group Theory<ref name=\"davis_permut\">Tom Davis, [http://www.geometer.org/rubik/group.pdf \"Group Theory via Rubik\u2019s Cube\"].

Since every move can be considered as a sequence of quarter turn rotations, it is appropriate to examine what is involved in a quarter turn rotation. Except for the absolute centre cubie for odd size cubes, during the quarter turn the cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories (also referred to as a 4-cycle movement since four quarter turns will restore the cubies in the specified trajectory to their original positions). A quarter turn of a 4-cubie set can be represented by three swaps as indicated below where swap 1-2 means the contents of cubicle 1 is swapped with the contents of cubicle 2, etc.{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0 auto}}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Start\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | 1/A\n| width=\"50%\" | 2/B\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | 4/D\n| width=\"50%\" | 3/C\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Swap 1-2\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Swap 1-3\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |Swap 1-4\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe parity<ref>Ryan Heise, [http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/parity.html \"Rubik's Cube Theory - Parity\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> of a permutation refers to whether that permutation is even or odd. An even permutation is one that can be represented by an even number of swaps while an odd permutation is one that can be represented by an odd number of swaps. An odd permutation followed by an odd permutation will represent an overall even permutation (adding two odd numbers always returns an even number). Since a quarter turn is made up of a number of 4-cycles each involving three swaps, if the number of 4-cycles is odd, overall parity of the quarter turn permutation will be odd and vice versa.\n\nQuarter turn permutation parity for a size <math>n</math> cube is given in the following table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:45em; text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom\n! style=\"width:15%\" | {{nowrap|Cube size<br />(odd or even)}}\n! style=\"width:15%\" | {{nowrap|Layer type}} \n! style=\"width:35%\" |Number of 4-cycle movements \n! style=\"width:35%\" |Overall parity\n|-\n| odd||inner||<math>n-1</math>||even\n|-\n| odd||outer||<math>\\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-1}{4}+\\left(n-1\\right)</math>||even{{Efn|name=a}}\n|-\n| even||inner||<math>n-1</math>||odd\n|-\n| even||outer|| <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)^2+\\left(n-1\\right)</math> ||even if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even {{Efn|name=b}}\n<br>odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd\n|-\n| colspan=4 |{{notelist|refs={{efn|name=a|Since <math>\\left(n-2\\right)^2-1</math> equals <math>\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(n-3\\right)</math>, a product of two consecutive even numbers, which must always be evenly divisible by 8.}} {{efn|name=b|Since <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)^2</math> will be odd if <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math> is odd (i.e. if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even) giving overall even since <math>(n-1)</math> is odd. The reverse applies if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd.}}}}\n|}\nSummarising the above parity results we conclude:\n* All permutations for odd size cubes have even overall parity.\n* All individual quarter turns for even size cubes, where half the cube size is an odd number, have odd overall parity.\n* For even size cubes where half the cube size is an even number, inner layer quarter turns have odd overall parity and outer layer quarter turns have even overall parity.\n\nThe above analysis considered the parity for corner (where applicable), edge and centre cubies combined. It is possible to consider these in isolation and when that is done an even combined quarter turn parity will involve a number of odd parity elements.\n\nStandard cubes (i.e. cubes with unmarked centres) of any size greater than 3 behave exactly like the size 3 cube if only outer layer rotations are permitted. Parity rules dictate that, for cubes of odd size, the swapping of the two cubies in a single edge set requires a change in the position of centre cubies. It can be shown<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /> that, for the size 4 cube the swapping and inverting of the two complementary cubies in a single edge set can be achieved without any change in the position of any other cubies. It can also be shown that, for cubes of even size 6 and above, the swapping of the two cubies in a single edge set requires a change in the position of centre cubies.\n\nA permutation as used here takes account of the change in the positions of cubies, not any change in their orientations. For the 24 edge cubie sets (made up of 12 complementary pairs) there is no restriction on position. Orientation is set by position and cannot be changed independently of position.\n\nCorner cubies behave the same for cubes of all sizes. They have three possible orientations made up from a combination of <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> twists where a full twist (about an axis drawn from the cube corner to the cubie's internal corner) returns the corner cubie to its original orientation. If we designate a unit clockwise twist by <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> and a unit counter-clockwise twist by <math>-\\frac{1}{3}</math>, then the twist possibilities for a corner cubie relative to any given initial state (the set state for example) are 0, <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> and <math>-\\frac{1}{3}</math>. The sum of the twist increments across all corner cubies must always be an integer (0, 1 or 2).\n\nWhen inner layer rotations are included for cubes of size greater than 3, some of the edge cubie movement limitations mentioned above no longer apply. These are expanded on in the [[#Final layer problems|Final layer problems]] section.\n\nCubie position and orientation are of special concern when unscrambling the final layer. Edge cubies must always end up in exactly the same positions they occupied in the initial set state before scrambling. If any edge cubie in a given edge set in the final layer has a wrong orientation (only applicable to cubes of size greater than 3), it must be in a wrong position and will need to be swapped with a complementary edge cubie also having wrong orientation. With everything else in place, corner cubies can be in the right position but two or more can have incorrect orientation. For standard cubes of size greater than 3, there is a negligible possibility that centre cubies (other than absolute centre cubies for cubes of odd size) will occupy the same positions they had in the initial set state (assuming the centre cubies are unmarked).\n\nBoth even and odd size cubes with either marked or unmarked centres obey the rule: \"Any permutation that results in only a rearrangement of centre cubies in 24 cubie orbits must have even parity\".\n\nIf permutations of facelets rather than cubies are considered then both position and orientation of cubies will be taken into account. For software cubes, the states (six colour possibilities) of the <math>6n^2</math> facelets (in a <math>6\\times n\\times n</math> array for instance) is what would allow complete information on cube state to be saved for later use.\n\nA cube of any size that is subject to repeats of the same permutation will eventually return to the state (e.g. the set state) it occupied before the first application of the permutation.<ref name=\"davis_permut\" /><ref name=\"davis_gptheory\" /> The number of times that a permutation has to be applied to first return the cube to its initial state is referred to as the order or the cycle length of the permutation and is applicable to cubes of all sizes. An overall permutation that results in no change of state is referred to as an Identity Permutation. A program that allows permutation cycle length of any size cube to be determined is available<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/unravelcube.htm \"Unravelling Cubes of Size 2x2x2 and Above\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and sample cycle length results have been documented.<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /> For a given permutation, cycle length can vary according to:\n* Cube size.\n* Initial cube state (for standard cubes with unmarked centres).\n* Cube style (whether standard or marked centres are in use).\n* Spatial orientation (checking all 24 of these rather than just one may give a different result).\n\nThe parity of an Identity Permutation is always even. That result for cubes of odd size is obviously true since every quarter turn has even parity. The result is less obvious for cubes of even size. For cubes of even size if the scrambling permutation relative to the previous set state is odd, then any permutation to solve the cube must also have odd parity and vice versa.\n\nThe generalized number of possible states for a size <math>n</math> cube is considered in the [[#Reachable states for cubes of all sizes|Reachable states for cubes of all sizes]] section.\n\n==Cube solving==\n\n===Solving by people===\nCube solving involves starting with a scrambled cube and applying step-by-step layer rotations to eventually end up with a solved cube. For cubes with unmarked centres that means all faces would need to appear in uniform colour. For cubes with marked centres a unique arrangement of all centre cubies in addition to the uniform colour requirement would need to apply. Since the starting point is always different, there can never be a unique set of rotations that can be applied to solve a cube. Usually, people work through the solution with the possible use of [[algorithms]], mainly in the latter stage of the unscrambling. In theory, it is possible for a person to write a computer program that \"thinks\" like a human and solves the cube without human intervention (refer to the [[#Solving by computer program|Solving by computer program]] section).\n\nThe aim of most software cube emulators is to provide a means for the user to interact with the program to solve (unscramble) the cube in a similar manner to the way they would unscramble a hardware cube.\n\nEfficient rotation sequences (algorithms) can be developed using Group Theory permutation mathematics. However, there are many references to the relevant rotation sequences required to solve cubes of small size (refer to some for size 3, 4, and 5 cubes<ref>Peter Still, [http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/rubikscubesolution.html \"Beginner Solution to the Rubik's Cube\"].

The steps involved in solving any cube of size greater than 4 are fairly straightforward extensions of those required to solve size 3 and size 4 cubes. However, there is limited availability of generalized instructions that can be applied for solving cubes of any size (particularly the large ones). Generalized guidance on one way of solving standard cubes<ref name=\"fraser_solving_unmarked\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/cube/solving/cubesolving.pdf \"Instructions for Solving Cubes of Various Sizes\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and cubes with marked centres<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> of all sizes is available.\n\nAnybody who can solve a size 4 cube should be able to solve cubes of larger size provided they accept an increased time-to-solve penalty. Software design features, unavailable in hardware cubes, can simplify the cube solving process. For a given set of cube design features the complexity (difficulty) of solving a Rubik\u2019s family cube increases if the number of reachable states increases. Three main properties affect that number:\n# Cube size: The number of cubies to be placed is a [[Quadratic function|quadratic (second order polynomial) function]] of cube size and therefore has a major influence on cube solving complexity.\n# Odd or even size: Even size cubes have an additional effect to just cube size that adds complexity relative to odd size cubes. This effect is relatively small and is independent of cube size (the added contribution when cube size changes from <math>n</math> to <math>\\left(n+1\\right)</math> for <math>n</math> odd is constant). This effect will be expanded upon when the number of reachable states is considered later.\n# Unmarked or marked centre cubies: Centre cubie marking adds complexity to cube solving.\n\nAdditional algorithms to assist users to solve the size 3<ref>Matthew Monroe, [http://www.alchemistmatt.com/cube/rubikcenter.html \"How to handle pictures or logos on the faces\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and to solve any size<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> cube with marked centres have been defined.\n\n===Large cube issues===\nLarge cube emulators claimed to cater for cubes up to and beyond size 100 are available. Irrespective of what upper size limit is claimed, available pixels (that vary according to the monitor in use) and the user's visual acuity are going to impose practical limits on the maximum cube size that a person can handle.\n\nAs indicated in the [[#Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes|Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes]] section, total number of cubies is <math>\\left\\{6\\left(n-1\\right)^2+2\\right\\}</math>, and the number of centre cubies is <math>6\\left(n-2\\right)^2</math>, where <math>n</math> is cube size. For large size cubes, the number of centre cubies becomes very dominant as indicated below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Cube size:\n| width=\"10%\" |4|| width=\"10%\" |8|| width=\"10%\" |16|| width=\"10%\" |32|| width=\"10%\" |64\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Total cubies:\n| width=\"10%\" |56|| width=\"10%\" |296|| width=\"10%\" |1352|| width=\"10%\" |5768|| width=\"10%\" |23816\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Centre cubie proportion of total cubies (%):\n| width=\"10%\" |42.8|| width=\"10%\" |73.0|| width=\"10%\" |87.0|| width=\"10%\" |93.6|| width=\"10%\" |96.8\n|}\n\nIt follows that placement of centre cubies will become increasingly more significant than the placement of other cubies as cube size is increased. The time to solve a cube will rise dramatically with cube size. For example, there are about 24 times as many cubies to place in a size 16 cube than there are in a size 4 cube. If the average time to place a cubie were the same in both cases, that factor of 24 in time would also apply. The 24 factor is likely to be an under-estimation, because the presence of a large number of cubies makes it more difficult (and time-consuming) to identify what belongs where.\n\nProviding a software program that allows the state of cubes of big size to be changed is not much more difficult than doing the same thing for cubes of small size. However, solving big cubes is a much more demanding and time-consuming task than doing the same for small cubes. Therefore, it is likely that most really big software cubes that are available have never been solved.\n\nIdentifying the exact locations to look for cubies (mainly the quadruple centre cubie sets) is a major issue for big cubes. Use of a secondary marker grid<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\" /> can ease identification. For example, a marker grid to form 4\u00d74 segments for a size 16 cube (16 such segments per face) could be used.\n\nA common set of six cubie colours adopted for both hardware cubes and software cubes comprises white, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. This colour set may be non-optimum for software cubes of large size where the number of pixels per cubie is small. For instance, the differentiation between white and yellow may be problematic. Reducing the number of colors in the red to blue range from five to four and adding violet (the colour at the extreme of the\n[[visible spectrum]]) produces a colour set that may be considered more suitable for cubes of large size. Some software cube implementations allow users to change the default colour set, if desired. This is a useful addition for users whose colour perception is at variance with the norm.\n\n===Solving by computer program===\nCube solving by computer program<ref>Eric Dietz(deceased), [http://cubex.sourceforge.net/ \"Rubik's Cube Solver\"]. Retrieved\n2017-02-24.</ref> (as distinct from the normal way people solve a cube) for small size (e.g. size 3) cubes has been developed, and it is equally easy to solve large size cubes by computer.\n\n===Final layer problems===\nA \"final layer problem\" is defined here to mean a need for a rearrangement of final layer edge cubies that cannot be achieved using standard size 3 cube moves. These are often referred to as parity problems or errors, but such terminology may be misleading. If moves were limited to those available to the size 3 cube, such states would be unreachable (break parity rules). There are numerous variations in the way the final layer problems are presented and the algorithms to resolve them, but the correction requirement will be similar to that described below. The problems considered here apply equally to standard cubes and to those with marked centres but in the latter case additional final layer issues arise for aligning centre cubies. The problems for larger cubes can be considered as straightforward extensions of those that apply to the size 4 cube. Basically, two types of problem can arise:\n* There is a need to flip a complementary pair or a complete set of edge cubies in the final edge set. This condition will be referred to as an OLL (orientation of last layer) requirement.\n* There is a need to swap the positions of two edge cubie sets in the final layer. This condition will be referred to as a PLL (permutation of last layer) requirement.\n\nOLL and PLL as used here can be considered to be sub-sets of the [[Fridrich Method|usual definitions]] of these terms. There are many references to moves that can be used to resolve these problems. Fewer references<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /><ref>Chris Hardwick, [http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve3.html \"Fix parity for 4x4x4 cube\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> demonstrate how these moves satisfy parity rules. From a parity perspective, there is a need to consider the rearrangement of centre cubies which is not readily observable in cubes with unmarked centres. Only OLL parity compliance will be illustrated here.\n\nA typical OLL correction for a size 9 cube is shown. The cubies shown in colour are the only ones in the cube that change positions.\n{| style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:OLL before correction.png|thumb|center|250px|OLL before correction for size 9 cube]]\n| style=\"width:20px\" | \n|[[File:OLL after correction.png|thumb|center|250px|OLL after correction for size 9 cube]]\n|}\nFor the OLL correction there are <math>n-2</math> centre cubie swaps and overall there are <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> swaps when the edge pair is included. For odd size cubes <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> is always even (and conforms with the universal even parity requirement for odd size cubes). For even size cubes <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> is always odd which means in this case a parity reversal always occurs, an allowable parity condition for even size cubes.\n\nFor the complete edge set flip (a requirement that can arise only for cubes of even size), the number of swaps will be <math>\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math>. The overall number of swaps will be even if <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math> is even (i.e. <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd). The overall number of swaps will be odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even. Hence overall parity will be even if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd and odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even.\n\nThe parity of a given algorithm can, of course, also be deduced from its content using the rules detailed in the [[#Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes|Rules for Rubik\u2019s family cubes]] section.\n\nFor standard cubes the rearrangement of centre cubies to resolve the OLL and PLL problems is unimportant. For cubes with marked centre cubies the effect of this rearrangement of these cubies is a serious drawback. For cubes with marked centres it is not possible (except for the size 4 cube) to align all final layer centre cubies until all edge cubies have been placed in their final positions.\n\n===Algorithms===\nInstructions for people on how to solve Rubik's type cubes are normally conveyed either in purely graphical form or as sequences defined using a printable character notation. A character sequence that can be translated and applied to perform a sequence of layer rotations to transform a given state to another (usually less scrambled) state is often referred to as an [[Algorithms|algorithm]]. Algorithms are most commonly used when unscrambling the latter portion of the cube but can be applied more extensively if desired. Algorithms can be written down as instructions that can be memorized or looked up in a document. The printable characters used (e.g. to indicate an anticlockwise quarter turn, a single layer quarter turn, or a multiple layer quarter turn) in algorithm instructions vary among authors, as does their positions in the instructions. Where people interpret instructions the way they are presented is insignificant. The only time the form of presentation has significance is when computer keyboard entry is used to change the state of software cubes, and automatic updating of the screen image occurs whenever a valid instruction is received. For example, if F\u2032 is used to represent an anticlockwise quarter turn of the front face, then, as the user types in F, a clockwise quarter turn will occur, and a correction will be needed when the user types the \u2032 character. The end result will still be correct, but use of \u2212F rather than F\u2032 would eliminate the superfluous rotation. Any text enhancements, such as superscripts or subscripts, must be avoided in the method of presenting cube rotation sequences when users communicate with software cubes via keyboard commands. When computer keyboard entry of instructions is used, [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] (which map a short input text string to a longer string) can be used<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\" /><ref name=\"fraser_solving_unmarked\" /><ref>Tom Davis, [http://www.geometer.org/rubik/ \"Rubik Test Release\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> as algorithm shortcuts.\n\n===Time to solve cubes===\nSpeedcubing (or speedsolving) is the practice of solving a cube in the Rubik's cube family in the shortest time possible (which usually implies reducing the number of quarter turn moves required). It is most commonly applied to cubes of small size, and there are numerous solving methods that have been documented. An international team of researchers using computer power from Google has found every way the standard size 3 Rubik's cube can be solved and have shown that it is possible to complete the solution in 20 moves or fewer<ref>Tomas Rokicki, Herbert Kociemba, Morley Davidson, and John Dethridge, [http://www.cube20.org/ \"God's Number is 20\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> for any initial scrambled state (where a move here is defined as a quarter or a half turn of a face). Generally, speed solving methods apply more to specialist cubists than typical cubists and are more complex than simple layer-by-layer type methods used by most other people.\n\n==Reachable and unreachable states for cubes of all sizes==\nIf a cube has at some previous time occupied the set state, then any state that can arise after legal moves is considered to be a reachable state. For small size cubes (size 2, 3, or 4), an unreachable state is one that cannot be reached by legal moves. For larger cubes, there needs to be some further qualification on what is meant by an unreachable state. In this article, notional movement between 24-cubie orbits for edge and for centre cubies is excluded.\n\n===Relationship between reachable and unreachable states===\nIf, for a cube of any size, ''m'' represents the number of reachable states, ''u'' represents the number of unreachable states, and ''t'' equals their sum:\n\n:<math>t=u+m</math>\n:<math>t=km</math> where <math>k</math> is a positive integer\n:<math>u=\\left(k-1\\right)m</math>\n\nBoth ''m'' and ''k'' are functions of cube size <math>n</math>. Values for ''m'' and ''k'' will be considered in the following sections. In other texts, \"reachable states\" are often referred to as \"permutations\".\n\n===Reachable states for cubes of all sizes===\nThe number of reachable states is based on:\n* Standard ''permutations and combinations mathematics''.<ref name=\"mason\">Oliver Mason, [http://www.hamilton.ie/ollie/EE304/Counting.pdf \"Some Simple Counting Rules, EE304 - Probability and Statistics\"].

These constants are in agreement with figures frequently quoted for the size 3 and size 4 cubes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=\"58%\" align=\"left\" | Corner cubie possibilities for even size cubes\n| width=\"4%\"  | P\n| width=\"13%\"  | (7!) 3<sup>6</sup>\n| width=\"25%\"  | 3.67416000000000 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Central edge cubie possibilities for odd size cubes, multiplied by 24\n| Q\n| 24 (12!) 2<sup>10</sup>\n| 1.17719433216000 \u00d7 10<sup>13</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Edge cubie possibilities for each dual set (12 pairs)\n| R\n| 24!\n| 6.20448401733239 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Centre cubie possibilities for each quadruple set (6 groups of 4)\n| S\n| (24!)/(4!)<sup>6</sup>\n| 3.24667053711000 \u00d7 10<sup>15</sup>\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"font-size:88%\" | Note: ! is the [[factorial]] symbol (N! means the product 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 N).\n|}\n\nThe value of S may warrant a word of explanation as it is commonly inferred that the number of possible states for centre cubies with identifying markings for a size 4 cube is 24!. Use of that value is guaranteed to yield the wrong answer if cubes with marked centres are under consideration. The first 20 cubies can be arbitrarily placed giving rise to factor 24!/4!. However, for each possible arrangement of edge cubies, only half the 4! hypothetical arrangements for the last four are reachable.<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /><ref name=\"fraser_states\" /> Hence the correct value for the cube with marked centres is 24!/2. If the markings are removed, then a \"permutation with some objects identical\"<ref name=\"mason\" /> applies. For the standard cube the marked cube value needs to be divided by (4!)<sup>6</sup>/2 (the 2 divisor must also be applied here). That gives an overall S value for the size 4 cube of 24!/(4!)<sup>6</sup>. All states for 24-centre-cubie orbits for standard Rubik\u2019s family cubes are reachable (if required, even parity is always achievable by swapping the positions of a couple of centre cubies of the same colour).\n\n:<math>m = \\textrm{P}\\textrm{Q}^a\\textrm{R}^b\\textrm{S}^c</math>\n::where <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> are positive integer [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] (functions of cube size <math>n</math>) as given below.\n::<math>a = n \\textrm{ mod }2</math> (i.e. 0 if <math>n</math> is even or 1 if <math>n</math> is odd)\n::<math>b = \\frac{n-2-a}{2}</math>\n::<math>c = \\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-a}{4}</math>\n\nFor even size cubes <math>\\textrm{Q}^a = 1</math> (see [[exponentiation]]).\n\nFor further simplification, parameter <math>m</math> may also be expressed as <math>m = 10^y</math> where <math>y=\\textrm{log}_{10}m</math>.

The difference is imperceptible except when plotted over a small range of <math>n</math>, as indicated in the graphs reproduced below. Only Rubik\u2019s family values for <math>n</math> equal to 2 and 3 are included in the second graph.\n{| style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n| [[File:Logplot 2to16.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n| width=\"20px\" |\n| [[File:logplot vertex.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n|}\n\nUse of the log function ''y'' provides the only practical means of plotting numbers that vary over such a huge range as that for the Rubik's cube family. The difference between the curves translates as a factor of 505.08471690483 (equal to <math>\\frac{\\textrm{R}^{0.5}\\textrm{S}^{0.25}}{\\textrm{Q}}</math>). This is the factor that defines the effect of even size, relative to odd size, on the number of reachable states for cubes with unmarked centres.\n\nHence, with the logarithmic presentation the number of cube states can be expressed using just four<ref>Math reference, [https://www.reference.com/math/non-integer-6b374df18d851eea \"non-integer\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> numbers (A, B, and the two C values). Furthermore, the number of cube states form a restricted set of values for a more general continuous quadratic (parabolic) function for which <math>n</math> can have non-integer and negative values. Calculating the value of ''m'' from the corresponding value of ''y'' is a straightforward process.\n\nCentre cubies are different from corner or edge cubies in that, unless they have indicative markings, there are multiple possibilities for their final orientation and/or locations. The number of different ways centre cubies can be arranged to yield a solved cube with unmarked centre cubies may be of interest. To calculate that, the impact of centre cubie marking needs to be assessed. Define <math>m_\\textrm{M}</math>, <math>\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M}</math>, and <math>\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M}</math> to be the changed parameters for marked centre cubies (P and R remain unchanged).\n\n:<math>\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{T Q}</math> where <math>\\textrm{T} = \\frac{4^6}{2} = 2048 </math>\n:<math>\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{V S}</math> where <math>\\textrm{V} = \\frac{(4!)^6}{2} = 95551488 </math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{P}\\left(\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M}\\right)^a\\textrm{R}^b\\left(\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M}\\right)^c</math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = m_\\textrm{D}m</math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{T}^a\\textrm{V}^c</math>\n\nParameter <math>m_\\textrm{M}</math> defines the number of reachable states for cubes with marked centres. Factor <math>m_\\textrm{D}</math> gives the number of different arrangements of unmarked centre cubies that will provide a solved size <math>n</math> cube. It is also the factor by which the number of different states for a standard cube needs to be multiplied by when marked centres apply.\n\n===Unreachable states for cubes of all sizes===\nThe number of unreachable states far exceeds the number of reachable states. There are many references to the number of unreachable states for the size 3 cube but very few for larger size cubes.\n\nThe unreachable arrangements for corner and edge cubies are the same for cubes with or without marked centres.\n\nIf a corner cubie for cubes of any size is considered, then a 1/3 twist clockwise leaving everything else unchanged will represent an unreachable state, and similarly for a 1/3 twist counter-clockwise. Hence only 1/3 of the twist possibilities are reachable.\n\nFor the central edge cubie for odd size cubes the behaviour is the same as that for the size 3 cube. Only half the conceivable positions are reachable and only half the conceivable orientations are reachable. Hence only 1/4 of the central edge cubie movement possibilities are reachable.\n\n[[File:Edge cube reach unreach 1.png|thumb|center|554px]]\nEdge cubies that comprise 12 complementary pairs (24 cubies total) behave as if the complementary cubies did not look the same. Any given edge cubie can move to any position in the 24-cubie orbit but for any given position there is one reachable and one unreachable orientation for that cubie. The reverse applies for the complementary edge cubie. For a given cubie (1-2) the reachable and unreachable orientations for a given face for a given orbit for a size 8 cube is illustrated below. One of the 24 reachable possibilities for a given edge cubie matches that of the set cube.\n\nThe number of unreachable states for a 24-edge-cubie set is the same as the number of reachable states (24! in each case).\n\nIn the case of the marked centre cubies only half the conceivable arrangements for each set of 24 cubies for any given orbit are reachable.<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> The same parity rules that apply for marked centre cubies also apply for the unmarked centre cubies. A quarter turn of a set-of-four centre cubies cannot be achieved without changing the arrangement elsewhere to meet the parity requirement. Because there are 95551488 ways of arranging the individual centre cubies so that the resulting arrangement appears exactly the same, parity rules can be met without any observable indication of how the parity compliance is achieved. Hence, for the normal case (24 cubies comprising four of each of six colours) there is no restriction on the achievable states for the centre cubies.\n\nThe following table uses the values noted above to represent the ''k'' component factors for the size <math>n</math> cube.

Yarmouth is the [[shire town]] of [[Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth County]] and is the largest population centre in the region.\n\nLong connected to [[fishing]] due to its proximity to [[Georges Bank]], the town is located in the heart of the world's largest [[lobster fishing]] grounds and as a result receives Canada's largest lobster landings each year.<ref>[http://www.townofyarmouth.ca/ Town of Yarmouth website]</ref>\n\n==History==\nOriginally inhabited by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], the region was known as \"Keespongwitk\" meaning \"Lands End\" due to its geographic isolation being located at the southwestern tip of the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]].<ref>[http://bayoffundy.com/articles/yarmouth-lands-end/ Yarmouth: Lands End - Bay of Fundy]</ref><ref name=\"Names\"/>\n\nThe region may have possibly been visited by [[Leif Ericson]]. An object known as the [[Yarmouth Runic Stone]] was found at the nearby village of [[Overton, Nova Scotia|Overton]] in 1812.

[[John Patch]], the son of a Yarmouth sea captain, developed and built one of the first modern [[screw propeller]] driven ships in 1832 (4 years before [[John Ericsson]]'s patent). First demonstrated in Yarmouth Harbour during the summer of 1833, Patch was unsuccessful in a [[patent]] application in that year, but he continued to improve his propeller and received an American patent in 1849<ref>Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions'' Goose Lane Publishing (2001) p. 58-59</ref> which drew praise in American scientific circles.<ref>[http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033 \"Patch's Propeller\", ''Scientific American'', Vol. 4, No. 5 (October 10, 1848)  p. 33, featured in ''The Archimedes Screw'' website retrieved 31 January 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174319/http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033|date=8 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> However, by 1849 there were multiple competing versions of the screw propeller.

The town's first railway was the locally owned [[Western Counties Railway]] which was built from Yarmouth to [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] in the 1870s.  It eventually was merged into the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]] (DAR), with a network extending into the [[Annapolis Valley]], [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]]; the DAR later became a subsidiary of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR).  The [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] was built along the south shore linking Yarmouth with [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]], [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia|Bridgewater]] and [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] in the early 20th century; the H&SW was eventually merged into the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR).  While iron-hulled steamships had led to the decline of Yarmouth's once-thriving wooden shipbuilding industry, they also made the port a vital connection between Nova Scotia's rail lines and steamships destined for [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]].  Rail services were abandoned to Yarmouth in stages, beginning in 1982 (CNR) and ending in 1990 (CPR).\n\n===Steamships and ferries===\n[[Tourism]] has been a major industry in Yarmouth since the 1880s when [[Loran Ellis Baker]] founded the Yarmouth Steamship Company. Steamship and railway promotion based in Yarmouth created the first tourism marketing in Nova Scotia.<ref>Jay White, [http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/tourism/early.asp?Language=English \"Canada's Ocean Playground: The Tourism Industry in Nova Scotia, 1870-1970\"], ''Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management''</ref>\nBaker's steamships operated between Yarmouth and Boston until 1900, when the company was purchased by the Dominion Atlantic Railway. The DAR and [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] offered connections for passengers arriving in Yarmouth with steamship services operating to New York City and Boston.\n\nIn 1939, examiners at Yarmouth's Merchant Marine Institution made seafaring history by issuing master's papers to [[Molly Kool]], the first female ship captain in the Western World.\n\nSteamship connections between Yarmouth and Boston / New York were maintained by [[Eastern Steamship Lines]] but were suspended with the start of [[World War II]]; the [[SS Yarmouth Castle|SS ''Yarmouth Castle'']] was one of many vessels which served this route. The service resumed a few years after the war with the S.S. Yarmouth, under the same company.  This service continued into the mid 1950s and was then replaced with the M.V. Bluenose.\n\n====CNR, CN Marine and Marine Atlantic====\nFollowing the war, as the economy of western Nova Scotia improved, the need for a year-round daily service was made evident. The service was needed as a more timely route for transport of goods between markets in Nova Scotia and the United States. Demand increased for passenger traffic as well.  This led citizens of southwestern Nova Scotia to undertake an extensive lobbying effort with the federal government to establish a [[ferry]] service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] connecting Yarmouth with a port in New England.  In 1949 the [[Canadian Maritime Commission]] began to study the possibility of a ferry service connecting with a port in the US. After some controversy as to whether to return to the traditional Boston or New York service, a decision was made to focus the effort on a service from Yarmouth to [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]].  In 1954 the federal government contracted [[Davie Shipbuilding]] to construct [[MV Bluenose|MV ''Bluenose'']] which was launched in 1955 and began service in 1956 under the management of [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) and later (1977-1982) under the management of a federal [[Crown corporation]] named [[CN Marine]].\n\nIn 1978 CN Marine started operating [[MV Marine Evangeline|MV ''Marine Evangeline'']] on a service from Yarmouth to [[Portland, Maine]].  In 1982 the old ''Bluenose'' was retired from the Bar Harbor service and sold.  CN Marine replaced her with a newer vessel [[MV Stena Jutlandica|MV ''Stena Jutlandica'']] which was renamed MV ''Bluenose'' to prevent confusion in tourism marketing literature.\n\nIn 1986 CN Marine was reorganized into the Crown corporation [[Marine Atlantic]] and in 1997 the federal government decided to end its financial support for the Gulf of Maine ferry service, soliciting proposals from private sector ferry companies to operate the route.\n\n====Lion Ferry, Prince of Fundy Cruises, Scotia Prince Cruises====\nThe growth of post-war automobile-based tourism saw the provincial government encourage additional ferry service with New England, a region with many family connections to the [[Maritimes]] dating to the 18th century and which accelerated during the first half of the 20th century.  In 1970 the MV ''Bluenose'' service operated by CNR was joined by the [[MS Prince of Fundy|MS ''Prince of Fundy'']] on a route connecting Yarmouth with [[Portland, Maine]] operated by [[Lion Ferry]].  The service was supplemented between 1973-1976 by [[MS Bolero|MS ''Bolero'']], however by 1976 both vessels were replaced by the [[MS Caribe|MS ''Caribe'']].  Lion Ferry sold Yarmouth's second ferry service to [[Scotia Prince Cruises|Prince of Fundy Cruises]] who purchased [[MS Stena Olympica|MS ''Stena Olympica'']] and renamed it MS ''Scotia Prince''.  The service underwent another ownership change in 2000 and was renamed [[Scotia Prince Cruises]].  In 2004 the company discovered toxic mould in its Portland terminal, owned by the City of Portland, canceling its 2005 season.  The City of Portland subsequently canceled the company's lease and evicted Scotia Prince Cruises, thus ending this ferry service.\n\n====Bay Ferries====\n[[File:The cat ferry.jpg|thumb|HSC ''The Cat'' in Yarmouth Harbour]]\nIn 1997 [[Bay Ferries]], a subsidiary of [[Northumberland Ferries Limited]], was the successful bidder for the federal government's Gulf of Maine ferry service.  Only the operating licence was transferred as well as the right to be the primary user of the federal government-owned ferry terminals in Yarmouth and Bar Harbor; the service would receive no subsidy from the federal government.  Bay Ferries purchased MV ''Bluenose'' from Marine Atlantic and used that vessel for the remainder of the 1997 season before selling it.\n\nIn 1998 Bay Ferries introduced the first [[high speed catamaran]] passenger-vehicle ferry service in North America when it purchased [[HSC INCAT 046|HSC ''Incat 046'']] from [[Incat]] in an aggressive bid to expand the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service.  Throughout the 1990s the market for ferry services in southwestern Nova Scotia was threatened by significant expansions of 4-lane expressways in northern Nova Scotia and across southern [[New Brunswick]] so it was theorized that the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service could maintain market share if the ferry voyage time was shortened.  Marketed as \"The Cat\", the use of the ferry service grew largely due to Bay Ferries' investment and the novelty of riding the ultra-modern high speed catamaran.  In 2002 Bay Ferries traded in HSC ''Incat 046'' for a larger vessel [[HSC The Cat|HSC ''The Cat'']] which was also marketed as \"The Cat\".  Beginning in 2003, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' during the winter months on services in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nFollowing the end of the service offered by [[Scotia Prince Cruises]] in 2004, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' in 2006 between Yarmouth to Portland, in addition to Bar Harbor; the old Portland ferry terminal being replaced by the newly built [[Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal]].  Following a decline in American tourism to Nova Scotia, as well as record-high fuel prices, Bay Ferries sought subsidies from the federal and provincial governments for its Gulf of Maine ferry service.  The federal government refused to provide a subsidy, having removed itself from operating such a service in 1997.  However, the provincial government offered a subsidy to cover the operating loss and this was subsequently provided in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  In 2009 the provincial government canceled the subsidy and Bay Ferries announced in December 2009 that it was ending its ferry service and sold the vessel.<ref name=\"ferry\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/12/18/ns-yarmouth-ferry-ends.html |title=Yarmouth ferry service ends. |publisher=cbc.ca |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 | work=CBC News}}</ref>\n\n====Nova Star Cruises====\nIn 2013 the provincial government posted a request for proposals for re-establishing a Yarmouth - Maine ferry service, stating that a successful proponent would receive a $21 million subsidy over a 7-year period.  In September 2013 it was announced that [[Nova Star Cruises]] was the successful proponent and in November 2013 it was confirmed that the service would start May 1, 2014 with the [[MV Nova Star|MV ''Nova Star'']] offering daily round trips between Yarmouth and Portland.  Nova Star Cruises also announced it was examining the possibility of using the vessel during the winter months on a service between [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] bypassing the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]]. Nova Star's contract to provide ferry services between Yarmouth and Portland was not renewed for 2016.<ref><http://novastarcruises.com/></ref>\n\n====Return of ''The Cat''====\n[[File:The Cat ferry Yarmouth 2016.jpg|thumb|''The Cat'' leaving Yarmouth Harbour in 2016]]\nOn March 24, 2016, [[Bay Ferries|Bay Ferries Limited]] announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy for a multi-year [[Bareboat charter|charter]] of [[HST-2]].  The vessel will be operated for a passenger/vehicle ferry service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth. The service and vessel will be branded as ''The CAT'' to align with the previous branding used by Bay Ferries. The vessel underwent a refit at a shipyard in [[South Carolina]] and the service began on June 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/05/25/cat-ferry-expected-to-start-service-mid-june/|title=The Cat expected to start ferry service in Maine in mid-June - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram|date=25 May 2016|work=pressherald.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalmariner.com/Web-Bulletin-2016/US-Navy-to-lease-high-speed-transport-to-Bay-Ferries/|title=US Navy to lease high-speed transport to Bay Ferries - Professional Mariner - Web Bulletin 2016|work=professionalmariner.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/06/16/news/portland/high-speed-ferry-begins-service-in-portland/|title=High-speed ferry begins service in Portland|first=Cbs|last=13|work=bangordailynews.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the first year of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yarmouth was selected as the location for a [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] (BCATP) facility. [[RCAF Station Yarmouth]] was originally opened in 1940 as three separate training sites (the East Camp, the West Camp and the Air Base).\n\nThe East Camp was home to a detachment of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s No. 34 [[Operational conversion unit|Operational Training Unit]] (from [[RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge]]), who trained bomber crews, as well as the [[Royal Navy]]'s No. 1 Naval Air Gunners School who were located at Yarmouth from 1 January 1943 to 30 March 1945.\n\nThe West Camp was home to an [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] Anti-Submarine Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron and several Eastern Air Command Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons, such as [[No. 162 Squadron RCAF|162 Squadron]].\n\nThe Air Base was home to the 9th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery, various RCAF and RAF Bomber Squadrons and an Army Co-operation Reconnaissance Flight. Its primary function was as an administrative and logistical support base to the RAF and RCAF squadrons in the area, in addition to providing a Weather Information Section, an Armament Section and a [[Shooting range|firing range]].\n\nA [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson bomber]] from Royal Canadian Air Force Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron 113 in Yarmouth became the first aircraft of RCAF's Eastern Air Command to destroy a submarine, sinking [[German submarine U-754|U-754]] about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} south of Yarmouth on July 31, 1942. The sinking resulted in 43 casualties and no survivors.<ref>''The Creation of a National Air Force'' W.A.B. Douglas, (University of Toronto Press, 1986) p. 520</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller installations associated with RCAF Station Yarmouth were located in southwestern Nova Scotia, including a [[bombing range]] at [[Port Maitland, Nova Scotia|Port Maitland]], a fuel depot at [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]], and radar detachments at [[Plymouth, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Plymouth]], [[Tusket, Nova Scotia|Tusket]], [[Bear Point, Nova Scotia|Bear Point]], [[Port Mouton, Nova Scotia|Port Mouton]] and [[Rockville, Nova Scotia|Rockville]]. In 1944, a detachment of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] briefly came to Yarmouth to test the effectiveness of a [[blimp]] service. After a crash, the RCAF decided against this venture.\n\nRCAF Station Yarmouth closed in 1945. The airfield was sold to the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]] in 1946 and became the [[Yarmouth Airport]]. A [[Canadian Army]] training camp (known as Camp 60) on Parade Street also provided basic and artillery training for 20,000 soldiers during the war.<ref>''RCAF Yarmouth East camp/West Camp'' Hank Reed, (East Camp Veterans, Yarmouth, 1996)</ref>\n\n[[File:YarmouthNS FishingBoats.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing boats in Yarmouth]]\n\n==Culture==\nThe Western Branch of the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] is located in Yarmouth. The town is also home to the [[Yarmouth County Museum & Archives]] which preserves the history of the town and surrounding county and operates the Killam Brothers building on the waterfront. The Firefighters Museum, part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system and the privately run Sweeney Fisheries Museum are also located in Yarmouth.\n\nThe [[Izaak Walton Killam]] Memorial house, founded in 1963, serves as the town's public library.  It is the largest branch of [[Western Counties Regional Library]] and houses the regional library's headquarters.\n\nThe Yarmouth Arts Regional Council was established in 1974, under the leadership of Lydia Davison, a local music teacher. Over the next five years, with the assistance of the [[Canada Council]] and many volunteers, the Yarmouth Arts Regional Centre (Th'YARC) was constructed on the site of a former garage on Parade Street. Th'YARC continues to operate to this day, with the 350-seat Lydia Davison Theatre, an art gallery and a print-making shop.\n\n[[File:Canada-Yarmouth01.jpg|thumb|left|The Victorian [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]] Eakin/Hatfield House in Yarmouth]]\n\nA popular but unsupported cultural belief in Yarmouth holds that the American composer [[Meredith Willson]] wrote his well-known song \"[[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas]]\" while staying in Yarmouth's Grand Hotel.<ref>[http://www.guestlovitt.ca/christmas.htm It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas: Was it written in Yarmouth?]</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, a record [[Shortfin mako shark|mako shark]] was caught off the coast of Yarmouth during the Yarmouth Shark Scramble.

Yarmouth is the [[shire town]] of [[Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth County]] and is the largest population centre in the region.\n\nLong connected to [[fishing]] due to its proximity to [[Georges Bank]], the town is located in the heart of the world's largest [[lobster fishing]] grounds and as a result receives Canada's largest lobster landings each year.<ref>[http://www.townofyarmouth.ca/ Town of Yarmouth website]</ref>\n\n==History==\nOriginally inhabited by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], the region was known as \"Keespongwitk\" meaning \"Lands End\" due to its geographic isolation being located at the southwestern tip of the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]].<ref>[http://bayoffundy.com/articles/yarmouth-lands-end/ Yarmouth: Lands End - Bay of Fundy]</ref><ref name=\"Names\"/>\n\nThe region may have possibly been visited by [[Leif Ericson]]. An object known as the [[Yarmouth Runic Stone]] was found at the nearby village of [[Overton, Nova Scotia|Overton]] in 1812. It was interpreted by some to have been carved by Ericson, while others feel the markings are natural scratches gradually enhanced over the years. The stone is preserved at the [[Yarmouth County Museum & Archives]].\n\n===European settlement===\nThe region was visited in 1604 by [[Samuel de Champlain]], who named it \"Cap-Fourchu\", meaning \"forked or cloven cape.\"<ref name=\"Names\">{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Thomas J. |title= Place-names of the Province of Nova Scotia |url= https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofprov00browuoft#page/n160/mode/1up |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia|publisher= Royal Print & Litho.|page=157 |date=1922}}</ref> The first Europeans to make a settlement on these shores were the French Acadians.

Despite the American Privateer raids in the [[Raid on Yarmouth, Nova Scotia (1775)]], the inhabitants still sheltered American prisoners after the [[Battle off Yarmouth (1777)]].\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], substantial numbers of [[United Empire Loyalist]]s arrived in 1785.\n\n[[File:View of Yarmouth from Milton, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|View of Yarmouth from Milton, Nova Scotia, by Sarah Bond Farish, 1829.]]\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n[[File:Yarmouthmuseum2.JPG|thumb|left|House flags of Yarmouth shipping companies and ship portraits at the [[Yarmouth County Museum]]]]\n\nThrough the 19th century the town was a major [[shipbuilding]] centre, at one point boasting more registered tonnage [[per capita]] than any other port in the world.<ref>[http://bayoffundy.com/articles/yarmouth-lands-end/ Yarmouth: Lands End]</ref> From 1874 to 1885, Yarmouth was the second largest port of registry in Canada following [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].

[[John Patch]], the son of a Yarmouth sea captain, developed and built one of the first modern [[screw propeller]] driven ships in 1832 (4 years before [[John Ericsson]]'s patent). First demonstrated in Yarmouth Harbour during the summer of 1833, Patch was unsuccessful in a [[patent]] application in that year, but he continued to improve his propeller and received an American patent in 1849<ref>Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions'' Goose Lane Publishing (2001) p. 58-59</ref> which drew praise in American scientific circles.<ref>[http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033 \"Patch's Propeller\", ''Scientific American'', Vol. 4, No. 5 (October 10, 1848)  p. 33, featured in ''The Archimedes Screw'' website retrieved 31 January 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174319/http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033|date=8 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> However, by 1849 there were multiple competing versions of the screw propeller.

The town's first railway was the locally owned [[Western Counties Railway]] which was built from Yarmouth to [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] in the 1870s.  It eventually was merged into the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]] (DAR), with a network extending into the [[Annapolis Valley]], [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]]; the DAR later became a subsidiary of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR).  The [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] was built along the south shore linking Yarmouth with [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]], [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia|Bridgewater]] and [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] in the early 20th century; the H&SW was eventually merged into the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR).  While iron-hulled steamships had led to the decline of Yarmouth's once-thriving wooden shipbuilding industry, they also made the port a vital connection between Nova Scotia's rail lines and steamships destined for [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]].  Rail services were abandoned to Yarmouth in stages, beginning in 1982 (CNR) and ending in 1990 (CPR).\n\n===Steamships and ferries===\n[[Tourism]] has been a major industry in Yarmouth since the 1880s when [[Loran Ellis Baker]] founded the Yarmouth Steamship Company. Steamship and railway promotion based in Yarmouth created the first tourism marketing in Nova Scotia.<ref>Jay White, [http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/tourism/early.asp?Language=English \"Canada's Ocean Playground: The Tourism Industry in Nova Scotia, 1870-1970\"], ''Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management''</ref>\nBaker's steamships operated between Yarmouth and Boston until 1900, when the company was purchased by the Dominion Atlantic Railway. The DAR and [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] offered connections for passengers arriving in Yarmouth with steamship services operating to New York City and Boston.\n\nIn 1939, examiners at Yarmouth's Merchant Marine Institution made seafaring history by issuing master's papers to [[Molly Kool]], the first female ship captain in the Western World.\n\nSteamship connections between Yarmouth and Boston / New York were maintained by [[Eastern Steamship Lines]] but were suspended with the start of [[World War II]]; the [[SS Yarmouth Castle|SS ''Yarmouth Castle'']] was one of many vessels which served this route. The service resumed a few years after the war with the S.S. Yarmouth, under the same company.  This service continued into the mid 1950s and was then replaced with the M.V. Bluenose.\n\n====CNR, CN Marine and Marine Atlantic====\nFollowing the war, as the economy of western Nova Scotia improved, the need for a year-round daily service was made evident. The service was needed as a more timely route for transport of goods between markets in Nova Scotia and the United States. Demand increased for passenger traffic as well.  This led citizens of southwestern Nova Scotia to undertake an extensive lobbying effort with the federal government to establish a [[ferry]] service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] connecting Yarmouth with a port in New England.  In 1949 the [[Canadian Maritime Commission]] began to study the possibility of a ferry service connecting with a port in the US. After some controversy as to whether to return to the traditional Boston or New York service, a decision was made to focus the effort on a service from Yarmouth to [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]].  In 1954 the federal government contracted [[Davie Shipbuilding]] to construct [[MV Bluenose|MV ''Bluenose'']] which was launched in 1955 and began service in 1956 under the management of [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) and later (1977-1982) under the management of a federal [[Crown corporation]] named [[CN Marine]].\n\nIn 1978 CN Marine started operating [[MV Marine Evangeline|MV ''Marine Evangeline'']] on a service from Yarmouth to [[Portland, Maine]].  In 1982 the old ''Bluenose'' was retired from the Bar Harbor service and sold.  CN Marine replaced her with a newer vessel [[MV Stena Jutlandica|MV ''Stena Jutlandica'']] which was renamed MV ''Bluenose'' to prevent confusion in tourism marketing literature.\n\nIn 1986 CN Marine was reorganized into the Crown corporation [[Marine Atlantic]] and in 1997 the federal government decided to end its financial support for the Gulf of Maine ferry service, soliciting proposals from private sector ferry companies to operate the route.\n\n====Lion Ferry, Prince of Fundy Cruises, Scotia Prince Cruises====\nThe growth of post-war automobile-based tourism saw the provincial government encourage additional ferry service with New England, a region with many family connections to the [[Maritimes]] dating to the 18th century and which accelerated during the first half of the 20th century.  In 1970 the MV ''Bluenose'' service operated by CNR was joined by the [[MS Prince of Fundy|MS ''Prince of Fundy'']] on a route connecting Yarmouth with [[Portland, Maine]] operated by [[Lion Ferry]].  The service was supplemented between 1973-1976 by [[MS Bolero|MS ''Bolero'']], however by 1976 both vessels were replaced by the [[MS Caribe|MS ''Caribe'']].  Lion Ferry sold Yarmouth's second ferry service to [[Scotia Prince Cruises|Prince of Fundy Cruises]] who purchased [[MS Stena Olympica|MS ''Stena Olympica'']] and renamed it MS ''Scotia Prince''.  The service underwent another ownership change in 2000 and was renamed [[Scotia Prince Cruises]].  In 2004 the company discovered toxic mould in its Portland terminal, owned by the City of Portland, canceling its 2005 season.  The City of Portland subsequently canceled the company's lease and evicted Scotia Prince Cruises, thus ending this ferry service.\n\n====Bay Ferries====\n[[File:The cat ferry.jpg|thumb|HSC ''The Cat'' in Yarmouth Harbour]]\nIn 1997 [[Bay Ferries]], a subsidiary of [[Northumberland Ferries Limited]], was the successful bidder for the federal government's Gulf of Maine ferry service.  Only the operating licence was transferred as well as the right to be the primary user of the federal government-owned ferry terminals in Yarmouth and Bar Harbor; the service would receive no subsidy from the federal government.  Bay Ferries purchased MV ''Bluenose'' from Marine Atlantic and used that vessel for the remainder of the 1997 season before selling it.\n\nIn 1998 Bay Ferries introduced the first [[high speed catamaran]] passenger-vehicle ferry service in North America when it purchased [[HSC INCAT 046|HSC ''Incat 046'']] from [[Incat]] in an aggressive bid to expand the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service.  Throughout the 1990s the market for ferry services in southwestern Nova Scotia was threatened by significant expansions of 4-lane expressways in northern Nova Scotia and across southern [[New Brunswick]] so it was theorized that the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service could maintain market share if the ferry voyage time was shortened.  Marketed as \"The Cat\", the use of the ferry service grew largely due to Bay Ferries' investment and the novelty of riding the ultra-modern high speed catamaran.  In 2002 Bay Ferries traded in HSC ''Incat 046'' for a larger vessel [[HSC The Cat|HSC ''The Cat'']] which was also marketed as \"The Cat\".  Beginning in 2003, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' during the winter months on services in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nFollowing the end of the service offered by [[Scotia Prince Cruises]] in 2004, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' in 2006 between Yarmouth to Portland, in addition to Bar Harbor; the old Portland ferry terminal being replaced by the newly built [[Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal]].  Following a decline in American tourism to Nova Scotia, as well as record-high fuel prices, Bay Ferries sought subsidies from the federal and provincial governments for its Gulf of Maine ferry service.  The federal government refused to provide a subsidy, having removed itself from operating such a service in 1997.  However, the provincial government offered a subsidy to cover the operating loss and this was subsequently provided in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  In 2009 the provincial government canceled the subsidy and Bay Ferries announced in December 2009 that it was ending its ferry service and sold the vessel.<ref name=\"ferry\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/12/18/ns-yarmouth-ferry-ends.html |title=Yarmouth ferry service ends. |publisher=cbc.ca |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 | work=CBC News}}</ref>\n\n====Nova Star Cruises====\nIn 2013 the provincial government posted a request for proposals for re-establishing a Yarmouth - Maine ferry service, stating that a successful proponent would receive a $21 million subsidy over a 7-year period.  In September 2013 it was announced that [[Nova Star Cruises]] was the successful proponent and in November 2013 it was confirmed that the service would start May 1, 2014 with the [[MV Nova Star|MV ''Nova Star'']] offering daily round trips between Yarmouth and Portland.  Nova Star Cruises also announced it was examining the possibility of using the vessel during the winter months on a service between [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] bypassing the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]]. Nova Star's contract to provide ferry services between Yarmouth and Portland was not renewed for 2016.<ref><http://novastarcruises.com/></ref>\n\n====Return of ''The Cat''====\n[[File:The Cat ferry Yarmouth 2016.jpg|thumb|''The Cat'' leaving Yarmouth Harbour in 2016]]\nOn March 24, 2016, [[Bay Ferries|Bay Ferries Limited]] announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy for a multi-year [[Bareboat charter|charter]] of [[HST-2]].  The vessel will be operated for a passenger/vehicle ferry service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth. The service and vessel will be branded as ''The CAT'' to align with the previous branding used by Bay Ferries.

[[RCAF Station Yarmouth]] was originally opened in 1940 as three separate training sites (the East Camp, the West Camp and the Air Base).\n\nThe East Camp was home to a detachment of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s No. 34 [[Operational conversion unit|Operational Training Unit]] (from [[RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge]]), who trained bomber crews, as well as the [[Royal Navy]]'s No. 1 Naval Air Gunners School who were located at Yarmouth from 1 January 1943 to 30 March 1945.\n\nThe West Camp was home to an [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] Anti-Submarine Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron and several Eastern Air Command Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons, such as [[No. 162 Squadron RCAF|162 Squadron]].\n\nThe Air Base was home to the 9th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery, various RCAF and RAF Bomber Squadrons and an Army Co-operation Reconnaissance Flight. Its primary function was as an administrative and logistical support base to the RAF and RCAF squadrons in the area, in addition to providing a Weather Information Section, an Armament Section and a [[Shooting range|firing range]].\n\nA [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson bomber]] from Royal Canadian Air Force Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron 113 in Yarmouth became the first aircraft of RCAF's Eastern Air Command to destroy a submarine, sinking [[German submarine U-754|U-754]] about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} south of Yarmouth on July 31, 1942. The sinking resulted in 43 casualties and no survivors.<ref>''The Creation of a National Air Force'' W.A.B. Douglas, (University of Toronto Press, 1986) p. 520</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller installations associated with RCAF Station Yarmouth were located in southwestern Nova Scotia, including a [[bombing range]] at [[Port Maitland, Nova Scotia|Port Maitland]], a fuel depot at [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]], and radar detachments at [[Plymouth, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Plymouth]], [[Tusket, Nova Scotia|Tusket]], [[Bear Point, Nova Scotia|Bear Point]], [[Port Mouton, Nova Scotia|Port Mouton]] and [[Rockville, Nova Scotia|Rockville]]. In 1944, a detachment of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] briefly came to Yarmouth to test the effectiveness of a [[blimp]] service. After a crash, the RCAF decided against this venture.\n\nRCAF Station Yarmouth closed in 1945. The airfield was sold to the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]] in 1946 and became the [[Yarmouth Airport]]. A [[Canadian Army]] training camp (known as Camp 60) on Parade Street also provided basic and artillery training for 20,000 soldiers during the war.<ref>''RCAF Yarmouth East camp/West Camp'' Hank Reed, (East Camp Veterans, Yarmouth, 1996)</ref>\n\n[[File:YarmouthNS FishingBoats.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing boats in Yarmouth]]\n\n==Culture==\nThe Western Branch of the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] is located in Yarmouth. The town is also home to the [[Yarmouth County Museum & Archives]] which preserves the history of the town and surrounding county and operates the Killam Brothers building on the waterfront. The Firefighters Museum, part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system and the privately run Sweeney Fisheries Museum are also located in Yarmouth.\n\nThe [[Izaak Walton Killam]] Memorial house, founded in 1963, serves as the town's public library.  It is the largest branch of [[Western Counties Regional Library]] and houses the regional library's headquarters.\n\nThe Yarmouth Arts Regional Council was established in 1974, under the leadership of Lydia Davison, a local music teacher. Over the next five years, with the assistance of the [[Canada Council]] and many volunteers, the Yarmouth Arts Regional Centre (Th'YARC) was constructed on the site of a former garage on Parade Street. Th'YARC continues to operate to this day, with the 350-seat Lydia Davison Theatre, an art gallery and a print-making shop.\n\n[[File:Canada-Yarmouth01.jpg|thumb|left|The Victorian [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]] Eakin/Hatfield House in Yarmouth]]\n\nA popular but unsupported cultural belief in Yarmouth holds that the American composer [[Meredith Willson]] wrote his well-known song \"[[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas]]\" while staying in Yarmouth's Grand Hotel.<ref>[http://www.guestlovitt.ca/christmas.htm It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas: Was it written in Yarmouth?]</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, a record [[Shortfin mako shark|mako shark]] was caught off the coast of Yarmouth during the Yarmouth Shark Scramble. It weighed {{convert|1082|lb|abbr=on}} and set a new Canadian record. It is considered one of the largest mako sharks ever caught.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/travel/story.html?id=e88d6269-9547-489b-a641-6419e99e95b7 Mako Shark caught off Yarmouth]</ref>\n\n[[Seafest]] is an annual 7 day festival organized since 1979.\n\n==Buildings and structures==\nYarmouth is known for some of the most exuberant examples of Victorian houses styles in the [[Maritimes]], a legacy of the wealthy captains and shipowners of the town's seafaring Golden Age.<ref>Mark Myers & Margaret McBurney, ''Atlantic Hearths: Early Homes and families of Nova Scotia'', University of Toronto Press (1994), p. 160</ref> A heritage district preserves several blocks of these residences, including the Lovitt House and Eakin/Hatfield House. On the waterfront, two historic warehouses survive from the sailing era, the Killam Brothers and Parker-Eakin's buildings, each with an associated wharf, which are the focal points of summer waterfront events.\n\nYarmouth's Main Street is marked by several distinctive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] commercial buildings such as the turreted Yarmouth Block Building.<ref>Elizabeth Pacey and Alvin Comiter, ''Landmarks: Historic Buildings in Nova Scotia'', Nimbus (1994) pp. 136-137</ref> The largest building in the town is a 1970s hotel, the Rodd Grand Hotel. It is built on the site of the original Grand Hotel, a [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] hotel which was the town's landmark for many years.\n\nA landmark for Yarmouth Harbour is the large Cape Forchu Lighthouse which is located a few kilometers away at the [[headland]] of [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia|Cape Forchu]], the peninsula that guards Yarmouth Harbour. The tall \"apple core\" style is a notable example of modernist style light tower.<ref>[http://nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=61&M=IP&N=3 \"Cape Forchu Lighthouse\", Nova Scotian Lighthouse Preservation Society website]</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n{{climate chart\n| Yarmouth\n|-6.9 |  0.8 |  127.3\n|-6.5|  1.1 |  101.8\n|-3.4|  4.0 | 115.5\n|1.2|  9.0 | 101.4\n|5.5|  13.9 | 100.9\n|9.6| 18.0 | 94.8\n|12.7| 20.9 | 88.4\n|12.9| 21.1 | 84.3\n|10.0| 18.2 |  94.9\n|5.6|  13.3 | 112.4\n|1.6|  8.7 |  139.3\n|-3.5|  3.8 |  131.8\n| float = left\n| source = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"CCN yarmouth\">{{cite web| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6516&lang=e&amp;StationName=Yarmouth&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1| title = Yarmouth A | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | publisher = Environment Canada | language = English, French | accessdate = 28 September 2015}}</ref>}}\nYarmouth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Dfb'') of the maritime influence, typical of climates surrounded by the sea but close to large continents such as [[Southern Norway|southern Norway]] and [[Hokkaido|coastal Hokkaido]] but with latitude variations.

His father was Franz Herzfeld, a socialist writer, and his mother was Alice (n\u00e9e Stolzenburg), a textile worker and political activist.\n\nIn 1899, Helmut, his brother [[Wieland Herzfelde]], and his sisters Lotte and Hertha were abandoned in the woods by their parents.<ref>Biographical Chronology from \"John Heartfield\", Edited by Peter Pachnicke and Klaus Honnef, Harry N.

Two commercial designers, [[Albert Weisgerber]] and [[Ludwig Hohlwein]], were early influences.\n\nWhile living in Berlin, he began styling himself \"John Heartfield,\" an [[anglicisation]] of his German name, to protest against [[anti-British]] fervour sweeping (Germany) during the [[First World War]], during which Berlin street crowds commonly shouted \"[[Gott strafe England]]!\" (\"May God punish England!\").<ref name=AMZ>John Heartfield and the Agitated Image: Photography, Persuasion, and the Rise of Avant-Garde Photomontage, Andres Mario Zervigon</ref>\n\nDuring the same year, Heartfield, his brother [[Wieland Herzfelde|Wieland]] and [[George Grosz]] launched publishing house Malik-Verlag in Berlin. In 1916, he and [[George Grosz]] had experimented with pasting pictures together, a form of art later named [[photomontage]], and which would be a central characteristic of their works.\n\nIn 1917, Heartfield became a member of [[Berlin Club Dada]].<ref name=AMZ /> Heartfield would later become active in the [[Dada]] movement, helping to organise the '''Erste Internationale Dada-Messe''' (First International Dada Fair) in Berlin in 1920. [[Dadaists]] were provocateurs who disrupted public art gatherings and ridiculed the participants.

He also built theatre sets for [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]].\n\nDuring the 1920s, Heartfield produced a great number of photomontages, many of which were reproduced as dust jackets for books such as his montage for Upton Sinclair's ''The Millennium''.\n\nIt was through [[rotogravure]], an engraving process whereby pictures, designs, and words are engraved into the printing plate or printing cylinder, that Heartfield's montages, in the form of posters, were distributed in the streets of Berlin between 1932 and 1933, when the Nazis came to power.\n\nHis political montages regularly appeared on the cover of the [[communist]] magazine Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung (AIZ, Workers' Illustrated Newspaper) from 1930 to 1938, a popular weekly whose circulation (as many as 500,000 copies at its height) rivaled any other contemporary German magazine. Since Heartfield's photomontages appeared on this cover, his work was widely seen at newsstands.\n\nHeartfield lived in Berlin until April 1933 when the [[Nazi Party]] took power. On [[Good Friday]], the [[SS]] broke into his apartment, but he escaped by jumping from his [[balcony]] and hiding in a trash bin. He fled Germany by walking over the [[Sudeten Mountains]] to [[Czechoslovakia]].

He was interned as an enemy alien, and his health began to deteriorate. Afterward, he lived in [[Hampstead]], London. His brother Wieland was refused a British residency permit in 1939 and instead left for the United States with his family.\n\n===Postwar period===\nIn the aftermath of [[World War II]], Heartfield was denied his written applications to remain in England for \"his work and his health\", and was convinced in 1950 to join Wieland, who had been living in [[East Berlin]], [[East Germany]]. Heartfield moved into an apartment next to brother's, at 129A Friedrichstrasse. However, his return to Berlin was seen with suspicion by the East German government due to his 11-year stay in England and the fact his dentist was under suspicion by the [[Stasi]]. He was interrogated<ref group=note>The English translation of the interrogation appears in the [[David King (historian)|David King]] book: John Heartfield, Laughter Is A Devastating Weapon.</ref><ref>[http://www.johnheartfield.com/John-Heartfield-Exhibition/about-john-heartfield-photomontages/tate-modern-london The David King Exhibit on John Heartfield Exhibition]</ref> and released having narrowly avoided a trial for [[treason]], but was denied admission into the East German Akademie der K\u00fcnste (Academy of the Arts). He was prohibited to work as an artist and was denied health benefits.\n\nDue to the intervention of [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Stefan Heym]], Heartfield was formally admitted to the Academy of the Arts in 1956. Although he subsequently produced some montages warning of the threat of nuclear war, he was never again as prolific as in his youth.\n\nIn [[East Berlin]], Heartfield worked closely with theatre directors such as [[Benno Besson]] and [[Wolfgang Langhoff]] at [[Berliner Ensemble]] and [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]]. He created innovative stage set designs for Bertolt Brecht and David Berg. Using Heartfield's minimal props and stark stages, Brecht interrupted his plays at key junctures to have the audience to be part of the action and not to lose themselves in it.\n\nIn 1967, he visited Britain and began preparing a retrospective exhibition of his work, which was subsequently completed by his widow Gertrud and the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Berlin Academy of Arts]], and shown at the ICA in London in 1969.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Heartfield Hitler Salute.jpg|thumb|left|One of John Heartfield's works.]]\nHe is best known for the 240 political art photomontages<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnheartfield.com/John-Heartfield-Exhibition/john-heartfield-art|title=JOHN HEARTFIELD ANTI-FASCIST PHOTOMONTAGE ART|work=John Heartfield Exhibition|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> he created from 1930 to 1938, mainly criticising fascism and [[Nazism]].

This song was re-recorded in German as \"[[Mittageisen]]\" and released as a single in September 1979 in Germany with Heartfield's work as the cover art. A few months later the single was also released in the UK.

The cover art of their self-titled debut album [[Laibach (album)|Laibach]] (Ropot, 1985, Ljubljana), also references Heartfield's '' Wie im Mittelalter\u2026 so im Dritten Reich'' (1934). A track called ''Raus! (Herzfelde)'', originally on [[Slovenska Akropola]], but also included in [[Baptism (Laibach album)|Krst pod Triglavom]] and [[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]] as ''Herzfeld (Heartfield)'', is about Heartfield.\n\nBritish [[hardcore punk]] band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] used Heartfield's work \"Peace and Fascism\" for the cover artwork of their 7\" EP [[Never Again (Discharge EP)|Never Again]], 1981.\n\nEnglish [[post-punk]] band [[Blurt]] recorded a song called \"Hurray, the Butter is All Gone!\" on their 1986 album [[Poppycock (album)|Poppycock]].\n\n[[Armenian American]] [[alternative metal]] band [[System of a Down (band)|System of a Down]] used Heartfield's poster for the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (''The Hand Has Five Fingers'') as [[cover art]] on their 1998 [[System of a Down (album)|self-titled debut album]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|John Heartfield}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Brigstocke, H.

He was interned as an enemy alien, and his health began to deteriorate. Afterward, he lived in [[Hampstead]], London. His brother Wieland was refused a British residency permit in 1939 and instead left for the United States with his family.\n\n===Postwar period===\nIn the aftermath of [[World War II]], Heartfield was denied his written applications to remain in England for \"his work and his health\", and was convinced in 1950 to join Wieland, who had been living in [[East Berlin]], [[East Germany]]. Heartfield moved into an apartment next to brother's, at 129A Friedrichstrasse. However, his return to Berlin was seen with suspicion by the East German government due to his 11-year stay in England and the fact his dentist was under suspicion by the [[Stasi]]. He was interrogated<ref group=note>The English translation of the interrogation appears in the [[David King (historian)|David King]] book: John Heartfield, Laughter Is A Devastating Weapon.</ref><ref>[http://www.johnheartfield.com/John-Heartfield-Exhibition/about-john-heartfield-photomontages/tate-modern-london The David King Exhibit on John Heartfield Exhibition]</ref> and released having narrowly avoided a trial for [[treason]], but was denied admission into the East German Akademie der K\u00fcnste (Academy of the Arts). He was prohibited to work as an artist and was denied health benefits.\n\nDue to the intervention of [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Stefan Heym]], Heartfield was formally admitted to the Academy of the Arts in 1956. Although he subsequently produced some montages warning of the threat of nuclear war, he was never again as prolific as in his youth.\n\nIn [[East Berlin]], Heartfield worked closely with theatre directors such as [[Benno Besson]] and [[Wolfgang Langhoff]] at [[Berliner Ensemble]] and [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]]. He created innovative stage set designs for Bertolt Brecht and David Berg. Using Heartfield's minimal props and stark stages, Brecht interrupted his plays at key junctures to have the audience to be part of the action and not to lose themselves in it.\n\nIn 1967, he visited Britain and began preparing a retrospective exhibition of his work, which was subsequently completed by his widow Gertrud and the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Berlin Academy of Arts]], and shown at the ICA in London in 1969.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Heartfield Hitler Salute.jpg|thumb|left|One of John Heartfield's works.]]\nHe is best known for the 240 political art photomontages<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnheartfield.com/John-Heartfield-Exhibition/john-heartfield-art|title=JOHN HEARTFIELD ANTI-FASCIST PHOTOMONTAGE ART|work=John Heartfield Exhibition|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> he created from 1930 to 1938, mainly criticising fascism and [[Nazism]].

When the West German [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Academy of Arts]] absorbed the East German Academy, the Heartfield Archive was transferred with it.\n\nFrom 15 April to 6 July 1993, the New York City [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted an exhibition of Heartfield's original montages.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/arts/review-art-hated-the-nazis-loved-the-soviets-created-images-to-mock-and-admire.html |title=Review/Art; Hated the Nazis, Loved the Soviets, Created Images to Mock and Admire|journal=The New York Times|first=Michael|last=Kimmelman|date=16 April 1993}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the British [[Tate Gallery]] held an exhibition of his photomontage pieces.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n<!-- Please go to \"About John Heartfield Copyrights\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnheartfield.com/John-Heartfield-Exhibition/heartfield-exhibition-curator/john-heartfield-copyrights|title=About John Heartfeld Copyrights\n|work=The Official John Heartfield Exhibition|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> to find out how you can reproduce John Heartfeld's images. -->\n\n''Hurray, There's No Butter Left!'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnheartfield.com/John-Heartfield-Exhibition/john-heartfield-art/political-art-posters/heartfield-posters-aiz/butter-is-all|title=Poster on the Official John Heartfield Exhibition|work=The John Heartfield Exhibition|accessdate=8 January 2017}}]</ref> was an inspiration to the song \"Metal Postcard\" by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. This song was re-recorded in German as \"[[Mittageisen]]\" and released as a single in September 1979 in Germany with Heartfield's work as the cover art. A few months later the single was also released in the UK. The Swiss [[Dark Wave|darkwave]] band [[Mittageisen (band)|Mittageisen]] (1981\u20131986) is named after this song's title.\n\nSlovenian and [[SFR Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav]] [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] music group [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] has a number of references to Heartfield's works: the original band's logo, the 'black cross', references Heartfield's art ''Der alte Wahlspruch im \"neuen\" Reich: Blut und Eisen'' (1934), a cross made of four axes, as can be seen on the inner sleeves and labels of their 1987 album [[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]]. The cover art of their self-titled debut album [[Laibach (album)|Laibach]] (Ropot, 1985, Ljubljana), also references Heartfield's '' Wie im Mittelalter\u2026 so im Dritten Reich'' (1934). A track called ''Raus! (Herzfelde)'', originally on [[Slovenska Akropola]], but also included in [[Baptism (Laibach album)|Krst pod Triglavom]] and [[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]] as ''Herzfeld (Heartfield)'', is about Heartfield.\n\nBritish [[hardcore punk]] band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] used Heartfield's work \"Peace and Fascism\" for the cover artwork of their 7\" EP [[Never Again (Discharge EP)|Never Again]], 1981.\n\nEnglish [[post-punk]] band [[Blurt]] recorded a song called \"Hurray, the Butter is All Gone!\" on their 1986 album [[Poppycock (album)|Poppycock]].\n\n[[Armenian American]] [[alternative metal]] band [[System of a Down (band)|System of a Down]] used Heartfield's poster for the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (''The Hand Has Five Fingers'') as [[cover art]] on their 1998 [[System of a Down (album)|self-titled debut album]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|John Heartfield}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Brigstocke, H.

Carei administers one village, Iancule\u0219ti ({{lang-hu|Szentj\u00e1nosmajor}}).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:1889 NagyKaroly 5kr.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Kingdom of Hungary stamp, cancelled NAGY-K\u00c1ROLY in 1889]]\n\nIn 1262, in a document, ''Karul'' appears as a name of a person, but the etymology of the word can be traced back to the name of a bird ''karul-karvaly'', taken from the ancient Turkish language. Karul may be derived from \"car\" in Romanian. The bird that can be found on the coat of arms of the Karolyi family.\n\nKing [[Louis I of Hungary]] permitted the organization of weekly market gatherings in Carei in 1346, as a result of the military achievements of the K\u00e1rolyi family.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/09500/09536/html/0020/8.html Ujfalussy Amadil: ''Nagyk\u00e1roly'']</ref> The development of regional trade in the region stimulated the development of the town.\n\nIn the 14th century, the settlement was a small township with a few streets built around the K\u00e1rolyi estate. Wars, plague and famine during the Middle Ages decimated the population and the K\u00e1rolyi family took steps to bring [[Sathmar Swabians|Swabian]] settlers to their lands. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Carei was often devastated by wars. The town and the surroundings villages suffered great losses during [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence]].\n\nThe first group of settlers came in 1712, opening a century-long period of gradual colonization with Swabians, [[Slovaks]], and [[Jews]]. Between 1712 and 1774, some 466 Swabian families settled in Carei, forming two districts in town.  Effects on cultural and social life began to show: in 1727 the [[Piarists|Piarist]] Gymnasium was established, in 1754 the first typography was built, and in 1756 a pharmacy was opened.\n\nThe town's urban shape was outlined after the great fire that occurred in May 1887, when 250 houses were burnt down. The rebuilding of the houses and the organizing of the streets were done according to the planning regulations adopted by the town's council.\n\n[[Light industry]] began to bloom in Carei starting with the 19th century, when the first public institutions{{Which|date=November 2009}} were also created.\n\nIn 1887 the [[Zal\u0103u]]\u2013Carei railway was built and in 1905 the railway between Carei and [[M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka]] was restored for transportation purposes.\n\nAfter the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] at the end of [[World War I]], Carei became part of the territory ceded to Romania in 1920 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1940, under the auspices of the [[Third Reich]], which imposed the [[Second Vienna Award]], Hungary retook this territory from Romania. During [[World War II]], however, it was taken back from Hungarian and [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops by Romanian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces on 25 October 1944, a day which has been celebrated since then as the [[Armed Forces Day#Romania|Day of the Romanian Armed Forces]].\n\nAlthough between 1760 and 1920 the town was the seat of the [[Szatm\u00e1r County]], the industrial development was not significant and it basically preserved its agricultural specificity until about 1960. In 1926 Carei was attached to [[S\u0103laj County]]. After 1945, Carei was included in the Baia Mare district, while after 1968, along with the administrative-territorial reorganization of the country, it returned to [[Satu Mare County]].\n\nUntil World War II, the industry of the town consisted of mills, the Oil Factory ''Ardealul'', a station for collecting and fermenting tobacco and some small workshops. During the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist period]], Carei gradually turned into an industrial town.\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe most important historical building in the city is the K\u00e1rolyi castle. Built originally as a fortress around the 14th century, it was converted to a castle in 1794, undergoing further transformations during the 19th century.

Carei administers one village, Iancule\u0219ti ({{lang-hu|Szentj\u00e1nosmajor}}).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:1889 NagyKaroly 5kr.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Kingdom of Hungary stamp, cancelled NAGY-K\u00c1ROLY in 1889]]\n\nIn 1262, in a document, ''Karul'' appears as a name of a person, but the etymology of the word can be traced back to the name of a bird ''karul-karvaly'', taken from the ancient Turkish language. Karul may be derived from \"car\" in Romanian. The bird that can be found on the coat of arms of the Karolyi family.\n\nKing [[Louis I of Hungary]] permitted the organization of weekly market gatherings in Carei in 1346, as a result of the military achievements of the K\u00e1rolyi family.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/09500/09536/html/0020/8.html Ujfalussy Amadil: ''Nagyk\u00e1roly'']</ref> The development of regional trade in the region stimulated the development of the town.\n\nIn the 14th century, the settlement was a small township with a few streets built around the K\u00e1rolyi estate. Wars, plague and famine during the Middle Ages decimated the population and the K\u00e1rolyi family took steps to bring [[Sathmar Swabians|Swabian]] settlers to their lands. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Carei was often devastated by wars. The town and the surroundings villages suffered great losses during [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence]].\n\nThe first group of settlers came in 1712, opening a century-long period of gradual colonization with Swabians, [[Slovaks]], and [[Jews]]. Between 1712 and 1774, some 466 Swabian families settled in Carei, forming two districts in town.  Effects on cultural and social life began to show: in 1727 the [[Piarists|Piarist]] Gymnasium was established, in 1754 the first typography was built, and in 1756 a pharmacy was opened.\n\nThe town's urban shape was outlined after the great fire that occurred in May 1887, when 250 houses were burnt down. The rebuilding of the houses and the organizing of the streets were done according to the planning regulations adopted by the town's council.\n\n[[Light industry]] began to bloom in Carei starting with the 19th century, when the first public institutions{{Which|date=November 2009}} were also created.\n\nIn 1887 the [[Zal\u0103u]]\u2013Carei railway was built and in 1905 the railway between Carei and [[M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka]] was restored for transportation purposes.\n\nAfter the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] at the end of [[World War I]], Carei became part of the territory ceded to Romania in 1920 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1940, under the auspices of the [[Third Reich]], which imposed the [[Second Vienna Award]], Hungary retook this territory from Romania. During [[World War II]], however, it was taken back from Hungarian and [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops by Romanian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces on 25 October 1944, a day which has been celebrated since then as the [[Armed Forces Day#Romania|Day of the Romanian Armed Forces]].\n\nAlthough between 1760 and 1920 the town was the seat of the [[Szatm\u00e1r County]], the industrial development was not significant and it basically preserved its agricultural specificity until about 1960. In 1926 Carei was attached to [[S\u0103laj County]]. After 1945, Carei was included in the Baia Mare district, while after 1968, along with the administrative-territorial reorganization of the country, it returned to [[Satu Mare County]].\n\nUntil World War II, the industry of the town consisted of mills, the Oil Factory ''Ardealul'', a station for collecting and fermenting tobacco and some small workshops. During the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist period]], Carei gradually turned into an industrial town.\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe most important historical building in the city is the K\u00e1rolyi castle. Built originally as a fortress around the 14th century, it was converted to a castle in 1794, undergoing further transformations during the 19th century. The manor is surrounded by an [[arboretum]], covering a surface of about {{convert|30|acre|ha}} and containing a great variety of species of trees and plants.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data<ref>[http://nepszamlalas.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=etnikai&id=2128 Census Database]</ref>\n|1880 | 12,523\n|1890 | 13,475\n|1900 | 15,382\n|1910 | 16,078\n|1920 | 15,294\n|1930 | 16,042\n|1941 | 15,850\n|1956 | 16,780\n|1966 | 19,686\n|1977 | 24,050\n|1992 | 26,372\n|2002 | 22,781\n|2011 | 20,775\n}}\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Carei had a population of 21,112; out of those, 51.9% were [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian]], 38.3% were [[Romanians|Romanian]], 2.3% were [[Germans in Romania|German]], and 2.2% were [[Romani people in Romania|Roma]].<ref>[http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ Tab8.

However, when the medreses were no longer able to meet the needs of the modern world, a restructuring process began, and as a result, the institutions of higher education called ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn'', the core of Istanbul University, was established.\n\nAn institution of [[higher education]] named the ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u Osman\u00ee'' (\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a) (Ottoman House of Sciences) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871.<ref name=\"R\u00fcegg, Walter 687\"/> Its first rector was [[Hasan Tahsini]], regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century.

Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of [[Galatasaray High School]], which continued regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as the ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u \u015eah\u00e2ne'' (Imperial House of Multiple Sciences) with courses on Mathematics, Literature and Theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.\n\nOn 21 April 1924, the [[Republic of Turkey]] recognized the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was recognized while the ''Schools'' (within the old Medrese system) became modern ''Faculties''.\n\nOn 1 August 1933, ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was reorganized as ''\u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi'' (Istanbul University) following the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|educational reforms]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]].

However, when the medreses were no longer able to meet the needs of the modern world, a restructuring process began, and as a result, the institutions of higher education called ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn'', the core of Istanbul University, was established.\n\nAn institution of [[higher education]] named the ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u Osman\u00ee'' (\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a) (Ottoman House of Sciences) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871.<ref name=\"R\u00fcegg, Walter 687\"/> Its first rector was [[Hasan Tahsini]], regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century.

Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of [[Galatasaray High School]], which continued regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as the ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u \u015eah\u00e2ne'' (Imperial House of Multiple Sciences) with courses on Mathematics, Literature and Theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.\n\nOn 21 April 1924, the [[Republic of Turkey]] recognized the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was recognized while the ''Schools'' (within the old Medrese system) became modern ''Faculties''.\n\nOn 1 August 1933, ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was reorganized as ''\u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi'' (Istanbul University) following the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|educational reforms]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]].

Mentioned in the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' as {{lang|la|castrum Zotmar}} (\"Zotmar's fort\"), the city has a history going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Today, it is an academic, cultural, industrial and business centre in [[Nord-Vest (development region)|northwestern Romania]].\n\n==Geography==\nSatu Mare is situated in [[Satu Mare County]], in northwest Romania, on the [[Some\u0219 River]], {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the border with Hungary and {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the border with [[Ukraine]]. The city is located at an altitude of {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the [[Some\u0219 River|Lower Some\u0219 alluvial plain]], spreading out from the [[Administrative Palace, Satu Mare|Administrative Palace]] at 25 October Square. The boundaries of the municipality contain an area of {{convert|150.3|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nFrom a geomorphologic point of view, the city is located on the [[Some\u0219 River|Some\u0219 Meadow]] on both sides of the river, which narrows in the vicinity of the city and widens [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]] and [[Source (river or stream)|downstream]] from it; flooded during heavy rainfall, the field has various geographical configurations at the edge of the city (sand banks, valleys, micro-depressions).<ref name=\"Geografie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.satu-mare.ro/despre/localizare.html |title=Geografie |publisher=www.satu-mare.ro |language=Romanian |accessdate=2009-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612193108/http://www.satu-mare.ro/despre/localizare.html |archivedate=June 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe formation of the current terrain of the city, dating from the late [[Pliocene]] in the [[Tertiary]] period, is linked to the clogging of the [[Pannonian Sea]]. Layers of soil were created from deposits of [[sand]], [[loess]] and [[gravel]], and generally have a thickness of {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}}\u2013{{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Over this base, decaying vegetation gave rise to [[podsol]]ic soils, which led to favorable conditions for crops ([[cereal]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit tree]]s).<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nThe water network around Satu Mare is composed of the Some\u0219 River, [[P\u00e2r\u00e2ul Sar]] in the north and the [[Homorod River (Some\u0219)|Homorod River]] in the south. The formation and evolution of the city was closely related to the Some\u0219 River, which, in addition to allowing for the settlement of a human community around it, has offered, since the early [[Middle Ages]], the possibility of international trade with coastal regions, a practice that favored [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], [[fishing]] and other economic activities.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nBecause the land slopes gently around the city, the Some\u0219 River has created numerous branches and [[meander]]s (before 1777, in the perimeter of the city there were 25 meanders [[Source (river or stream)|downstream]] and 14 [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]]). After systematisation works in 1777, the number of meanders in the city dropped to 9 [[wikt:downstream|downstream]] and 5 [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]], the total length of the river now being at {{convert|36.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} within the city. Systematisation performed up to the mid-19th century configured the existing Some\u0219 riverbed; [[Levee|embankments]] were built {{convert|17.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long on the right bank and {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the left. In 1970, the embankments were raised by {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}\u2013{{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}}, protecting 52,000 hectares within the city limits and restoring nearly 800 ha of agricultural land that had previously been flooded.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe flora associated with the town of Satu Mare is characteristic for the meadow area with trees of soft essence like [[wicker]], indigenous [[Populus|poplar]], [[maple]] and [[Corylus avellana|hazelnut]]. Grassland vegetation is represented by ''[[Agrostis stolonifera]]'', ''[[Poa trivialis]]'', ''[[Alopecurus pratensis]]'' and other types of vegetation.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nThe city's largest park, the [[Garden of Rome]], features some rare trees that are uncommon to the area, including the [[Styphnolobium japonicum|pagoda tree]], native to East Asia (especially China); ''[[Pterocarya]]'', also native to Asia; and ''[[Paulownia tomentosa]]'', native to central and western China.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nFauna is represented by species of rodents ([[hamster]] and [[european ground squirrel]]), reptiles, including ''[[Vipera berus]]'' in the Noroieni forest, and as avifauna species of [[duck]]s, [[Goose|geese]], [[egret]]s, during passages and systematic occasional wanderings.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nSatu Mare has a [[continental climate]], characterised by hot dry summers and cold winters. As the city is in the far north of the country, winter is much colder than the national average, with minimum temperatures reaching {{convert|-17|C|F|0}}, lower than values recorded in other cities in western Romania like [[Oradea]] ({{convert|-15|C|F|0}}) or [[Timi\u0219oara]] ({{convert|-17|C|F|0}}). The average annual temperature is {{convert|9.6|C|F|0}}, or broken down by seasons: [[Spring (season)|Spring]] {{convert|10.2|C|F|0}}, [[summer]] {{convert|19.6|C|F|0}}, [[autumn]] {{convert|10.8|C|F|0}} and [[winter]] {{convert|1.7|C|F|0}}.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/> Atmospheric humidity is quite high. Prevailing wind currents blow in from the northwest, bringing spring and summer rainfall. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  The [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]\" (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=1051&cityname=Satu+Mare%2C+Romania&units= |publisher= Weatherbase |title= Climate Summary for Satu Mare |accessdate=2013-06-25}}</ref> \n{{Weather box\n|location = Satu Mare\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 1\n|Feb high C = 3\n|Mar high C = 10\n|Apr high C = 15\n|May high C = 20\n|Jun high C = 22\n|Jul high C = 25\n|Aug high C = 25\n|Sep high C = 21\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 7\n|Dec high C = 2\n|year high C = 13\n|Jan low C = -5\n|Feb low C = -3\n|Mar low C = 1\n|Apr low C = 5\n|May low C = 9\n|Jun low C = 12\n|Jul low C = 13\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 10\n|Oct low C = 5\n|Nov low C = 0\n|Dec low C = -2\n|year low C = 5\n|Jan precipitation cm = 2\n|Feb precipitation cm = 2\n|Mar precipitation cm = 2\n|Apr precipitation cm = 4\n|May precipitation cm = 7\n|Jun precipitation cm = 8\n|Jul precipitation cm = 8\n|Aug precipitation cm = 7\n|Sep precipitation cm = 4\n|Oct precipitation cm = 4\n|Nov precipitation cm = 3\n|Dec precipitation cm = 2\n|year precipitation cm = 59\n|source 1 = weatherbase.com<ref name=weatherbase>{{cite web\n|url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=1051&refer=&units=metric |title =Weatherbase data for Satu Mare |accessdate = 2009-06-22 |language =}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Name==\nThe Hungarian name of the town ''Szatm\u00e1r'' is believed to come from the personal name ''Zotmar'', as the 13th-century ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' gives the name of the 10th-century fortified settlement at the site of today's Satu Mare as {{lang|la|castrum Zotmar}} (\"Zotmar's fort\").<ref name=\"Niedermaier\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=OglbJfMLGIkC&dq&pg=PA320 |title= St\u00e4dte, D\u00f6rfer, Bauwerke.

In 1562 the citadel was besieged by Ottoman armies led by [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha]] of [[Buda]] and Maleoci Pasha of [[Timi\u0219oara]]. Then the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] besieged it, leading the fleeing [[Transylvania]]n armies to set it on fire. The Austrian general Lazar Schwendi ordered the citadel to be rebuilt after the plans of Italian architect Ottavio Baldigara; using an Italian system of fortifications, the new structure would be pentagonal with five towers.<ref name=\"History\"/> After a period when it changed hands, the town came under Ottoman control in 1661. Called ''Sokmar'' by the new authorities, it was a [[kaza]] center within the [[S\u00e2niob|\u015eenk\u00f6y]] [[sanjak]] of [[Varat Eyalet]]. This status held until 1691, when the army of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] expelled the Ottomans during the [[Great Turkish War]].<ref>{{in lang|tr}} Sadik M\u00fcfit Bilge, [http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/19/1267/14566.pdf \"Macaristan'da Osmanl\u0131 Hakimeyitinin ve \u0130dari Te\u015fkilat\u0131n\u0131n Kurulu\u015fu ve Geli\u015fmesi\"], in ''OTAM (Ankara \u00dcniversitesi Osmanl\u0131 Tarihi Ara\u015ft\u0131rma ve Uygulama Merkezi Dergisi)'', vol.

In the 18th century, intense urbanisation began; several buildings survive from that period, including the old city hall, the inn, a barracks, the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic]] church and the [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed]] church. A [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Satu Mare|Roman Catholic diocese]] was established there in 1804. In 1823, the city's systematization commission was established in order to direct its local government. In 1844, paving operations begun in 1805 were stepped up. The first industrial concerns also opened, including the steam mill, the brick factory, the Neuschloss Factory for wood products, the lumber factory, the Princz Factory and the Unio Factory. Due to its location at the intersection of commercial roads, Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti became and important rail hub. The Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti\u2013Nagyk\u00e1roly ([[Carei]]) line was built in 1871, followed in 1872 by the Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti\u2013M\u00e1ramarossziget ([[Sighetu Marma\u0163iei]]) line, an 1894 link to Nagyb\u00e1nya ([[Baia Mare]]), 1900 to Erd\u0151d ([[Ardud]]) and 1906 to Biksz\u00e1d ([[Bixad, Satu Mare|Bixad]]).<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nSince the second half of the 19th century, it underwent important economic and socio-cultural changes. The city's large companies (the Unio wagon factory, the Princz Factory, the Ardeleana textile enterprise, the Freund petroleum refinery, the brick factory and the furniture factory) prospered in this period, and the city invested heavily in communication lines, schools, hospitals, public works and public parks. The banking and commerce system also developed: in 1929 the [[chamber of commerce and industry]], as well as the commodities stock market were established, with 25 commercial enterprises and 75 industrial and production firms as members. In 1930 there were 33 banks.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nAfter the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]], Romanian troops captured the town during their offensive launched on April 15, 1919.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Transylvania |url= http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/440.html |publisher=Atlantic Research and Publications, Inc. |author=B\u00e9la K\u00f6peczi (editor)|accessdate=2010-08-18}}{{ISBN|0-88033-497-5}}\n</ref> By the [[Treaty of Trianon]]] Satu Mare officially ceased to be part of Hungary becoming part of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].

Mentioned in the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' as {{lang|la|castrum Zotmar}} (\"Zotmar's fort\"), the city has a history going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Today, it is an academic, cultural, industrial and business centre in [[Nord-Vest (development region)|northwestern Romania]].\n\n==Geography==\nSatu Mare is situated in [[Satu Mare County]], in northwest Romania, on the [[Some\u0219 River]], {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the border with Hungary and {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the border with [[Ukraine]]. The city is located at an altitude of {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the [[Some\u0219 River|Lower Some\u0219 alluvial plain]], spreading out from the [[Administrative Palace, Satu Mare|Administrative Palace]] at 25 October Square. The boundaries of the municipality contain an area of {{convert|150.3|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nFrom a geomorphologic point of view, the city is located on the [[Some\u0219 River|Some\u0219 Meadow]] on both sides of the river, which narrows in the vicinity of the city and widens [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]] and [[Source (river or stream)|downstream]] from it; flooded during heavy rainfall, the field has various geographical configurations at the edge of the city (sand banks, valleys, micro-depressions).<ref name=\"Geografie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.satu-mare.ro/despre/localizare.html |title=Geografie |publisher=www.satu-mare.ro |language=Romanian |accessdate=2009-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612193108/http://www.satu-mare.ro/despre/localizare.html |archivedate=June 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe formation of the current terrain of the city, dating from the late [[Pliocene]] in the [[Tertiary]] period, is linked to the clogging of the [[Pannonian Sea]]. Layers of soil were created from deposits of [[sand]], [[loess]] and [[gravel]], and generally have a thickness of {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}}\u2013{{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Over this base, decaying vegetation gave rise to [[podsol]]ic soils, which led to favorable conditions for crops ([[cereal]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit tree]]s).<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nThe water network around Satu Mare is composed of the Some\u0219 River, [[P\u00e2r\u00e2ul Sar]] in the north and the [[Homorod River (Some\u0219)|Homorod River]] in the south. The formation and evolution of the city was closely related to the Some\u0219 River, which, in addition to allowing for the settlement of a human community around it, has offered, since the early [[Middle Ages]], the possibility of international trade with coastal regions, a practice that favored [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], [[fishing]] and other economic activities.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nBecause the land slopes gently around the city, the Some\u0219 River has created numerous branches and [[meander]]s (before 1777, in the perimeter of the city there were 25 meanders [[Source (river or stream)|downstream]] and 14 [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]]). After systematisation works in 1777, the number of meanders in the city dropped to 9 [[wikt:downstream|downstream]] and 5 [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]], the total length of the river now being at {{convert|36.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} within the city. Systematisation performed up to the mid-19th century configured the existing Some\u0219 riverbed; [[Levee|embankments]] were built {{convert|17.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long on the right bank and {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the left. In 1970, the embankments were raised by {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}\u2013{{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}}, protecting 52,000 hectares within the city limits and restoring nearly 800 ha of agricultural land that had previously been flooded.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe flora associated with the town of Satu Mare is characteristic for the meadow area with trees of soft essence like [[wicker]], indigenous [[Populus|poplar]], [[maple]] and [[Corylus avellana|hazelnut]]. Grassland vegetation is represented by ''[[Agrostis stolonifera]]'', ''[[Poa trivialis]]'', ''[[Alopecurus pratensis]]'' and other types of vegetation.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nThe city's largest park, the [[Garden of Rome]], features some rare trees that are uncommon to the area, including the [[Styphnolobium japonicum|pagoda tree]], native to East Asia (especially China); ''[[Pterocarya]]'', also native to Asia; and ''[[Paulownia tomentosa]]'', native to central and western China.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\nFauna is represented by species of rodents ([[hamster]] and [[european ground squirrel]]), reptiles, including ''[[Vipera berus]]'' in the Noroieni forest, and as avifauna species of [[duck]]s, [[Goose|geese]], [[egret]]s, during passages and systematic occasional wanderings.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nSatu Mare has a [[continental climate]], characterised by hot dry summers and cold winters. As the city is in the far north of the country, winter is much colder than the national average, with minimum temperatures reaching {{convert|-17|C|F|0}}, lower than values recorded in other cities in western Romania like [[Oradea]] ({{convert|-15|C|F|0}}) or [[Timi\u0219oara]] ({{convert|-17|C|F|0}}). The average annual temperature is {{convert|9.6|C|F|0}}, or broken down by seasons: [[Spring (season)|Spring]] {{convert|10.2|C|F|0}}, [[summer]] {{convert|19.6|C|F|0}}, [[autumn]] {{convert|10.8|C|F|0}} and [[winter]] {{convert|1.7|C|F|0}}.<ref name=\"Geografie\"/> Atmospheric humidity is quite high. Prevailing wind currents blow in from the northwest, bringing spring and summer rainfall. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

In 1562 the citadel was besieged by Ottoman armies led by [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha]] of [[Buda]] and Maleoci Pasha of [[Timi\u0219oara]]. Then the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] besieged it, leading the fleeing [[Transylvania]]n armies to set it on fire. The Austrian general Lazar Schwendi ordered the citadel to be rebuilt after the plans of Italian architect Ottavio Baldigara; using an Italian system of fortifications, the new structure would be pentagonal with five towers.<ref name=\"History\"/> After a period when it changed hands, the town came under Ottoman control in 1661. Called ''Sokmar'' by the new authorities, it was a [[kaza]] center within the [[S\u00e2niob|\u015eenk\u00f6y]] [[sanjak]] of [[Varat Eyalet]].

In the 18th century, intense urbanisation began; several buildings survive from that period, including the old city hall, the inn, a barracks, the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic]] church and the [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed]] church. A [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Satu Mare|Roman Catholic diocese]] was established there in 1804. In 1823, the city's systematization commission was established in order to direct its local government. In 1844, paving operations begun in 1805 were stepped up. The first industrial concerns also opened, including the steam mill, the brick factory, the Neuschloss Factory for wood products, the lumber factory, the Princz Factory and the Unio Factory. Due to its location at the intersection of commercial roads, Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti became and important rail hub. The Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti\u2013Nagyk\u00e1roly ([[Carei]]) line was built in 1871, followed in 1872 by the Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti\u2013M\u00e1ramarossziget ([[Sighetu Marma\u0163iei]]) line, an 1894 link to Nagyb\u00e1nya ([[Baia Mare]]), 1900 to Erd\u0151d ([[Ardud]]) and 1906 to Biksz\u00e1d ([[Bixad, Satu Mare|Bixad]]).<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nSince the second half of the 19th century, it underwent important economic and socio-cultural changes. The city's large companies (the Unio wagon factory, the Princz Factory, the Ardeleana textile enterprise, the Freund petroleum refinery, the brick factory and the furniture factory) prospered in this period, and the city invested heavily in communication lines, schools, hospitals, public works and public parks. The banking and commerce system also developed: in 1929 the [[chamber of commerce and industry]], as well as the commodities stock market were established, with 25 commercial enterprises and 75 industrial and production firms as members. In 1930 there were 33 banks.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nAfter the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]], Romanian troops captured the town during their offensive launched on April 15, 1919.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Transylvania |url= http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/440.html |publisher=Atlantic Research and Publications, Inc. |author=B\u00e9la K\u00f6peczi (editor)|accessdate=2010-08-18}}{{ISBN|0-88033-497-5}}\n</ref> By the [[Treaty of Trianon]]] Satu Mare officially ceased to be part of Hungary becoming part of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].
