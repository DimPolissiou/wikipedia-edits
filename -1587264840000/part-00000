Zealand]], run at Alexandra Park.  In recent years the race has been held in late April or early May.  \n\nThe New Zealand Messenger Championship has traditionally been the most prestigious 4 year-old race in New Zealand, and a key guide to feature races in the following season like the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and [[Auckland Pacing Cup| Auckland Cup]].  This is evidenced by New Zealand Messenger Championship winners and subsequent Cup victors such as Lazarus, [[Auckland Reactor]], [[Monkey King (horse)| Monkey King]], Mainland Banner, [[Elsu]] and Just An Excuse to name a few. \n\nFor the 2013 and 2014 years 5 year olds were also eligible to compete in the race.\n\n== Winners list ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

They found a bassist but had difficulty finding a vocalist. When Teru made a tape of his singing and gave it to Takuro he was immediately recruited for the part, leaving the drums part to be filled by another person. On the search for a second guitarist, [[Hisashi (musician)|Hisashi]] was asked to join but declined the offer, as he was already part of a locally well-known heavy punk/rock band called Ari, which better suited his taste in music. Hisashi eventually accepted Takuro's offer and became Glay's lead guitarist after Ari disbanded.<ref name=\"Glad to be Glay\">{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/hisashi03.html| title=Hisashi's interview for GROOVY Magazine - translation| accessdate=2008-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804073840/http://geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/hisashi03.html|archivedate=2009-08-04}}</ref> Officially, the name \"Glay\" is a deliberate misspelling of the word \"[[gray]]\" and represents the style of music they wanted to play: a mixture between rock (black) and pop (white).<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\"/> Friday magazine ran an article quoting a former classmate of a band member as saying the \"glay\" spelling was a simple spelling mistake rather than a deliberate decision.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Confusing the R and L is a very common mistake amongst Japanese speakers of English, because the Japanese language does not distinguish between the retroflex (\"r\") and lateral (\"l\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nBy the time of Takuro and Teru's graduation, Glay were enjoying some popularity in their hometown of Hakodate and were playing full live houses. Following Hisashi's high school graduation in 1990, the three moved to [[Tokyo]] to try to further expand their musical career. The bassist and the drummer chose to stay in Hakodate. In Tokyo, they found a completely different situation: although they had been relatively popular in their hometown, it was not easy to begin a career in Tokyo. Their concerts attracted few people, and sometimes none at all,<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1998/int/980309/the_arts.music.the_day_t10.html# |title=The Day the Phones Died |accessdate=2008-05-23 |work=Time |date=March 9, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224235216/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1998/int/980309/the_arts.music.the_day_t10.html |archivedate=December 24, 2007 }}</ref> and many live houses would not accept them because they did not fit well into either rock or pop categories.

When their bassist quit, Takuro knew that [[Jiro (musician)|Jiro]], who was also from Hakodate and had played with the indie band Pierrot (different from the now disbanded [[Pierrot (band)|Pierrot]], that enjoyed mainstream popularity), had moved to Tokyo and invited him to join Glay. He too, declined the offer, insisting that he was already heading in the right direction for himself. It wasn't until Takuro asked him to play at just one show to fill in for their missing bassist that he decided to go. Following that show, Jiro continued to receive invitations to play with Glay, and eventually he became Glay's official bass player, finalizing the official four member lineup.<ref name=\"Glad to be Glay 3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/jiro03.html| title=Jiro's interview for GROOVY Magazine - Translation|accessdate=2008-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804073841/http://geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/jiro03.html|archivedate=2009-08-04}}</ref>\n\nThey promoted the band by handing out flyers on the street and giving out demo tapes. Eventually they became better known on the Tokyo live house circuit, and began drawing larger crowds. Eventually, [[Hide (musician)|hide]] of [[X Japan]] gave one of Glay's demos to his bandmate [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]].

Their 4th single \"Freeze My Love\" made it onto the Oricon Top 20, debuting at No.&nbsp;19. Two months later their second album, ''[[Speed Pop]]'', peaked at No.&nbsp;8. It was their first album released on Platinum Records, a division of [[PolyGram]] that Yoshiki founded that same year. Their first No.&nbsp;1 hit was in 1996 with their third album ''[[Beat Out!]]'', which was marked as a major turning point in Glay's career. Released later that same year, the fourth album ''[[Beloved (Glay album)|Beloved]]'' was their first album to sell over 1 million copies. In September 1996, Glay played the final concert of the \"Beat Out! Reprise Tour\" at [[Nippon Budokan]], their first concert at the venue, which is stated by them to have been their biggest dream coming true. In August 1997, their 12th single \"[[However (song)|However]]\" remained at the top of the charts for two weeks in a row and, after it was displaced by [[Zard]]'s single \"[[Eien (Zard song)|Eien]]\" for one week, it re-appeared at the top position for another three weeks.\n\nSince then, Glay has produced several hit singles, most of them reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the charts. In the period between 1997 and 2000, Glay produced six million-selling singles, being the third artist with most million-selling singles of all time. Their 13th single \"[[Yuuwaku (song)|Yuuwaku]]\" topped Oricon yearly single ranking in 1998. In 1999, their 16th single \"[[Winter, Again (song)|Winter, Again]]\" was number two of the year and won the [[41st Japan Record Awards]] \"Grand Prix\" award, which is considered the most important Japanese music award. Their albums were also massively successful; both ''[[Pure Soul]]'' (1998) and ''[[Heavy Gauge]]'' (1999), along with the compilation album ''[[Drive: Glay Complete Best|Drive - Glay Complete Best]]'' (2000), sold more than two million copies each.\n\nThe impact of their popularity was such that, in 1998, Japan's telephone service was temporarily put out of order due to the mass number of fans trying to reserve tickets to their upcoming tour.<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\"/> The [[1998 Winter Olympics]] were being held, and press coverage of the event became chaotic because of the incident.<ref name=\"The Day in Music\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4716974-1.html|title=This Day in Music For February 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn this period, the band won several prizes and established some records. In 1997, the album ''[[Review (Glay album)|Review - Best of Glay]]'' stayed for five weeks in a row at the top position of the Oricon charts and became the all-time best-selling album in Japan at the time, with almost 5 million copies sold.<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\"/> (at present, it is ranked at No.&nbsp;3 spot, according to Oricon). Their 1999 video-single \"Survival\" sold approximately 900 thousand copies, and is up to the present the all-time best-selling video/DVD. In the same year,  their first \"Expo\" concert would lure a record audience of 200,000 people (see \"Glay Expo\").\n\n1999 was the year Glay played their first dome tour, \"Glay Dome Tour \"pure soul\" 1999\", which made the band the first to hold a consecutive 5 day \"dome\" concert. This tour had a total of 15 performances in four venues and attracted a total audience of 750,000 people. Glay closed the year of 1999, playing the concert \"The Millennium Eve - A Christmas Present for the People Who Love Live a Lot\", a joint concert with [[Luna Sea]], on December 23, and the \"Glay Countdown Live in Messe \"Come Together\"\" on December 31.\n\nTakuro described the \"Expo'99\" as a dream come true. When the album ''[[Heavy Gauge]]'' was released, in October 1999, Takuro wrote a diary entry in Glay's official home page, describing the album as a representation of his feelings at that moment. His feelings were not of happiness, but of \"emptiness\" and not knowing what to do after \"doing everything\" they wanted to. The album is seen as a first step to a new direction in the band's career.<ref name=\"Shiroi Heiya\">{{cite web|url=http://web.pitas.com/jrock/13_12_2002.html|title=A Glay Rant (Shiroi Heiya article)|accessdate=2008-05-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508144426/http://web.pitas.com/jrock/13_12_2002.html|archivedate=2008-05-08}}</ref> The band considered disbanding in 2000, after releasing their [[Drive: Glay Complete Best|second compilation album]], which was a suggestion made by fellow singer [[Yuki Isoya]], whose group [[Judy and Mary]] had disbanded.\n\n===2001\u20132003===\nAfter this period of massive success and a considerably steady style in their music, Glay's work took a turn in 2001. Their 2001 album ''[[One Love (Glay album)|One Love]]'' got mixed feelings among the fans, due to its disparities to their earlier works, with a different, generally poppier and experimental sound, and songs that had reggae and R&B influences. Their 2002 album ''[[Unity Roots and Family, Away]]'', which was almost completely made of slow-paced songs and also had elements from other types of music (gospel, rap and traditional [[Okinawa]]n music), was not welcomed by most fans.<ref name=\"Shiroi Heiya\"/>\n\nIn spite of the \"cold\" reception these works had, the band reached No.&nbsp;1 spot in the charts with both albums. Glay continued being successful with their tours in Japan. They proved to enjoy popularity outside Japan as well, in 2001, when members visited [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]] to promote the Expo 2001 \"Global Communication\" and officially invited artists Dome, [[Nicholas Tse]], [[Mayday (Taiwanese band)|Mayday]] and [[Jaurim]] to participate in one of the Expo concerts. The next year, they played outside Japan for the first time (not counting one concert in Hawaii for their fanclub members), when they played a sold-out live performance for a 35,000 audience in Beijing. The concert is the most expensive in [[China]]'s history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml# |title=The Japan Zone newsletter |publisher=Japan-zone.com |accessdate=2011-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012170712/http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml |archive-date=2008-10-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Glay also met then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20021002sm.html |title=Glay strikes the right chord with Chinese leader Zemin &#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2002-10-02 |accessdate=2011-07-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, they made a contract transfer from Pony Canyon to [[Toshiba EMI]], the most expensive transfer in Japan's history, at 4 billion [[yen]].<ref name=\"Japan Zone Newsletter\">{{cite web| url=http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml| title=Japan-zone note| accessdate=2008-05-23| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012170712/http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml| archive-date=2008-10-12| url-status=dead}}</ref> Under the new company, Glay released their first DVD\u2014single \"Itsuka\" and their first B-Side compilation albums, ''[[Glay Rare Collectives vol. 1 and 2|Rare Collectives Vol.1]]'' and ''[[Glay Rare Collectives vol. 1 and 2|Rare Collectives Vol. 2]]''.\n\nAlso in 2003, an art gallery dedicated to Glay was opened in their hometown, Hakodate. \"Art Style of Glay\" was located in the Winning Hall, a famous building in the city and remained open until 2007.\n\n===2004: 10th Anniversary===\nIn 2004, Glay had several activities to celebrate their 10th anniversary since their major debut. As a start to this celebration, Glay presented the concert \"Rock Shock vol. 3\" in 2003. The name was taken from an indie festival organized by Glay in 1989, which had had two editions. In March of that year, they released their 9th studio album, ''[[The Frustrated]]'', and in order to promote the album, the band held the \"Glay Concert Tour 2004 X-Rated\" and later, in October, the \"Glay Arena Tour 2004 \"The Frustrated\" -Extreme-\".\n\nOn July 27 they played a \"pre-Expo\" concert at Universal Studios Japan and on July 31, they played the third edition of the \"Glay Expo\", which was the main event of the year by the band. At the end of the year they held the fan-club exclusive \"Countdown Live in Messe \"Come Together\"\" on December 31. They finished the 10th anniversary celebration with the release of the compilation ''[[Ballad Best Singles: White Road]]'' in January 2005 and with the \"10th Anniversary Year Final Glay Dome Tour 2005 \"White Road\"\" which finished with the \"Glay 10th Anniversary Year Final Glay Osaka 4 Days Special 2005 \"White Road\"\".\n\n===2005\u20132006: Rebirth===\nIn 2005, after years of touring, promoting, and recording, the four took a hiatus. Their only new release as a group was the single \"Scream\", their first collaboration work, with the vocal\u2013dance group [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]]. \"Scream\", which was released under Exile's record company, was the fifth best selling single of the year.\n\nDuring that time, Jiro created a side band with [[the pillows]] guitarist Sawao Yamanaka and [[Straightener (band)|Straightener]]'s drummer Nakayama Shinpei called [[The Predators (Japanese band)|The Predators]], in the summer of 2005. The Predators played in summer festivals and released the mini-album ''Hunting!''. Teru and Hisashi formed a band called Rally with [[The Mad Capsule Markets]] drummer Motokatsu and bassist Koji Ueno from [[Thee Michelle Gun Elephant]]. Rally contributed a cover of [[Buck-Tick]]'s \"Aku no Hana\" for the tribute CD ''[[Parade -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-]]''.\n\nAlthough it was believed that Glay took a break as a group to take a rest, it was later reported in the news that the band had split from their former agency, Unlimited Group. The reasons were obscure, but the event managed to delay the band's work. Information about the episode has always been unclear, as the band just refers to it as a time when they \"couldn't move forward\" and \"had thoughts of quitting\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nikkansports.com/ns/entertainment/p-et-tp0-060210-0007.html| title=Nikkansports note|accessdate=2008-05-23 | language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"Dailysports\">{{cite web|url=http://www.daily.co.jp/gossip/2006/02/10/204541.shtml |title=Daily Sports note |accessdate=2008-05-23 |language=Japanese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111042829/http://www.daily.co.jp/gossip/2006/02/10/204541.shtml |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}</ref> ''Cyzo'' Magazine's October 2005 issue had reported Glay's management dispute and referred to it as a media taboo.<ref name=\"Cyzo Magazine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cyzo.com/| title=Cyzo Magazine Website|accessdate=2008-10-12 | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, Glay ended their silence by having a two-day live performance in Zepp Tokyo and a three-day live performance at [[Nippon Budokan]], titled \"Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\", which was produced as an independent event.

In the following month, they collaborated with former [[Boowy]] vocalist [[Kyosuke Himuro]] in their single \"Answer\". Together, they performed in \"Kyosuke Himuro + Glay Swing Addiction 2006\", with \"Answer\" being one of the songs. In August, Glay performed at [[Southern All Stars]]'s summer concert ''Mujintou'' alongside various artists. In September, \"Natsuoto/Henna Yume -Thousand Dreams-\" was released, with Natsuoto being the theme song to TV show ''Koi suru Hanikami''.\n\nFollowing the release of these singles was their tour, \"Rock 'n' Roll Swindle -Re-Birth-\" from November 2006 to early 2007.\n\n===2007\u20132008===\nOn January 31, 2007, Glay released their tenth full-length studio album, [[Love Is Beautiful (album)|Love is Beautiful]], containing 14 tracks, which reached No.&nbsp;1 spot and was their 10th album to do so, Until then, Glay had been the all-male band with most No.&nbsp;1 albums in Japan, but later that year [[Mr. Children]] would replace them.<ref>[https://archive.is/20090120174341/http://contents.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/44595/- Oricon webpage's special page]</ref> Following the release of this album was their arena tour, titled after the album.\n\nAlthough there was not much to promote, Glay was very active as a live band. Over the summer of 2007, they performed at the \"15th Anniversary Cue Music Jam-Boree\" in Yubari on July 1 and produced the \"Rock Shock. Vol. 4\" on August 23, 2007.

They found a bassist but had difficulty finding a vocalist. When Teru made a tape of his singing and gave it to Takuro he was immediately recruited for the part, leaving the drums part to be filled by another person. On the search for a second guitarist, [[Hisashi (musician)|Hisashi]] was asked to join but declined the offer, as he was already part of a locally well-known heavy punk/rock band called Ari, which better suited his taste in music. Hisashi eventually accepted Takuro's offer and became Glay's lead guitarist after Ari disbanded.<ref name=\"Glad to be Glay\">{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/hisashi03.html| title=Hisashi's interview for GROOVY Magazine - translation| accessdate=2008-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804073840/http://geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/hisashi03.html|archivedate=2009-08-04}}</ref> Officially, the name \"Glay\" is a deliberate misspelling of the word \"[[gray]]\" and represents the style of music they wanted to play: a mixture between rock (black) and pop (white).<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\"/> Friday magazine ran an article quoting a former classmate of a band member as saying the \"glay\" spelling was a simple spelling mistake rather than a deliberate decision.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Confusing the R and L is a very common mistake amongst Japanese speakers of English, because the Japanese language does not distinguish between the retroflex (\"r\") and lateral (\"l\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nBy the time of Takuro and Teru's graduation, Glay were enjoying some popularity in their hometown of Hakodate and were playing full live houses. Following Hisashi's high school graduation in 1990, the three moved to [[Tokyo]] to try to further expand their musical career. The bassist and the drummer chose to stay in Hakodate. In Tokyo, they found a completely different situation: although they had been relatively popular in their hometown, it was not easy to begin a career in Tokyo. Their concerts attracted few people, and sometimes none at all,<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1998/int/980309/the_arts.music.the_day_t10.html# |title=The Day the Phones Died |accessdate=2008-05-23 |work=Time |date=March 9, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224235216/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1998/int/980309/the_arts.music.the_day_t10.html |archivedate=December 24, 2007 }}</ref> and many live houses would not accept them because they did not fit well into either rock or pop categories.

When their bassist quit, Takuro knew that [[Jiro (musician)|Jiro]], who was also from Hakodate and had played with the indie band Pierrot (different from the now disbanded [[Pierrot (band)|Pierrot]], that enjoyed mainstream popularity), had moved to Tokyo and invited him to join Glay. He too, declined the offer, insisting that he was already heading in the right direction for himself. It wasn't until Takuro asked him to play at just one show to fill in for their missing bassist that he decided to go. Following that show, Jiro continued to receive invitations to play with Glay, and eventually he became Glay's official bass player, finalizing the official four member lineup.<ref name=\"Glad to be Glay 3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/jiro03.html| title=Jiro's interview for GROOVY Magazine - Translation|accessdate=2008-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804073841/http://geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Arena/4919/jiro03.html|archivedate=2009-08-04}}</ref>\n\nThey promoted the band by handing out flyers on the street and giving out demo tapes. Eventually they became better known on the Tokyo live house circuit, and began drawing larger crowds. Eventually, [[Hide (musician)|hide]] of [[X Japan]] gave one of Glay's demos to his bandmate [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]]. During an October 1993 show, Yoshiki and his entourage came to watch and offered the band a contract to his record label [[Extasy Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=VISUAL JAPAN SUMMIT 2016 Day 2: Part 3|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-123483-visual-japan-summit-2016-day-2-part-3.html|work=jame-world.com|accessdate=2016-11-16}}</ref> Their debut single, \"Rain\", and their first album, ''[[Hai to Diamond]]'', were both released on May 25, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.en.barks.jp/news/?id=1000004618|title=GLAY Rereleases Album From Indie Days In Anthology Format|work=Barks|accessdate=2015-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423204002/http://www.en.barks.jp/news/?id=1000004618|archive-date=2015-04-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1995\u20132000===\nAfter the time of their debut, Glay steadily became more popular. Their 4th single \"Freeze My Love\" made it onto the Oricon Top 20, debuting at No.&nbsp;19. Two months later their second album, ''[[Speed Pop]]'', peaked at No.&nbsp;8. It was their first album released on Platinum Records, a division of [[PolyGram]] that Yoshiki founded that same year. Their first No.&nbsp;1 hit was in 1996 with their third album ''[[Beat Out!]]'', which was marked as a major turning point in Glay's career. Released later that same year, the fourth album ''[[Beloved (Glay album)|Beloved]]'' was their first album to sell over 1 million copies. In September 1996, Glay played the final concert of the \"Beat Out! Reprise Tour\" at [[Nippon Budokan]], their first concert at the venue, which is stated by them to have been their biggest dream coming true. In August 1997, their 12th single \"[[However (song)|However]]\" remained at the top of the charts for two weeks in a row and, after it was displaced by [[Zard]]'s single \"[[Eien (Zard song)|Eien]]\" for one week, it re-appeared at the top position for another three weeks.\n\nSince then, Glay has produced several hit singles, most of them reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the charts. In the period between 1997 and 2000, Glay produced six million-selling singles, being the third artist with most million-selling singles of all time. Their 13th single \"[[Yuuwaku (song)|Yuuwaku]]\" topped Oricon yearly single ranking in 1998. In 1999, their 16th single \"[[Winter, Again (song)|Winter, Again]]\" was number two of the year and won the [[41st Japan Record Awards]] \"Grand Prix\" award, which is considered the most important Japanese music award. Their albums were also massively successful; both ''[[Pure Soul]]'' (1998) and ''[[Heavy Gauge]]'' (1999), along with the compilation album ''[[Drive: Glay Complete Best|Drive - Glay Complete Best]]'' (2000), sold more than two million copies each.\n\nThe impact of their popularity was such that, in 1998, Japan's telephone service was temporarily put out of order due to the mass number of fans trying to reserve tickets to their upcoming tour.<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\"/> The [[1998 Winter Olympics]] were being held, and press coverage of the event became chaotic because of the incident.<ref name=\"The Day in Music\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4716974-1.html|title=This Day in Music For February 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn this period, the band won several prizes and established some records. In 1997, the album ''[[Review (Glay album)|Review - Best of Glay]]'' stayed for five weeks in a row at the top position of the Oricon charts and became the all-time best-selling album in Japan at the time, with almost 5 million copies sold.<ref name=\"Time Magazine Article\"/> (at present, it is ranked at No.&nbsp;3 spot, according to Oricon). Their 1999 video-single \"Survival\" sold approximately 900 thousand copies, and is up to the present the all-time best-selling video/DVD. In the same year,  their first \"Expo\" concert would lure a record audience of 200,000 people (see \"Glay Expo\").\n\n1999 was the year Glay played their first dome tour, \"Glay Dome Tour \"pure soul\" 1999\", which made the band the first to hold a consecutive 5 day \"dome\" concert. This tour had a total of 15 performances in four venues and attracted a total audience of 750,000 people. Glay closed the year of 1999, playing the concert \"The Millennium Eve - A Christmas Present for the People Who Love Live a Lot\", a joint concert with [[Luna Sea]], on December 23, and the \"Glay Countdown Live in Messe \"Come Together\"\" on December 31.\n\nTakuro described the \"Expo'99\" as a dream come true. When the album ''[[Heavy Gauge]]'' was released, in October 1999, Takuro wrote a diary entry in Glay's official home page, describing the album as a representation of his feelings at that moment. His feelings were not of happiness, but of \"emptiness\" and not knowing what to do after \"doing everything\" they wanted to. The album is seen as a first step to a new direction in the band's career.<ref name=\"Shiroi Heiya\">{{cite web|url=http://web.pitas.com/jrock/13_12_2002.html|title=A Glay Rant (Shiroi Heiya article)|accessdate=2008-05-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508144426/http://web.pitas.com/jrock/13_12_2002.html|archivedate=2008-05-08}}</ref> The band considered disbanding in 2000, after releasing their [[Drive: Glay Complete Best|second compilation album]], which was a suggestion made by fellow singer [[Yuki Isoya]], whose group [[Judy and Mary]] had disbanded.\n\n===2001\u20132003===\nAfter this period of massive success and a considerably steady style in their music, Glay's work took a turn in 2001. Their 2001 album ''[[One Love (Glay album)|One Love]]'' got mixed feelings among the fans, due to its disparities to their earlier works, with a different, generally poppier and experimental sound, and songs that had reggae and R&B influences. Their 2002 album ''[[Unity Roots and Family, Away]]'', which was almost completely made of slow-paced songs and also had elements from other types of music (gospel, rap and traditional [[Okinawa]]n music), was not welcomed by most fans.<ref name=\"Shiroi Heiya\"/>\n\nIn spite of the \"cold\" reception these works had, the band reached No.&nbsp;1 spot in the charts with both albums. Glay continued being successful with their tours in Japan. They proved to enjoy popularity outside Japan as well, in 2001, when members visited [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]] to promote the Expo 2001 \"Global Communication\" and officially invited artists Dome, [[Nicholas Tse]], [[Mayday (Taiwanese band)|Mayday]] and [[Jaurim]] to participate in one of the Expo concerts. The next year, they played outside Japan for the first time (not counting one concert in Hawaii for their fanclub members), when they played a sold-out live performance for a 35,000 audience in Beijing. The concert is the most expensive in [[China]]'s history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml# |title=The Japan Zone newsletter |publisher=Japan-zone.com |accessdate=2011-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012170712/http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml |archive-date=2008-10-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Glay also met then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20021002sm.html |title=Glay strikes the right chord with Chinese leader Zemin &#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2002-10-02 |accessdate=2011-07-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, they made a contract transfer from Pony Canyon to [[Toshiba EMI]], the most expensive transfer in Japan's history, at 4 billion [[yen]].<ref name=\"Japan Zone Newsletter\">{{cite web| url=http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml| title=Japan-zone note| accessdate=2008-05-23| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012170712/http://www.japan-zone.com/japanzine/japanzine30.shtml| archive-date=2008-10-12| url-status=dead}}</ref> Under the new company, Glay released their first DVD\u2014single \"Itsuka\" and their first B-Side compilation albums, ''[[Glay Rare Collectives vol. 1 and 2|Rare Collectives Vol.1]]'' and ''[[Glay Rare Collectives vol. 1 and 2|Rare Collectives Vol. 2]]''.\n\nAlso in 2003, an art gallery dedicated to Glay was opened in their hometown, Hakodate. \"Art Style of Glay\" was located in the Winning Hall, a famous building in the city and remained open until 2007.\n\n===2004: 10th Anniversary===\nIn 2004, Glay had several activities to celebrate their 10th anniversary since their major debut. As a start to this celebration, Glay presented the concert \"Rock Shock vol. 3\" in 2003. The name was taken from an indie festival organized by Glay in 1989, which had had two editions. In March of that year, they released their 9th studio album, ''[[The Frustrated]]'', and in order to promote the album, the band held the \"Glay Concert Tour 2004 X-Rated\" and later, in October, the \"Glay Arena Tour 2004 \"The Frustrated\" -Extreme-\".\n\nOn July 27 they played a \"pre-Expo\" concert at Universal Studios Japan and on July 31, they played the third edition of the \"Glay Expo\", which was the main event of the year by the band. At the end of the year they held the fan-club exclusive \"Countdown Live in Messe \"Come Together\"\" on December 31. They finished the 10th anniversary celebration with the release of the compilation ''[[Ballad Best Singles: White Road]]'' in January 2005 and with the \"10th Anniversary Year Final Glay Dome Tour 2005 \"White Road\"\" which finished with the \"Glay 10th Anniversary Year Final Glay Osaka 4 Days Special 2005 \"White Road\"\".\n\n===2005\u20132006: Rebirth===\nIn 2005, after years of touring, promoting, and recording, the four took a hiatus. Their only new release as a group was the single \"Scream\", their first collaboration work, with the vocal\u2013dance group [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]]. \"Scream\", which was released under Exile's record company, was the fifth best selling single of the year.\n\nDuring that time, Jiro created a side band with [[the pillows]] guitarist Sawao Yamanaka and [[Straightener (band)|Straightener]]'s drummer Nakayama Shinpei called [[The Predators (Japanese band)|The Predators]], in the summer of 2005. The Predators played in summer festivals and released the mini-album ''Hunting!''. Teru and Hisashi formed a band called Rally with [[The Mad Capsule Markets]] drummer Motokatsu and bassist Koji Ueno from [[Thee Michelle Gun Elephant]].

It also takes into consideration its four Ps, its risks and POVs, and its constraints (calendar, costs, and norms of quality). The goal is to determine whether the project should go ahead, be redesigned, or else abandoned altogether.<ref>Mesly, Olivier. (2017). ''Project feasibility \u2013 Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press. 546 pages. ISBN 9 781498 757911. See page 130.</ref> The five frames of analysis are: The frame of definition; the frame of contextual risks; the frame of potentiality; the parametric frame; the frame of dominant and contingency strategies.\n\nThe four Ps are traditionally defined as Plan, Processes, People, and Power. The risks are considered to be external to the project (e.g., weather conditions) and are divided in eight categories: (Plan) financial and organizational (e.g., government structure for a private project); (Processes) environmental and technological; (People) marketing and sociocultural; and (Power) legal and political. POVs are Points of Vulnerability: they differ from risks in the sense that they are internal to the project and can be controlled or else eliminated.\n\nThe constraints are the standard constraints of calendar, costs and norms of quality that can each be objectively determined and measured along the entire project lifecycle. Depending on projects, portions of the study may suffice to produce a feasibility study; smaller projects, for example, may not require an exhaustive environmental assessment.\n\n== Common factors ==\nThe acronym [[TELOS (project management)|TELOS]] refers to the five areas of feasibility -  Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational and Scheduling.\n\n===Technical feasibility===\nThis assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project.<ref>Blecke, Curtis.

It is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system<ref name=\"Management Information Systems 10e\">O'Brien, J. A., & Marakas, G. M. (2011).

Factors that make one method being preferred to other method in agricultural projects are the following:\n* Availability of inputs or raw materials and their quality and prices. \n* Availability of markets for outputs of each method and the expected prices for these outputs.\n* Various efficiency factors such as the expected increase in one additional unit of fertilizer or productivity of a specified crop per one thing\n\n==== Production technique ====\nAfter we determine the appropriate method of production of a commodity, it is necessary to look for the optimal technique to produce this commodity. \n \n==== Project requirements ====\nOnce the method of production and its technique are determined, technical people have to determine the projects' requirements during the investment and operating periods. These include:\n* Determination of tools and equipment needed for the project such as drinkers and feeders or pumps or pipes ...etc.\n* Determination of projects' requirements of constructions such as buildings, storage, and roads ...etc. in addition to internal designs for these requirements.\n* Determination of projects' requirements of skilled and unskilled  labor and managerial and financial labor.\n* Determination of construction period concerning the costs of designs and consultations and the costs of constructions and other tools.\n* Determination of minimum storage of inputs, cash money to cope with operating and contingency costs.\n\n==== Project location ====\nThe most important factors that determine the selection of project location are the following:\n* Availability of land (proper acreage and reasonable costs). \n* The impact of the project on the environment and the approval of the concerned institutions for license.\n* The costs of transporting inputs and outputs to the project's location (i.e., the distance from the markets).\n* Availability of various services related to the project such as availability of extension services or veterinary or water or electricity or good roads ...etc.\n\n===Legal feasibility===\nIt determines whether the proposed system conflicts with legal requirements, e.g., a data processing system must comply with the local data protection regulations and if the proposed venture is acceptable in accordance to the laws of the land.\n\n===Operational feasibility study===\nOperational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.<ref name=\"SAD-Global_Enterprise\">Bentley, L & Whitten, J (2007). ''System Analysis & Design for the Global Enterprise''. 7th ed. (p. 417).</ref>\n\nThe operational feasibility assessment focuses on the degree to which the proposed development project fits in with the existing business environment and objectives with regard to development schedule, delivery date, [[corporate culture]] and existing business processes.\n\nTo ensure success, desired operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early design phases.<ref name=\"SE_and_Analysis\">[[Benjamin S. Blanchard]] & [[Wolt Fabrycky]] (uk). ''Systems Engineering & Analysis ''. 5th ed. (p. 361).</ref>\n\n===Time feasibility===\nA time feasibility study will take into account the period in which the project is going to take up to its completion. A project will fail if it takes too long to be completed before it is useful. Typically this means estimating how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in a given time period using some methods like payback period. Time feasibility is a measure of how reasonable the project timetable is. Given our technical expertise, are the project deadlines reasonable? Some projects are initiated with specific deadlines. It is necessary to determine whether the deadlines are mandatory or desirable.\n\n==Other feasibility factors==\n\n===Resource feasibility===\nDescribe how much time is available to build the new system, when it can be built, whether it interferes with normal business operations, type and amount of resources required, dependencies, and developmental procedures with company revenue prospectus.\n\n===Financial feasibility===\nIn case of a new project, financial viability can be judged on the following parameters:\n\n* Total estimated cost of the project\n* Financing of the project in terms of its capital structure, debt to equity ratio and promoter's share of total cost\n* Existing investment by the promoter in any other business\n* Projected cash flow and profitability\n\nThe financial viability of a project should provide the following information:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/contract-issues/assessing-financial-viability/practice.html|title=ASSESSING FINANCIAL VIABILITY|first=Department of|last=Finance|date=30 October 2013|website=www.finance.gov.au|access-date=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217155255/http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/contract-issues/assessing-financial-viability/practice.html|archive-date=17 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Full details of the assets to be financed and how liquid those assets are.\n* Rate of conversion to cash-liquidity (i.e., how easily the various assets can be converted to cash).\n* Project's funding potential and repayment terms.\n* Sensitivity in the repayments capability to the following factors:\n** Mild slowing of sales.\n** Acute reduction/slowing of sales.\n** Small increase in cost.\n** Large increase in cost.\n** Adverse economic conditions.\nIn 1983 the first generation of the Computer Model for Feasibility Analysis and Reporting (COMFAR), a computation tool for financial analysis of investments, was released. Since then, this United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) software has been developed to also support the economic appraisal of projects.\nThe COMFAR III Expert is intended as an aid in the analysis of investment projects. The main module of the program accepts financial and economic data, produces financial and economic statements and graphical displays and calculates measures of performance. Supplementary modules assist in the analytical process. Cost-benefit and value-added methods of economic analysis developed by UNIDO are included in the program and the methods of major international development institutions are accommodated.

A feasibility study aims to objectively and rationally uncover the strengths and weaknesses of an existing business or proposed venture, opportunities and threats present in the [[natural environment]], the [[resources]] required to carry through, and ultimately the prospects for success.<ref name=\"Justis\">Justis, R.

It also takes into consideration its four Ps, its risks and POVs, and its constraints (calendar, costs, and norms of quality). The goal is to determine whether the project should go ahead, be redesigned, or else abandoned altogether.<ref> Mesly, Olivier. (2017). ''Project feasibility \u2013 Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press. 546 pages. ISBN 9 781498 757911. See page 130.</ref>. The five frames of analysis are: The frame of definition; the frame of contextual risks; the frame of potentiality; the parametric frame; the frame of dominant and contingency strategies.\n\nThe four Ps are traditionally defined as Plan, Processes, People, and Power. The risks are considered to be external to the project (e.g., weather conditions) and are divided in eight categories: (Plan) financial and organizational (e.g., government structure for a private project); (Processes) environmental and technological; (People) marketing and sociocultural; and (Power) legal and political. POVs are Points of Vulnerability: they differ from risks in the sense that they are internal to the project and can be controlled or else eliminated.\n\nThe constraints are the standard constraints of calendar, costs and norms of quality that can each be objectively determined and measured along the entire project lifecycle. Depending on projects, portions of the study may suffice to produce a feasibility study; smaller projects, for example, may not require an exhaustive environmental assessment.\n\n== Common factors ==\nThe acronym [[TELOS (project management)|TELOS]] refers to the five areas of feasibility -  Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational and Scheduling.\n\n===Technical feasibility===  \nThis assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project.<ref>Blecke, Curtis.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1970.</ref> When writing a feasibility report, the following should be taken to consideration:\n* A brief description of the business to assess more possible factors which could affect the study\n* The part of the business being examined\n* The human and economic factor\n* The possible solutions to the problem    \n\nAt this level, the concern is whether the proposal is both ''technically'' and ''[[legally]]'' feasible (assuming moderate cost).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system. It is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system<ref name=\"Management Information Systems 10e\">O'Brien, J. A., & Marakas, G. M. (2011).

Factors that make one method being preferred to other method in agricultural projects are the following:\n* Availability of inputs or raw materials and their quality and prices. \n* Availability of markets for outputs of each method and the expected prices for these outputs.\n* Various efficiency factors such as the expected increase in one additional unit of fertilizer or productivity of a specified crop per one thing\n\n==== Production technique ====\nAfter we determine the appropriate method of production of a commodity, it is necessary to look for the optimal technique to produce this commodity. \n \n==== Project requirements ====\nOnce the method of production and its technique are determined, technical people have to determine the projects' requirements during the investment and operating periods. These include:\n* Determination of tools and equipment needed for the project such as drinkers and feeders or pumps or pipes \u2026etc.\n* Determination of projects' requirements of constructions such as buildings, storage, and roads \u2026etc. in addition to internal designs for these requirements.\n* Determination of projects' requirements of skilled and unskilled  labor and managerial and financial labor.\n* Determination of construction period concerning the costs of designs and consultations and the costs of constructions and other tools.\n* Determination of minimum storage of inputs, cash money to cope with operating and contingency costs.\n\n==== Project location ====\nThe most important factors that determine the selection of project location are the following:\n* Availability of land (proper acreage and reasonable costs). \n* The impact of the project on the environment and the approval of the concerned institutions for license.\n* The costs of transporting inputs and outputs to the project's location (i.e., the distance from the markets).\n* Availability of various services related to the project such as availability of extension services or veterinary or water or electricity or good roads ...etc.\n\n===Legal feasibility===\nIt determines whether the proposed system conflicts with legal requirements, e.g., a data processing system must comply with the local data protection regulations and if the proposed venture is acceptable in accordance to the laws of the land.\n\n===Operational feasibility study===\nOperational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.<ref name=\"SAD-Global_Enterprise\">Bentley, L & Whitten, J (2007). ''System Analysis & Design for the Global Enterprise''. 7th ed. (p. 417).</ref>\n\nThe operational feasibility assessment focuses on the degree to which the proposed development project fits in with the existing business environment and objectives with regard to development schedule, delivery date, [[corporate culture]] and existing business processes.\n\nTo ensure success, desired operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early design phases.<ref name=\"SE_and_Analysis\">[[Benjamin S. Blanchard]] & [[Wolt Fabrycky]] (uk). ''Systems Engineering & Analysis ''. 5th ed. (p. 361).</ref>\n\n===Time feasibility===\nA time feasibility study will take into account the period in which the project is going to take up to its completion. A project will fail if it takes too long to be completed before it is useful. Typically this means estimating how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in a given time period using some methods like payback period. Time feasibility is a measure of how reasonable the project timetable is. Given our technical expertise, are the project deadlines reasonable? Some projects are initiated with specific deadlines. It is necessary to determine whether the deadlines are mandatory or desirable.\n\n==Other feasibility factors==\n\n===Resource feasibility===\nDescribe how much time is available to build the new system, when it can be built, whether it interferes with normal business operations, type and amount of resources required, dependencies, and developmental procedures with company revenue prospectus.\n\n===Financial feasibility===\nIn case of a new project, financial viability can be judged on the following parameters:\n\n* Total estimated cost of the project\n* Financing of the project in terms of its capital structure, debt to equity ratio and promoter's share of total cost\n* Existing investment by the promoter in any other business\n* Projected cash flow and profitability\n\nThe financial viability of a project should provide the following information:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/contract-issues/assessing-financial-viability/practice.html|title=ASSESSING FINANCIAL VIABILITY|first=Department of|last=Finance|date=30 October 2013|website=www.finance.gov.au|access-date=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217155255/http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/contract-issues/assessing-financial-viability/practice.html|archive-date=17 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Full details of the assets to be financed and how liquid those assets are.\n* Rate of conversion to cash-liquidity (i.e., how easily the various assets can be converted to cash).\n* Project's funding potential and repayment terms.\n* Sensitivity in the repayments capability to the following factors:\n** Mild slowing of sales.\n** Acute reduction/slowing of sales.\n** Small increase in cost.\n** Large increase in cost.\n** Adverse economic conditions.\nIn 1983 the first generation of the Computer Model for Feasibility Analysis and Reporting (COMFAR), a computation tool for financial analysis of investments, was released. Since then, this United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) software has been developed to also support the economic appraisal of projects.\nThe COMFAR III Expert is intended as an aid in the analysis of investment projects. The main module of the program accepts financial and economic data, produces financial and economic statements and graphical displays and calculates measures of performance. Supplementary modules assist in the analytical process. Cost-benefit and value-added methods of economic analysis developed by UNIDO are included in the program and the methods of major international development institutions are accommodated. The program is applicable for the analysis of investment in new projects and expansion or rehabilitation of existing enterprises as, e.g., in the case of reprivatisation projects. For joint ventures, the financial perspective of each partner or class of shareholder can be developed. Analysis can be performed under a variety of assumptions concerning inflation, currency revaluation and price escalations.<ref>COMFAR III Expert Reference Manual United Nations Industrial Development Organisation.</ref>\n\n==[[Market research|Market research studies]]==\nThis is one of the most important sections of the feasibility study as it examines the marketability of the product or services and convinces readers that there is a potential market for the product or services.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} If a significant market for the product or services cannot be established, then there is no project.
