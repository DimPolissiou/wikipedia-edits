{"title_page": "Abortion in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Termination of a pregnancy in the United States}}\n\n[[Abortion]] is legal throughout the [[United States]] and its territories, although restrictions and accessibility vary from state to state. Abortion is a controversial and divisive issue in the society, culture and politics of the U.S., and various [[Abortion law|anti-abortion laws]] have been in force in each state since at least 1900.Before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decisions of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decriminalized abortion nationwide in 1973, abortion was already legal in several states, but the decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). \n\n==Terminology==\n{{Main|Abortion}}\nThe abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"[[induced abortion]]\" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref>According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':\n<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\n\n(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n\n(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>\n\nLikewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before [[Viability]] at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=Katie |title= Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1175\u20131180 |date=20 Dec 2019 |doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175 |pmid=30585581 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nIn medical parlance, \"abortion\" can refer to either [[miscarriage]] or abortion until the fetus is viable. After viability, doctors call an abortion a \"termination of pregnancy\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Rise of anti-abortion legislation===\n[[File:Map of US abortion laws pre-1973.svg|thumb|250px|right|Abortion laws in the U.S. before ''Roe'' {{legend|#ED1C24|Illegal (30)}}\n{{legend|#6F3198|Legal in case of rape (1)}}\n{{legend|#2F3699|Legal in case of danger to woman's health (2)}}\n{{legend|#22B14C|Legal in case of danger to woman's health, rape or incest, or likely damaged fetus (13)}}\n{{legend|#FFF200|Legal on request (4)}}{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} ]]\nWhen the United States first became independent, most states applied English [[common law]] to abortion.

Additionally, various anti-abortion statutes began to appear in the United States in the 1820s that codified or expanded common law. In 1821, a [[Connecticut]] law targeted [[apothecary|apothecaries]] who sold \"poisons\" to women for purposes of inducing an abortion, and [[New York (state)|New York]] made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor in 1829.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buell|first=Samuel|date=1991|title=Criminal Abortion Revisited|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2798&context=faculty_scholarship|journal=New York University Law Review|volume=66:1774|issue=6|pages=1774\u2013831|via=duke.edu|pmid=11652642}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2019|reason=Source does not include any reference to the 1829 NY law.}} Other legal scholars have pointed out that some of the early laws punished not only the doctor or abortionist, but also the woman who hired them.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Suzanne M. |last1=Alford |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?52+Duke+L.+J.+1011 |title=Is Self-Abortion a Fundamental Right? |volume=52 |journal=Duke Law Journal |pages=1011\u201329 |issue=5 |year=2003 |jstor=1373127 |pmid=12964572}}</ref>\n\nA number of other factors likely played a role in the rise of anti-abortion laws. [[Physician]]s, who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge. Science had discovered that [[Fertilisation|conception]] inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted. <sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> Moreover, [[quickening]] was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of [[gestation]] than any other step. Many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.<ref name=\"Mohr3536\">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

Wade'', 30 states prohibited abortion without exception, 16 states banned abortion except in certain special circumstances (e.g., rape, incest, health threat to mother), 3 states allowed residents to obtain abortions, and New York allowed abortions generally.<ref>[https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue Lessons from Before Roe: Will Past be Prologue?] The Guttmacher Policy Review, Vol. 6 Iss. 1, March 1, 2003. Retrieved 11 January 2017.</ref> Early that year, on January 22, 1973, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' invalidated all of these laws, and set guidelines for the availability of abortion. ''Roe'' established that the [[right of privacy]] of a woman to obtain an abortion \"must be considered against important state interests in regulation\".<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973|source=j|pin=154}} \"We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\"</ref> ''Roe'' established a \"[[Gestation#Humans|trimester]]\" (i.e., 12 week) threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to its increasing \"viability\" (likelihood of survival outside the uterus) over the course of a pregnancy, such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.\n\nIn deciding ''Roe v. Wade'', the Supreme Court ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] (in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state). In its opinion, it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases:<blockquote>State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/410/113.html 410 U.S. 113]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2011-04-14.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being.\n\nA central issue in the ''Roe'' case (and in the wider abortion debate in general) is whether human life or personhood begins at conception, birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue, noting: \"We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\" Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under English and American [[common law]] and statutes, \"the unborn have never been recognized ... as persons in the whole sense\", and thus, the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. So, rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the court simply declared that the State has a \"compelling interest\" in protecting \"potential life\" at the point of viability.\n\n====''Doe v.

Although, the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many [[County|counties]] have no abortion providers.<ref name=\"Doan3\">{{cite book|author1=Alesha Doan|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57}}</ref> ''Planned Parenthood v.

Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}}</ref> ''Roe'' had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to \"[[strict scrutiny]]\" \u2014 the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental [[U.S. Constitution|Constitutional]] rights.

Wade'' while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore, a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\")</ref> but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the [[United States Constitution|constitution]]: \"Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It declares that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The controlling word in the cases before us is 'liberty'.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', {{ussc|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=846}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject. On April 18, 2007, it issued a ruling in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', involving a federal law entitled the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]] which President [[George W. Bush]] had signed into law. The law banned [[intact dilation and extraction]], which opponents of abortion rights referred to as \"partial-birth abortion\", and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5-4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony Kennedy, was joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and the two recent appointees, [[Samuel Alito]] and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]].\n\nIn the case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision on June 27, 2016 swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain \"admitting privileges\" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions \"facially\" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]]\u2014that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts, and not the legislatures.<ref name=\"20160627SCOTUSDenniston\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

Gee]]'' in the 2019 term, a case resulting from a Louisiana state law that was passed at a similar time as the Texas law at the center of ''Whole Woman's Health''. Like Texas' law, the Louisiana law required certain measures for abortion clinics that, if having gone into effect, would have closed five of the six clinics in the state. The case in Louisiana was put on hold pending the result of ''Whole Woman's Health'', and was retried based on the Supreme Court's decision. While the District Court ruled the law unconstitutional, the Fifth Circuit found that unlike the Texas law, the burden of the Louisiana law passed the tests outlined in ''Whole Woman's Health'', and thus the law was constitutional. The Supreme Court issued an order to suspend enforcement of the law pending further review, and agreed to hear the case in full in October 2019. It will be the first abortion-related case to be heard by President [[Donald Trump]]'s appointees to the Court, [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Bret Kavanaugh]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-to-review-ruling-on-louisiana-abortion-law/2019/10/04/85eaf2b0-e6ab-11e9-a6e8-8759c5c7f608_story.html | title = Supreme Court to review ruling on Louisiana abortion law | first= Robert | last= Barnes | date =  October 4, 2019 | accessdate = October 4, 2019 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>\n\n==Current legal status{{anchor|Current_legal_situation}}==\n\n===Federal legislation===\nSince 1995, led by congressional [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of [[intact dilation and extraction]], commonly known as partial birth abortion. Such measures passed twice by wide margins, but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decision defined \"health\" in vague terms, justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion. Congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes.\n\nThe [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act|Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002]] (\"BAIPA\") was enacted August 5, 2002 by an Act of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush. It asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion. A \"born-alive infant\" is specified as a \"person, human being, child, individual\". \"Born alive\" is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural, induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.\n\nOn October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281-142, the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] approved the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] to ban partial-birth abortion, with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure. A woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure. On October 21, 2003, the [[United States Senate]] passed the bill by a vote of 64-34, with a number of Democrats joining in support. The bill was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 5, 2003, but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law. The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case ''[[Gonzales v.

In the majority opinion delivered by the court in ''Roe v. Wade'', viability was defined as \"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about [[Prenatal Development|seven months]] (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks\". When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks.

It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy among pro-abortion rights advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion.\n\nThe [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]] is a [[United States Congress]] bill to ban late-term abortions nationwide after 20 weeks post-[[fertilization]] on the basis that the fetus is capable of feeling pain during an abortion at and after that point of pregnancy. The bill was first introduced in Congress in 2013. It successfully passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2013, 2015, and 2017, but has yet to pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

Abortion is a controversial and divisive issue in the society, culture and politics of the U.S., and various [[Abortion law|anti-abortion laws]] have been in force in each state since at least 1900.Before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decisions of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decriminalized abortion nationwide in 1973, abortion was already legal in several states, but the decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). \n\n==Terminology==\n{{Main|Abortion}}\nThe abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"[[induced abortion]]\" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref>According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':\n<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\n\n(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n\n(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>\n\nLikewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before [[Viability]] at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=Katie |title= Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1175\u20131180 |date=20 Dec 2019 |doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175 |pmid=30585581 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nIn medical parlance, \"abortion\" can refer to either [[miscarriage]] or abortion until the fetus is viable.

[[Physician]]s, who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge. Science had discovered that [[Fertilisation|conception]] inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted. <sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> Moreover, [[quickening]] was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of [[gestation]] than any other step. Many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.<ref name=\"Mohr3536\">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

[...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed.

Retrieved 11 January 2017.</ref> Early that year, on January 22, 1973, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' invalidated all of these laws, and set guidelines for the availability of abortion. ''Roe'' established that the [[right of privacy]] of a woman to obtain an abortion \"must be considered against important state interests in regulation\".<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973|source=j|pin=154}} \"We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\"</ref> ''Roe'' established a \"[[Gestation#Humans|trimester]]\" (i.e., 12 week) threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to its increasing \"viability\" (likelihood of survival outside the uterus) over the course of a pregnancy, such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.\n\nIn deciding ''Roe v. Wade'', the Supreme Court ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] (in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state). In its opinion, it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases:<blockquote>State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/410/113.html 410 U.S. 113]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2011-04-14.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being.\n\nA central issue in the ''Roe'' case (and in the wider abortion debate in general) is whether human life or personhood begins at conception, birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue, noting: \"We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\" Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under English and American [[common law]] and statutes, \"the unborn have never been recognized ... as persons in the whole sense\", and thus, the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. So, rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the court simply declared that the State has a \"compelling interest\" in protecting \"potential life\" at the point of viability.\n\n====''Doe v. Bolton''====\n{{Main|Doe v. Bolton}}\nUnder ''[[Roe v.

Although, the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many [[County|counties]] have no abortion providers.<ref name=\"Doan3\">{{cite book|author1=Alesha Doan|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57}}</ref> ''Planned Parenthood v.

Casey]]'', the Court abandoned ''Roe's'' strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to choose to have an abortion before viability.<ref>{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}}</ref> ''Roe'' had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to \"[[strict scrutiny]]\" \u2014 the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental [[U.S. Constitution|Constitutional]] rights. ''Casey'' instead adopted the lower,   [[undue burden]] standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions,<ref>{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}} (\"(a) To protect the central right recognized by ''Roe v. Wade'' while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore, a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\")</ref> but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the [[United States Constitution|constitution]]: \"Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It declares that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The controlling word in the cases before us is 'liberty'.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', {{ussc|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=846}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject. On April 18, 2007, it issued a ruling in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', involving a federal law entitled the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]] which President [[George W. Bush]] had signed into law. The law banned [[intact dilation and extraction]], which opponents of abortion rights referred to as \"partial-birth abortion\", and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5-4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony Kennedy, was joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and the two recent appointees, [[Samuel Alito]] and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]].\n\nIn the case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision on June 27, 2016 swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain \"admitting privileges\" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions \"facially\" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]]\u2014that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts, and not the legislatures.<ref name=\"20160627SCOTUSDenniston\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

Gee]]'' in the 2019 term, a case resulting from a Louisiana state law that was passed at a similar time as the Texas law at the center of ''Whole Woman's Health''. Like Texas' law, the Louisiana law required certain measures for abortion clinics that, if having gone into effect, would have closed five of the six clinics in the state. The case in Louisiana was put on hold pending the result of ''Whole Woman's Health'', and was retried based on the Supreme Court's decision. While the District Court ruled the law unconstitutional, the Fifth Circuit found that unlike the Texas law, the burden of the Louisiana law passed the tests outlined in ''Whole Woman's Health'', and thus the law was constitutional. The Supreme Court issued an order to suspend enforcement of the law pending further review, and agreed to hear the case in full in October 2019.

Such measures passed twice by wide margins, but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decision defined \"health\" in vague terms, justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion. Congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes.\n\nThe [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act|Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002]] (\"BAIPA\") was enacted August 5, 2002 by an Act of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush. It asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion. A \"born-alive infant\" is specified as a \"person, human being, child, individual\". \"Born alive\" is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural, induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.\n\nOn October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281-142, the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] approved the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] to ban partial-birth abortion, with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure. A woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure. On October 21, 2003, the [[United States Senate]] passed the bill by a vote of 64-34, with a number of Democrats joining in support. The bill was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 5, 2003, but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law. The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' on April 18, 2007, signaling a substantial change in the Court's approach to abortion law.<ref name=\"nyt-greenhouse\">{{cite news | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | authorlink = Linda Greenhouse | work = The New York Times | title = Justices Back Ban on Method of Abortion | date = April 19, 2007 | accessdate = January 3, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html}}</ref> The 5-4 ruling said the ''Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act'' does not conflict with previous decisions regarding abortion.\n\nThe current judicial interpretation of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] regarding abortion, following the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s 1973 landmark decision in ''Roe v. Wade'', and subsequent companion decisions, is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees. States have passed laws to restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure.<ref>[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state], LawServer</ref>\n\nThe official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, issued in 1983 after extensive hearings on the [[Human Life Amendment]] (proposed by Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] and [[Thomas Eagleton]]), stated that\n\n{{quote|Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy.<ref>Report, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, on Senate Joint Resolution 3, 98th Congress, 98-149, June 7, 1983, p. 6.</ref>}}\n\nOne aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the [[fetus]] is \"[[Fetal viability|viable]]\" outside the womb as a measure of when the \"life\" of the fetus is its own (and therefore subject to being protected by the state). In the majority opinion delivered by the court in ''Roe v. Wade'', viability was defined as \"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about [[Prenatal Development|seven months]] (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks\". When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks.

Nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings, as the issue may come before them as judges.\n\nThe [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], commonly known as \"[[Laci Peterson|Laci]] and Conner's Law\" was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on April 1, 2004, allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother (one for the mother and one for the fetus). It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy among pro-abortion rights advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion.\n\nThe [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]] is a [[United States Congress]] bill to ban late-term abortions nationwide after 20 weeks post-[[fertilization]] on the basis that the fetus is capable of feeling pain during an abortion at and after that point of pregnancy. The bill was first introduced in Congress in 2013. It successfully passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2013, 2015, and 2017, but has yet to pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Opponents of the bill reject the claims made by the bill's supporters regarding fetal development, and argue that such a restriction would endanger women's health.\n\n[[File:AbortionRestrictions2013.svg|thumb|This map demonstrates an increase in abortion restrictions and a simultaneous decrease in abortion access in the US in 2013.

The cost of an abortion varies depending on factors such as location, facility, timing, and type of procedure. In 2005, a non-hospital abortion at 10 weeks' gestation ranged from $90 to $1,800 (average: $430), whereas an abortion at 20 weeks' gestation ranged from $350 to $4,520 (average: $1,260).

Wade]]'', and has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills since 1976, and represented the first major legislative success by the [[pro-life movement]]. The law requires that states cover abortions under Medicaid in the event of rape, incest, and life endangerment. Based on the federal law:\n* 32 states and D. C. fund abortions through Medicaid only in the cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. SD covers abortions only in the cases of life endangerment, which does not comply with federal requirements under the Hyde Amendment. IN, UT, and WI have expanded coverage to women whose physical health is jeopardized, and IA, MS, UT, and VA also include fetal abnormality cases.\n* 17 states (AK, AZ, CA, CT, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, MT, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA, WV) use their own funds to cover all or most \"medically necessary\" abortions sought by low-income women under Medicaid, 13 of which are required by State court orders to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|author=Francis Roberta W.|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|work=Equal Rights Amendment|accessdate=2009-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417234051/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm|archive-date=2009-04-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Private insurance===\n* 5 states (ID, KY, MO, ND, OK) restrict insurance coverage of abortion services in private plans: OK limits coverage to life endangerment, rape or incest circumstances; and the other four states limit coverage to cases of life endangerment.\n* 12 states (CO, IL, KY, MA, MS, NE, ND, OH, PA, RI, SC, VA) restrict abortion coverage in insurance plans for public employees, with CO and KY restricting insurance coverage of abortion under any circumstances.\n* U.S. laws also ban federal funding of abortions for federal employees and their dependents, Native Americans covered by the Indian Health Service, military personnel and their dependents, and women with disabilities covered by Medicare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/womenshealth/upload/3269-02.pdf |title=Women's Health Policy Facts |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-02 |publisher=The Henry J.

This divergence also led to [[Christian Right]] organizations like [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]], [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and [[Moral Majority]] having an increasingly strong role in the Republican Party. This opposition has been extended under the Foreign Assistance Act: in 1973 [[Jesse Helms]] introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote abortion overseas, and in 1984 the [[Mexico City Policy]] prohibited financial support to any overseas organization that performed or promoted abortions. The \"Mexico City Policy\" was revoked by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] and subsequently reinstated by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]].

The [[legalized abortion and crime effect]] is another controversial theory that posits legal abortion reduces crime, because unwanted children are more likely to become criminals.\n\nSince ''Roe v. Wade'', there have been numerous attempts to reverse the decision. In the 2011 election season, Mississippi placed an amendment on the ballot that redefine how the state viewed abortion.

It portrays the years after Newton's birth in 1642, his education, as well as his early scientific contributions, before the [[Writing of Principia Mathematica|writing of his main work]], the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', in 1685.\n\nPornhud.com \n[[Christmas]] Day, 25 December 1642 [[Old Style]] (which was 4 January 1643 on the [[Gregorian calendar]], which is now used)<ref name=\" OSNS\">During Newton's lifetime, two calendars were in use in Europe: the [[Julian Calendar|Julian]] or '[[Old Style]]' in Britain and parts of northern Europe (Protestant) and eastern Europe, and the [[Gregorian Calendar|Gregorian]] or '[[New Style]]', in use in Roman Catholic Europe and elsewhere. At Newton's birth, Gregorian dates were ten days ahead of Julian dates: thus Newton was born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 by the Julian calendar, but on 4 January 1643 by the Gregorian. By the time he died, the difference between the calendars had increased to eleven days. Moreover, before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in the UK in 1752, the English new year began (for legal and some other civil purposes) on 25 March ('[[Lady Day]]', i.e. the feast of the Annunciation: sometimes called 'Annunciation Style') rather than on 1 January (sometimes called 'Circumcision Style'). Unless otherwise noted, the remainder of the dates in this article follow the Julian Calendar.</ref> at [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the county of [[Lincolnshire]]. (At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the Gregorian calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as 25 December, according to the [[Julian calendar]].)\n\nNewton was born three months after the death of his father, a prosperous farmer also named Isaac Newton. His father was described as a \"wild and extravagant man\". Born [[Premature birth|prematurely]], young Isaac was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fitted inside a [[quart]] mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother to burn them and the house over them.\"<ref>Cohen, I.B. (1970). Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Vol. 11, p.43. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons</ref> Later on his mother returned after her husband died.\n\nFrom age 12 to age 17, Newton resided with [[William Clarke (apothecary)|William Clarke]], [[apothecary]], in [[Grantham]], where he acquired his interest in chemistry. While living with the Clarke family, Newton was educated at [[The King's School, Grantham]] (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He spent much of his time on independent pursuits, and did poorly in school.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iKyytTQI7tEC&pg=PA31|title=Genius Genes: How Asperger Talents Changed the World|page=31|author1-last=Fitzgerald|author1-first=Michael|author2-last=O'Brien|author2-first=Brendan|publisher=AAPC Publishing|date=2007|isbn=978-1931282444|quote=Like many geniuses throughout history, Newton performed poorly at school, played truant, and was close to the bottom of his class.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/newton.html|title=Newton|last=Pinaire|first=Chris|publisher=Wichita State University|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref>{{Better source|date=May 2019}} He was removed from school, and by October 1659 he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him.

This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report.\n\nManuscript evidence shows that Newton's earliest known piece writing, a Latin phrasebook, as well as the first letter in his hand which has yet been found, addressed to a \u2018Loving friend\u2019, were copied from an unpublished version of a work on Latin pedagogy by William Walker, a schoolmaster and rector whose acquaintance with Newton is documented from 1665. This suggests an early influence of the schoolmaster on the natural philosopher when he was still a schoolboy. <ref> Holland, Michael. \u201cIsaac Newton\u2019s Latin Exercises and Letter to a \u2018Loving Friend\u2019: Identifying the Sources.\u201d Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, vol. 80 (2017): 249-259 (https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/warburg/jwci/2017/00000080/00000001/art00013) </ref>\n\nIn June 1661, he was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] as a [[sizar]]\u2014a sort of work-study role.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Isaac Newton : the last sorcerer|last=White, Michael, 1959-2018.|publisher=|isbn=9780007392018|edition= Paperback|location=London|pages=46|oclc=911627345|date = 20 February 2012}}</ref> At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of [[Aristotle]], whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[astronomer]]s such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. In 1665, he discovered the generalised [[binomial theorem]] and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Soon after Newton had obtained his degree in August 1665, the University closed down as a precaution against the [[Great Plague of London]]. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,<ref>ed. Michael Hoskins (1997). Cambridge Illustrated History of Astronomy, p.&nbsp;159. [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref> Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the next two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation. In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a fellow of Trinity.<ref>{{acad|id=RY644J|name=Newton, Isaac}}</ref>\n\nNewton had stated that when he had purchased a book on [[astrology]] at [[Stourbridge fair]], near Cambridge, he was unable, on account of his ignorance of [[trigonometry]], to understand a figure of the heavens which was drawn in the book. He, therefore, bought an English edition of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] which included an index of propositions, and, having turned to two or three which he thought might be helpful, found them so obvious that he dismissed it \"as a trifling book\", and applied himself to the study of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' ''Geometry''. It is reported that in his examination for a scholarship at Trinity, to which he was elected on 28 April 1664, he was examined in Euclid by Dr [[Isaac Barrow]], who was disappointed in Newton's lack of knowledge of the subject. Newton was convinced to read the ''Elements'' again with care, and formed a more favourable opinion of Euclid's merit.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Michael |title=Isaac Newton; The last Sorcerer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C |location= |publisher=[[Fourth Estate]] |pages=62\u201363 |isbn=185702706X |author-link= |date=6 April 1999 }}</ref>\n\nNewton's study of Descartes' ''Geometry'' seems to have inspired him with a love of the subject, and introduced him to higher mathematics. In a small [[commonplace book]], dated January 1664, there are several articles on [[angular section]]s, and the [[squaring of curves]] and \"crooked lines that may be squared\", several calculations about [[musical note]]s, geometrical propositions from [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]] and [[Frans van Schooten]], annotations out of [[John Wallis]]'s ''Arithmetic of Infinities'', together with observations on [[refraction]], on the grinding of \"spherical optic glasses\", on the errors of [[lens (optics)|lens]]es and the method of rectifying them, and on the extraction of all kinds of [[root of a function|root]]s, particularly those \"in affected powers\". In this same book the following entry made by Newton himself, many years afterward, gives a further account of the nature of his work during the period when he was an undergraduate:\n\n{{quote |July 4, 1699. By consulting an account of my expenses at Cambridge, in the years 1663 and 1664, I find that in the year 1664 a little before Christmas, I being then Senior Sophister, bought Schooten's ''Miscellanies'' and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartes']] ''Geometry'' (having read this ''Geometry'' and Oughtred's ''Clavis'' clean over half a year before), and borrowed Wallis' works, and by consequence made these annotations out of Schooten and Wallis, in winter between the years 1664 and 1665. At such time I found the method of Infinite Series; and in summer 1665, being forced from Cambridge by the plague, I computed the area of the [[Hyperbola]] at [[Boothby Pagnell|Boothby]], in Lincolnshire, to two and fifty figures by the same method.}}\n\nThat Newton must have begun early to make careful observations of natural phenomena is shown by the following remarks about halos, which appear in his ''Optics'', book ii. part iv. obs. 13:\n\n{{quote |The like Crowns appear sometimes about the moon; for at the beginning of the Year 1664, February 19th, at night, I saw two such Crowns about her. The Diameter of the first or innermost was about three Degrees, and that of the second about five Degrees and a half. Next about the moon was a Circle of white, and next about that the inner Crown, which was of a bluish-green within next the white, and of a yellow and red without, and next about these Colours were blue and green on the inside of the Outward Crown, and red on the outside of it. At the same time, there appeared a Halo about 22 Degrees 35' distant from the centre of the moon. It was elliptical, and its long Diameter was perpendicular to the Horizon, verging below farthest from the moon.}}\n\nHe formulated the three laws of motion:\n\n* Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it.\n* The relationship between an object's mass ''m'', its acceleration ''a'', and the applied force ''F'' is ''F'' = ''ma''. Acceleration and force are vectors (as sometimes indicated by their symbols being displayed in slant bold font); in this law, the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector.\n* For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n==Academic career==\nIn January 1665 Newton took the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]]. The persons appointed (in conjunction with the proctors, John Slade of [[Catharine Hall, Cambridge]], and [[Benjamin Pulleyn]] of Trinity College, Newton's tutor) to examine the questionists{{clarify|date=December 2018}} were [[John Eachard]] of Catharine Hall and [[Thomas Gipps]] of Trinity University.{{clarify|date=December 2018}} It is a curious accident{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that we have no information about the respective merits of the candidates for a degree in this year since the \"ordo senioritis\" of the Bachelors of Arts for the year is omitted in the \"Grace Book\".\n\nIt is supposed{{By whom|date=May 2019}} that it was in 1665 that the method of [[fluxion|fluxi\u00f3n]]s (his term for [[calculus of variations]]) first occurred to Newton's mind. There are several papers in Newton's handwriting bearing dates 1665<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Trinity College Notebook|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03996/}}</ref>{{Better source|date=May 2019|reason=The noted source is primary source material, which is not considered a reliable source for Wikipedia.

Otherwise what we have is original research.}} and 1666 in which the method is described, in some of which dotted or dashed letters are used to represent fluxions (i.e. derivatives), and in some of which the method is explained without the use of dotted letters.\n\nBoth in 1665 and 1666 Trinity College was dismissed on account of the [[Great Plague of London]]. On each occasion it was agreed, as shown by entries in the \"Conclusion Book\" of the college, dated 7 August 1665, and 22 June 1666, and signed by the master of the college, Dr Pearson, that all fellows and scholars who were dismissed on account of the pestilence be allowed one month's commons.{{Clarify|reason=What is meant by the term commons in this context?|date=May 2019}}\n\nNewton must have left college before August 1665{{According to whom|date=May 2019}}, as his name does not appear in the list of those who received extra commons on that occasion, and he tells us himself in the extract from his commonplace book already quoted that he was \"forced from Cambridge by the plague\" in the summer of that year. He was elected a fellow of his college on 5 October 1667. There were nine vacancies, one caused by the death of [[Abraham Cowley]] the previous summer, and the nine successful candidates were all of the same academic standings. A few weeks after his election to a [[fellow]]ship Newton went to Lincolnshire and did not return to Cambridge till the February following. In March 1668 he took his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degree.\n\nDuring the years 1666 to 1669 Newton's studies were very diverse. He bought [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s and lenses on two or three occasions, and also [[chemical]]s and a [[furnace]], apparently for chemical experiments{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}; but he also employed part of his time on the theory of fluxions and other branches of pure mathematics. He wrote a paper, ''De Analysi per Aequationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas'', which he put, probably in June 1669, into the hands of Isaac Barrow (then [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]]), at the same time permitting him to communicate its contents to their common friend [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]] (1624&ndash;1683), a mathematician of no mean order. Barrow did so on 31 July 1669, but kept the name of the author a secret, and merely told Collins that he was a friend staying at Cambridge, who had a powerful genius for such matters.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} In a subsequent letter on 20 August Barrow expressed his pleasure at hearing the favourable opinion which Collins had formed of the paper, and added, \"the name of the author is Newton, a fellow of our college, and a young man, who is only in his second year since he took the degree of Master of Arts, and who, with an unparalleled genius (''examine quo est acumen''), has made very great progress in this branch of mathematics\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Shortly afterward Barrow resigned his chair and was instrumental in securing Newton's election as his successor.\n\nNewton was elected Lucasian professor on 29 October 1670. It was his duty as professor{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to lecture at least once a week in term time on some portion of [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], [[astronomy]], [[geography]], [[optics]], [[statics]], or some other [[mathematics|mathematical]] subject, and also for two hours in the week to allow an audience to any student who might come to consult with the professor on any difficulties he had encountered. The subject which Newton chose for his lectures was optics. These lectures did little to expand his reputation, as they were remarkably sparsely attended; frequently leaving Newton to lecture at the walls of the classroom.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} An account of their content was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in the spring of 1672.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==The composition of white light==\n[[File:NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A replica of Newton's second reflecting telescope of 1672 presented to the [[Royal Society]].]]\nAccording to [[Alfred Rupert Hall]] the first practical reflecting telescope was built by Newton in 1668.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">''Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought'', by Alfred Rupert Hall, 1996, page 67.</ref> Later on such prototype for a design came to be called a [[Newtonian telescope]] or [[Newton's reflector]].\n\nOn 21 December 1671 he was proposed as a candidate for admission to the Royal Society by Dr [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]], [[bishop of Salisbury]], and on 11 January 1672, he was elected a fellow of the Society. At the meeting at which Newton was elected, he read a description of a [[reflecting telescope]] which he had invented, and \"it was ordered that a letter should be written by the secretary to Mr. Newton to acquaint him of his election into the Society, and to thank him for the communication of his [[telescope]], and to assure him that the Society would take care that all right should be done him concerning this invention.\" {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn his reply to the secretary on 18 January 1672, Newton writes: \"I desire that in your next letter you would inform me for what time the society continue their weekly meetings; because, if they continue them for any time, I am purposing them to be considered of and examined an account of a philosophical discovery, which induced me to the making of the said telescope, and which I doubt not but will prove much more grateful than the communication of that instrument being in my judgment the oddest if not the most considerable detection which hath hitherto been made into the operations of nature.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThis promise was fulfilled in communication which Newton addressed to [[Henry Oldenburg]], the secretary of the Royal Society, on 6 February 1672, and which was read before the society two days afterward. The whole is printed in No. 80 of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]].''\n\nNewton's \"philosophical discovery\" was the realisation that white light is composed of a [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of colours. He realised that objects are coloured only because they absorb some of these colours more than others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nAfter he explained this to the Society, he proceeded: \"When I understood this, I left off my aforesaid glassworks; for I saw, that the perfection of telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for want of glasses truly [[Figuring|figured]] according to the prescriptions of Optics Authors (which all men have hitherto imagined), as because that light itself is a heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible rays. So that was a glass so exactly figured as to collect any one sort of rays into one point, it could not collect those also into the same point, which has the same incidence upon the same medium are apt to suffer a different [[refraction]]. Nay, I wondered, that seeing the difference of refrangibility was so great, as I found it, telescopes should arrive at that perfection they are now at.\" This \"difference in refrangibility\" is now known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nHe then points out why \"the object-glass of any telescope cannot collect all the rays which come from one point of an object, to make them convene at its focus in less room than in a circular space, whose diameter is the 50th part of the diameter of its aperture: which is an irregularity some hundreds of times greater, than a circularly figured lens, of so small a section as the object-glasses of long telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of its figure, were light uniform.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} He adds: \"This made me take [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s into consideration, and finding them regular so that the Angle of Reflection of all sorts of Rays was equal to their Angle of Incidence; I understood, that by their mediation optic instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, provided a reflecting substance could be found, which would polish as finely as glass, and reflect as much light, as glass transmits, and the art of communicating to it a [[parabola|parabolic]] figure be also attained. But these seemed very great difficulties, and I have almost thought them insuperable, when I further considered, that every irregularity in a reflecting superficies makes the rays stray 5 or 6 times more out of their due course, than the like irregularities in a refracting one; so that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite, than in figuring glasses for refraction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n\"Amidst these thoughts, I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening Plague, and it was more than two years before I proceeded further. But then having thought on a tender way of polishing, proper for metal, whereby, as I imagined, the figure also would be corrected to the last; I began to try, what might be affected in this kind, and by degrees so far perfected an instrument (in the essential parts of it like that I sent to London), by which I could discern [[Jupiter]]'s 4 [[Natural satellite|Concomitant]]s, and showed them diverse times to two others of my acquaintance. I could also discern the [[Moon]]-like phase of [[Venus]], but not very distinctly, nor without some niceness in disposing of the instrument.\n\n\"From that time I was interrupted until this last autumn when I made the other. And as that was sensibly better than the first (especially for day-objects), so I doubt not, but they will be still brought to much greater perfection by their endeavours, who, as you inform me, are taking care of it at London.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Newton's theory of colour===\nAfter a remark that [[microscope]]s seem as capable of improvement as telescopes, he adds:\n\n{{quote |I shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable deformity in its Rays, were in the intermediate<!-- should it be the intermediate?--> degrees of refrangibility. And this analogy twist colours, and refrangibility is very precise and strict; the rays always either exactly agreeing in both, or proportionally disagreeing in both.}}\n\nFurther on, after some remarks on the subject of compound colours, he says:\n\n{{quote |I might add more instances of this nature, but I shall conclude with this general one, that the colours of all-natural bodies have no other origin than this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty than another. And this I have experimented in a dark room by illuminating those bodies with uncompounded light of diverse colours. For by that means anybody may be made to appear of any colour. They have there no appropriate colour, but ever appear of the colour of the light cast upon them, but yet with this difference, that they are most brisk and vivid in the light of their daylight colour. [[cinnabar|Minium]] appears thereof any colour indifferently, with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red, and so [[azurite|Bise]] appears indifferently of any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blue.}}\n{{quote |And there place a clear and colourless prism, to refract the entering light towards the further part of the room, which, as I said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured image. Then place a [[lens (optics)|lens]] of about three-foot radius (suppose a broad object-glass of a three-foot telescope), at the distance of about four or five foot from thence, through which all those colours may at once be transmitted, and made by its refraction to convene at a further distance of about ten or twelve feet. If at that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted into whiteness again by being mingled.}}\n\n{{quote |But it is requisite, that the prism and lens be placed steadily, and that the paper, on which the colours are cast be moved to and fro; for, by such motion, you will not only find, at what distance the whiteness is almost perfect but also see, how the colours gradually convene and vanish into whiteness, and afterward having crossed one another in that place where they compound whiteness, are again dissipated and severed, and in an inverted order retain the same colours, which they had before they entered the composition. You may also see, that, if any of the colours at the lens be intercepted, the whiteness will be changed into the other colours. And therefore, that the composition of whiteness be perfect, care must be taken, that none of the colours fall beside the lens.}}\n\nHe concludes his communication with the words: {{quote |This, I conceive, is enough for an introduction to experiments of this kind: which if any of the R. Society shall be so curious as to prosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what success:  if anything seems to be defective, or to thwart this relation, I may have an opportunity of giving further direction about it, or of acknowledging my errors, if I have committed any.}}\n\n===Controversies===\nThe publication of these discoveries led to a series of controversies which lasted for several years, in which Newton had to contend with the eminent English physicist [[Robert Hooke]], Anthony Lucas (mathematical professor at the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]]), [[Franciscus Linus]] (a physician in [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]), and many others. Some of his opponents denied the truth of his experiments, refusing to believe in the existence of the spectrum. Others criticised the experiments, saying that the length of the spectrum was never more than three and a half times the breadth{{clarify|date=December 2018}}, whereas Newton found it to be five times the breadth. It appears that Newton made the mistake of supposing that all prisms would give a spectrum of the same length; the objections of his opponents led him to measure carefully the lengths of spectra formed by prisms of different angles and different [[refractive index|refractive indices]], but he was not led thereby to the discovery of the different dispersive powers of different refractive substances.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nNewton carried on the discussion with the objectors with great courtesy and patience, but the pain which these long discussions gave to his sensitive mind may be estimated from his letter of 18 November 1676 to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]: \"I promised to send you an answer to Mr. Lucas this next Tuesday, but I find I shall scarce finish what I have designed, to get a copy taken of it by that time, and therefore I beg your patience a week longer. I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy, but if I get free of Mr. Lucas's business, I will resolutely bid adieu to it eternally, excepting what I do for my private satisfaction, or leave to come out after me; for I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or to become a slave to defend it.\"\n\nIt was fortunate{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that these disputes did not damp Newton's ardour as much as he feared. He later published many papers in the Philosophical Transactions on various aspects of optics, and, although some of his views are erroneous, and are now almost universally rejected, his investigations led to discoveries which are of permanent value. He succeeded in explaining the colour of thin and of thick plates ([[diffraction]]), and the inflexion{{clarify|date=December 2018}} of light, and he wrote on double refraction, [[light polarisation]] and [[binocular vision]]. He also invented a [[Octant (instrument)#Newton's reflecting quadrant|reflecting quadrant]] for observing the angles between the [[moon]] and the fixed stars&mdash; the same in every essential as the historically important navigational instrument more commonly known as [[Octant (instrument)|Hadley's quadrant]]. This discovery was communicated by him to [[Edmund Halley]] in 1700 but was not published, or communicated to the Royal Society, until after Newton's death, when a description of it was found among his papers.\n\n==Conflict over oratorship elections==\nIn March 1673 Newton took a prominent part in a dispute in the university. The public oratorship fell vacant, and a contest arose between the heads of the colleges and the members of the [[Senate]] as to the mode of electing to the office. The heads claimed the right of nominating two persons, one of whom was to be elected by the senate. The senate insisted that the proper mode was by an open election. [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], who was the chancellor of the university, endeavoured to effect a compromise which, he says, \"I hope may for the present satisfy both sides. I propose that the heads may for this time nominate and the body comply, yet interposing (if they think fit) a protestation concerning their plea that this election may not hereafter pass for a decisive precedent in prejudice of their claim\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} and, \"whereas I understand that the whole university has chiefly consideration for Dr [[Henry Paman]] of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and Mr. Craven of Trinity College, I do recommend them both to be nominated.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The heads, however, nominated Drs Paman and Ralph Sanderson (of St John's); the next day 121 members of the senate recorded their votes for Craven and ninety-eight for Paman. On the morning of the election, a protest in which Newton's name appeared was read and entered in the Regent House. But the vice-chancellor admitted Paman the same morning, and so ended the first contest of a non-scientific character in which Newton took part. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Newton's poverty==\nOn 8 March 1673 Newton wrote to Oldenburg, the secretary of the Royal Society:<blockquote>\"Sir, I desire that you will procure that I may be put out from being any longer Fellow of the Royal Society: for though I honour that body, yet since I see I shall neither profit them nor (because of this distance) can partake of the advantage of their assemblies, I desire to withdraw.\"</blockquote>\n\nOldenburg replied to this with an offer to apply to the Society to excuse Newton the weekly payments, as in a letter of Newton's to Oldenburg, dated 23 June 1673, he says, \"For your proffer about my quarterly payments, I thank you, but I would not have you trouble yourself to get them excused if you have not done it already.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Nothing further seems to have been done in the matter until 28 January 1675, when Oldenburg informed the Society that \"Mr. Newton is now in such circumstances that he desires to be excused from the weekly payments.\" Upon this \"it was agreed to by the council that he be dispensed with, as several others are.\" {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nOn 18 February 1675 Newton was formally accepted into the Society. The most probable reason why Newton wished to be excused from these payments is that, as he was not in holy orders, his fellowship at Trinity College would lapse in autumn 1675, with a consequent reduction in his income. But he received a patent from the Crown in April 1675, allowing him as Lucasian professor to retain his fellowship without being required to take holy orders. This must have relieved Newton's financial worries since in November 1676 he donated \u00a340 towards the building of the new library of Trinity College.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Universal law of gravitation==\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation}}\nIt is supposed{{By whom|date=May 2019}} that it was at Woolsthorpe in the summer of 1666 that Newton's thoughts were directed to the subject of gravity. They are said{{By whom|date=May 2019}} to have been inspired by Newton's seeing an apple fall from a tree on his mother's farm, a version for which there is reasonable historical evidence. In one version of the story, the apple is supposed to have fallen on Newton's head; this version appears to have been invented by [[Isaac D'Israeli]]. [[Voltaire]] is the authority for the former version of the story. He had his information from Newton's favourite niece [[Catherine Barton]], who married [[John Conduitt]], a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of Newton's intimate friends. How much truth there is in what is a plausible and a favourite story can never be known, but it is certain{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that tradition marked a tree as that from which the apple fell, until 1866, when, owing to decay, the tree was cut down and it is wood carefully preserved.\n\n[[Johannes Kepler]] had proved by an elaborate series of measurements that\n\n* each [[planet]] revolves in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit around the Sun, whose centre occupies one of the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of the ellipse,\n* that the radius vector of each planet drawn from the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times,\n* and that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.\n\nThe fact that heavy bodies have always a tendency to fall to the Earth, no matter at what height they are placed above the Earth's surface, seems to have led Newton to conjecture{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that the same tendency to fall to the Earth might have been the cause by which the Moon was retained in its orbit around the Earth.\n\nNewton, by calculating from [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]], and supposing the orbits of the planets to be circles with the sun at the centre, had already proved{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that the force of the Sun acting upon the different planets must vary as the inverse square of the distances of the planets from the Sun. He was therefore led{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to inquire whether if the Earth's attraction extended to the Moon, the force at that distance would be of the exact magnitude necessary to retain the Moon in its orbit. He found that the Moon by its motion in its orbit was deflected from the tangent in every minute through a space of 13 feet (3.96 m). But by observing the distance through which a body would fall in one second at the Earth's surface, and by calculating from that on the supposition of the force diminishing in the ratio of the inverse square of the distance, he found that the Earth's attraction at the distance of the moon would draw a body through 15&nbsp;ft. (4.57 metres) in one minute. Newton regarded the discrepancy between the results as proof of the inaccuracy of his conjecture, and \"laid aside at that time any further thoughts of this matter\".  (See [[Newton's cannonball]].)\n\nIn November 1679, [[Robert Hooke]] (after his appointment to manage the Royal Society's correspondence) began an exchange of letters with Newton{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}: he wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others.<ref>H W Turnbull (ed.) (1960), \"Correspondence of Isaac Newton\", Vol 2 (1676-1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), giving the Hooke-Newton correspondence (of November 1679 to January 1679|80) at pp.297-314.</ref> The correspondence later led to controversy. Hooke and Newton disagreed about the form of the path of a body falling from a height, taking the motion of the Earth around its axis into consideration. Newton later acknowledged that the exchanges of 1679-80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomy.<ref>H W Turnbull (ed.) (1960), cited above, at pp.435-440.</ref> This led Newton to revert{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to his former conjectures on the Moon. The estimate Newton had used for the radius of the Earth, which had been accepted by geographers and navigators, was based on the very rough estimate that the [[length of a degree of latitude]] of the Earth's surface measured along a meridian was 60 nautical miles.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} At a meeting of the Royal Society on 11 January 1672, Oldenburg, the secretary, read a letter from Paris describing the procedure followed by [[Jean Picard]] in measuring a degree, and specifically stating the precise length that he calculated it to be. It is probable that Newton had become acquainted with this measurement of Picard's, and that he was therefore led to make use of it when his thoughts were redirected to the subject. This estimate of the Earth's magnitude, giving 691 miles (1112&nbsp; km) to 10\u00b0, made the two results, the discrepancy between which Newton had regarded as a disproof of his conjecture, to agree so exactly that he now regarded his conjecture as fully established.\n\nIn January 1684, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], Halley and Hooke were led to discuss the law of gravity, and although they probably all agreed{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} on the truth of the inverse square law, yet this truth was not looked upon as established. It appears{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that Hooke professed to have a solution of the problem of the path of a body moving around a centre of force attracting as the inverse square of the distance, but Halley declared after a delay of some months that Hooke \"had not been so good as his word\" in showing his solution to Wren and started for Cambridge, in August 1684, to consult Newton on the subject. Without mentioning the speculations which had been made, he asked Newton what would be the curve described by a planet around the Sun on the assumption that the Sun's force diminished as the square of the distance. Newton replied promptly, \"an ellipse\", and on being questioned by Halley as to the reason for his answer he replied, \"Why, I have calculated it.\" He could not, however, put his hand upon his calculation, but he promised to send it to Halley. After the latter had left Cambridge, Newton set to work to reproduce the calculation. After making a mistake and producing a different result he corrected his work and obtained his former result.\n\nNext November, Newton redeemed his promise to Halley by sending him, by the hand of Mr. Paget, a fellow of Trinity College and mathematical master of [[Christ's Hospital]], a copy of his demonstration; and very soon afterward Halley again visited Cambridge to confer with Newton about the problem. On his return to London on 10 December 1684, he informed the Royal Society \"that he had lately seen Mr. Newton at Cambridge, who had shown him a curious treatise ''De Motu''\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} which at Halley's desire he promised to send to the Society to be entered upon their register. \"Mr. Halley was desired to put Mr. Newton in mind of his promise for the securing this invention to himself, till he could be at leisure to publish it\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}<!-- Who said this? This quote is not properly attributed to a source. --> and Paget was desired to join with Halley in urging Newton to do so. By the middle of February Newton had sent his paper to Aston, one of the secretaries of the Society, and in a letter to Aston dated 23 February 1685, Newton thanked him for \"having entered on the register his notions about motion\". This treatise ''De Motu'' was the starting point of the ''Principia'',{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} and was meant{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to be a short account of what that work was intended to embrace. It occupies twenty-four [[octavo]] pages, and consists of four [[theorem]]s and seven problems, some of which are identical with some of the most important propositions of the second and third sections of the first book of the [[Principia Mathematica|'' Principia'']].\n\n==See also==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus]]\n* [[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)]]\n* ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Newton]]''\n* [[Gauss\u2013Newton algorithm]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[List of independent discoveries#17th century|List of independent discoveries]]\n* [[Newton's cannonball]]\n* [[Newton disc]]\n* [[Newton fractal]]\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Newton's inequalities]]\n* [[Newton's laws of motion]]\n* [[Newton's notation]]\n* [[Newton polygon]]\n* [[Newton polynomial]]\n* [[Isaac Newton's religious views|Newton's religious views]]\n* [[Newton series#Newton series|Newton series]]\n* [[Newton's theorem of revolving orbits]]\n* [[Newton (unit)]]\n{{col-3}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Isaac Newton}}\n* [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]]\n* [[Newton\u2013Euler equations]]\n* [[Newtonianism]]\n* [[Scientific Revolution]]\n* [[Writing of Principia Mathematica]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Westfall|first=Richard S.|title=The Life of Isaac Newton|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1994|isbn=0-521-47737-9}}\n\n{{Isaac Newton}}\n\n[[Category:Isaac Newton]]\n[[Category:Early lives by individual|Newton, Sir Isaac]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{original research|date=May 2019}}\n{{essay|date=May 2019}}\n{{POV|date=May 2019}}}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Isaac Newton at 46 in [[Godfrey Kneller]]'s 1689 portrait.]]\n\nThe following article is part of a biography of [[Sir Isaac Newton]], the English mathematician and scientist, author of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

At Newton's birth, Gregorian dates were ten days ahead of Julian dates: thus Newton was born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 by the Julian calendar, but on 4 January 1643 by the Gregorian. By the time he died, the difference between the calendars had increased to eleven days. Moreover, before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in the UK in 1752, the English new year began (for legal and some other civil purposes) on 25 March ('[[Lady Day]]', i.e. the feast of the Annunciation: sometimes called 'Annunciation Style') rather than on 1 January (sometimes called 'Circumcision Style'). Unless otherwise noted, the remainder of the dates in this article follow the Julian Calendar.</ref> at [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the county of [[Lincolnshire]]. (At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the Gregorian calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as 25 December, according to the [[Julian calendar]].)\n\nNewton was born three months after the death of his father, a prosperous farmer also named Isaac Newton. His father was described as a \"wild and extravagant man\". Born [[Premature birth|prematurely]], young Isaac was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fitted inside a [[quart]] mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother to burn them and the house over them.\"<ref>Cohen, I.B.

In 1665, he discovered the generalised [[binomial theorem]] and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became [[infinitesimal calculus]].

He, therefore, bought an English edition of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] which included an index of propositions, and, having turned to two or three which he thought might be helpful, found them so obvious that he dismissed it \"as a trifling book\", and applied himself to the study of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' ''Geometry''. It is reported that in his examination for a scholarship at Trinity, to which he was elected on 28 April 1664, he was examined in Euclid by Dr [[Isaac Barrow]], who was disappointed in Newton's lack of knowledge of the subject. Newton was convinced to read the ''Elements'' again with care, and formed a more favourable opinion of Euclid's merit.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Michael |title=Isaac Newton; The last Sorcerer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C |location= |publisher=[[Fourth Estate]] |pages=62\u201363 |isbn=185702706X |author-link= |date=6 April 1999 }}</ref>\n\nNewton's study of Descartes' ''Geometry'' seems to have inspired him with a love of the subject, and introduced him to higher mathematics. In a small [[commonplace book]], dated January 1664, there are several articles on [[angular section]]s, and the [[squaring of curves]] and \"crooked lines that may be squared\", several calculations about [[musical note]]s, geometrical propositions from [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]] and [[Frans van Schooten]], annotations out of [[John Wallis]]'s ''Arithmetic of Infinities'', together with observations on [[refraction]], on the grinding of \"spherical optic glasses\", on the errors of [[lens (optics)|lens]]es and the method of rectifying them, and on the extraction of all kinds of [[root of a function|root]]s, particularly those \"in affected powers\". In this same book the following entry made by Newton himself, many years afterward, gives a further account of the nature of his work during the period when he was an undergraduate:\n\n{{quote |July 4, 1699. By consulting an account of my expenses at Cambridge, in the years 1663 and 1664, I find that in the year 1664 a little before Christmas, I being then Senior Sophister, bought Schooten's ''Miscellanies'' and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartes']] ''Geometry'' (having read this ''Geometry'' and Oughtred's ''Clavis'' clean over half a year before), and borrowed Wallis' works, and by consequence made these annotations out of Schooten and Wallis, in winter between the years 1664 and 1665. At such time I found the method of Infinite Series; and in summer 1665, being forced from Cambridge by the plague, I computed the area of the [[Hyperbola]] at [[Boothby Pagnell|Boothby]], in Lincolnshire, to two and fifty figures by the same method.}}\n\nThat Newton must have begun early to make careful observations of natural phenomena is shown by the following remarks about halos, which appear in his ''Optics'', book ii. part iv. obs. 13:\n\n{{quote |The like Crowns appear sometimes about the moon; for at the beginning of the Year 1664, February 19th, at night, I saw two such Crowns about her. The Diameter of the first or innermost was about three Degrees, and that of the second about five Degrees and a half. Next about the moon was a Circle of white, and next about that the inner Crown, which was of a bluish-green within next the white, and of a yellow and red without, and next about these Colours were blue and green on the inside of the Outward Crown, and red on the outside of it. At the same time, there appeared a Halo about 22 Degrees 35' distant from the centre of the moon. It was elliptical, and its long Diameter was perpendicular to the Horizon, verging below farthest from the moon.}}\n\nHe formulated the three laws of motion:\n\n* Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it.\n* The relationship between an object's mass ''m'', its acceleration ''a'', and the applied force ''F'' is ''F'' = ''ma''. Acceleration and force are vectors (as sometimes indicated by their symbols being displayed in slant bold font); in this law, the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector.\n* For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n==Academic career==\nIn January 1665 Newton took the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]]. The persons appointed (in conjunction with the proctors, John Slade of [[Catharine Hall, Cambridge]], and [[Benjamin Pulleyn]] of Trinity College, Newton's tutor) to examine the questionists{{clarify|date=December 2018}} were [[John Eachard]] of Catharine Hall and [[Thomas Gipps]] of Trinity University.{{clarify|date=December 2018}} It is a curious accident{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that we have no information about the respective merits of the candidates for a degree in this year since the \"ordo senioritis\" of the Bachelors of Arts for the year is omitted in the \"Grace Book\".\n\nIt is supposed{{By whom|date=May 2019}} that it was in 1665 that the method of [[fluxion|fluxi\u00f3n]]s (his term for [[calculus of variations]]) first occurred to Newton's mind. There are several papers in Newton's handwriting bearing dates 1665<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Trinity College Notebook|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03996/}}</ref>{{Better source|date=May 2019|reason=The noted source is primary source material, which is not considered a reliable source for Wikipedia.

On each occasion it was agreed, as shown by entries in the \"Conclusion Book\" of the college, dated 7 August 1665, and 22 June 1666, and signed by the master of the college, Dr Pearson, that all fellows and scholars who were dismissed on account of the pestilence be allowed one month's commons.{{Clarify|reason=What is meant by the term commons in this context?|date=May 2019}}\n\nNewton must have left college before August 1665{{According to whom|date=May 2019}}, as his name does not appear in the list of those who received extra commons on that occasion, and he tells us himself in the extract from his commonplace book already quoted that he was \"forced from Cambridge by the plague\" in the summer of that year. He was elected a fellow of his college on 5 October 1667. There were nine vacancies, one caused by the death of [[Abraham Cowley]] the previous summer, and the nine successful candidates were all of the same academic standings. A few weeks after his election to a [[fellow]]ship Newton went to Lincolnshire and did not return to Cambridge till the February following. In March 1668 he took his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degree.\n\nDuring the years 1666 to 1669 Newton's studies were very diverse. He bought [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s and lenses on two or three occasions, and also [[chemical]]s and a [[furnace]], apparently for chemical experiments{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}; but he also employed part of his time on the theory of fluxions and other branches of pure mathematics. He wrote a paper, ''De Analysi per Aequationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas'', which he put, probably in June 1669, into the hands of Isaac Barrow (then [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]]), at the same time permitting him to communicate its contents to their common friend [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]] (1624&ndash;1683), a mathematician of no mean order. Barrow did so on 31 July 1669, but kept the name of the author a secret, and merely told Collins that he was a friend staying at Cambridge, who had a powerful genius for such matters.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} In a subsequent letter on 20 August Barrow expressed his pleasure at hearing the favourable opinion which Collins had formed of the paper, and added, \"the name of the author is Newton, a fellow of our college, and a young man, who is only in his second year since he took the degree of Master of Arts, and who, with an unparalleled genius (''examine quo est acumen''), has made very great progress in this branch of mathematics\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Shortly afterward Barrow resigned his chair and was instrumental in securing Newton's election as his successor.\n\nNewton was elected Lucasian professor on 29 October 1670. It was his duty as professor{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to lecture at least once a week in term time on some portion of [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], [[astronomy]], [[geography]], [[optics]], [[statics]], or some other [[mathematics|mathematical]] subject, and also for two hours in the week to allow an audience to any student who might come to consult with the professor on any difficulties he had encountered. The subject which Newton chose for his lectures was optics. These lectures did little to expand his reputation, as they were remarkably sparsely attended; frequently leaving Newton to lecture at the walls of the classroom.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} An account of their content was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in the spring of 1672.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==The composition of white light==\n[[File:NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A replica of Newton's second reflecting telescope of 1672 presented to the [[Royal Society]].]]\nAccording to [[Alfred Rupert Hall]] the first practical reflecting telescope was built by Newton in 1668.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">''Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought'', by Alfred Rupert Hall, 1996, page 67.</ref> Later on such prototype for a design came to be called a [[Newtonian telescope]] or [[Newton's reflector]].\n\nOn 21 December 1671 he was proposed as a candidate for admission to the Royal Society by Dr [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]], [[bishop of Salisbury]], and on 11 January 1672, he was elected a fellow of the Society. At the meeting at which Newton was elected, he read a description of a [[reflecting telescope]] which he had invented, and \"it was ordered that a letter should be written by the secretary to Mr. Newton to acquaint him of his election into the Society, and to thank him for the communication of his [[telescope]], and to assure him that the Society would take care that all right should be done him concerning this invention.\" {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn his reply to the secretary on 18 January 1672, Newton writes: \"I desire that in your next letter you would inform me for what time the society continue their weekly meetings; because, if they continue them for any time, I am purposing them to be considered of and examined an account of a philosophical discovery, which induced me to the making of the said telescope, and which I doubt not but will prove much more grateful than the communication of that instrument being in my judgment the oddest if not the most considerable detection which hath hitherto been made into the operations of nature.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThis promise was fulfilled in communication which Newton addressed to [[Henry Oldenburg]], the secretary of the Royal Society, on 6 February 1672, and which was read before the society two days afterward. The whole is printed in No. 80 of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]].''\n\nNewton's \"philosophical discovery\" was the realisation that white light is composed of a [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of colours. He realised that objects are coloured only because they absorb some of these colours more than others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nAfter he explained this to the Society, he proceeded: \"When I understood this, I left off my aforesaid glassworks; for I saw, that the perfection of telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for want of glasses truly [[Figuring|figured]] according to the prescriptions of Optics Authors (which all men have hitherto imagined), as because that light itself is a heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible rays. So that was a glass so exactly figured as to collect any one sort of rays into one point, it could not collect those also into the same point, which has the same incidence upon the same medium are apt to suffer a different [[refraction]]. Nay, I wondered, that seeing the difference of refrangibility was so great, as I found it, telescopes should arrive at that perfection they are now at.\" This \"difference in refrangibility\" is now known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nHe then points out why \"the object-glass of any telescope cannot collect all the rays which come from one point of an object, to make them convene at its focus in less room than in a circular space, whose diameter is the 50th part of the diameter of its aperture: which is an irregularity some hundreds of times greater, than a circularly figured lens, of so small a section as the object-glasses of long telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of its figure, were light uniform.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} He adds: \"This made me take [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s into consideration, and finding them regular so that the Angle of Reflection of all sorts of Rays was equal to their Angle of Incidence; I understood, that by their mediation optic instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, provided a reflecting substance could be found, which would polish as finely as glass, and reflect as much light, as glass transmits, and the art of communicating to it a [[parabola|parabolic]] figure be also attained. But these seemed very great difficulties, and I have almost thought them insuperable, when I further considered, that every irregularity in a reflecting superficies makes the rays stray 5 or 6 times more out of their due course, than the like irregularities in a refracting one; so that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite, than in figuring glasses for refraction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n\"Amidst these thoughts, I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening Plague, and it was more than two years before I proceeded further. But then having thought on a tender way of polishing, proper for metal, whereby, as I imagined, the figure also would be corrected to the last; I began to try, what might be affected in this kind, and by degrees so far perfected an instrument (in the essential parts of it like that I sent to London), by which I could discern [[Jupiter]]'s 4 [[Natural satellite|Concomitant]]s, and showed them diverse times to two others of my acquaintance. I could also discern the [[Moon]]-like phase of [[Venus]], but not very distinctly, nor without some niceness in disposing of the instrument.\n\n\"From that time I was interrupted until this last autumn when I made the other. And as that was sensibly better than the first (especially for day-objects), so I doubt not, but they will be still brought to much greater perfection by their endeavours, who, as you inform me, are taking care of it at London.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Newton's theory of colour===\nAfter a remark that [[microscope]]s seem as capable of improvement as telescopes, he adds:\n\n{{quote |I shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable deformity in its Rays, were in the intermediate<!-- should it be the intermediate?--> degrees of refrangibility. And this analogy twist colours, and refrangibility is very precise and strict; the rays always either exactly agreeing in both, or proportionally disagreeing in both.}}\n\nFurther on, after some remarks on the subject of compound colours, he says:\n\n{{quote |I might add more instances of this nature, but I shall conclude with this general one, that the colours of all-natural bodies have no other origin than this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty than another. And this I have experimented in a dark room by illuminating those bodies with uncompounded light of diverse colours. For by that means anybody may be made to appear of any colour. They have there no appropriate colour, but ever appear of the colour of the light cast upon them, but yet with this difference, that they are most brisk and vivid in the light of their daylight colour. [[cinnabar|Minium]] appears thereof any colour indifferently, with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red, and so [[azurite|Bise]] appears indifferently of any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blue.}}\n{{quote |And there place a clear and colourless prism, to refract the entering light towards the further part of the room, which, as I said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured image. Then place a [[lens (optics)|lens]] of about three-foot radius (suppose a broad object-glass of a three-foot telescope), at the distance of about four or five foot from thence, through which all those colours may at once be transmitted, and made by its refraction to convene at a further distance of about ten or twelve feet. If at that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted into whiteness again by being mingled.}}\n\n{{quote |But it is requisite, that the prism and lens be placed steadily, and that the paper, on which the colours are cast be moved to and fro; for, by such motion, you will not only find, at what distance the whiteness is almost perfect but also see, how the colours gradually convene and vanish into whiteness, and afterward having crossed one another in that place where they compound whiteness, are again dissipated and severed, and in an inverted order retain the same colours, which they had before they entered the composition. You may also see, that, if any of the colours at the lens be intercepted, the whiteness will be changed into the other colours. And therefore, that the composition of whiteness be perfect, care must be taken, that none of the colours fall beside the lens.}}\n\nHe concludes his communication with the words: {{quote |This, I conceive, is enough for an introduction to experiments of this kind: which if any of the R. Society shall be so curious as to prosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what success:  if anything seems to be defective, or to thwart this relation, I may have an opportunity of giving further direction about it, or of acknowledging my errors, if I have committed any.}}\n\n===Controversies===\nThe publication of these discoveries led to a series of controversies which lasted for several years, in which Newton had to contend with the eminent English physicist [[Robert Hooke]], Anthony Lucas (mathematical professor at the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]]), [[Franciscus Linus]] (a physician in [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]), and many others. Some of his opponents denied the truth of his experiments, refusing to believe in the existence of the spectrum. Others criticised the experiments, saying that the length of the spectrum was never more than three and a half times the breadth{{clarify|date=December 2018}}, whereas Newton found it to be five times the breadth. It appears that Newton made the mistake of supposing that all prisms would give a spectrum of the same length; the objections of his opponents led him to measure carefully the lengths of spectra formed by prisms of different angles and different [[refractive index|refractive indices]], but he was not led thereby to the discovery of the different dispersive powers of different refractive substances.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nNewton carried on the discussion with the objectors with great courtesy and patience, but the pain which these long discussions gave to his sensitive mind may be estimated from his letter of 18 November 1676 to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]: \"I promised to send you an answer to Mr. Lucas this next Tuesday, but I find I shall scarce finish what I have designed, to get a copy taken of it by that time, and therefore I beg your patience a week longer. I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy, but if I get free of Mr. Lucas's business, I will resolutely bid adieu to it eternally, excepting what I do for my private satisfaction, or leave to come out after me; for I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or to become a slave to defend it.\"\n\nIt was fortunate{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that these disputes did not damp Newton's ardour as much as he feared. He later published many papers in the Philosophical Transactions on various aspects of optics, and, although some of his views are erroneous, and are now almost universally rejected, his investigations led to discoveries which are of permanent value. He succeeded in explaining the colour of thin and of thick plates ([[diffraction]]), and the inflexion{{clarify|date=December 2018}} of light, and he wrote on double refraction, [[light polarisation]] and [[binocular vision]]. He also invented a [[Octant (instrument)#Newton's reflecting quadrant|reflecting quadrant]] for observing the angles between the [[moon]] and the fixed stars&mdash; the same in every essential as the historically important navigational instrument more commonly known as [[Octant (instrument)|Hadley's quadrant]]. This discovery was communicated by him to [[Edmund Halley]] in 1700 but was not published, or communicated to the Royal Society, until after Newton's death, when a description of it was found among his papers.\n\n==Conflict over oratorship elections==\nIn March 1673 Newton took a prominent part in a dispute in the university. The public oratorship fell vacant, and a contest arose between the heads of the colleges and the members of the [[Senate]] as to the mode of electing to the office. The heads claimed the right of nominating two persons, one of whom was to be elected by the senate. The senate insisted that the proper mode was by an open election. [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], who was the chancellor of the university, endeavoured to effect a compromise which, he says, \"I hope may for the present satisfy both sides. I propose that the heads may for this time nominate and the body comply, yet interposing (if they think fit) a protestation concerning their plea that this election may not hereafter pass for a decisive precedent in prejudice of their claim\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} and, \"whereas I understand that the whole university has chiefly consideration for Dr [[Henry Paman]] of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and Mr. Craven of Trinity College, I do recommend them both to be nominated.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The heads, however, nominated Drs Paman and Ralph Sanderson (of St John's); the next day 121 members of the senate recorded their votes for Craven and ninety-eight for Paman. On the morning of the election, a protest in which Newton's name appeared was read and entered in the Regent House. But the vice-chancellor admitted Paman the same morning, and so ended the first contest of a non-scientific character in which Newton took part. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Newton's poverty==\nOn 8 March 1673 Newton wrote to Oldenburg, the secretary of the Royal Society:<blockquote>\"Sir, I desire that you will procure that I may be put out from being any longer Fellow of the Royal Society: for though I honour that body, yet since I see I shall neither profit them nor (because of this distance) can partake of the advantage of their assemblies, I desire to withdraw.\"</blockquote>\n\nOldenburg replied to this with an offer to apply to the Society to excuse Newton the weekly payments, as in a letter of Newton's to Oldenburg, dated 23 June 1673, he says, \"For your proffer about my quarterly payments, I thank you, but I would not have you trouble yourself to get them excused if you have not done it already.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Nothing further seems to have been done in the matter until 28 January 1675, when Oldenburg informed the Society that \"Mr. Newton is now in such circumstances that he desires to be excused from the weekly payments.\" Upon this \"it was agreed to by the council that he be dispensed with, as several others are.\" {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nOn 18 February 1675 Newton was formally accepted into the Society. The most probable reason why Newton wished to be excused from these payments is that, as he was not in holy orders, his fellowship at Trinity College would lapse in autumn 1675, with a consequent reduction in his income. But he received a patent from the Crown in April 1675, allowing him as Lucasian professor to retain his fellowship without being required to take holy orders. This must have relieved Newton's financial worries since in November 1676 he donated \u00a340 towards the building of the new library of Trinity College.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Universal law of gravitation==\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation}}\nIt is supposed{{By whom|date=May 2019}} that it was at Woolsthorpe in the summer of 1666 that Newton's thoughts were directed to the subject of gravity. They are said{{By whom|date=May 2019}} to have been inspired by Newton's seeing an apple fall from a tree on his mother's farm, a version for which there is reasonable historical evidence. In one version of the story, the apple is supposed to have fallen on Newton's head; this version appears to have been invented by [[Isaac D'Israeli]]. [[Voltaire]] is the authority for the former version of the story. He had his information from Newton's favourite niece [[Catherine Barton]], who married [[John Conduitt]], a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of Newton's intimate friends. How much truth there is in what is a plausible and a favourite story can never be known, but it is certain{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that tradition marked a tree as that from which the apple fell, until 1866, when, owing to decay, the tree was cut down and it is wood carefully preserved.\n\n[[Johannes Kepler]] had proved by an elaborate series of measurements that\n\n* each [[planet]] revolves in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit around the Sun, whose centre occupies one of the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of the ellipse,\n* that the radius vector of each planet drawn from the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times,\n* and that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.\n\nThe fact that heavy bodies have always a tendency to fall to the Earth, no matter at what height they are placed above the Earth's surface, seems to have led Newton to conjecture{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that the same tendency to fall to the Earth might have been the cause by which the Moon was retained in its orbit around the Earth.\n\nNewton, by calculating from [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]], and supposing the orbits of the planets to be circles with the sun at the centre, had already proved{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that the force of the Sun acting upon the different planets must vary as the inverse square of the distances of the planets from the Sun. He was therefore led{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to inquire whether if the Earth's attraction extended to the Moon, the force at that distance would be of the exact magnitude necessary to retain the Moon in its orbit. He found that the Moon by its motion in its orbit was deflected from the tangent in every minute through a space of 13 feet (3.96 m). But by observing the distance through which a body would fall in one second at the Earth's surface, and by calculating from that on the supposition of the force diminishing in the ratio of the inverse square of the distance, he found that the Earth's attraction at the distance of the moon would draw a body through 15&nbsp;ft. (4.57 metres) in one minute. Newton regarded the discrepancy between the results as proof of the inaccuracy of his conjecture, and \"laid aside at that time any further thoughts of this matter\".  (See [[Newton's cannonball]].)\n\nIn November 1679, [[Robert Hooke]] (after his appointment to manage the Royal Society's correspondence) began an exchange of letters with Newton{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}: he wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others.<ref>H W Turnbull (ed.) (1960), \"Correspondence of Isaac Newton\", Vol 2 (1676-1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), giving the Hooke-Newton correspondence (of November 1679 to January 1679|80) at pp.297-314.</ref> The correspondence later led to controversy. Hooke and Newton disagreed about the form of the path of a body falling from a height, taking the motion of the Earth around its axis into consideration. Newton later acknowledged that the exchanges of 1679-80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomy.<ref>H W Turnbull (ed.) (1960), cited above, at pp.435-440.</ref> This led Newton to revert{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to his former conjectures on the Moon. The estimate Newton had used for the radius of the Earth, which had been accepted by geographers and navigators, was based on the very rough estimate that the [[length of a degree of latitude]] of the Earth's surface measured along a meridian was 60 nautical miles.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} At a meeting of the Royal Society on 11 January 1672, Oldenburg, the secretary, read a letter from Paris describing the procedure followed by [[Jean Picard]] in measuring a degree, and specifically stating the precise length that he calculated it to be. It is probable that Newton had become acquainted with this measurement of Picard's, and that he was therefore led to make use of it when his thoughts were redirected to the subject. This estimate of the Earth's magnitude, giving 691 miles (1112&nbsp; km) to 10\u00b0, made the two results, the discrepancy between which Newton had regarded as a disproof of his conjecture, to agree so exactly that he now regarded his conjecture as fully established.\n\nIn January 1684, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], Halley and Hooke were led to discuss the law of gravity, and although they probably all agreed{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} on the truth of the inverse square law, yet this truth was not looked upon as established. It appears{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} that Hooke professed to have a solution of the problem of the path of a body moving around a centre of force attracting as the inverse square of the distance, but Halley declared after a delay of some months that Hooke \"had not been so good as his word\" in showing his solution to Wren and started for Cambridge, in August 1684, to consult Newton on the subject. Without mentioning the speculations which had been made, he asked Newton what would be the curve described by a planet around the Sun on the assumption that the Sun's force diminished as the square of the distance. Newton replied promptly, \"an ellipse\", and on being questioned by Halley as to the reason for his answer he replied, \"Why, I have calculated it.\" He could not, however, put his hand upon his calculation, but he promised to send it to Halley. After the latter had left Cambridge, Newton set to work to reproduce the calculation. After making a mistake and producing a different result he corrected his work and obtained his former result.\n\nNext November, Newton redeemed his promise to Halley by sending him, by the hand of Mr. Paget, a fellow of Trinity College and mathematical master of [[Christ's Hospital]], a copy of his demonstration; and very soon afterward Halley again visited Cambridge to confer with Newton about the problem. On his return to London on 10 December 1684, he informed the Royal Society \"that he had lately seen Mr. Newton at Cambridge, who had shown him a curious treatise ''De Motu''\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} which at Halley's desire he promised to send to the Society to be entered upon their register. \"Mr. Halley was desired to put Mr. Newton in mind of his promise for the securing this invention to himself, till he could be at leisure to publish it\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}<!-- Who said this? This quote is not properly attributed to a source. --> and Paget was desired to join with Halley in urging Newton to do so. By the middle of February Newton had sent his paper to Aston, one of the secretaries of the Society, and in a letter to Aston dated 23 February 1685, Newton thanked him for \"having entered on the register his notions about motion\". This treatise ''De Motu'' was the starting point of the ''Principia'',{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} and was meant{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} to be a short account of what that work was intended to embrace. It occupies twenty-four [[octavo]] pages, and consists of four [[theorem]]s and seven problems, some of which are identical with some of the most important propositions of the second and third sections of the first book of the [[Principia Mathematica|'' Principia'']].\n\n==See also==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus]]\n* [[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)]]\n* ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Newton]]''\n* [[Gauss\u2013Newton algorithm]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[List of independent discoveries#17th century|List of independent discoveries]]\n* [[Newton's cannonball]]\n* [[Newton disc]]\n* [[Newton fractal]]\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Newton's inequalities]]\n* [[Newton's laws of motion]]\n* [[Newton's notation]]\n* [[Newton polygon]]\n* [[Newton polynomial]]\n* [[Isaac Newton's religious views|Newton's religious views]]\n* [[Newton series#Newton series|Newton series]]\n* [[Newton's theorem of revolving orbits]]\n* [[Newton (unit)]]\n{{col-3}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Isaac Newton}}\n* [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]]\n* [[Newton\u2013Euler equations]]\n* [[Newtonianism]]\n* [[Scientific Revolution]]\n* [[Writing of Principia Mathematica]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Westfall|first=Richard S.|title=The Life of Isaac Newton|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1994|isbn=0-521-47737-9}}\n\n{{Isaac Newton}}\n\n[[Category:Isaac Newton]]\n[[Category:Early lives by individual|Newton, Sir Isaac]]\n", "name_user": "2601:8c4:4380:9790:41ef:6b25:e646:65e3", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_of_Isaac_Newton"}
