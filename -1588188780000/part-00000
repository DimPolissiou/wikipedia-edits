Among the tracks written for these albums were \"To Live Is to Fly\", \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", and \"[[If I Needed You]]\". These songs eventually raised Van Zandt to near-legend status in American and European songwriting circles.<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nIn 1972, Van Zandt recorded tracks for an album with a working title of ''Seven Come Eleven'', which remained unreleased for many years due to a dispute between his manager Kevin Eggers and producer Jack Clement. Eggers either could not or refused to pay for the studio sessions, so Clement erased the master tapes. However, before they were deleted, Eggers snuck into the studio and recorded rough mixes of the songs on to a [[cassette tape]]. Tracks from the aborted ''Seven Come Eleven'' debacle later surfaced on ''The Nashville Sessions''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1975, Van Zandt was featured prominently in the documentary film ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'' with [[Guy Clark]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Gamble Rogers]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and [[David Allan Coe]].

Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression.<ref name=\"utr\" /> In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, [[Tomato Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> The following year, he recorded ''[[Flyin' Shoes]]''; he did not release another album until 1987's ''[[At My Window (album)|At My Window]]''. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.<ref name=\"dallasmusic\" />\n\n=== 1980s\u20131990s ===\nSeveral of Van Zandt's compositions were recorded by other artists, such as [[Emmylou Harris]] who, with [[Don Williams]], had a No. 3 country hit in 1981 with \"[[If I Needed You]],\" and [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]], the pair taking \"Pancho and Lefty\" to No. 1 on the country charts in 1983. Van Zandt had a small cameo appearance in the video for the song. In his later years, he recorded less frequently, his voice and singing style altered in part because of his drug addiction and alcoholism. However, he continued writing songs, such as \"Marie\" and \"The Hole\".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAccording to Susanna Clark, Van Zandt turned down repeated invitations to write with Bob Dylan.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=203}}</ref> Dylan was reportedly a \"big fan\" of Townes and claimed to have all of his records; Van Zandt admired Dylan's songs, but didn't care for his celebrity.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\" /> The two first met during a chance encounter outside a costume shop in the [[South Congress]] district of Austin, on June 21, 1986.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\" /> According to Johnny Guess, Dylan later arranged another meeting with the songwriter. The [[Drag (Austin, Texas)|Drag]] in Austin was shut down due to Dylan being in town; Van Zandt drove his [[motorhome]] to the cordoned-off area, after which Dylan boarded the vehicle and requested to hear him play several songs.<ref>''[[Be Here to Love Me]]'' DVD bonus feature: Johnny Guess interview.</ref> In May and June 1990, he opened for the [[Cowboy Junkies]] during a two-month-long tour of the United States and Canada, which exposed him to a younger generation of fans.<ref name=\"tvzfaq\" /> As a result, he wrote the song \"Cowboy Junkies Lament\" for the group, with a verse about each respective member of the band.<ref name=\"deeperblue216\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n=== Relationships ===\nVan Zandt married Fran Peterson on August 26, 1965; a son, John Townes \"J.T.\" Van Zandt II, was born to them on April 11, 1969, in Houston.

They had no children.<ref name=\"tvzfaq\" />\n\nVan Zandt's final marriage was to Jeanene Munsell. They met on December 9, 1980 at a memorial for [[John Lennon]].

Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression.<ref name=\"utr\" /> In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, [[Tomato Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> The following year, he recorded ''[[Flyin' Shoes]]''; he did not release another album until 1987's ''[[At My Window (album)|At My Window]]''. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s.

Van Zandt had a small cameo appearance in the video for the song. In his later years, he recorded less frequently, his voice and singing style altered in part because of his drug addiction and alcoholism.

She is a professor [[Emeritus|emerita]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Ideologically a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Davis was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] until 1991, after which she joined the breakaway [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]]. She is the author of over ten books on [[Social class|class]], [[feminism]], and the [[Incarceration in the United States|U.S. prison system]].\n\nBorn to an [[African American]] family in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Davis studied French at [[Brandeis University]] and philosophy at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in [[West Germany]]. Studying under the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], a prominent figure in the [[Frankfurt School]] of Marxism, Davis became increasingly interested in [[far-left politics]]. Returning to the U.S., she studied at the [[University of California, San Diego]] before moving to [[East Germany]], where she gained a doctorate at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Back in the U.S., she joined the Communist Party and, as a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]], involved herself in a range of leftist causes, including the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|campaign against]] the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1969 she was hired as an acting assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). UCLA's governing [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] soon fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her use of inflammatory language. \n\nIn 1970, firearms registered to Davis were used in an [[Marin County courthouse incident|armed takeover of a courtroom]] in [[Marin County, California]], in which four people were killed. She was prosecuted for three capital felonies, including conspiracy to murder. After over a year in jail, she was acquitted of the charges in 1972. She continued both her academic work and her domestic activism. In the 1980s she was professor of [[Ethnic Studies|ethnic studies]] at [[San Francisco State University]]. Much of her work focused on [[Prison abolition movement|the abolition of prisons]] and in 1997 she co-founded [[Critical Resistance]], an organization working to abolish the [[prison\u2013industrial complex]]. During the 1970s she visited [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]-governed countries and during the 1980s was twice the Communist Party's candidate for [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]]. In 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], she left the party and joined the breakaway Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Also in 1991, she joined the [[Feminist Studies|feminist studies]] department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she became department director before retiring in 2008. Since then she has continued to write and remained active in movements such as [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign.\n\nPraised by many Marxists and others on the far left, Davis has received various awards, including the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. She has also sustained criticism<!-- Criticism by who? --> for her support for political violence and her refusal to advocate for prisoners in Marxist-Leninist countries.<!-- What prisoners and which countries? -->\n\n==Early life==\nAngela Davis was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Her family lived in the \"Dynamite Hill\" neighborhood, which was marked in the 1950s by the bombings of houses in an attempt to intimidate and drive out middle-class blacks who had moved there. Davis occasionally spent time on her uncle's farm and with friends in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Rocks}}</ref> She had two brothers, [[Ben Davis (American football)|Ben]] and Reginald, and a sister, Fania.

Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school, and later, Parker Annex, a middle-school branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time, Davis's mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], an organization influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] aimed at building alliances among African Americans in the South.

She was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], in which four black girls were killed. She grieved deeply as she was personally acquainted with the victims.<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\nNearing completion of her degree in French, Davis realized her major interest was philosophy. She was particularly interested in Marcuse's ideas. On returning to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. Marcuse, she wrote in her autobiography, was approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965, she graduated [[magna cum laude]], a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\n===University of PoopHead===\n[[File:Angela_Davis_at_Goethe_University_in_Frankfurt,_Germany.tif|thumb|As a student at the Institute of Social Research at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

After visiting [[East Berlin]] during the annual [[May Day#Germany|May Day celebration]], she felt that the East German government was dealing better with the residual effects of [[fascism]] than were the [[West Germany|West Germans]]. Many of her roommates were active in the radical [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union (SDS)]], and Davis participated in some SDS actions.

According to Davis, between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century, the number of prisons in the United States sharply increased but crime rates continued to fall. She argues that racism in American society during this time was demonstrated by the disproportionate share of the African-American population who were incarcerated. \"What is effective or just about this 'justice' system?\" she urged people to ask.<ref name=\"Prison Abolishment\">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Are prisons Obsolete?|year=2003|publisher=Open Media Series|location=Canada}}</ref>\n\nDavis has lectured at [[Rutgers University]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Smith College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Brown University]], [[Syracuse University]], and other schools.

activist, philosopher, academic, and author. She is a professor [[Emeritus|emerita]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Ideologically a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Davis was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] until 1991, after which she joined the breakaway [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]]. She is the author of over ten books on [[Social class|class]], [[feminism]], and the [[Incarceration in the United States|U.S. prison system]].\n\nBorn to an [[African American]] family in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Davis studied French at [[Brandeis University]] and philosophy at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in [[West Germany]]. Studying under the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], a prominent figure in the [[Frankfurt School]] of Marxism, Davis became increasingly interested in [[far-left politics]]. Returning to the U.S., she studied at the [[University of California, San Diego]] before moving to [[East Germany]], where she gained a doctorate at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Back in the U.S., she joined the Communist Party and, as a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]], involved herself in a range of leftist causes, including the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|campaign against]] the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1969 she was hired as an acting assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). UCLA's governing [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] soon fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her use of inflammatory language. \n\nIn 1970, firearms registered to Davis were used in an [[Marin County courthouse incident|armed takeover of a courtroom]] in [[Marin County, California]], in which four people were killed. She was prosecuted for three capital felonies, including conspiracy to murder. After over a year in jail, she was acquitted of the charges in 1972. She continued both her academic work and her domestic activism. In the 1980s she was professor of [[Ethnic Studies|ethnic studies]] at [[San Francisco State University]]. Much of her work focused on [[Prison abolition movement|the abolition of prisons]] and in 1997 she co-founded [[Critical Resistance]], an organization working to abolish the [[prison\u2013industrial complex]]. During the 1970s she visited [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]-governed countries and during the 1980s was twice the Communist Party's candidate for [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]]. In 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], she left the party and joined the breakaway Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Also in 1991, she joined the [[Feminist Studies|feminist studies]] department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she became department director before retiring in 2008. Since then she has continued to write and remained active in movements such as [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign.\n\nPraised by many Marxists and others on the far left, Davis has received various awards, including the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. She has also sustained criticism<!-- Criticism by who? --> for her support for political violence and her refusal to advocate for prisoners in Marxist-Leninist countries.<!-- What prisoners and which countries? -->\n\n==Early life==\nAngela Davis was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Her family lived in the \"Dynamite Hill\" neighborhood, which was marked in the 1950s by the bombings of houses in an attempt to intimidate and drive out middle-class blacks who had moved there. Davis occasionally spent time on her uncle's farm and with friends in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Rocks}}</ref> She had two brothers, [[Ben Davis (American football)|Ben]] and Reginald, and a sister, Fania.

Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school, and later, Parker Annex, a middle-school branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time, Davis's mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], an organization influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] aimed at building alliances among African Americans in the South.

She was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], in which four black girls were killed. She grieved deeply as she was personally acquainted with the victims.<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\nNearing completion of her degree in French, Davis realized her major interest was philosophy. She was particularly interested in Marcuse's ideas. On returning to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. Marcuse, she wrote in her autobiography, was approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965, she graduated [[magna cum laude]], a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\n===University of Frankfurt===\n[[File:Angela_Davis_at_Goethe_University_in_Frankfurt,_Germany.tif|thumb|As a student at the Institute of Social Research at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

After visiting [[East Berlin]] during the annual [[May Day#Germany|May Day celebration]], she felt that the East German government was dealing better with the residual effects of [[fascism]] than were the [[West Germany|West Germans]]. Many of her roommates were active in the radical [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union (SDS)]], and Davis participated in some SDS actions.

In recent works, she has argued that the US prison system more closely resembles a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system. According to Davis, between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century, the number of prisons in the United States sharply increased but crime rates continued to fall. She argues that racism in American society during this time was demonstrated by the disproportionate share of the African-American population who were incarcerated. \"What is effective or just about this 'justice' system?\" she urged people to ask.<ref name=\"Prison Abolishment\">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Are prisons Obsolete?|year=2003|publisher=Open Media Series|location=Canada}}</ref>\n\nDavis has lectured at [[Rutgers University]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Smith College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Brown University]], [[Syracuse University]], and other schools. As most of her teaching is at the graduate level, she says that she concentrates more on posing questions that encourage development of [[critical thinking]] than on imparting knowledge.<ref name=\"BookTV\"/>\n\nAs early as 1969, Davis began public speaking engagements. She expressed her opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], racism, sexism, and the prison\u2013industrial complex, and her support of gay rights and other social justice movements. In 1969, she blamed [[imperialism]] for the troubles oppressed populations suffer: \n<blockquote>We are facing a common enemy and that enemy is Yankee Imperialism, which is killing us both here and abroad. Now I think anyone who would try to separate those struggles, anyone who would say that in order to consolidate an anti-war movement, we have to leave all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right into the hands of the enemy, she declared.<ref name=\"Speech-Vietnam\">{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Speech by Angela Davis at a Black Panther Rally in Bobby Hutton Park|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/04/15/18589458.php|work=East Bay|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2001 she publicly spoke against the war on terror following the [[9/11 attacks]], continued to criticize the prison\u2013industrial complex, and discussed the broken immigration system. She said that to solve social justice issues, people must \"hone their critical skills, develop them and implement them.\" Later, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, she declared that the \"horrendous situation in New Orleans\" was due to the country's structural racism, capitalism, and imperialism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JKENb33U4E|work=YouTube|title=Angela Davis making a live public speech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Angela-Davis-Mar-28-2006.jpg|thumb|right|Davis at the University of Alberta, March 28, 2006.]]\nDavis opposed the 1995 [[Million Man March]], arguing that the exclusion of women from this event promoted [[male chauvinism]].

It consists of two bored tunnels and the [[cable stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] '''Queen Elizabeth II Bridge'''. The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of [[Greater London]], it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles.{{sfn|Pickford|Blythe|2006|p=256}} It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the [[M25 motorway]]'s route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described as one of the most important road crossings in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.\n\nThe crossing's development started in the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the [[World War II|Second World War]] and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a single lane of traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and this increased traffic put pressure on the tunnels' capacity. A [[Private Finance Initiative]] scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction.\n\nThe crossing had always been [[Toll road|tolled]], and from 1 April 2003 this became a [[Road pricing|charge]], though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am. An [[automatic number plate recognition]] charging scheme named the \"Dart Charge\" began in November 2014. As a result, the booths on the Kent side were removed and the charge is now only payable online. A residents' scheme is available, offering discounts for people living near the crossing.\n\n==Location==\nThe crossing spans the [[River Thames]] between [[Dartford, Kent]], to the south and [[Thurrock, Essex]], to the north. It is about {{convert|20|mi}} east of the [[centre of London]], outside the [[Greater London]] boundary.<ref>{{cite

It consists of two bored tunnels and the [[cable stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] '''Queen Elizabeth II Bridge'''. The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of [[Greater London]], it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles.{{sfn|Pickford|Blythe|2006|p=256}} It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the [[M25 motorway]]'s route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described as one of the most important road crossings in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.\n\nThe crossing's development started in the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the [[World War II|Second World War]] and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a single lane of traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and this increased traffic put pressure on the tunnels' capacity. A [[Private Finance Initiative]] scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction.\n\nThe crossing had always been [[Toll road|tolled]], and from 1 April 2003 this became a [[Road pricing|charge]], though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am. An [[automatic number plate recognition]] charging scheme named the \"Dart Charge\" began in November 2014. As a result, the booths on the Kent side were removed and the charge is now only payable online. A residents' scheme is available, offering discounts for people living near the crossing.\n\n==Location==\nThe crossing spans the [[River Thames]] between [[Dartford, Kent]], to the south and [[Thurrock, Essex]], to the north. It is about {{convert|20|mi}} east of the [[centre of London]], outside the [[Greater London]] boundary.<ref>{{cite

Her main attribute is the military [[helmet]] worn on her head; she often holds a sword, spear, or shield, and brandishes a torch or whip as she rides into battle in a four-horse chariot. She had a temple near the [[Theater of Marcellus]]. Her iconography was extended by painters and sculptors following the [[Renaissance]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe goddess of war ''Bell\u014dna'' is a derivative of Latin ''bellum'' ('war, warfare'), older ''duellum'', probably stemming from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ''*duenelo'' ('quite good, quite brave').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=70}}she was born at belona tower thats why they named her bellona\n\n==Cult and temples==\nOriginally named ''Duellona'' in the [[Italic languages]],<ref>[[Varro]], ''On the Latin Language'', VIII.49.</ref> (according to the typical evolution in Latin of initial \"du\" to \"b\"){{cn|date=February 2020}} the cult figure who became Bellona was an ancient [[Sabines|Sabine]] goddess of war and identified with [[Nerio]], the consort of the war god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] - and later with the Greek [[Enyo]]. Her first [[Temple of Bellona (Rome)|temple]] in Rome was dedicated in 296 BCE, where her festival was celebrated on 3 June.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Ancient Mediterranean Religions'' (2016), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dXH4CgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA136 p.136]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Her priests were known as Bellonarii and used to wound their own arms or legs as a blood sacrifice to her.<ref>William Smith, ''Smaller Classical Dictionary'', London 1862, p.77</ref> These rites took place on 24 March, called the day of blood (''dies sanguinis''), after the ceremony. In consequence of this practice, which approximated to the rites dedicated to [[Cybele]] in [[Asia Minor]], both Enyo and Bellona became identified with her [[Cappadocia]]n aspect, [[Ma (goddess)|Ma]].<ref>\"Cults of Enyo and Ma\" at [http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html Theoi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517160833/http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html |date=May 17, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe Roman [[Campus Martius]] area, in which Bellona\u2019s temple was situated, had [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial status]]. Ambassadors from foreign states, who were not allowed to enter the city proper, stayed in this complex. Since the area of the temple was outside the pomerium, the Senate met there with ambassadors and received victorious generals prior to their [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s. Beside the temple was the war column (''columna bellica''), which represented non-Roman territory. To declare war on a distant state, a javelin was thrown over the column by one of the priests concerned with diplomacy (''[[fetial]]es'') in a modification of the archaic practice, from Roman territory toward the direction of the enemy land and this symbolical attack was considered the opening of war.<ref>\"Fetiales\", [http://www.britannica.com/topic/fetial#ref6592 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801195059/http://www.britannica.com/topic/fetial#ref6592 |date=August 1, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn the military cult of Bellona, she was associated with [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], the personification of valour. She then travelled outside Rome with the imperial legions and her temples have been recorded in France, Germany, Britain, and North Africa.<ref>Glenys Lloyd-Morgan, \"Nemesis and Bellona\" in ''The Concept of the Goddess'', London 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z6EAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA125 pp.125-6]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Representation in the arts==\n===Poetry===\nOften in poetry the name Bellona is used simply as a synonym for war, although in the [[Thebaid (Latin poem)|''Thebaid'']] of [[Statius]] the goddess appears as a character, representing the destructive and belligerent aspect of war. There she is described as carrying a spear and a flaming torch or riding in a chariot and waving a blood-stained sword.<ref>Included in the \"Enyo\" article at [http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html Theoi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517160833/http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html |date=May 17, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Painting and sculpture===\nBellona is commonly portrayed wearing a plumed helmet and dressed in armour, or at least a [[breastplate]] with a skirt beneath. In her hand she carries a spear, shield, or other weapons, and occasionally, she sounds a [[trumpet]] for the attack. She was sometimes associated with the winged [[Victory]] holding a laurel crown in her hand, a statue of whom she sometimes carries; when she appears on war memorials she may hold that attribute.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Spranger Bellona against the Turks.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|\"Bellona Leading the Imperial Armies against the Turks\", a 1600 print of [[Bartholomaeus Spranger]]'s  design]]\n\n===Painting and sculpture===\nExamples of such an armoured figure appear in the 1633 painting attributed to [[Rembrandt]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],<ref>Ernst van de Wetering, A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings VI: Rembrandt's Paintings Revisited, Dordrecht NL 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hk5TBQAAQBAJ p.529]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and statues by [[Johann Baptist Straub]] (1770) and [[Johann Wilhelm Beyer]] (1773\u201380).

In the fresco by Constantino Brumidi in the [[Brumidi Corridors|U.S. Capitol]] (1855\u201360), her image is updated. There she is shown standing next to an [[artillery]] piece and has the stars and stripes on her shield.\n\nNot all representations of Bellona wear armour.

There are Classical references that sanction this, however. In [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'', for example, appears the description \"Bellona with bare flank, her brazen weapons clanging as she moved\" (3. 60).<ref>\"Bellona\" section at [http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html Theoi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517160833/http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html |date=May 17, 2016 }}</ref> A further poetic reference taken up by a painter occurs in [[Louis Jean Fran\u00e7ois Lagren\u00e9e]]'s \"Bellona Presenting the Reins of his Horses to Mars\" (1766).

In ''[[Henry IV, Part I]]'', Hotspur describes her as \"the fire-eyed maid of smoky war\" (IV.i.119). In [[The Two Noble Kinsmen]], set in pre-Roman Athens, the sister of Hippolyta will solicit her divine aid for Theseus against Thebes (I.iii.13). At the start of the play named after him, ''[[Macbeth]]'' is introduced as a violent and brave warrior when the Thane of Ross calls him \"Bellona's bridegroom\" (I.ii.54), that is to say, the equivalent of Mars. \n \nIn more modern times, [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]] dedicated an energetic [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburnean]] evocation of the \"false goddess\" who leads men astray in his poem \"Bellona\", published in Australia in 1867.<ref>''Sea Spray and Smoke Drift'', [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gordon/adam_lindsay/poems/chapter1.html#section10 poem 10] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912013537/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gordon/adam_lindsay/poems/chapter1.html#section10 |date=September 12, 2015 }}</ref> She also figures in [[Edgell Rickword]]'s [[World War I]] poem \"The Traveller\". There the poet describes himself as marching toward the front line in the company of Art, the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], and the works of [[Walter Pater]]. Meeting Bellona as they approach the fighting, one by one the pleasurable companions are forced to flee before the violence of war, until the goddess rejoices in having him to herself.<ref>Published in Behind the Eyes (1921)</ref>\n\n===Cantata and opera===\nBellona appears in the prologue of [[Rameau]]'s opera, ''[[Les Indes Galantes]]'' (1735), in which the call of love ultimately triumphs over that of war.<ref>Cuthbert Girdlestone, Philip Gossett, ''Jean-Philippe Rameau: His Life and Work'', Dover Publications 1969, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7aqtAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA324 pp.323-4]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In a Bach ''[[dramma per musica]]'' performed two years before, [[T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken!

Batholomaeus Spranger's \"Bellona Leading the Imperial Armies against the Turks\" (see above) played its part in Austria's anti-Turkish propaganda during the [[Long Turkish War]]. A later phase of the continuing conflict, culminating in victory at the [[battle of Zenta]] in 1697, is marked by Jean Cosyn's celebratory doorway in Brussels in what now is known as the Maison de Bellone, at the centre of which presides the helmeted bust of the goddess surrounded by military standards and cannons.<ref>Photographs on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170305005145/http://www.brusselspictures.com/wp-content/photos/Maison-de-la-Bellone/IMG_3203.JPG Brussels Pictures site]</ref>\n\nA dynastic political statement is made in [[Marie de Medici Cycle|\"Marie de Medici as Bellona\"]] (1622/5), designed by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for her public rooms in the [[Luxembourg Palace]].

She carries a small statue of the winged goddess in her right hand, a smaller winged figure is mounted below the plumes of her helmet, while [[cupid]]s hover above her, holding a [[laurel crown]]. Her portrayal contrasts with Rembrandt's depiction of Bellona with the homely features of an ordinary Dutchwoman.

Her main attribute is the military [[helmet]] worn on her head; she often holds a sword, spear, or shield, and brandishes a torch or whip as she rides into battle in a four-horse chariot. She had a temple near the [[Theater of Marcellus]]. Her iconography was extended by painters and sculptors following the [[Renaissance]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe goddess of war ''Bell\u014dna'' is a derivative of Latin ''bellum'' ('war, warfare'), older ''duellum'', probably stemming from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ''*duenelo'' ('quite good, quite brave').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=70}}\n\n==Cult and temples==\nOriginally named ''Duellona'' in the [[Italic languages]],<ref>[[Varro]], ''On the Latin Language'', VIII.49.</ref> (according to the typical evolution in Latin of initial \"du\" to \"b\"){{cn|date=February 2020}} the cult figure who became Bellona was an ancient [[Sabines|Sabine]] goddess of war and identified with [[Nerio]], the consort of the war god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] - and later with the Greek [[Enyo]]. Her first [[Temple of Bellona (Rome)|temple]] in Rome was dedicated in 296 BCE, where her festival was celebrated on 3 June.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Ancient Mediterranean Religions'' (2016), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dXH4CgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA136 p.136]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Her priests were known as Bellonarii and used to wound their own arms or legs as a blood sacrifice to her.<ref>William Smith, ''Smaller Classical Dictionary'', London 1862, p.77</ref> These rites took place on 24 March, called the day of blood (''dies sanguinis''), after the ceremony. In consequence of this practice, which approximated to the rites dedicated to [[Cybele]] in [[Asia Minor]], both Enyo and Bellona became identified with her [[Cappadocia]]n aspect, [[Ma (goddess)|Ma]].<ref>\"Cults of Enyo and Ma\" at [http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html Theoi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517160833/http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyo.html |date=May 17, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe Roman [[Campus Martius]] area, in which Bellona\u2019s temple was situated, had [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial status]]. Ambassadors from foreign states, who were not allowed to enter the city proper, stayed in this complex. Since the area of the temple was outside the pomerium, the Senate met there with ambassadors and received victorious generals prior to their [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s. Beside the temple was the war column (''columna bellica''), which represented non-Roman territory. To declare war on a distant state, a javelin was thrown over the column by one of the priests concerned with diplomacy (''[[fetial]]es'') in a modification of the archaic practice, from Roman territory toward the direction of the enemy land and this symbolical attack was considered the opening of war.<ref>\"Fetiales\", [http://www.britannica.com/topic/fetial#ref6592 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801195059/http://www.britannica.com/topic/fetial#ref6592 |date=August 1, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn the military cult of Bellona, she was associated with [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], the personification of valour.

In her hand she carries a spear, shield, or other weapons, and occasionally, she sounds a [[trumpet]] for the attack. She was sometimes associated with the winged [[Victory]] holding a laurel crown in her hand, a statue of whom she sometimes carries; when she appears on war memorials she may hold that attribute.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Spranger Bellona against the Turks.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|\"Bellona Leading the Imperial Armies against the Turks\", a 1600 print of [[Bartholomaeus Spranger]]'s  design]]\n\n===Painting and sculpture===\nExamples of such an armoured figure appear in the 1633 painting attributed to [[Rembrandt]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],<ref>Ernst van de Wetering, A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings VI: Rembrandt's Paintings Revisited, Dordrecht NL 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hk5TBQAAQBAJ p.529]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and statues by [[Johann Baptist Straub]] (1770) and [[Johann Wilhelm Beyer]] (1773\u201380).

At the start of the play named after him, ''[[Macbeth]]'' is introduced as a violent and brave warrior when the Thane of Ross calls him \"Bellona's bridegroom\" (I.ii.54), that is to say, the equivalent of Mars. \n \nIn more modern times, [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]] dedicated an energetic [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburnean]] evocation of the \"false goddess\" who leads men astray in his poem \"Bellona\", published in Australia in 1867.<ref>''Sea Spray and Smoke Drift'', [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gordon/adam_lindsay/poems/chapter1.html#section10 poem 10] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912013537/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gordon/adam_lindsay/poems/chapter1.html#section10 |date=September 12, 2015 }}</ref> She also figures in [[Edgell Rickword]]'s [[World War I]] poem \"The Traveller\".

A later phase of the continuing conflict, culminating in victory at the [[battle of Zenta]] in 1697, is marked by Jean Cosyn's celebratory doorway in Brussels in what now is known as the Maison de Bellone, at the centre of which presides the helmeted bust of the goddess surrounded by military standards and cannons.<ref>Photographs on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170305005145/http://www.brusselspictures.com/wp-content/photos/Maison-de-la-Bellone/IMG_3203.JPG Brussels Pictures site]</ref>\n\nA dynastic political statement is made in [[Marie de Medici Cycle|\"Marie de Medici as Bellona\"]] (1622/5), designed by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for her public rooms in the [[Luxembourg Palace]].

''Stern on Finance'', November 6, 2008.</ref> ]]\n\n'''Financialization''' (or '''Financialisation''' in [[British English]]) is a term sometimes used to describe the development of [[financial capitalism]] during the period from 1980 to present, in which [[Financial leverage|debt-to-equity ratios]] increased and [[financial markets|financial services]] accounted for an increasing share of [[national income]] relative to other sectors.\n\nFinancialization describes an economic process by which exchange is facilitated through the intermediation of [[financial instrument]]s. Financialization may permit real goods, services, and risks to be readily exchangeable for [[currency]], and thus make it easier for people to [[Rationalization (economics)|rationalize]] their assets and income flows.\n\n==Specific academic approaches==\nVarious definitions, focusing on specific aspects and interpretations, have been used:\n* Greta Krippner of the [[University of Michigan]] writes that financialization refers to a \"pattern of [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]] in which [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] making occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and [[Production (economics)|commodity production]].\" In the introduction to the 2005 book ''Financialization and the World Economy'', editor Gerald A. Epstein wrote that some scholars have insisted on a much narrower use of the term: the ascendancy of [[shareholder value]] as a mode of [[corporate governance]], or the growing dominance of [[capital market]] financial systems over bank-based financial systems. Pierre-Yves Gomez and Harry Korine, in their 2008 book ''Entrepreneurs and Democracy: A Political Theory of Corporate Governance'', have identified a long-term trend in the evolution of corporate governance of large corporations and have shown that financialization is one step in this process.\n*[[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] described financialization as \"a lapse back into the pre-industrial [[usury]] and rent economy of European [[feudalism]]\" in a 2003 interview:<ref>Standard Schaefer. [http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/08/29/who-benefited-from-the-tech-bubble-an-interview-with-michael-hudson Who Benefited from the Tech Bubble? an Interview with Michael Hudson]   ''CounterPunch'', August 29, 2003.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"only [[debt]]s grew exponentially, year after year, and they do so inexorably, even when\u2014indeed, especially when\u2014the economy slows down and its companies and people fall below break-even levels. As their debts grow, they siphon off the economic surplus for debt service (...) The problem is that the financial sector's receipts are not turned into fixed capital formation to increase output. They build up increasingly on the opposite side of the balance sheet, as new loans, that is, debts and new claims on society\u2019s output and income.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[Companies] are not able to invest in new physical capital equipment or buildings because they are obliged to use their operating revenue to pay their bankers and bondholders, as well as junk-bond holders. This is what I mean when I say that the economy is becoming financialized. Its aim is not to provide tangible capital formation or rising living standards, but to generate interest, financial fees for underwriting mergers and acquisitions, and capital gains that accrue mainly to insiders, headed by upper management and large financial institutions.  The upshot is that the traditional business cycle has been overshadowed by a secular increase in debt. Instead of labor earning more, hourly earnings have declined in real terms. There has been a drop in net disposable income after paying taxes and withholding \"forced saving\" for social Security and medical insurance, pension-fund contributions and\u2013most serious of all\u2013debt service on [[credit card]]s, [[bank loan]]s, [[mortgage loan]]s, [[student loan]]s, [[auto loan]]s, [[home insurance]] premiums, [[life insurance]], [[private medical insurance]] and other [[FIRE economy|FIRE-sector]] charges. ... This diverts spending away from goods and services.</blockquote>\n\n* Thomas Marois, looking at the big emerging markets, defines \"emerging finance capitalism\" as the current phase of accumulation, characterized by \"the fusion of the interests of domestic and foreign financial capital in the state apparatus as the institutionalized priorities and overarching social logic guiding the actions of state managers and government elites, often to the detriment of labor.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Marois|first=Thomas|title=States, Banks and Crisis: Emerging Finance Capitalism in Mexico and Turkey|year=2012|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|url=https://www.academia.edu/1457363}}</ref>\n* According to Gerald A. Epstein, \"Financialization refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international levels.\"<ref>Gerald Epstein [http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/financial/fin_Epstein.pdf Financialization, Rentier Interests, and Central Bank Policy].  December, 2001 (this version, June, 2002 )</ref>\n* Financialization may be defined as \"the increasing dominance of the finance industry in the sum total of economic activity, of financial controllers in the management of corporations, of financial assets among total assets, of marketised securities and particularly equities among financial assets, of the stock market as a market for corporate control in determining corporate strategies, and of fluctuations in the stock market as a determinant of business cycles\" (Dore 2002).\n* More popularly, however, financialization is understood to mean the vastly expanded role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors, and [[financial institution]]s in the operation of domestic and international economies.\n* Sociological and political interpretations have also been made. In his 2006 book, ''[[American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century]]'', American writer and commentator [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] presents financialization as \"a process whereby financial services, broadly construed, take over the dominant economic, cultural, and political role in a national economy\" (268). Phillips considers that the financialization of the US economy follows the same pattern that marked the beginning of the decline of [[Habsburg Spain]] in the 16th century, the [[Dutch trading empire]] in the 18th century, and the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century (it is also worth pointing out that the true final step in each of these historical economies was [[economic collapse|collapse]]):\n::... the leading [[economic power]]s have followed an evolutionary progression: first, agriculture, fishing, and the like, next commerce and industry, and finally finance. Several historians have elaborated this point. Brooks Adams contended that \"as societies consolidate, they pass through a profound intellectual change. Energy ceases to vent through the imagination and takes the form of capital.\"\n\nJean Cushen explores how the workplace outcomes associated with financialization render employees insecure and angry.<ref>Cushen, J. (2013). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368213000408 Financialization in the workplace: Hegemonic narratives, performative interventions and the angry knowledge worker]. ''Accounting, Organizations and Society'', Volume 38, Issue 4, May 2013, pp 314\u2013331.</ref>\n\n==Roots==\nIn the American experience, increased financialization occurred concomitant with the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and the free-market doctrines of [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago School of Economics]] in the late Twentieth Century. Various academic economists of that period worked out ideological and theoretical rationalizations and analytical approaches to facilitate the increased [[deregulation]] of financial systems and banking.\n\nIn a 1998 article, [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] discussed previous economists who saw the problems that result from financialization.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hudson | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Hudson (economist) | title = Financial Capitalism v.

Reinert]] and Arno Mong Daast\u00f8l in \"Production Capitalism vs. Financial Capitalism\" provided an extensive bibliography on past writings, and prophetically asked<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Reinert | first1 = Erik S. | last2 = Daast\u00f8l | first2 = Arno Mong | author-link1 = Erik S.

What are the long-term consequences if an increasing percentage of savings and wealth, as it now seems, is used to '''inflate the prices of already existing assets''' - real estate and stocks - instead of to create new production and innovation? </blockquote>\n\n==Financial turnover compared to gross domestic product==\nOther financial markets exhibited similarly explosive growth. Trading in US equity (stock) markets grew from $136.0 billion (or 13.1% of US GDP) in 1970 to $1.671 trillion (or 28.8% of U.S. GDP) in 1990. In 2000, trading in US equity markets was $14.222 trillion (144.9% of GDP). Most of the growth in stock trading has been directly attributed to the introduction and spread of [[program trading]].\n\nAccording to the [http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0703b.pdf March 2007 Quarterly Report from the Bank for International Settlements] (see page 24.):\n<blockquote>Trading on the international derivatives exchanges slowed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Combined turnover of interest rate, currency and stock index derivatives fell by 7% to $431 trillion between October and December 2006. </blockquote>\nThus, derivatives trading\u2014mostly [[futures contract]]s on interest rates, foreign currencies, Treasury bonds, and the like\u2014had reached a level of $1,200 trillion, or $1.2 quadrillion, a year. By comparison, US GDP in 2006 was $12.456 trillion.\n\n==Futures markets==\n[[File:Futures Trading Composition 2019 SVG.svg|thumb|right]]\nThe data for turnover in the futures markets in 1970, 1980, and 1990 is based on the number of contracts traded, which is reported by the organized exchanges, such as the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the New York Commodity Exchange, and compiled in data appendices of the Annual Reports of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The pie charts below show the dramatic shift in the types of futures contracts traded from 1970 to 2004.\n\nFor a century after organized futures exchanges were founded in the mid-19th century, all futures trading was solely based on agricultural commodities. But after the end of the gold-backed fixed-exchange rate system in 1971, contracts based on foreign currencies began to be traded. After the deregulation of interest rates by the Bank of England and then the US Federal Reserve in the late 1970s, futures contracts based on various bonds and interest rates began to be traded. The result was that financial futures contracts\u2014based on such things as interest rates, currencies, or equity indices\u2014came to dominate the futures markets.\n\nThe dollar value of turnover in the futures markets is found by multiplying the number of contracts traded by the average value per contract for 1978 to 1980, which was calculated in research by the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) in 1981. The figures for earlier years were estimated on computer-generated exponential fit of data from 1960 to 1970, with 1960 set at $165 billion, half the 1970 figure, on the basis of a graph accompanying the ACLI data, which showed that the number of futures contracts traded in 1961 and earlier years was about half the number traded in 1970.\n\nAccording to the ALCI data, the average value of interest-rate contracts is around ten times that of agricultural and other commodities, while the average value of currency contracts is twice that of agricultural and other commodities. (Beginning in mid-1993, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange itself began to release figures of the nominal value of contracts traded at the CME each month. In November 1993, the CME boasted that it had set a new monthly record of 13.466 million contracts traded, representing a dollar value of $8.8 trillion. By late 1994, this monthly value had doubled. On January 3, 1995, the CME boasted that its total volume for 1994 had jumped by 54%, to 226.3 million contracts traded, worth nearly $200 trillion. Soon thereafter, the CME ceased to provide a figure for the dollar value of contracts traded.)\n\nFutures contracts are a \"contract to buy or sell a very common homogenous item at a future date for a specific price\". The nominal value of a futures contract is wildly different from the risk involved in engaging in that contract. Consider two parties who engage in a contract to exchange 5,000 bushels of wheat at $8.89 per bushel on December 17, 2012. The nominal value of the contract would be $44,450 (5,000 bushels x $8.89). But what is the risk? For the buyer. the risk is that the seller will not be able to deliver the wheat on the stated date. This means the buyer must purchase the wheat from someone else; this is known as the \"spot market\". Assume that the spot price for wheat on December 17, 2012, is $10 per bushel. This means the cost of purchasing the wheat is $50,000 (5,000 bushels x $10). So the buyer would have lost $5,550 ($50,000 less $44,450), or the difference in the cost between the contract price and the spot price. Furthermore, futures are traded via exchanges, which guarantee that if one party reneges on its end of the bargain, (1) that party is blacklisted from entering into such contracts in the future and (2) the injured party is insured against the loss by the exchange. If the loss is so large that the exchange cannot cover it, then the members of the exchange make up the loss. Another mitigating factor to consider is that a commonly traded liquid asset, such as gold, wheat, or the S&P 500 stock index, is extremely unlikely to have a future value of $0; thus the counter-party risk is limited to something substantially less than the nominal value.\n\n==Accelerated growth of the finance sector==\nThe financial sector is a key industry in developed economies, in which it represents a sizeable share of the [[GDP]] and an important source of employment. [[Financial services]] ([[bank]]ing, [[insurance]], investment, etc.) have been for a long time a powerful sector of the economy in many economically developed countries. Those activities have also played a key role in facilitating [[economic globalization]].\n\n===Early 20th Century History in the United States===\nAs early as the beginning of the 20th Century, a small number of financial sector firms have controlled the lion's share of wealth and power of the financial sector. The notion of an American \"financial oligarchy\" was discussed as early as 1913. In an article entitled \"Our Financial Oligarchy,\" [[Louis Brandeis]], who in 1913 was appointed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], wrote that \"We believe that no methods of regulation ever have been or can be devised to remove the menace inherent in private monopoly and overwhelming commercial power\" that is vested in U.S. finance sector firms.<ref>[[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James Kwak]], \"[[13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown]],\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), pp. 28-29</ref> There were early investigations of the concentration of the economic power of the U.S. finance sector, such as the [[Pujo Committee]] of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], which in 1912 found that control of credit in America was concentrated in the hands of a small group of Wall Street firms that were using their positions to accumulate vast economic power.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 28</ref> When in 1911 [[Standard Oil]] was broken up as an illegal monopoly by the U.S. government, the concentration of power in the U.S. financial sector was unaltered.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 26</ref>\n\nKey players of financial sector firms also had a seat at the table in devising the central bank of the United States. In November 1910 the five heads of the country's most powerful finance sector firms gathered for a secret meeting on [[Jekyll Island]] with U.S. Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] and Assistant Secretary of the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] [[A. Piatt Andrew]] and laid the plans for the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]].<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 27</ref>\n\n===Deregulation and Accelerated Growth===\nIn the 1970s, the financial sector comprised slightly more than 3% of total [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP] of the U.S. economy,<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 61</ref> while total financial assets of all investment banks (that is, securities broker-dealers) made up less than 2% of U.S. GDP.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 63</ref> The period from the [[New Deal]] through the 1970s has been referred to as the era of \"boring banking\" because banks that took deposits and made loans to individuals were prohibited from engaging in investments involving creative [[financial engineering]] and [[investment banking]].<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 60-63</ref>\n\nU.S. federal deregulation in the 1980s of many types of banking practices paved the way for the rapid growth in the size, profitability and political power of the financial sector. Such financial sector practices included the creation of private [[mortgage-backed securities]],<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 76</ref> and more speculative approaches to the creation and trading of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] based on new quantitative models of risk and value,.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), pp. 78-81</ref> Wall Street ramped up pressure on the [[United States Congress]] for more deregulation, including for the repeal of [[Glass-Steagall]], a New Deal law that, among other things, prohibits a bank that accepts deposits from functioning as an investment bank since the latter entails greater risks.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), pp. 82-83, 95</ref>\n\nAs a result of this rapid financialization, the financial sector scaled up vastly in the span of a few decades. In 1978, the financial sector comprised 3.5% of the American economy (that is, it made up 3.5% of U.S. GDP), but by 2007 it had reached 5.9%. Profits in the American financial sector in 2009 were six times higher on average than in 1980, compared with non-financial sector profits, which on average were just over twice what they were in 1980. Financial sector profits grew by 800%, adjusted for inflation, from 1980 to 2005. By way of comparison with the rest of the economy, U.S. nonfinancial sector profits grew by 250% during the same period. By way of historical perspective, financial sector profits from the 1930s until 1980 grew at the same rate as the rest of the American economy.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 60</ref>\n[[File:Geldverrm\u00f6genUSAengl.PNG|thumb|Assets of sectors of the United States]]\nBy way of illustration of the increased power of the financial sector over the economy, in 1978 commercial banks held $1.2 trillion (million million) in assets, which is equivalent to 53% of the GDP of the United States. By year's end 2007, commercial banks held $11.8 trillion in assets, which is equivalent to 84% of U.S. GDP. Investment banks (securities broker-dealers) held $33 billion (thousand million) in assets in 1978 (equivalent to 1.3% of U.S. GDP), but held $3.1 trillion in assets (equivalent to 22% U.S. GDP) in 2007. The securities that were so instrumental in triggering the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]], asset-backed securities, including [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs) were practically non-existent in 1978. By 2007, they comprised $4.5 trillion in assets, equivalent to 32% of U.S. GDP.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 59</ref>\n\n==The development of leverage and financial derivatives==\nOne of the most notable features of financialization has been the development of [[leverage (finance)|overleverage]] (more borrowed capital and less own capital) and, as a related tool, [[financial derivatives]]: financial instruments, the price or value of which is derived from the price or value of another, underlying financial instrument. Those instruments, whose initial purpose was hedging and risk management, have become widely traded financial assets in their own right. The most common types of derivatives are futures contracts, swaps, and options. In the early 1990s, a number of central banks around the world began to survey the amount of derivative market activity and report the results to the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nIn the past few years, the number and types of financial derivatives have grown enormously. In November 2007, commenting on the financial crisis sparked by the subprime mortgage collapse in the United States, Doug Noland's ''Credit Bubble Bulletin'', on Asia Times Online, noted,\n<blockquote>\nThe scale of the Credit \"insurance\" problem is astounding. According to the Bank of International Settlements, the OTC market for Credit default swaps (CDS) jumped from $4.7 TN at the end of 2004 to $22.6 TN to end 2006. From the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] we know that the total notional volume of [[credit derivative]]s jumped about 30% during the first half to $45.5 TN. And from the Comptroller of the Currency, total U.S. commercial bank Credit derivative positions ballooned from $492bn to begin 2003 to $11.8 TN as of this past June....\n</blockquote>\n\nA major unknown regarding derivatives is the actual amount of cash behind a transaction. A derivatives contract with a notional value of millions of dollars may actually only cost a few thousand dollars. For example, an [[interest rate swap]] might be based on exchanging the interest payments on $100 million in US Treasury bonds at a fixed interest of 4.5%, for the floating interest rate of $100 million in credit card receivables. This contract would involve at least $4.5 million in interest payments, though the notional value may be reported as $100 million. However, the actual \"cost\" of the swap contract would be some small fraction of the minimal $4.5 million in interest payments. The difficulty of determining exactly how much this swap contract is worth, when accounted for on a financial institution's books, is typical of the worries of many experts and regulators over the explosive growth of these types of instruments.\n\nContrary to common belief in the United States, the largest financial center for derivatives (and for foreign exchange) is London. According to [http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/global-financing-race-new-york/story.aspx?guid=%7b5967C688-8AEB-4279-9704-F5CF3B45C653%7d&print=true&dist=printTop MarketWatch on December 7, 2006],\n<blockquote>\nThe global [[foreign exchange market]], easily the largest financial market, is dominated by London. More than half of the trades in the derivatives market are handled in London, which straddles the time zones between Asia and the U.S. And the trading rooms in the Square Mile, as the City of London financial district is known, are responsible for almost three-quarters of the trades in the secondary fixed-income markets.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Effects on the economy==\nIn the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|2007-2010 financial crisis]], a number of economists and others began to argue that [[financial services]] had become too large a sector of the US economy, with no real benefit to society accruing from the activities of increased financialization.<ref>Megan McCardle.

''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 2009</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, white-collar criminologist and former senior financial regulator [[William K. Black]] listed the ways in which the financial sector harms the real economy. Black wrote, \"The financial sector functions as the sharp canines that the predator state uses to rend the nation. In addition to siphoning off capital for its own benefit, the finance sector misallocates the remaining capital in ways that harm the real economy in order to reward already-rich financial elites harming the nation.\"<ref>William K.

In a speech before the [[Reserve Bank of India]], Turner said that the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u201398 was similar to the 2008\u20139 crisis in that \"both were rooted in, or at least followed after, sustained increases in the relative importance of financial activity relative to real non-financial economic activity, an increasing 'financialisation' of the economy.\"<ref>[[Reserve Bank of India]].

''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 2009</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s vast monetary resources flowing to a few \"megabanks,\" enabled the financial oligarchy to achieve greater political power in the United States. Wall Street firms largely succeeded in getting the American political system and regulators to accept the ideology of financial [[deregulation]] and the legalization of more novel financial instruments.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 89</ref> Political power was achieved by [[campaign finance|contributions to political campaigns]], by financial industry [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]], and through a [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] that positioned financial industry leaders in key politically appointed policy making and regulatory roles and that rewarded sympathetic senior government officials with super high-paying Wall Street jobs after their government service.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 90</ref> The financial sector  was the leading contributor to political campaigns since at least the 1990s, contributing more than $150 million in 2006. (This far exceeded the second largest political contributing industry, the healthcare industry, which contributed $100 million in 2006.) From 1990 to 2006, the securities and investment industry increased its political contributions six-fold, from an annual $12 to $72 million. The financial sector contributed $1.7 billion to political campaigns from 1998 to 2006, and spent an additional $3.4 billion on political lobbying, according to one estimate.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 91</ref>\n\nPolicy makers such as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] [[Alan Greenspan]] called for [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Capital control]]\n* [[Derivative (finance)]]\n* [[Economic rent]]\n* [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]]\n* [[Financial capital]]\n* [[Financial economics]]\n* [[FIRE economy]]\n* [[Foreign exchange trading]]\n* [[Economic sociology]]\n* [[Late capitalism]]\n* [[Neoliberalism]]\n* [[Shadow banking system]]\n* [[Tech bubble]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baker, A (2005).

Financialization may permit real goods, services, and risks to be readily exchangeable for [[currency]], and thus make it easier for people to [[Rationalization (economics)|rationalize]] their assets and income flows.\n\n==Specific academic approaches==\nVarious definitions, focusing on specific aspects and interpretations, have been used:\n* Greta Krippner of the [[University of Michigan]] writes that financialization refers to a \"pattern of [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]] in which [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] making occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and [[Production (economics)|commodity production]].\" In the introduction to the 2005 book ''Financialization and the World Economy'', editor Gerald A. Epstein wrote that some scholars have insisted on a much narrower use of the term: the ascendancy of [[shareholder value]] as a mode of [[corporate governance]], or the growing dominance of [[capital market]] financial systems over bank-based financial systems. Pierre-Yves Gomez and Harry Korine, in their 2008 book ''Entrepreneurs and Democracy: A Political Theory of Corporate Governance'', have identified a long-term trend in the evolution of corporate governance of large corporations and have shown that financialization is one step in this process.\n*[[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] described financialization as \"a lapse back into the pre-industrial [[usury]] and rent economy of European [[feudalism]]\" in a 2003 interview:<ref>Standard Schaefer. [http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/08/29/who-benefited-from-the-tech-bubble-an-interview-with-michael-hudson Who Benefited from the Tech Bubble? an Interview with Michael Hudson]   ''CounterPunch'', August 29, 2003.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"only [[debt]]s grew exponentially, year after year, and they do so inexorably, even when\u2014indeed, especially when\u2014the economy slows down and its companies and people fall below break-even levels. As their debts grow, they siphon off the economic surplus for debt service (...) The problem is that the financial sector's receipts are not turned into fixed capital formation to increase output. They build up increasingly on the opposite side of the balance sheet, as new loans, that is, debts and new claims on society\u2019s output and income.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[Companies] are not able to invest in new physical capital equipment or buildings because they are obliged to use their operating revenue to pay their bankers and bondholders, as well as junk-bond holders. This is what I mean when I say that the economy is becoming financialized. Its aim is not to provide tangible capital formation or rising living standards, but to generate interest, financial fees for underwriting mergers and acquisitions, and capital gains that accrue mainly to insiders, headed by upper management and large financial institutions.  The upshot is that the traditional business cycle has been overshadowed by a secular increase in debt. Instead of labor earning more, hourly earnings have declined in real terms. There has been a drop in net disposable income after paying taxes and withholding \"forced saving\" for social Security and medical insurance, pension-fund contributions and\u2013most serious of all\u2013debt service on [[credit card]]s, [[bank loan]]s, [[mortgage loan]]s, [[student loan]]s, [[auto loan]]s, [[home insurance]] premiums, [[life insurance]], [[private medical insurance]] and other [[FIRE economy|FIRE-sector]] charges. ... This diverts spending away from goods and services.</blockquote>\n\n* Thomas Marois, looking at the big emerging markets, defines \"emerging finance capitalism\" as the current phase of accumulation, characterized by \"the fusion of the interests of domestic and foreign financial capital in the state apparatus as the institutionalized priorities and overarching social logic guiding the actions of state managers and government elites, often to the detriment of labor.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Marois|first=Thomas|title=States, Banks and Crisis: Emerging Finance Capitalism in Mexico and Turkey|year=2012|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|url=https://www.academia.edu/1457363}}</ref>\n* According to Gerald A. Epstein, \"Financialization refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international levels.\"<ref>Gerald Epstein [http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/financial/fin_Epstein.pdf Financialization, Rentier Interests, and Central Bank Policy].  December, 2001 (this version, June, 2002 )</ref>\n* Financialization may be defined as \"the increasing dominance of the finance industry in the sum total of economic activity, of financial controllers in the management of corporations, of financial assets among total assets, of marketised securities and particularly equities among financial assets, of the stock market as a market for corporate control in determining corporate strategies, and of fluctuations in the stock market as a determinant of business cycles\" (Dore 2002).\n* More popularly, however, financialization is understood to mean the vastly expanded role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors, and [[financial institution]]s in the operation of domestic and international economies.\n* Sociological and political interpretations have also been made. In his 2006 book, ''[[American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century]]'', American writer and commentator [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] presents financialization as \"a process whereby financial services, broadly construed, take over the dominant economic, cultural, and political role in a national economy\" (268). Phillips considers that the financialization of the US economy follows the same pattern that marked the beginning of the decline of [[Habsburg Spain]] in the 16th century, the [[Dutch trading empire]] in the 18th century, and the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century (it is also worth pointing out that the true final step in each of these historical economies was [[economic collapse|collapse]]):\n::... the leading [[economic power]]s have followed an evolutionary progression: first, agriculture, fishing, and the like, next commerce and industry, and finally finance. Several historians have elaborated this point. Brooks Adams contended that \"as societies consolidate, they pass through a profound intellectual change. Energy ceases to vent through the imagination and takes the form of capital.\"\n\nJean Cushen explores how the workplace outcomes associated with financialization render employees insecure and angry.<ref>Cushen, J.

Various academic economists of that period worked out ideological and theoretical rationalizations and analytical approaches to facilitate the increased [[deregulation]] of financial systems and banking.\n\nIn a 1998 article, [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] discussed previous economists who saw the problems that result from financialization.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hudson | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Hudson (economist) | title = Financial Capitalism v.

What are the long-term consequences if an increasing percentage of savings and wealth, as it now seems, is used to '''inflate the prices of already existing assets''' - real estate and stocks - instead of to create new production and innovation? </blockquote>\n\n==Financial turnover compared to gross domestic product==\nOther financial markets exhibited similarly explosive growth. Trading in US equity (stock) markets grew from $136.0 billion (or 13.1% of US GDP) in 1970 to $1.671 trillion (or 28.8% of U.S. GDP) in 1990. In 2000, trading in US equity markets was $14.222 trillion (144.9% of GDP). Most of the growth in stock trading has been directly attributed to the introduction and spread of [[program trading]].\n\nAccording to the [http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0703b.pdf March 2007 Quarterly Report from the Bank for International Settlements] (see page 24.):\n<blockquote>Trading on the international derivatives exchanges slowed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Combined turnover of interest rate, currency and stock index derivatives fell by 7% to $431 trillion between October and December 2006. </blockquote>\nThus, derivatives trading\u2014mostly [[futures contract]]s on interest rates, foreign currencies, Treasury bonds, and the like\u2014had reached a level of $1,200 trillion, or $1.2 quadrillion, a year. By comparison, US GDP in 2006 was $12.456 trillion.\n\n==Futures markets==\n[[File:Futures Trading Composition 2019 SVG.svg|thumb|right]]\nThe data for turnover in the futures markets in 1970, 1980, and 1990 is based on the number of contracts traded, which is reported by the organized exchanges, such as the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the New York Commodity Exchange, and compiled in data appendices of the Annual Reports of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The pie charts below show the dramatic shift in the types of futures contracts traded from 1970 to 2004.\n\nFor a century after organized futures exchanges were founded in the mid-19th century, all futures trading was solely based on agricultural commodities. But after the end of the gold-backed fixed-exchange rate system in 1971, contracts based on foreign currencies began to be traded. After the deregulation of interest rates by the Bank of England and then the US Federal Reserve in the late 1970s, futures contracts based on various bonds and interest rates began to be traded. The result was that financial futures contracts\u2014based on such things as interest rates, currencies, or equity indices\u2014came to dominate the futures markets.\n\nThe dollar value of turnover in the futures markets is found by multiplying the number of contracts traded by the average value per contract for 1978 to 1980, which was calculated in research by the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) in 1981. The figures for earlier years were estimated on computer-generated exponential fit of data from 1960 to 1970, with 1960 set at $165 billion, half the 1970 figure, on the basis of a graph accompanying the ACLI data, which showed that the number of futures contracts traded in 1961 and earlier years was about half the number traded in 1970.\n\nAccording to the ALCI data, the average value of interest-rate contracts is around ten times that of agricultural and other commodities, while the average value of currency contracts is twice that of agricultural and other commodities. (Beginning in mid-1993, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange itself began to release figures of the nominal value of contracts traded at the CME each month. In November 1993, the CME boasted that it had set a new monthly record of 13.466 million contracts traded, representing a dollar value of $8.8 trillion. By late 1994, this monthly value had doubled. On January 3, 1995, the CME boasted that its total volume for 1994 had jumped by 54%, to 226.3 million contracts traded, worth nearly $200 trillion. Soon thereafter, the CME ceased to provide a figure for the dollar value of contracts traded.)\n\nFutures contracts are a \"contract to buy or sell a very common homogenous item at a future date for a specific price\". The nominal value of a futures contract is wildly different from the risk involved in engaging in that contract. Consider two parties who engage in a contract to exchange 5,000 bushels of wheat at $8.89 per bushel on December 17, 2012. The nominal value of the contract would be $44,450 (5,000 bushels x $8.89). But what is the risk? For the buyer. the risk is that the seller will not be able to deliver the wheat on the stated date. This means the buyer must purchase the wheat from someone else; this is known as the \"spot market\". Assume that the spot price for wheat on December 17, 2012, is $10 per bushel. This means the cost of purchasing the wheat is $50,000 (5,000 bushels x $10). So the buyer would have lost $5,550 ($50,000 less $44,450), or the difference in the cost between the contract price and the spot price. Furthermore, futures are traded via exchanges, which guarantee that if one party reneges on its end of the bargain, (1) that party is blacklisted from entering into such contracts in the future and (2) the injured party is insured against the loss by the exchange. If the loss is so large that the exchange cannot cover it, then the members of the exchange make up the loss. Another mitigating factor to consider is that a commonly traded liquid asset, such as gold, wheat, or the S&P 500 stock index, is extremely unlikely to have a future value of $0; thus the counter-party risk is limited to something substantially less than the nominal value.\n\n==Accelerated growth of the finance sector==\nThe financial sector is a key industry in developed economies, in which it represents a sizeable share of the [[GDP]] and an important source of employment. [[Financial services]] ([[bank]]ing, [[insurance]], investment, etc.) have been for a long time a powerful sector of the economy in many economically developed countries. Those activities have also played a key role in facilitating [[economic globalization]].\n\n===Early 20th Century History in the United States===\nAs early as the beginning of the 20th Century, a small number of financial sector firms have controlled the lion's share of wealth and power of the financial sector. The notion of an American \"financial oligarchy\" was discussed as early as 1913. In an article entitled \"Our Financial Oligarchy,\" [[Louis Brandeis]], who in 1913 was appointed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], wrote that \"We believe that no methods of regulation ever have been or can be devised to remove the menace inherent in private monopoly and overwhelming commercial power\" that is vested in U.S. finance sector firms.<ref>[[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James Kwak]], \"[[13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown]],\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), pp. 28-29</ref> There were early investigations of the concentration of the economic power of the U.S. finance sector, such as the [[Pujo Committee]] of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], which in 1912 found that control of credit in America was concentrated in the hands of a small group of Wall Street firms that were using their positions to accumulate vast economic power.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 28</ref> When in 1911 [[Standard Oil]] was broken up as an illegal monopoly by the U.S. government, the concentration of power in the U.S. financial sector was unaltered.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 26</ref>\n\nKey players of financial sector firms also had a seat at the table in devising the central bank of the United States. In November 1910 the five heads of the country's most powerful finance sector firms gathered for a secret meeting on [[Jekyll Island]] with U.S. Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] and Assistant Secretary of the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] [[A. Piatt Andrew]] and laid the plans for the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]].<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 27</ref>\n\n===Deregulation and Accelerated Growth===\nIn the 1970s, the financial sector comprised slightly more than 3% of total [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP] of the U.S. economy,<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 61</ref> while total financial assets of all investment banks (that is, securities broker-dealers) made up less than 2% of U.S. GDP.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 63</ref> The period from the [[New Deal]] through the 1970s has been referred to as the era of \"boring banking\" because banks that took deposits and made loans to individuals were prohibited from engaging in investments involving creative [[financial engineering]] and [[investment banking]].<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 60-63</ref>\n\nU.S. federal deregulation in the 1980s of many types of banking practices paved the way for the rapid growth in the size, profitability and political power of the financial sector. Such financial sector practices included the creation of private [[mortgage-backed securities]],<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 76</ref> and more speculative approaches to the creation and trading of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] based on new quantitative models of risk and value,.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), pp. 78-81</ref> Wall Street ramped up pressure on the [[United States Congress]] for more deregulation, including for the repeal of [[Glass-Steagall]], a New Deal law that, among other things, prohibits a bank that accepts deposits from functioning as an investment bank since the latter entails greater risks.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), pp. 82-83, 95</ref>\n\nAs a result of this rapid financialization, the financial sector scaled up vastly in the span of a few decades. In 1978, the financial sector comprised 3.5% of the American economy (that is, it made up 3.5% of U.S. GDP), but by 2007 it had reached 5.9%. Profits in the American financial sector in 2009 were six times higher on average than in 1980, compared with non-financial sector profits, which on average were just over twice what they were in 1980. Financial sector profits grew by 800%, adjusted for inflation, from 1980 to 2005. By way of comparison with the rest of the economy, U.S. nonfinancial sector profits grew by 250% during the same period. By way of historical perspective, financial sector profits from the 1930s until 1980 grew at the same rate as the rest of the American economy.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 60</ref>\n[[File:Geldverrm\u00f6genUSAengl.PNG|thumb|Assets of sectors of the United States]]\nBy way of illustration of the increased power of the financial sector over the economy, in 1978 commercial banks held $1.2 trillion (million million) in assets, which is equivalent to 53% of the GDP of the United States. By year's end 2007, commercial banks held $11.8 trillion in assets, which is equivalent to 84% of U.S. GDP. Investment banks (securities broker-dealers) held $33 billion (thousand million) in assets in 1978 (equivalent to 1.3% of U.S. GDP), but held $3.1 trillion in assets (equivalent to 22% U.S. GDP) in 2007. The securities that were so instrumental in triggering the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]], asset-backed securities, including [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs) were practically non-existent in 1978. By 2007, they comprised $4.5 trillion in assets, equivalent to 32% of U.S. GDP.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 59</ref>\n\n==The development of leverage and financial derivatives==\nOne of the most notable features of financialization has been the development of [[leverage (finance)|overleverage]] (more borrowed capital and less own capital) and, as a related tool, [[financial derivatives]]: financial instruments, the price or value of which is derived from the price or value of another, underlying financial instrument. Those instruments, whose initial purpose was hedging and risk management, have become widely traded financial assets in their own right. The most common types of derivatives are futures contracts, swaps, and options. In the early 1990s, a number of central banks around the world began to survey the amount of derivative market activity and report the results to the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nIn the past few years, the number and types of financial derivatives have grown enormously. In November 2007, commenting on the financial crisis sparked by the subprime mortgage collapse in the United States, Doug Noland's ''Credit Bubble Bulletin'', on Asia Times Online, noted,\n<blockquote>\nThe scale of the Credit \"insurance\" problem is astounding. According to the Bank of International Settlements, the OTC market for Credit default swaps (CDS) jumped from $4.7 TN at the end of 2004 to $22.6 TN to end 2006. From the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] we know that the total notional volume of [[credit derivative]]s jumped about 30% during the first half to $45.5 TN. And from the Comptroller of the Currency, total U.S. commercial bank Credit derivative positions ballooned from $492bn to begin 2003 to $11.8 TN as of this past June....\n</blockquote>\n\nA major unknown regarding derivatives is the actual amount of cash behind a transaction. A derivatives contract with a notional value of millions of dollars may actually only cost a few thousand dollars. For example, an [[interest rate swap]] might be based on exchanging the interest payments on $100 million in US Treasury bonds at a fixed interest of 4.5%, for the floating interest rate of $100 million in credit card receivables. This contract would involve at least $4.5 million in interest payments, though the notional value may be reported as $100 million. However, the actual \"cost\" of the swap contract would be some small fraction of the minimal $4.5 million in interest payments. The difficulty of determining exactly how much this swap contract is worth, when accounted for on a financial institution's books, is typical of the worries of many experts and regulators over the explosive growth of these types of instruments.\n\nContrary to common belief in the United States, the largest financial center for derivatives (and for foreign exchange) is London. According to [http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/global-financing-race-new-york/story.aspx?guid=%7b5967C688-8AEB-4279-9704-F5CF3B45C653%7d&print=true&dist=printTop MarketWatch on December 7, 2006],\n<blockquote>\nThe global [[foreign exchange market]], easily the largest financial market, is dominated by London. More than half of the trades in the derivatives market are handled in London, which straddles the time zones between Asia and the U.S. And the trading rooms in the Square Mile, as the City of London financial district is known, are responsible for almost three-quarters of the trades in the secondary fixed-income markets.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Effects on the economy==\nIn the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|2007-2010 financial crisis]], a number of economists and others began to argue that [[financial services]] had become too large a sector of the US economy, with no real benefit to society accruing from the activities of increased financialization.<ref>Megan McCardle.

Black]] listed the ways in which the financial sector harms the real economy. Black wrote, \"The financial sector functions as the sharp canines that the predator state uses to rend the nation.

Wall Street firms largely succeeded in getting the American political system and regulators to accept the ideology of financial [[deregulation]] and the legalization of more novel financial instruments.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 89</ref> Political power was achieved by [[campaign finance|contributions to political campaigns]], by financial industry [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]], and through a [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] that positioned financial industry leaders in key politically appointed policy making and regulatory roles and that rewarded sympathetic senior government officials with super high-paying Wall Street jobs after their government service.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 90</ref> The financial sector  was the leading contributor to political campaigns since at least the 1990s, contributing more than $150 million in 2006. (This far exceeded the second largest political contributing industry, the healthcare industry, which contributed $100 million in 2006.) From 1990 to 2006, the securities and investment industry increased its political contributions six-fold, from an annual $12 to $72 million. The financial sector contributed $1.7 billion to political campaigns from 1998 to 2006, and spent an additional $3.4 billion on political lobbying, according to one estimate.<ref>Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,\" (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 91</ref>\n\nPolicy makers such as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] [[Alan Greenspan]] called for [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Capital control]]\n* [[Derivative (finance)]]\n* [[Economic rent]]\n* [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]]\n* [[Financial capital]]\n* [[Financial economics]]\n* [[FIRE economy]]\n* [[Foreign exchange trading]]\n* [[Economic sociology]]\n* [[Late capitalism]]\n* [[Neoliberalism]]\n* [[Shadow banking system]]\n* [[Tech bubble]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baker, A (2005).
