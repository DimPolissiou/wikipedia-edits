Regular episodes of the podcast feature the brothers comedically providing answers to questions either submitted by listeners or found on the [[Yahoo! Answers]] service.\n\nThe show was independently produced and released by the McElroy brothers from April 2010 until it joined the Maximum Fun network of podcasts in January 2011.<ref name=\"ep38\">{{cite web | url=http://mbmbam.libsyn.com/my-brother-my-brother-and-me-38-the-brain-wife | title=My Brother, My Brother and Me 38: The Brain Wife | publisher=[[Maximum Fun]] | work=My Brother, My Brother and Me | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> In 2010, the show was consistently listed among the top 10 comedy podcasts on [[iTunes]].<ref name=\"herald\">{{cite web | url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/life/x310370512/McElroy-brothers-find-success-with-podcast | title=McElroy brothers find success with podcast | publisher=HD Media Company, LLC | work=The Herald-Dispatch | date=November 14, 2010 | accessdate=September 17, 2014 | author=Lavender, Dave}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The A.V.

Answers]]. The second type of question is usually referred to by the brothers as a \"Yahoo.\" Both kinds of questions will usually prompt the hosts into long humorous discussions.<ref name=\"herald\" />\n\n\"(It's a) Departure\" by [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]] & [[The Long Winters]] (from the album ''[[Putting the Days to Bed]]'') has served as the primary theme song for ''My Brother, My Brother and Me'' since the show joined the Maximum Fun network on January 17, 2011.<ref name=\"ep217\">{{cite web | url=http://mbmbam.libsyn.com/mbm-ba-m-217-clippy-lovemaking-tips | title=MBMBaM 217: Clippy Lovemaking Tips | publisher=[[Maximum Fun]] | work=My Brother, My Brother and Me | date=September 15, 2014 | accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> Prior to this, the show's theme song was \"[[Take a Chance on Me]]\" by [[ABBA]], while \"Root to This\" by [[Fear of Pop]] and later \"[[Feed the Animals|Play Your Part (Pt. 2)]]\" by [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] was used as a closing theme.<ref name=\"ep38\" />\n\n===Recurring segments===\nBeyond the typical format of humorously answering questions from users and from Yahoo Answers, the brothers host different recurring segments included randomly in episodes. Most live shows tend to include at least one occurrence of a segment such as Munch Squad or Haunted Doll Watch. These include:\n* '''\"The Money Zone\"''': A segment each episode, normally around the midpoint of the episode, including advertisements from corporate sponsors and paid messages from listeners read by the hosts on air.<ref name=\"ep217\" />\n* '''\"Minion Quotes\"''': A segment in live shows wherein Justin reads platitudes while Griffin and Travis attempt to guess which cartoon character the platitude is serving as a caption for. If Griffin or Travis guesses correctly, Justin must post the meme on his Facebook page without comment, and cannot reply to the responses to the post. This has caused no small amount of distress to Justin.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://maximumfun.org/episodes/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/episode-482-face-2-face-big-stitch-energy/ | title=MBMBaM 482: Big Stitch Energy | publisher=[[Maximum Fun]] | work=My Brother, My Brother and Me | date=October 21, 2019 | accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n* '''\"Munch Squad\"''': A \"podcast within a podcast\" in which Justin recites and ridicules press releases from fast food companies about new products<ref name=\"ep304\">{{cite web | url=https://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-304-chicken-soup-boys | title=MBMBaM 304: Chicken Soup for Boys | publisher=[[Maximum Fun]] | work=My Brother, My Brother and Me | date=May 23, 2016 | accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref> In recent episodes, Justin has claimed that Munch Squad is \"winding down\" though he continues to regularly perform the segment.<ref name=\"ep477\">{{cite web | url=https://maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-477-crash-bandicoot\u2019s-wallet-chain | title=MBMBaM 477: Crash Bandicoot's Wallet Chain | publisher=[[Maximum Fun]] | work=My Brother, My Brother and Me | date=September 17, 2019 | accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>\n* '''\"Haunted Doll Watch\"''': A segment which features Justin reading and critiquing [[eBay]] listings of apparently haunted, possessed, or cursed dolls.<ref name=\"ep235\">{{cite web | url=https://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-235-audio-billboards | title=MBMBaM 235: Audio Billboards | publisher=[[Maximum Fun]] | work=My Brother, My Brother and Me | date=January 20, 2015 | accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>\n* '''\"Sad Libs\"''': A segment in which Travis creates tragic stories with blank spaces and completes them with nonsensical or uncomfortable words, resembling [[Mad Libs]].

The questions cover a wide range of topics, but often end with an anecdotal question that Justin and Griffin would have no way of knowing. Travis started this segment shortly after having his second baby, and his brothers make it clear how much they dislike it.<ref name=\"ep495\">{{cite web | url=https://maximumfun.org/transcripts/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/transcript-my-brother-my-brother-and-me-ep-495-play-along-at-home/ | title=MBMBaM 495: Play Along at Home | publisher=[[Maximum Fun]] | work=My Brother, My Brother and Me | date=January 27, 2020 | accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Special episodes===\nEpisodes of the show are occasionally performed and recorded in front of live audiences at venues in cities such as [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]]; the format remains the same, including recurring segments such as Munch Squad, with the addition of a section where the brothers take questions from the audience.<ref name=\"libsyn\">{{cite web | url=http://mbmbam.libsyn.com/ | title=My Brother, My Brother and Me | work=libsyn.com | accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> A special episode called \"The Adventure Zone\" was released on August 18, 2014, shortly after Justin and his wife Sydnee had a baby.

Most live shows tend to include at least one occurrence of a segment such as Munch Squad or Haunted Doll Watch. These include:\n* '''\"The Money Zone\"''': A segment each episode, normally around the midpoint of the episode, including advertisements from corporate sponsors and paid messages from listeners read by the hosts on air.<ref name=\"ep217\" />\n* '''\"Minion Quotes\"''': A segment in live shows wherein Justin reads platitudes while Griffin and Travis attempt to guess which cartoon character the platitude is serving as a caption for. If Griffin or Travis guesses correctly, Justin must post the meme on his Facebook page without comment, and cannot reply to the responses to the post.

He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic \"burying the hatchet\" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, \"Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?\"<ref name=\"archive\" /> He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named \"The Building of the 20th century\" in an unscientific \"Top-Ten\" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C. Robie House, and the Johnson Wax Building.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Madison Opera]] in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera ''[[Shining Brow]]'', by composer [[Daron Hagen]] and [[libretto|librettist]] [[Paul Muldoon]] based on events early in Wright's life. The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2\u00a2 postage stamp.\n\n\"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]\" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]]. [[Art Garfunkel]] has stated that the origin of the song came from his request that Simon write a song about the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]. This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> As a founder of organic architecture, Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=777}}</ref> \n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home in [[Broadacre City]], his unique vision for urban planning in the United States. In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and  other structures. He often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and [[stained glass]]. Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as \"the greatest American architect of all time.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed [[World Heritage Site]] as ''[[The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright]].''\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]] and [[Louis Sullivan]].  He opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893, and developed an influential home and studio in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], in 1898. His colorful personal life made headlines: leaving his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin, and their children for [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] in 1909, the murders at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin estate]] in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel in 1923, and his relationship with [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]], who became his third wife in 1928.\n\n==Early years==\n===Ancestry===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]]. Family records show that he was christened as \"Frank Lincoln Wright\" (possibly in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) when born on June 8, 1867. Writer [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote that the family name \"Lloyd\" was used shortly thereafter,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-fhnSK26vMC&pg=PT12&dq=frank+lincoln+wright&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCweLMnuPmAhVMZc0KHahfDfUQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=frank%20lincoln%20wright&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Life|last=Huxtable|first=Ada Louise|date=2008-04-29|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4406-3173-3|language=en}}</ref> but biographer [[Meryle Secrest]] claims that Wright himself adopted \"Lloyd\" at 18, after his parents' divorce in 1884.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7ZB90XmTdcC&pg=PA79&dq=frank+lloyd+wright+name+change&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGhsftruPmAhVKXc0KHQdZD7QQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=frank%20lloyd%20wright%20name%20change&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-74414-8|language=en}}</ref> \n\nWright's father, William Cary Wright (1825\u20131904), was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister.<ref name=\":1\" />  He was also a published composer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimber|first=Marian Wilson|date=2014|title=Various Artists.

Anna was a member of the well-known Lloyd Jones clan who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]. One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.\n\n===Childhood===\nAccording to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|page=58}}</ref> In 1870, the family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where William ministered to a small congregation.\n\nIn 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \"For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top\u2026 and played\u2026 with the cube, the sphere and the triangle\u2014these smooth wooden maple blocks\u2026 All are in my fingers to this day\u2026 \"<ref>Alofsin, Anthony (1993).

They settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with his children.\n\nSoon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. In 1884 William sued for a divorce from Anna on the grounds of \"\u2026 emotional cruelty and physical violence and spousal abandonment.\"<ref> Hendrickson, Paul, ''Plagued By Fire'', Alfred A Knopf, New York, 2019, p. 399</ref> William left Wisconsin after the divorce was granted in 1885.

University of Wisconsin-Madison.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n===Silsbee and other early work experience (1887\u20131888)===\nIn 1887, Wright arrived in Chicago in search of employment. As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and a population boom, new development was plentiful. Wright later recalled that while his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Drafter|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of Joseph Lyman Silsbee.<ref name=Wright /> Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee\u2014accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor\u2014on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in Spring Green.<ref name=FLWF /> While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the [[Hillside Home School I]] in Spring Green for two of his aunts.<ref name=OGorman /> Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W. Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G. Elmslie]]. Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.\n\nFeeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton. However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee\u2014this time with a raise in salary.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}</ref> Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more \"gracefully picturesque\" than the other \"brutalities\" of the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}</ref> Wright aspired for more progressive work.\n\n===Adler & Sullivan (1888\u20131893)===\n\nWright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Adler & Sullivan]] was \"looking for someone to make the finished  drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}</ref> Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of Louis Sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}</ref> Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his own employees, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89\u201394}}</ref> In spite of this, \"Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility.\" As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for \"Dear Master\").<ref name=Tafel /> He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller. Wright later engaged Mueller in the construction of several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.<ref name=Saint />\n\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom).JPG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (1889)]]\n\nOn June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin (1871\u20131959). The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: \"Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?\"<ref name=\"Wright 2005, p. 97\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}</ref> With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.<ref name=Weil />\n\nBy 1890, Wright had an office next to Sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman [[George Elmslie]], who had been hired by Sullivan at Wright's request.<ref name=Saint/><ref name=Gebhard /> Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, the firm of Adler & Sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian Robert Twombly) suggests that Sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches.<ref name=Gebhard/> During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A. Charnley bungalow (1890) in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], the Berry-MacHarg House, [[James A. Charnley House]] (both 1891), and the Louis Sullivan House (1892), all in Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Lind />\n\n[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4.jpg|thumb|The [[Walter Gale House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1893). While a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] in style, it features window bands and a cantilevered porch roof which hint at Wright's developing aesthetics]]\n\nDespite Sullivan's loan and overtime salary, Wright was constantly short on funds. Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These \"bootlegged\" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today, including the [[Thomas H. Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P. Parker House|Robert Parker]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs with the residential projects for Adler & Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement. Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm.<ref name=Lind/> Several stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He \"threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler & Sullivan office never to return.\" Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}</ref> However, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also recounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.<ref name=Lind/><ref>{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}</ref> Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.\n\n===Transition and experimentation (1893\u20131900)===\nAfter leaving Louis Sullivan's firm, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan-designed [[Schiller Building]] on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago. Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler & Sullivan. Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)|Dwight H. Perkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}</ref> These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what  became known as the Prairie School.<ref name=Brooks /> They were joined by Perkins' apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.<ref name=Cassidy /><ref name=MIT />\n\n[[File:William H. Winslow House Front Facade.jpg|thumb|[[William H. Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]] (1893)]]\n\nWright's projects during this period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897) and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style Bagley House (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G. Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E. Roberts]] House (1896).<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56\u2013109}}</ref> While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore house (1895), Oak Park, IL, rear.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan G. Moore House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1895)]]\n\nSoon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome. To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the \u00c9cole lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref name=Goldberger />\n\n[[File:Frank LLoyd Wright Studio Chicago Frontage.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's studio]] viewed from [[Chicago Avenue]] (1898)]]\n\nWright relocated his practice to his home in 1898  to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house. The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio embodied Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which his next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust 2001, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Prairie style houses (1900\u20131914)===\nBy 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: <blockquote> \"[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], [[Isabel Roberts]], and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches, and recognition today!\"<ref>''My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright,'' by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Arthur Heurtley House (1902), Oak Park, IL.JPG|thumb|[[Arthur Heurtley House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1902)]]\n[[File:Darwin D. Martin House.jpg|thumb|[[Darwin D. Martin House]], [[Buffalo, New York]] (1904)]]\n[[File:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Hillside Home School, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902)]]\n\nBetween 1900 and 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the \"[[Prairie style]]\". Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B. Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations.<ref name=Clayton /> Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style.<ref name=Sommer /><ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}</ref> At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design. \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" and \"A Small House with Lots of Room in it\" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years.<ref name=Clayton/> Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]] in 1904. Other Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick [[Robie House]] in Chicago and the Avery and Queene [[Coonley House]] in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. The Robie House, with its soaring, [[cantilever]]ed roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]] (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the \"cornerstone of modernism\".\n\nWright's residential designs of this era were known as \"prairie houses\" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago.  Prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials\u2014especially stone and wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquehome.org/Architectural-Style/prairie.htm|title=Prairie School Architecture|website=www.antiquehome.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class Prairie Style [[single-family house]] model, shifting his focus to a more democratic architecture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Storrer |first1=William Allin |title=The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright : a complete catalog |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0226776200 |page=xvii |edition=Updated 3rd }}</ref> Wright went to Europe in 1909 with a portfolio of his work and presented it to Berlin publisher [[Ernst Wasmuth]].<ref>Secrest, p. 202</ref>  ''Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright'', published in 1911, was the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe.

Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space. [[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wright in 1926]]\n\nOther early notable public buildings included the [[Larkin Administration Building]] (1905) as well as the Geneva Inn ([[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], 1911), the [[Midway Gardens]] (Chicago, Illinois, 1913), the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] ([[Alberta]], Canada, 1914), and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (Tokyo, 1922).\n\n===Textile concrete block system===\nIn the early 1920s, Wright designed a \"[[Textile block house|textile]]\" concrete block system. The system of precast blocks, reinforced by an internal system of bars, enabled \"fabrication as infinite in color, texture, and variety as in that rug.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KiaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=wright+critical+writings#v=onepage&q=wright%20critical%20writings&f=false|title=The Essential Frank Lloyd Wright: Critical Writings on Architecture|last=Wright|first=Frank Lloyd|date=2008|editor-last=Pfeiffer|editor-first=Bruce Brooks|website=Princeton University Press|language=en|access-date=May 7, 2019|isbn=9780691146324}}</ref> Wright first used his textile block system on the [[Millard House]] in Pasadena , California, in 1923.

As he explained in ''The Natural House'' (1954), \"The original blocks are made on the site by ramming concrete into wood or metal wrap-around forms, with one outside face (which may be pattered), and one rear or inside face, generally coffered, for lightness.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Midlife problems==\n\n===Family abandonment{{anchor | Europe and personal troubles}}===\n[[File:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Taliesin, Spring Green, Wisconsin]]\nIn 1903, while Wright was designing a house for Edwin Cheney (a neighbor in Oak Park), he became enamored with Cheney's wife, Mamah. [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist, and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. Their relationship became the talk of the town; they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. In 1909, Wright and Mamah Cheney met up in Europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. Wright remained in Europe for almost a year, first in [[Florence, Italy]] (where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd) and, later, in [[Fiesole, Italy]], where he lived with Mamah. During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. After Wright returned to the United States in October 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses. Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]}}, by May 1911. The recurring theme of {{lang|cy|Taliesin}} also came from his mother's side: {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin]]}} in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest. The family motto, \"''{{lang|cy|Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd}}''\" (\"The Truth Against the World\"), was taken from the Welsh poet {{lang|cy|[[Iolo Morganwg]]}}, who also had a son named Taliesin. The motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the {{lang|cy|[[Eisteddfod]]}} in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212826/http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2005 |title=Home Country |publisher=Unitychapel.org |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Catastrophe at Taliesin studio===\nOn August 15, 1914, while Wright was working in Chicago, Julian Carlton, a male servant who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin and murdered seven people with an axe as the fire burned.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /><ref>https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/famous-murders/taliesin-massacre-frank-lloyd-wright/</ref> The dead included Mamah; her two children, John and Martha Cheney; a gardener (David Lindblom); a draftsman (Emil Brodelle); a workman (Thomas Brunker); and another workman's son (Ernest Weston). Two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, William Weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. Carlton swallowed [[hydrochloric acid]] immediately following the attack in an attempt to [[suicide|kill himself]].<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> He was nearly [[Lynching|lynched]] on the spot, but was taken to the [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]] jail.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> Carlton died from [[starvation]] seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" />\n\n===Divorce and further troubles===\nIn 1922, Kitty Wright finally granted Wright a divorce. Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, Maude \"Miriam\" Noel. In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died. Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. In 1924, after the separation, but while still married, Wright met [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]] at a Petrograd Ballet performance in Chicago. They moved in together at Taliesin in 1925, and soon Olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, Iovanna, born on December 2, 1925.\n\nOn April 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at Taliesin. Crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of Japanese prints that Wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000.<ref>Secrest, p. 315\u2013317.</ref> Wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home \"Taliesin III\".\n\nIn 1926, Olga's ex-husband, Vlademar Hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, Svetlana. In October 1926, Wright and Olgivanna were accused of violating the [[Mann Act]] and arrested in [[Tonka Bay, Minnesota]].<ref>Minnesota Historical Society, Collections Up Close, \"[http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/01/frank-lloyd-wright-arrested-in-minnesota/ Frank Lloyd Wright Arrested in Minnesota]\"</ref> The charges were later dropped.\n\nWright and Miriam Noel's divorce was finalized in 1927. Wright was again required to wait for one year before remarrying.

Twenty-three came to live and work that year, as did many more in the years that followed. \nConsiderable controversy existed over the living conditions and education of the fellows; recent books and articles have given conflicting and often unflattering pictures of their treatment.<ref>Friedland, Roger, and Zellman, Harold.

He proposed the idea in his book ''The Disappearing City'' in 1932, and unveiled a {{convert|12|ft2|m2|adj=on}} model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. Concurrent with the development of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including walls composed of a \"sandwich\" of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper\u2014a significant change from typically framed walls.<ref>Twombly, p.242</ref> Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.\n\nUsonian houses were Wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most American households. By developing homes with progressively more open plans, Wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room.<ref>Twombly, p.257</ref> As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. Bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal. The built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles which influenced Wright's early work. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. His Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers.<ref>Twombly, p.244</ref> Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.\n\n===Significant later works===\n[[File:Guggenheim museum exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York City (1959)]]\n\n[[File:Wrightfallingwater.jpg|thumb|[[Fallingwater]], [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]] (1937)]] ''[[Fallingwater]]'', one of Wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar J. Kaufmann|Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr.]], at [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]]. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using [[limestone]] for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, [[post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]] of the lowest terrace was completed.\n\n[[Taliesin West]], Wright's winter home and studio complex in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], was a laboratory for Wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. Now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.\nWright turned 80 shortly after World War II ended, yet remained busy. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City occupied Wright for 16&nbsp;years (1943\u20131959)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/about/frank-lloyd-wright-building|title=The Frank Lloyd Wright Building|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on [[Fifth Avenue]]; its interior is similar to the inside of a [[seashell]]. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.\n\n[[File:Price tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] (1956)]]\nThe only realized skyscraper designed by Wright is the [[Price Tower]], a 19-story tower in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]]. It is also one of the two existing vertically oriented Wright structures (the other is the [[S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]). The Price Tower was commissioned by Harold C. Price of the H. C. Price Company, a local [[oil pipeline]] and chemical firm. On March 29, 2007, Price Tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]], one of only 20 such properties in Oklahoma.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20070413.HTM National Park Service] \u2014 ''National Historic Landmarks Designated'', April 13, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Monona Terrace]], originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for Madison, Wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of Wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. The \"as-built\" design was carried out by Wright's apprentice Tony Puttnam. Monona Terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|title=Monona Terrace Convention Center, history web page|accessdate=May 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215652/http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Florida Southern College]], located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) Frank Lloyd Wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the [[Child of the Sun]] project.

He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks, and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]. Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). In 1897, Wright received a patent for \"Prism Glass Tiles\" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior.<ref>http://www.dailyartdaily.com/prismatic-tiles-frank-lloyd-wright-glass/</ref> Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.<ref name=\"TMCnet\">{{cite web|author=Lync Voice UC Industry News|title=The Textile Block System [Concrete International]|url=http://www.lyncvoiceuc.com/news/2012/04/14/6258593.htm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright. \"In the Cause of Architecture, VI: The Meaning of Materials\u2014Glass\". ''The Architectural Record'', 64(July 1928), 10-16.</ref> One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By using this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style. The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Carla|title=Frank Lloyd Wright's glass designs|date=1995|publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780876544686|pages=57}}</ref>\n\nWright also designed some of his own clothing. His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles. Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII. He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Wright-designed window in [[Robie House]], Chicago (1906)]]\nWright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization \"a harbor of refuge for the incompetent,\" and \"a form of refined gangsterism.\" When an associate referred to him as \"an old amateur\" Wright confirmed, \"I am the oldest.\"<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web|title=Biography in Sound: Frank Lloyd Wright|url=https://archive.org/details/Biography_in_Sound|work=Old Time Radio|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:\n# [[Louis Sullivan]], whom he considered to be his ''Lieber Meister'' (dear master)\n# Nature, particularly shapes/forms and colors/patterns of plant life\n# Music (his favorite composer was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]])\n# Japanese art, prints and buildings\n# [[Froebel Gifts]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Jeanne S.|date=March 1, 1989|title=The Froebel-Wright Kindergarten Connection: A New Perspective|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=48|issue=1|pages=24\u201337|doi=10.2307/990404|issn=0037-9808|jstor=990404}}</ref>\n\nHe also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the Prairie School architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates.<ref>Griffin, Marion Mahony, ''The Magic of America'', typescript, 1947</ref> As with any architect, though, Wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. In his earlier days, Wright worked with some of the top architects of the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], including Sullivan. In his Prairie School days, Wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including [[William Eugene Drummond]], [[John Van Bergen]], [[Isabel Roberts]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Albert Chase McArthur|Albert McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin]], and [[Walter Burley Griffin]].\n\nThe Czech-born architect [[Antonin Raymond]], recognized as the father of modern architecture in Japan, worked for Wright at Taliesin and led the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He subsequently stayed in Japan and opened his own practice. [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]] also worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel. His own work is often credited as influencing Wright's Usonian houses. Schindler's friend [[Richard Neutra]] also worked briefly for Wright and became an internationally successful architect.\n\nLater, in the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] days, Wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]], [[John Lautner]], [[E. Fay Jones]], [[Henry Klumb]], [[William Bernoudy]], and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\n===Community planning===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career. His commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death. He had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.<ref>''Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs'', Charles E. and Berdeana Aguar, McGraw-Hill, 2002, p.344</ref>\n\nHis thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for [[Charles E. Roberts]] entitled the \"Quadruple Block Plan.\" This design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets. The houses, which used the same design as published in \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" from the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the ''Wasmuth Portfolio'' in 1910.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs|first1=Charles E.|last1=Aguar|first2=Berdeana|last2=Aguar|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=2002|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the City Club of Chicago Land Development Competition in 1913. The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. This design expanded on the Quadruple Block Plan and included several social levels. The design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the [[blue collar]] homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces.

He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic \"burying the hatchet\" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, \"Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?\"<ref name=\"archive\" /> He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named \"The Building of the 20th century\" in an unscientific \"Top-Ten\" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C. Robie House, and the Johnson Wax Building.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Madison Opera]] in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera ''[[Shining Brow]]'', by composer [[Daron Hagen]] and [[libretto|librettist]] [[Paul Muldoon]] based on events early in Wright's life. The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2\u00a2 postage stamp.\n\n\"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]\" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]].

Delfeayo also has two brothers who are not musicians: Ellis Marsalis III (b. 1964) is a poet, photographer and computer networking specialist based in [[Baltimore]], and Mboya Kenyatta (b. 1970) is [[autism|autistic]] and was the primary inspiration for Delfeayo's founding of the New Orleans-based Uptown Music Theatre.

Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and [[hail]], with some contribution from [[fog]] and [[dew]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=15, Table 2.3 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013  }}</ref> Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface.

A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.\n\n===Fresh water storage===\n{{Main|Water resources}}\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 1\n| total_width = 150\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg\n| width1 = \n| caption1 = \n| height1 = \n| image2 = Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg\n| width2 = \n| caption2 = \n| height2 = \n| footer = The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide and low tide.

By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of total water used for irrigation comes from unsustainable withdrawals of groundwater, causing groundwater depletion.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Yoshihide|last1=Wada |first2=L.P.H.|last2=Van Beek|first3=Marc FP |last3=Bierkens|title=Nonsustainable groundwater sustaining irrigation: A global assessment|journal=Water Resources Research |date= 2012 |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=W00L06 |doi=10.1029/2011WR010562|bibcode=2012WRR....48.0L06W }}</ref>\n\n===Sea water and tides===\n{{Main|Seawater|Tides}}\n[[Seawater|Sea water]] contains about 3.5% [[sodium chloride]] on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis]] <span style=\"color:green;\">(green)</span> and [[cellular respiration|respiration]] <span style=\"color:red;\">(red)</span>]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155\u201311162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanization and biofuel crops.

Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world.

Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.\n\nHumans require water with few impurities.

Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.\n\n====Transportation====\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\nThe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.\n\n====Chemical uses====\nWater is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\n[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]\n[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]\n[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]\n[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\n\nThe [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n\n====Industrial applications====\nMany industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |title=Search Results |website=International Water Management Institute (IWMI) |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605124732/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought.

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008).

[[James Legge]]'s 1891 translation of the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' states, \"The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike.

On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth.

The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis|<span style=\"color:green;\">photosynthesis (green)</span>]] and [[cellular respiration|<span style=\"color:red;\">respiration (red)</span>]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155\u201311162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanization and biofuel crops.

(Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.\n\nHumans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead,<ref>''Conquering Chemistry'' 4th Ed. Published 2008</ref> and/or harmful bacteria, such as ''[[Vibrio]]''.

Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.\n\n====Transportation====\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\nThe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.\n\n====Chemical uses====\nWater is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\n[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]\n[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]\n[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]\n[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\n\nThe [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n\n====Industrial applications====\nMany industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by {{convert|0.51|C-change|3}}, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by {{convert|1.02|C-change|3}}; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.<ref name=\"vaclacik\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}</ref>\n\nSolutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.<ref name=\"deman\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1234-3}}</ref> Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.<ref name=\"vaclacik\" /> Solutes in water lower water activity\u2014this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.<ref name=\"deman\" /> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.\n\n[[Water hardness]] is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken.

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nIn the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].\n\nWater is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular [[Asian philosophy]]. [[James Legge]]'s 1891 translation of the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' states, \"The highest excellence is like (that of) water.

When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

It is primarily literary, although it also has an art show, vendors' room, the [[Critter Crunch (Robotics Competition)|Critter Crunch]] (similar to [[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]), the Critter Float-illa (robotic competition in the hotel pool), a [[video]] room, [[anime]] room, [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]], gaming, [[List of weapons in Star Trek|bat'leth]] tournament, and programming on science, writing, literary, media and fannish topics. It runs its own track of kid-friendly, interactive programming and also hosts the Avistrum Academy of Sorcery. It is run by MileHiCon, Inc., a Colorado [[not-for-profit corporation]], and donates money each year to local literacy programs.\n\n==History==\nMileHiCon was started by the Denver Area Science Fiction Association (DASFA). Following the monthly meeting in September 1969, several DASFAns discussed their recent experiences at the St. Louis WorldCon and it was decided to hold an SF (science fiction) Mini-Convention for the next meeting. However, due to some planning hitches and the inability of some key people to attend, it was postponed until November.<ref>DASFA newsletter, October 1969</ref>\n\nThe name of the evening-long event was shortened to Minicon. It was held in the basement meeting room of the Columbia Savings Bank, where DASFA met at that time. DASFA soon discovered that another convention called Minicon had been started the previous year in [[Minneapolis]]. Since that name was taken, DASFA decided to rename it Octocon, since (after the first one) it was held in October.  After a couple of years holding Octocon, they discovered there was a convention in [[Ireland]] called [[Octocon]]. DASFA then renamed the convention again. Two final proposals for the title were:\n*\"MileHiCon,\" which plays off Denver being \"the Mile-High City,\" and would be unlikely to be duplicated;\n*\"LungfishGranolaCon,\" which refers to an ancient DASFA tradition of [[lungfish]] jokes, a type of [[word game]].\n\"MileHiCon\" was chosen, after a close vote.\n\nAround 1980, MileHiCon was incorporated as an entity separate from DASFA (which still meets, but is not incorporated). For the last several years, attendance has generally hovered around a thousand.\n\n'''MileHiCon 43''' was held 21\u201323 October 2011.

It involves the mistreatment or malicious use of a [[consecrate]]d [[Sacramental bread|host]]\u2014the bread used in the [[Eucharist]]ic service of the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (also known by Protestants simply as Communion bread).

There is an outer reality which is bread and wine and an inner which is the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental manner. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence.\n\nHost desecration has been associated with groups identified as inimical to Christianity. It is a common belief that desecration of the host is part of [[Satanism|Satanic practice]], especially the [[Black Mass]]. LaVeyan Satanists do not typically perform Black Mass as a regular ritual, though \"Le Messe Noir\" from [[Anton LaVey]]'s work ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]'' does include some elements.\n\nSince the publication of ''Memoriale Domini'' in 1969,<ref name=\"ewtn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWMEMOR.HTM|title=Memoriale Domini|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an \"ancient custom\".<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world. The practice means that access to consecrated Hosts is easier than in the past, since the person receiving it in the hand may pretend to place it in their mouth for consumption.

(This practice was still performed commonly and consistently, even as recently as the early 1970s in America, and is still common in many churches and countries presently. Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the Memoriale Domini indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm.) Kneeling to receive communion is still the norm among Anglicans and Lutherans as act of reverence.\n\n==Medieval accusations against Jews==\n[[Image:Host desecration.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Jews depicted torturing the host, on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] tapestry.]]\n{{Antisemitism}}\nAccusations of host desecration (German ''Hostiensch\u00e4ndung'') leveled against [[Jews]] were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.<ref name=\"je\"/> The libel of \"[[Jewish deicide]]\": that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man, was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by stabbing or burning them.\n\nIt has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity.<ref>Langmuir (1990), p.289</ref> Although the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] did not imply that, by consuming the host, Christians were eating flesh and drinking blood in the normal sense, the language used to describe the dogma would have been interpreted as completely alien to [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish law]]. For Jews, such a belief system would contradict their strict dietary laws, which forbid the consumption of blood; even when consuming [[kosher animals]].\n\nJews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious than desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nThe penalties for Jews accused of defiling sacred hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, \"confessed\" to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in [[Beelitz]] in 1243,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofje00unse|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge|author=|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Behrman's Jewish book house|date= 1934|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> in [[Prague]] in 1389,<ref>\"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/jud_blib2.htm Blood libel accusations against Jews]\", Religious Tolerance Organisation, retrieved 7 May 2007.</ref> and in many German cities, according to Ocker's writings in the ''Harvard Theological Review''.<ref>Ocker (April 1998)</ref> According to William Nichol, over 100 instances of Jews pleading guilty to the desecration of sacred hosts have been recorded.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first recorded accusation was made in 1243 at [[Beelitz]], south of Potsdam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desecration of Host |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/host-desecration-of |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the [[:fr:Clo\u00eetre et \u00e9glise des Billettes|Church of the Rue des Billettes]] and in a local confraternity. The case of 1337, at [[Deggendorf]], celebrated locally as part of the ''\"Deggendorfer Gnad\"'' until 1992, led to a series of massacres across the region. In 1370 in Brussels the charge of host desecration, linked to an actual recovered relic of desecrated hosts currently found in the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula|Cathedral of St. Gudula]] and long celebrated in a special feast, and to artistic depictions also found in the Cathedral, led to the burning of six Jews (other times given twenty) and, reportedly, the expulsion of the town's Jewish population (see [[Brussels massacre]]). In 1510, at [[:de:Knoblauch (Ketzin)|Knoblauch]] in [[Havelland]] 38 Jews were executed and more expelled from [[Brandenburg]].\n\nAn alleged host desecration in 1410, at [[Segovia]], was said to have brought about an earthquake; as a result, leading Jews in the city were executed and the local synagogue was seized and re-dedicated as the convent and Church of Corpus Christi.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Markman |first=Sidney David |authorlink= |year=2003 |title=Jewish Remnants in Spain: Wanderings in a Lost World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62SGDeU0CzcC&pg=PA50 |location=Mesa, AZ |publisher=Scribe Publishers |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0972723706 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar accusations, resulting in extensive persecution of Jews, were brought forward in 1294, at [[Laa an der Thaya|Laa]], Austria; 1298, at [[R\u00f6ttingen]], near [[W\u00fcrzburg]], and at Korneuburg, near [[Vienna]]; 1299, at [[Ratisbon]]; 1306, at [[St. P\u00f6lten]]; 1330, at [[G\u00fcstrow]]; 1338, at [[Pulkau]]; 1388, at [[Prague]]; 1401, at [[Glogau]]; 1420, at Ems; 1453, at [[Breslau]]; 1478, at [[Passau]]; 1492, at [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], in [[Mecklenburg]]; 1514, at Mittelberg, in [[Alsace]]; 1556, at [[Sochaczew]], in Poland. The last Jew burned for stealing a host died in 1631, according to [[Jacques Basnage]], quoting from Manasseh b. Israel. In some cases host desecration legends emerged without actual accusations, as was the case of the host desecration legend of Poznan (Posen).<ref>{{cite book|author=Magda Teter |title=Sinners on Trial: Jews and Sacrilege after the Reformation|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-674-05297-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|287px|The second panel of [[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''Miracle of the Profaned Host'' (c.1467-1469) from the Urbino Confraternity of Corpus Domini predella.

There is an outer reality which is bread and wine and an inner which is the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental manner. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence.\n\nHost desecration has been associated with groups identified as inimical to Christianity. It is a common belief that desecration of the host is part of [[Satanism|Satanic practice]], especially the [[Black Mass]]. LaVeyan Satanists do not typically perform Black Mass as a regular ritual, though \"Le Messe Noir\" from [[Anton LaVey]]'s work ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]'' does include some elements.\n\nSince the publication of ''Memoriale Domini'' in 1969,<ref name=\"ewtn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWMEMOR.HTM|title=Memoriale Domini|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an \"ancient custom\".<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world. The practice means that access to consecrated Hosts is easier than in the past, since the person receiving it in the hand may pretend to place it in their mouth for consumption. However, recent statements and practices of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]<ref name=\"light of the world\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|title=In 'Light of the World', by Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict says: \"I am not opposed in principle to Communion in the hand; I have both administered and received Communion in this way myself...The idea behind my current practice of having people kneel to receive Communion on the tongue was to send a signal and to underscore the Real Presence with an exclamation point.\"|website=ignatius.com|access-date=2012-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055319/http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|archive-date=2012-05-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> have caused a shift in Catholic practice (notably at Papal Masses and amongst more traditional-minded Catholics) of receiving on the tongue while kneeling, which is also an ancient practice. (This practice was still performed commonly and consistently, even as recently as the early 1970s in America, and is still common in many churches and countries presently. Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the Memoriale Domini indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm.) Kneeling to receive communion is still the norm among Anglicans and Lutherans as act of reverence.\n\n==Medieval accusations against Jews==\n[[Image:Host desecration.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Jews depicted torturing the host, on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] tapestry.]]\n{{Antisemitism}}\nAccusations of host desecration (German ''Hostiensch\u00e4ndung'') leveled against [[Jews]] were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.<ref name=\"je\"/> The libel of \"[[Jewish deicide]]\": that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man, was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by stabbing or burning them.\n\nIt has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity.<ref>Langmuir (1990), p.289</ref> Although the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] did not imply that, by consuming the host, Christians were eating flesh and drinking blood in the normal sense, the language used to describe the dogma would have been interpreted as completely alien to [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish law]]. For Jews, such a belief system would contradict their strict dietary laws, which forbid the consumption of blood; even when consuming [[kosher animals]].\n\nJews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious than desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nThe penalties for Jews accused of defiling sacred hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, \"confessed\" to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in [[Beelitz]] in 1243,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofje00unse|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge|author=|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Behrman's Jewish book house|date= 1934|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> in [[Prague]] in 1389,<ref>\"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/jud_blib2.htm Blood libel accusations against Jews]\", Religious Tolerance Organisation, retrieved 7 May 2007.</ref> and in many German cities, according to Ocker's writings in the ''Harvard Theological Review''.<ref>Ocker (April 1998)</ref> According to William Nichol, over 100 instances of Jews pleading guilty to the desecration of sacred hosts have been recorded.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first recorded accusation was made in 1243 at [[Beelitz]], south of Potsdam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desecration of Host |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/host-desecration-of |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the [[:fr:Clo\u00eetre et \u00e9glise des Billettes|Church of the Rue des Billettes]] and in a local confraternity. The case of 1337, at [[Deggendorf]], celebrated locally as part of the ''\"Deggendorfer Gnad\"'' until 1992, led to a series of massacres across the region. In 1370 in Brussels the charge of host desecration, linked to an actual recovered relic of desecrated hosts currently found in the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula|Cathedral of St. Gudula]] and long celebrated in a special feast, and to artistic depictions also found in the Cathedral, led to the burning of six Jews (other times given twenty) and, reportedly, the expulsion of the town's Jewish population (see [[Brussels massacre]]). In 1510, at [[:de:Knoblauch (Ketzin)|Knoblauch]] in [[Havelland]] 38 Jews were executed and more expelled from [[Brandenburg]].\n\nAn alleged host desecration in 1410, at [[Segovia]], was said to have brought about an earthquake; as a result, leading Jews in the city were executed and the local synagogue was seized and re-dedicated as the convent and Church of Corpus Christi.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Markman |first=Sidney David |authorlink= |year=2003 |title=Jewish Remnants in Spain: Wanderings in a Lost World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62SGDeU0CzcC&pg=PA50 |location=Mesa, AZ |publisher=Scribe Publishers |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0972723706 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar accusations, resulting in extensive persecution of Jews, were brought forward in 1294, at [[Laa an der Thaya|Laa]], Austria; 1298, at [[R\u00f6ttingen]], near [[W\u00fcrzburg]], and at Korneuburg, near [[Vienna]]; 1299, at [[Ratisbon]]; 1306, at [[St. P\u00f6lten]]; 1330, at [[G\u00fcstrow]]; 1338, at [[Pulkau]]; 1388, at [[Prague]]; 1401, at [[Glogau]]; 1420, at Ems; 1453, at [[Breslau]]; 1478, at [[Passau]]; 1492, at [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], in [[Mecklenburg]]; 1514, at Mittelberg, in [[Alsace]]; 1556, at [[Sochaczew]], in Poland. The last Jew burned for stealing a host died in 1631, according to [[Jacques Basnage]], quoting from Manasseh b. Israel. In some cases host desecration legends emerged without actual accusations, as was the case of the host desecration legend of Poznan (Posen).<ref>{{cite book|author=Magda Teter |title=Sinners on Trial: Jews and Sacrilege after the Reformation|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-674-05297-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|287px|The second panel of [[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''Miracle of the Profaned Host'' (c.1467-1469) from the Urbino Confraternity of Corpus Domini predella.
