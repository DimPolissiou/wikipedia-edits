{"title_page": "Verb phrase ellipsis", "text_new": "In [[linguistics]], '''verb phrase ellipsis''' ('''VP-ellipsis''' or '''VPE''') is a type of [[elliptical construction]] and a type of [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] in which a [[non-finite verb|non-finite verb phrase]] has been left out (elided) provided that its [[antecedent]] can be found within the same linguistic context, e.g. ''She will sell sea shells, and he will <sub>sell sea shells</sub> too''. VP-ellipsis is a well-studied kind of ellipsis,<ref>Prominent explorations of VP-ellipsis are, for instance, those of Hankamer and Sag (1976), Hardt (1993), and Johnson (2001).</ref> particularly with regard to its occurrence in English,<ref>An extensive corpus study is found in Bos and Spenader (2011).</ref> although certain types can be found in other languages as well.<ref>See Goldberg (2005) for a sustained argument that verb phrase ellipsis is also found in certain verb-raising languages.</ref>\n\n==Features of verb phrase ellipsis in English==\nIn the VP ellipsis considered here, which are features of [[English grammar]], the elided VP must be a [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] VP; it cannot be a [[finite verb|finite]] VP. Further, the ellipsis must be introduced by an [[auxiliary verb]] (''be'', ''can'', ''do'', ''don't'', ''could'', ''have'', ''may'', ''might'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''won't'', ''would'', etc.) or by the infinitive particle ''to''.<ref>See Kroeger (2004:35) concerning the necessity that an auxiliary verb be \"left behind\" in order to license VP ellipsis.</ref> In the examples below, the elided material of VP ellipsis is indicated using subscripts and a smaller font and the antecedent to the ellipsis is bolded:\n\n::You might '''do it''', but I won't <sub>do it</sub>.\n\n::She won't '''laugh''', but he will <sub>laugh</sub>.\n\n::Susan has '''been cheating''', and Fred has <sub>been cheating</sub> too.\n\n::Larry is not '''telling the truth''', neither is Jim <sub>telling the truth</sub>.\n\n::They will '''do it''' if they want to <sub>do it</sub>.\n\nAttempts at VP ellipsis that lack an auxiliary verb fail, unless the infinitive particle ''to'' is retained:\n\n::a. *Sam wants '''to eat''', and Fred wants <sub>to eat</sub> as well. (* indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical)\n::b. Sam wants to '''eat''', and Fred wants to <sub>eat</sub> as well.\n\n::a. *Josh likes '''to sleep late''', and Hillary likes <sub>to sleep late</sub> as well.\n::b. Josh likes to '''sleep late''', and Hillary likes to <sub>sleep late</sub> as well.\n\nApparent exceptions to this restriction on VP ellipsis may be instances of [[null complement anaphora]], e.g. ''?Bill tried to leave, and Jim tried <sub>to leave</sub> too''.\n\nA particularly frequent construction in which VP ellipsis (obligatorily) occurs is the [[tag question]]:\n\n::Jeremy '''likes beer''', doesn't he <sub>like beer</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n::Susan will '''write the paper''', won't she <sub>write the paper</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n\n==The direction of ellipsis==\nVP ellipsis can be said to operate either ''forwards'' or'' backwards'': it operates forwards when the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to the ellipsis precedes the ellipsis (as in the above examples) and backwards when the antecedent follows the ellipsis. It can also be said to operate either ''upwards'' or ''downwards'' (or neither). It operates upwards when the antecedent appears in a clause that is [[subordinate clause|subordinate]] to the clause containing the ellipsis, and downwards when the ellipsis appears in a clause subordinate to the clause containing the antecedent. In the above examples, the two clauses are [[coordination (grammar)|coordinated]], so neither is subordinate to the other, and hence the operation of the ellipsis is neither upward nor downward.\n\nCombinations of these directions of operation of ellipsis are illustrated with the following examples:\n\n:: The people who say they will '''help''' never do <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and upwards</small>\n:: The people who say they will <sub>help</sub> never do '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and downwards</small>\n\n:: The people never do '''help''', who say they will <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and downwards</small>\n:: *The people never do <sub>help</sub>, who say they will '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and upwards</small>\n\nThree of the four combinations are acceptable. However, as the fourth example shows, VP ellipsis is impossible when it operates both backwards and upwards.\n\n==Antecedent-contained ellipsis==\n{{main article|Antecedent-contained deletion}}\nAn aspect of VP ellipsis that has been the subject of much theoretical analysis occurs when the ellipsis appears to be contained inside its antecedent. The phenomenon is called '''antecedent-contained ellipsis''' or '''antecedent-contained deletion'''. Canonical cases of antecedent-contained ellipsis occur when the ellipsis appears inside a quantified object NP, e.g.\n\n::They '''said everything that we did <sub>say</sub>'''.\n::He is '''thinking the same thing I am <sub>thinking</sub>'''.\n\nIf it is assumed that the antecedent to the ellipsis is to be a complete verb phrase, then the only possible antecedent appears to be the VP in bold. This VP, however, contains the ellipsis itself. This analysis would imply an [[infinite regress]], which is an impossibility, since it would mean that the ellipsis could never acquire full semantic content.\n\nOne means of addressing antecedent-contained ellipsis that is pursued in some [[phrase structure grammar]]s is to assume quantifier [[raising (linguistics)|raising]] (QR).<ref>For accounts of antecedent contained deletion in terms of quantifier raising, see for instance Kennedy (1997) and Wilder (2003).</ref> Quantifier raising raises the quantified NP to a position where it is no longer contained inside its antecedent VP. An alternative explanation, pursued in [[dependency grammar]]s, is to assume that the basic unit of syntax is not the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], but rather the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]].<ref>Concerning the status of the catena as the basic unit of syntactic analysis and as a basis for the analysis of ellipsis and antecedent containment, see Osborne (2019: 353-355, 373-375).</ref> On this analysis, the antecedent to the ellipsis does not need to be a complete constituent (an entire verb phrase), but can be merely a catena (the verbs ''say'' and ''thinking'' in the above examples), which need not contain the ellipsis.\n\n==Argument contained ellipsis==\nAs noted above, VP ellipsis is generally impossible if it would operate both backwards and upwards. There are also certain other restrictions on the possibility of ellipsis, although a complete theoretical analysis may be lacking. Two examples of environments in which ellipsis fails are now given:<ref>The two examples illustrating argument contained ellipsis were originally from Wasow 1972.</ref>\n\n:: *A proof that God '''exists''' does <sub>exist</sub>. <small>- Failed upward ellipsis</small>\n:: *A proof that God does <sub>exist</sub> '''exists'''. <small>- Failed argument-contained ellipsis</small>\n\nThe inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these cases has been explored in terms of so-called ''argument contained ellipsis''.<ref>Argument contained ellipsis is explored in detail by Kennedy (1994).</ref> The ellipsis appears inside an argument of the predicate represented by the antecedent to the ellipsis.

Laid out within medieval walls on a hill in the wide valley of the [[Aterno-Pescara|Aterno]] river, it is surrounded by the [[Apennine Mountains]], with the [[Gran Sasso d'Italia]] to the north-east.\n\nL'Aquila sits upon a hillside in the middle of a narrow valley; tall snow-capped mountains of the Gran Sasso massif flank the town. A maze of narrow streets, lined with Baroque and Renaissance buildings and churches, open onto elegant piazzas. Home to the [[University of L'Aquila]], it is a lively [[college town]] and, as such, has many cultural institutions: a [[Repertory|repertory theatre]], a symphony orchestra, a fine-arts academy, a state conservatory, a film institute. There are several [[ski resorts]] in the surrounding province ([[Campo Imperatore]], [[Ovindoli]], [[Pescasseroli]], [[Roccaraso]], [[Scanno, Abruzzo|Scanno]]).\n\n==Geography==\nClose to the highest of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] [[Gran Sasso d'Italia|summits]], L'Aquila is positioned at an elevation of {{convert|721|m|ft}} in the Valley of the [[Aterno-Pescara]], situated between four mountain peaks above {{convert|2000|m|ft}}.\n\nThe mountains block the city off from warm humid air currents from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and give rise to a climate that is cool in comparison to most of [[central Italy]], and dry. It has been said{{by whom|date=February 2018}} that the city enjoys each year 11 cold months and one cool one.\n\nL'Aquila is approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} east-northeast of Rome, with which it is connected by an [[Autostrada A24 (Italy)|autostrada]] through the mountains.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of L'Aquila}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe city's construction was begun by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], out of several already existing villages (ninety-nine, according to local tradition; see [[Amiternum]]), as a bulwark against the power of the papacy. The name of Aquila means \"Eagle\" in Italian. Construction was completed in 1254 under Frederick's son, [[Conrad IV of Germany]]. The name was switched to Aquila degli Abruzzi in 1861, and L'Aquila in 1939. After the death of Conrad, the city was destroyed by his brother [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred]] in 1259, but soon rebuilt by [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I of Anjou]], its successor as king of Sicily. The walls were completed in 1316.\n\nIt quickly became the second city of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. It was an autonomous city, ruled by a [[diarchy]] composed of the City Council (which had varying names and composition over the centuries) and the King's Captain. It fell initially under the lordship of Niccol\u00f2 dell'Isola, appointed by the people as the People's Knight, but he was then killed when he became a tyrant. Later, it fell under Pietro \"Lalle\" Camponeschi, Count of Montorio, who became the third side of a new triarchy, with the Council and the King's Captain. Camponeschi, who was also Great Chancellor of the kingdom of Naples, became too powerful, and was killed by order of Prince [[Louis, Prince of Taranto|Louis]] of [[Principality of Taranto|Taranto]]. His descendants fought with the Pretatti family for power for several generations, but never again attained the power of their ancestor. The last, and the one true \"lord\" of L'Aquila, was Ludovico Franchi, who challenged the power of the pope by giving refuge to [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso I d'Este]], former duke of [[Duchy of Ferrara|Ferrara]], and the children of [[Gian Paolo Baglioni|Giampaolo Baglioni]], deposed lord of [[Perugia]]. In the end, however, the Aquilans had him deposed and imprisoned by the [[List of monarchs of Naples|king of Naples]].\n\n[[File:L'Aquila 65.jpg|thumb|left|Fountain of the 99 Spouts.]]\n\nThe power of L'Aquila was based on the close connection between the city and its mother-villages, which had established the city as a federation, each of them building a borough and considering it as a part of the mother-village. The Fountain of the 99 Spouts (''Fontana delle 99 Cannelle''), was given its name to celebrate the ancient origin of the town. The City Council was originally composed of the Mayors of the villages, and the city had no legal existence until King [[Charles II of Naples]] appointed a \"Camerlengo\", responsible for city tributes (previously paid separately by each of its mother-villages). Later, the Camerlengo also took political power, as President of the City Council.\n\nFrom its beginnings the city constituted an important market for the surrounding countryside, which provided it with a regular supply of food: from the fertile valleys came the precious saffron; the surrounding mountain pastures provided summer grazing for numerous [[Transhumance|transhumant]] flocks of sheep, which in turn supplied abundant raw materials for export and, to a lesser extent, small local industries, which in time brought craftsmen and merchants from outside the area.\n\nWithin a few decades L'Aquila became a crossroads in communications between cities within and beyond the Kingdom, thanks to the so-called \"via degli Abruzzi\", which ran from [[Florence]] to Naples by way of [[Perugia]], Rieti, L'Aquila, Sulmona, Isernia, Venafro, Teano and [[Capua]].\n\n[[File:SMariaCollemaggio.jpg|thumb|right|Church of [[Santa Maria di Collemaggio]].]]\n\nNegotiations for the succession of Edmund, son of [[Henry III of England]], to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] involved L'Aquila in the web of interests linking the [[Roman Curia]] to the [[Courts of England and Wales|English court]]. On December 23, 1256, [[Pope Alexander IV]] elevated the churches of Saints Massimo and Giorgio to the status of cathedrals as a reward to the citizens of L'Aquila for their opposition to King Manfred who, in July 1259, had the city razed to the ground in an attempt to destroy the negotiations. On August 29, 1294, the [[hermit]] Pietro del Morrone was consecrated as [[pope Celestine V]] in the church of [[Santa Maria di Collemaggio]], in commemoration of which the new pope decreed the annual religious rite of the Pardon (nowadays known as [[Celestinian Forgiveness]], ''Perdonanza Celestiniana''), still observed today in the city on August&nbsp;28 and&nbsp;29: it is the immediate ancestor of the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee Year]].\n\nThe pontificate of Celestine V gave a new impulse to building development, as can be seen from the city statutes. In 1311, moreover, King [[Robert of Naples|Robert of Anjou]] granted privileges which had a decisive influence on the development of trade. These privileges protected all activities related to sheep-farming, exempting them from customs duties on imports and exports. This was the period in which merchants from [[Tuscany]] (Scale, Bonaccorsi) and Rieti purchased houses in the city. Hence the conditions for radical political renewal: in 1355 the trade guilds of leather-workers, metal-workers, merchants and learned men were brought into the government of the city, and these together with the Camerario and the Cinque constituted the new Camera Aquilana. Eleven years earlier, in 1344, the King had granted the city its own mint.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century the city was struck by plague epidemics (1348, 1363) and earthquakes (1349). Reconstruction began soon, however. In the 14th\u201315th century Jewish families came to live in the city, while the generals of the [[Franciscan]] Order chose the city as the seat of the Order's general chapters (1376, 1408, 1411, 1450, 1452, 1495). [[Bernardino of Siena]], of the [[Franciscan]] order of the Observance, visited L'Aquila twice, the first time to preach in the presence of King [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou|Ren\u00e9 of Naples]], and in 1444, on his second visit, he died in the city. In 1481 [[Adam of Rottweil]], a pupil and collaborator of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Johann Gutenberg]], obtained permission to establish a [[printing press]] in L'Aquila.\n\nThe Osservanti branch of the Franciscan order had a decisive influence on L'Aquila. As a result of initiatives by Friar [[John of Capistrano|Giovanni da Capistrano]] and Friar Giacomo della Marca, Lombard masters undertook, in the relatively underdeveloped north-east of the city, an imposing series of buildings centring on the hospital of Saint Salvatore (1446) and the convent and the [[Basilica of San Bernardino]]. The [[Construction|construction work]] was long and difficult, mainly because of the earthquake of 1461, which caused the buildings to collapse, and the translation of the body of San Bernardino did not take place until May 14, 1472. The whole city suffered serious damage on the occasion of the earthquake, and two years went by before repairs on the churches and convents began.\n\nIn a strategy finalised to increasing their political and economic autonomy, the Aquilani took a series of political gambles, siding sometimes with the Roman [[Pope|Papacy]], sometimes with the Kingdom of Naples. When the Pope excommunicated [[Joanna II of Naples|Joanna II]], Queen of Naples, appointing [[Louis III of Naples|Louis III of Anjou]] as heir to the crown in her stead, L'Aquila sided with the Angevines. Joanna hired the [[condottiero]] [[Braccio da Montone]]. In exchange for his services, Braccio obtained the lordship of Teramo, as well as the [[fief]]doms of Capua and Foggia: he started a [[War of L'Aquila|13-month-long siege]] of L'Aquila, that resisted bravely. Facing Braccio, at the head of the [[Angevines|Angevine]] army was [[Muzio Sforza|Muzio Attendolo Sforza]] and his son [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco]]. The final clash between the two contenders was just below the walls of Aquila, near the hamlet today called Bazzano. In the battle fought on June 2, 1424 Braccio, mortally wounded in the neck, was made prisoner and transported to Aquila, where he died three days later, on June 5, 1424. The Pope had him buried in deconsecrated earth. The citizens of L'Aquila honoured the bravery of their enemy Braccio by dedicating one of the main streets of the city to his name.\n\n[[File:LAquila1703.jpg|thumb|right|L'Aquila in 1703.]]\n\n===Modern era===\nThis period of freedom and prosperity ended in the 16th century, when Spanish viceroy [[Philibert of Ch\u00e2lon|Philibert van Oranje]] partially destroyed L'Aquila and established Spanish [[feudalism]] in its countryside. The city, separated from its roots, never developed again. Ancient privileges were revoked. L'Aquila was again destroyed by an [[1703 Apennine earthquakes|earthquake]] in 1703. Successive earthquakes have repeatedly damaged the city's large [[L'Aquila Cathedral|cathedral]], and destroyed the original dome of the [[Basilica of San Bernardino]], designed along the lines of the dome of [[Florence Cathedral|Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence. The city was also sacked two times by [[Napoleonic Wars|French troops]] in 1799.\n\nL'Aquila, like so much of Italy, is a city of political contrasts. In the 1970s a novel by [[Alberto Moravia]] was seized because it was considered obscene, a local Catholic Archbishop protested the nudity of a centuries-old statue of a young man, and a group of local reactionaries even asked for the seizure of the \u00a350 coin because it showed a naked man. In October 2003, however, a liberal judge in l'Aquila ordered the small town of [[Ofena]] to remove a crucifix from its elementary school so as to not to offend the religious sensibilities of two young [[Muslim]] students. After a national outcry, the judge's decision was overturned. In May 2007 [[Massimo Cialente]], a physician and medical researcher, was [[Mayor|elected mayor]] of L'Aquila with a [[centre-left]] coalition.\n\n===Earthquakes===\n{{See also|2009 L'Aquila earthquake}}\n\n[[File:L'Aquila eathquake prefettura.jpg|thumb|right|The local [[prefecture]] (a government office) damaged by the earthquake.]]\n[[File:G8 Summit - 8 July 2009-9.jpg|thumb|Leaders pose for a group photo on the first day of the G8 Summit.]]\n\nEarthquakes mark the history of L'Aquila, as the city is situated partially on an ancient lake-bed that amplifies seismic activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abruzzo2000.com/abruzzo/laquila/laquila.htm |title=L'Aquila, prov. of L'Aquila, Abruzzo |publisher=Abruzzo2000.com |accessdate=April 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/1777/1/03%20d'addezio.pdf Earth-prints.org]</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1315, the city was struck by an earthquake which seriously damaged the [[Francis of Assisi|San Francesco]] Church.

More than 3.000 people died and almost all the churches collapsed; [[Rocca Calascio]], the highest fortress in Europe was also ruined by this event, yet the town survived. L'Aquila was then repopulated by decision of [[Pope Clement XI]]. The town was rocked by earthquake again in 1706.

Among the sights are:\n\n===Religious buildings===\n*[[L'Aquila Cathedral]]: main church dedicated to Saint [[Maximus of Aveia]] (San Massimo), was built in the 13th century, but razed after the 1703 earthquake. The most recent fa\u00e7ade dated from the 19th century, but the earthquake of 2009 and subsequent aftershocks collapsed parts of the [[transept]] and possibly more of the cathedral.\n*[[Basilica of San Bernardino]] (1472): church has a fine [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] fa\u00e7ade by [[Nicola Filotesio|Nicol\u00f2 Filotesio]] (commonly called Cola dell'Amatrice), and contains the monumental tomb of the saint (1480), decorated with beautiful sculptures, and executed by [[Silvestro Ariscola]].\n*[[Santa Maria di Collemaggio]]: church just outside the town, has a very fine, but simple, Romanesque fa\u00e7ade (1270\u20131280) in red and white marble, with three decorated portals and a rose-window above each. The two side doors are also fine. The interior contains the mausoleum of [[Pope Celestine V]] erected in 1517.\n*[[Santa Giusta (L'Aquila)|Santa Giusta]]: Romanesque fa\u00e7ade with Gothic rose window\n*[[San Silvestro, L'Aquila|San Silvestro]]: 14th-century Romanesque fa\u00e7ade with Gothic rose window\n\n===Secular buildings===\n*[[Forte Spagnolo|Spanish fort (''Forte Spagnolo'')]]: massive castle in the highest part of the town,  erected in 1534 by the Spanish viceroy [[Don Pedro de Toledo]]. In 2016, home to the [[Museo Nazionale d'Abruzzo|National Museum of Abruzzo]].\n*''Fontana Luminosa ''(\"Luminous Fountain\"): a 1930s sculpture of two women bearing large jars.\n*''Fontana delle novantanove cannelle'' (1272): a fountain with ninety-nine jets distributed along three walls. The source of the fountain is still unknown. \n*''L'Aquila cemetery'': includes grave of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], 19th\u2011century German [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] pioneer who lived in L'Aquila; every year, [[Homosexuality|gay people]] from all over the world meet at the cemetery to honour his memory.\n*''Roman ruins of [[Amiternum]]'': ruins of an Ancient Roman city\n*''[[Rocca Calascio]]'': castle used in the 1980s as the location for the movie ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'', which is likely the highest castle in Italy, if not, Europe.\n\nAlso nearby are several [[ski resort]]s like [[Gran Sasso d'Italia]], the highest of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] where in its valley the movie ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'' was filmed in the end of the 1980s. The town also contains some fine palaces: the municipality has a museum, with a collection of Roman inscriptions and some illuminated service books. The Palazzi Dragonetti and Persichetti contain private collections of pictures.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Stadio fattori.JPG|thumb|right|Tommaso Fattori Stadium]]\n\n===Cinematographic activities===\nThe first step of L'Aquila in the [[Cinematography|cinematographic]] activities was the Cineforum Primo Piano founded by Gabriele Lucci in the middle of the 1970s. As a work of Lucci, in 1981 saw the establishment of l'Istituto Cinematografico dell'Aquila, an institute for the production and diffusion of the cinematographic culture in Italia and abroad.\n\nThe [[Teatro Stabile d'Abruzzo]] is based in the city and was formed in 2000.\n\n===Sport===\nThe city is the home of five-time Italian champions [[L'Aquila Rugby]]. The football squad, [[A.S.D. L'Aquila Calcio 1927|L'Aquila Calcio]], played 3 times in [[serie B]].\n\n==''Frazioni''==\nThe following is a list of the ''frazioni'' in the ''comune'' of L'Aquila: Aquilio, [[Aragno]],

{{IPA-it|\u02c8la\u02d0kwila|lang|It-L'Aquila.ogg}}; meaning \"The Eagle\") is a city and ''[[comune]]'' in Central Italy, both the capital city of the [[Abruzzo]] region and of the [[Province of L'Aquila]]. {{As of|2013}}, it has a population of 70,967 inhabitants. Laid out within medieval walls on a hill in the wide valley of the [[Aterno-Pescara|Aterno]] river, it is surrounded by the [[Apennine Mountains]], with the [[Gran Sasso d'Italia]] to the north-east.\n\nL'Aquila sits upon a hillside in the middle of a narrow valley; tall snow-capped mountains of the Gran Sasso massif flank the town. A maze of narrow streets, lined with Baroque and Renaissance buildings and churches, open onto elegant piazzas. Home to the [[University of L'Aquila]], it is a lively [[college town]] and, as such, has many cultural institutions: a [[Repertory|repertory theatre]], a symphony orchestra, a fine-arts academy, a state conservatory, a film institute. There are several [[ski resorts]] in the surrounding province ([[Campo Imperatore]], [[Ovindoli]], [[Pescasseroli]], [[Roccaraso]], [[Scanno, Abruzzo|Scanno]]).\n\n==Geography==\nClose to the highest of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] [[Gran Sasso d'Italia|summits]], L'Aquila is positioned at an elevation of {{convert|721|m|ft}} in the Valley of the [[Aterno-Pescara]], situated between four mountain peaks above {{convert|2000|m|ft}}.\n\nThe mountains block the city off from warm humid air currents from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and give rise to a climate that is cool in comparison to most of [[central Italy]], and dry. It has been said{{by whom|date=February 2018}} that the city enjoys each year 11 cold months and one cool one.\n\nL'Aquila is approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} east-northeast of Rome, with which it is connected by an [[Autostrada A24 (Italy)|autostrada]] through the mountains.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of L'Aquila}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe city's construction was begun by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], out of several already existing villages (ninety-nine, according to local tradition; see [[Amiternum]]), as a bulwark against the power of the papacy. The name of Aquila means \"Eagle\" in Italian. Construction was completed in 1254 under Frederick's son, [[Conrad IV of Germany]]. The name was switched to Aquila degli Abruzzi in 1861, and L'Aquila in 1939. After the death of Conrad, the city was destroyed by his brother [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred]] in 1259, but soon rebuilt by [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I of Anjou]], its successor as king of Sicily. The walls were completed in 1316.\n\nIt quickly became the second city of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. It was an autonomous city, ruled by a [[diarchy]] composed of the City Council (which had varying names and composition over the centuries) and the King's Captain. It fell initially under the lordship of Niccol\u00f2 dell'Isola, appointed by the people as the People's Knight, but he was then killed when he became a tyrant. Later, it fell under Pietro \"Lalle\" Camponeschi, Count of Montorio, who became the third side of a new triarchy, with the Council and the King's Captain. Camponeschi, who was also Great Chancellor of the kingdom of Naples, became too powerful, and was killed by order of Prince [[Louis, Prince of Taranto|Louis]] of [[Principality of Taranto|Taranto]]. His descendants fought with the Pretatti family for power for several generations, but never again attained the power of their ancestor. The last, and the one true \"lord\" of L'Aquila, was Ludovico Franchi, who challenged the power of the pope by giving refuge to [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso I d'Este]], former duke of [[Duchy of Ferrara|Ferrara]], and the children of [[Gian Paolo Baglioni|Giampaolo Baglioni]], deposed lord of [[Perugia]]. In the end, however, the Aquilans had him deposed and imprisoned by the [[List of monarchs of Naples|king of Naples]].\n\n[[File:L'Aquila 65.jpg|thumb|left|Fountain of the 99 Spouts.]]\n\nThe power of L'Aquila was based on the close connection between the city and its mother-villages, which had established the city as a federation, each of them building a borough and considering it as a part of the mother-village. The Fountain of the 99 Spouts (''Fontana delle 99 Cannelle''), was given its name to celebrate the ancient origin of the town. The City Council was originally composed of the Mayors of the villages, and the city had no legal existence until King [[Charles II of Naples]] appointed a \"Camerlengo\", responsible for city tributes (previously paid separately by each of its mother-villages). Later, the Camerlengo also took political power, as President of the City Council.\n\nFrom its beginnings the city constituted an important market for the surrounding countryside, which provided it with a regular supply of food: from the fertile valleys came the precious saffron; the surrounding mountain pastures provided summer grazing for numerous [[Transhumance|transhumant]] flocks of sheep, which in turn supplied abundant raw materials for export and, to a lesser extent, small local industries, which in time brought craftsmen and merchants from outside the area.\n\nWithin a few decades L'Aquila became a crossroads in communications between cities within and beyond the Kingdom, thanks to the so-called \"via degli Abruzzi\", which ran from [[Florence]] to Naples by way of [[Perugia]], Rieti, L'Aquila, Sulmona, Isernia, Venafro, Teano and [[Capua]].\n\n[[File:SMariaCollemaggio.jpg|thumb|right|Church of [[Santa Maria di Collemaggio]].]]\n\nNegotiations for the succession of Edmund, son of [[Henry III of England]], to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] involved L'Aquila in the web of interests linking the [[Roman Curia]] to the [[Courts of England and Wales|English court]]. On December 23, 1256, [[Pope Alexander IV]] elevated the churches of Saints Massimo and Giorgio to the status of cathedrals as a reward to the citizens of L'Aquila for their opposition to King Manfred who, in July 1259, had the city razed to the ground in an attempt to destroy the negotiations. On August 29, 1294, the [[hermit]] Pietro del Morrone was consecrated as [[pope Celestine V]] in the church of [[Santa Maria di Collemaggio]], in commemoration of which the new pope decreed the annual religious rite of the Pardon (nowadays known as [[Celestinian Forgiveness]], ''Perdonanza Celestiniana''), still observed today in the city on August&nbsp;28 and&nbsp;29: it is the immediate ancestor of the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee Year]].\n\nThe pontificate of Celestine V gave a new impulse to building development, as can be seen from the city statutes. In 1311, moreover, King [[Robert of Naples|Robert of Anjou]] granted privileges which had a decisive influence on the development of trade. These privileges protected all activities related to sheep-farming, exempting them from customs duties on imports and exports. This was the period in which merchants from [[Tuscany]] (Scale, Bonaccorsi) and Rieti purchased houses in the city. Hence the conditions for radical political renewal: in 1355 the trade guilds of leather-workers, metal-workers, merchants and learned men were brought into the government of the city, and these together with the Camerario and the Cinque constituted the new Camera Aquilana. Eleven years earlier, in 1344, the King had granted the city its own mint.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century the city was struck by plague epidemics (1348, 1363) and earthquakes (1349). Reconstruction began soon, however. In the 14th\u201315th century Jewish families came to live in the city, while the generals of the [[Franciscan]] Order chose the city as the seat of the Order's general chapters (1376, 1408, 1411, 1450, 1452, 1495). [[Bernardino of Siena]], of the [[Franciscan]] order of the Observance, visited L'Aquila twice, the first time to preach in the presence of King [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou|Ren\u00e9 of Naples]], and in 1444, on his second visit, he died in the city. In 1481 [[Adam of Rottweil]], a pupil and collaborator of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Johann Gutenberg]], obtained permission to establish a [[printing press]] in L'Aquila.\n\nThe Osservanti branch of the Franciscan order had a decisive influence on L'Aquila. As a result of initiatives by Friar [[John of Capistrano|Giovanni da Capistrano]] and Friar Giacomo della Marca, Lombard masters undertook, in the relatively underdeveloped north-east of the city, an imposing series of buildings centring on the hospital of Saint Salvatore (1446) and the convent and the [[Basilica of San Bernardino]]. The [[Construction|construction work]] was long and difficult, mainly because of the earthquake of 1461, which caused the buildings to collapse, and the translation of the body of San Bernardino did not take place until May 14, 1472. The whole city suffered serious damage on the occasion of the earthquake, and two years went by before repairs on the churches and convents began.\n\nIn a strategy finalised to increasing their political and economic autonomy, the Aquilani took a series of political gambles, siding sometimes with the Roman [[Pope|Papacy]], sometimes with the Kingdom of Naples. When the Pope excommunicated [[Joanna II of Naples|Joanna II]], Queen of Naples, appointing [[Louis III of Naples|Louis III of Anjou]] as heir to the crown in her stead, L'Aquila sided with the Angevines. Joanna hired the [[condottiero]] [[Braccio da Montone]]. In exchange for his services, Braccio obtained the lordship of Teramo, as well as the [[fief]]doms of Capua and Foggia: he started a [[War of L'Aquila|13-month-long siege]] of L'Aquila, that resisted bravely. Facing Braccio, at the head of the [[Angevines|Angevine]] army was [[Muzio Sforza|Muzio Attendolo Sforza]] and his son [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco]]. The final clash between the two contenders was just below the walls of Aquila, near the hamlet today called Bazzano. In the battle fought on June 2, 1424 Braccio, mortally wounded in the neck, was made prisoner and transported to Aquila, where he died three days later, on June 5, 1424. The Pope had him buried in deconsecrated earth. The citizens of L'Aquila honoured the bravery of their enemy Braccio by dedicating one of the main streets of the city to his name.\n\n[[File:LAquila1703.jpg|thumb|right|L'Aquila in 1703.]]\n\n===Modern era===\nThis period of freedom and prosperity ended in the 16th century, when Spanish viceroy [[Philibert of Ch\u00e2lon|Philibert van Oranje]] partially destroyed L'Aquila and established Spanish [[feudalism]] in its countryside. The city, separated from its roots, never developed again. Ancient privileges were revoked. L'Aquila was again destroyed by an [[1703 Apennine earthquakes|earthquake]] in 1703. Successive earthquakes have repeatedly damaged the city's large [[L'Aquila Cathedral|cathedral]], and destroyed the original dome of the [[Basilica of San Bernardino]], designed along the lines of the dome of [[Florence Cathedral|Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence. The city was also sacked two times by [[Napoleonic Wars|French troops]] in 1799.\n\nL'Aquila, like so much of Italy, is a city of political contrasts. In the 1970s a novel by [[Alberto Moravia]] was seized because it was considered obscene, a local Catholic Archbishop protested the nudity of a centuries-old statue of a young man, and a group of local reactionaries even asked for the seizure of the \u00a350 coin because it showed a naked man. In October 2003, however, a liberal judge in l'Aquila ordered the small town of [[Ofena]] to remove a crucifix from its elementary school so as to not to offend the religious sensibilities of two young [[Muslim]] students. After a national outcry, the judge's decision was overturned. In May 2007 [[Massimo Cialente]], a physician and medical researcher, was [[Mayor|elected mayor]] of L'Aquila with a [[centre-left]] coalition.\n\n===Earthquakes===\n{{See also|2009 L'Aquila earthquake}}\n\n[[File:L'Aquila eathquake prefettura.jpg|thumb|right|The local [[prefecture]] (a government office) damaged by the earthquake.]]\n[[File:G8 Summit - 8 July 2009-9.jpg|thumb|Leaders pose for a group photo on the first day of the G8 Summit.]]\n\nEarthquakes mark the history of L'Aquila, as the city is situated partially on an ancient lake-bed that amplifies seismic activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abruzzo2000.com/abruzzo/laquila/laquila.htm |title=L'Aquila, prov. of L'Aquila, Abruzzo |publisher=Abruzzo2000.com |accessdate=April 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/1777/1/03%20d'addezio.pdf Earth-prints.org]</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1315, the city was struck by an earthquake which seriously damaged the [[Francis of Assisi|San Francesco]] Church.

Other earthquakes struck in 1452, then on November 26, 1461, and again in 1501 and 1646. On February 3, 1703 a major earthquake struck the town. More than 3.000 people died and almost all the churches collapsed; [[Rocca Calascio]], the highest fortress in Europe was also ruined by this event, yet the town survived. L'Aquila was then repopulated by decision of [[Pope Clement XI]]. The town was rocked by earthquake again in 1706. The most serious earthquake in the history of the town struck on July 31, 1786, when more than 6.000 people died.

[[World War II]] is a recurring theme in his work. He is a key figure of the generation of [[New European Painting|European figurative painters]] who gained renown at a time when many believed the medium had lost its relevance due to the [[Information Age|new digital age]]. \n\nMuch of Tuymans\u2019 work deals with moral complexity, specifically the coexistence of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nina|first=Siegal|title=Luc Tuymans, Master of Moral Complexities, Tries Something New|journal=|date=21 March 2019 | publisher=The New York Times | location=New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610015254/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | archivedate=10 June 2019 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> His subjects range from major historical events such as [[the Holocaust]] to the seemingly inconsequential or banal: wallpaper, Christmas decorations or everyday objects for example. \n\nThe artist's sparsely-coloured [[Figurative painting|figurative paintings]] are made up of quick brush strokes of wet paint. Tuymans paints from [[Photographic image|photographic]] or [[Cinematography|cinematic]] images drawn from the media or [[public sphere]], as well as from his own [[Photograph|photographs]] and [[Drawing|drawings]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans:  Forever, The Management of Magic | date=14 February \u2013 22 March 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301030757/http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | archivedate=1 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Roger | first1 = White | title = The contemporaries travels in the 21st-century art world | publisher=Bloomsbury | series = | volume = 1 | edition = | location = New York | date = 2016 | page = 173 | isbn = 9781620400951 | OCLC = 1124364481}}</ref> They often appear intentionally [[out of focus]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/226/ | title=Luc Tuymans: Corporate. 6 November\u201321 December 2010 | date = | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans: Forever, The Management of Magic. 14 February\u201322 March 2008 | date = 29 January 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Roger | first1 = White | title = The contemporaries travels in the 21st-century art world | publisher=Bloomsbury | series = | volume = 1 | edition = | location = New York | date = 2016 | page = 173 | isbn = 9781620400951 | OCLC = 1124364481}}</ref> The blurred effect is, however, created purposefully with painted strokes, it is not the result of a \u2018wiping away\u2019 technique.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Why-paintings-succeed-where-words-fail/19286 | title=Why paintings succeed where words fail | last = Harris | first = Gareth | date=9 September 2009 | publisher=The Art Newspaper | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nFormal and conceptual oppositions recur in his work, which is echoed in his remark that while \u2018sickness should appear in the way the painting is made\u2019 there is also pleasure in its making \u2013 a \u2018caressing\u2019 of the canvas.

The painting ''Gaskamer'' (''Gas Chamber'') exemplifies his use of titles to provoke associations in the mind of the viewer. Meaning, in his work, is never fixed; his paintings incite thought. A related characteristic of Tuymans' work is the way he often works in series, a method which enables one image to generate another through which images can be formulated and reformulated ad infinitum. Images are repeatedly analysed and distilled, and a large number of drawings, photocopies and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] are produced in preparation for his oil paintings.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | title=Exhibitions - The Rumour, 5 September \u2014 13 October 2001 | date=1 March 2020 | publisher=White Cube | location=London | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301113132/https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | archivedate=1 March 2020 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Tate2004/> Each final painting is, however, completed in a single day.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Mullins | first1 = Charlotte | title = Painting People: Figure Painting Today | publisher=D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers | series = | volume = | edition = | location = New York | date = 2008 | page = 150 | isbn = 9781933045832 | OCLC = 216938984}}</ref>  \n\n==Early Life==\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Antichambre 1985 Collection M HKA - Collection of the Flemish Community.jpg|thumb|270px|<small>Luc Tuymans, ''Antichambre'', 1985<br>Oil on canvas, 69.9 \u00d7 80.1 cm, 271\u20442 \u00d7 319\u204416 inches, Collection [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp|M HKA Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp]] - Collection of the Flemish Community</small>|alt=]]\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Body 1990 Collection S.M.A.K.

Sketches, [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and other small-scale works form the bedrock of his work for they constitute, for him, a way of thinking through an idea. Important features of Tuymans' artistic approach can be found in these preparatory pieces such as his voluntary choice of low-quality materials and his incorporation of found elements. Such works are both visual preparations for later paintings and exteriorisations of thought processes. As Tuymans said in an interview with Josef Helfenstein in 1997: \u2018drawing is particularly important because I become mentally involved in the work and the picture. What is important for me is the idea of thinking while I draw, particularly in the tiny drawings.

Each drawing is more than a visual record: it forms part of a wider reflective process.

Unlike the permanent mural paintings, Tuymans other mural paintings are temporary events and installations created for exhibitions. The type of mural techniques used is either acrylic paint or fresco applied directly on the existing wall surfaces. On rare occasions, he also made textile murals, which are based on drawings that are scanned and mechanically produced. As he said in a video interview he gave about the triptych mural painting ''S. Croce'' (2010), they are always related to the 'raw space' and 'it is the element of approach which is important with murals', he also mentioned that 'If I work on a wall I feel much more free than on a canvas.' \n\nThe first permanent mural was created in 1995 in Antwerp at Caf\u00e9 Alberto. It features a larger version of the painting ''Superstition''.<ref name=Volume22018>Meyer-Hermann, Eva.

[[World War II]] is a recurring theme in his work. He is a key figure of the generation of [[New European Painting|European figurative painters]] who gained renown at a time when many believed the medium had lost its relevance due to the [[Information Age|new digital age]]. \n\nMuch of Tuymans\u2019 work deals with moral complexity, specifically the coexistence of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nina|first=Siegal|title=Luc Tuymans, Master of Moral Complexities, Tries Something New|journal=|date=21 March 2019 | publisher=The New York Times | location=New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610015254/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | archivedate=10 June 2019 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> His subjects range from major historical events such as [[the Holocaust]] to the seemingly inconsequential or banal: wallpaper, Christmas decorations or everyday objects for example. \n\nThe artist's sparsely-coloured [[Figurative painting|figurative paintings]] are made up of quick brush strokes of wet paint. Tuymans paints from [[Photographic image|photographic]] or [[Cinematography|cinematic]] images drawn from the media or [[public sphere]], as well as from his own [[Photograph|photographs]] and [[Drawing|drawings]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans:  Forever, The Management of Magic | date=14 February \u2013 22 March 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301030757/http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | archivedate=1 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Roger | first1 = White | title = The contemporaries travels in the 21st-century art world | publisher=Bloomsbury | series = | volume = 1 | edition = | location = New York | date = 2016 | page = 173 | isbn = 9781620400951 | OCLC = 1124364481}}</ref> They often appear intentionally [[out of focus]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/226/ | title=Luc Tuymans: Corporate. 6 November\u201321 December 2010 | date = | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans: Forever, The Management of Magic. 14 February\u201322 March 2008 | date = 29 January 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Roger | first1 = White | title = The contemporaries travels in the 21st-century art world | publisher=Bloomsbury | series = | volume = 1 | edition = | location = New York | date = 2016 | page = 173 | isbn = 9781620400951 | OCLC = 1124364481}}</ref> The blurred effect is, however, created purposefully with painted strokes, it is not the result of a \u2018wiping away\u2019 technique.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Why-paintings-succeed-where-words-fail/19286 | title=Why paintings succeed where words fail | last = Harris | first = Gareth | date=9 September 2009 | publisher=The Art Newspaper | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nFormal and conceptual oppositions recur in his work, which is echoed in his remark that while \u2018sickness should appear in the way the painting is made\u2019 there is also pleasure in its making \u2013 a \u2018caressing\u2019 of the canvas.

The painting ''Gaskamer'' (''Gas Chamber'') exemplifies his use of titles to provoke associations in the mind of the viewer. Meaning, in his work, is never fixed; his paintings incite thought. A related characteristic of Tuymans' work is the way he often works in series, a method which enables one image to generate another through which images can be formulated and reformulated ad infinitum. Images are repeatedly analysed and distilled, and a large number of drawings, photocopies and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] are produced in preparation for his oil paintings.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | title=Exhibitions - The Rumour, 5 September \u2014 13 October 2001 | date=1 March 2020 | publisher=White Cube | location=London | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301113132/https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | archivedate=1 March 2020 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Tate2004/> Each final painting is, however, completed in a single day.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Mullins | first1 = Charlotte | title = Painting People: Figure Painting Today | publisher=D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers | series = | volume = | edition = | location = New York | date = 2008 | page = 150 | isbn = 9781933045832 | OCLC = 216938984}}</ref>  \n\n==Early Life==\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Antichambre 1985 Collection M HKA - Collection of the Flemish Community.jpg|thumb|270px|<small>Luc Tuymans, ''Antichambre'', 1985<br>Oil on canvas, 69.9 \u00d7 80.1 cm, 271\u20442 \u00d7 319\u204416 inches, Collection [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp|M HKA Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp]] - Collection of the Flemish Community</small>|alt=]]\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Body 1990 Collection S.M.A.K.

The following year, they published the project in the ''Tijdschrift voor levende Volkskunst'' (''Journal of Living Folk Art''), as a journal modelled on the historical ''Volksfoto'' magazine.

This project involved interpreting the town\u2019s history through artworks which were spread across over twenty locations.

In 1940, the building was part of the Otwock ghetto, and in 1942, during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi occupation of Poland]], its inhabitants either died of starvation, were shot, or were sent to the [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka concentration camp]].<ref>afterall.org, May 8, 2014.</ref> \n\nAt the retrospective exhibition entitled ''Intolerance'' staged by [[Qatar Museums Authority|QM Gallery Al Riwaq]] in Doha in 2016, Tuymans presented a new body of work entitled ''The Arena I\u2013VI''.

Important features of Tuymans' artistic approach can be found in these preparatory pieces such as his voluntary choice of low-quality materials and his incorporation of found elements. Such works are both visual preparations for later paintings and exteriorisations of thought processes. As Tuymans said in an interview with Josef Helfenstein in 1997: \u2018drawing is particularly important because I become mentally involved in the work and the picture.

On rare occasions, he also made textile murals, which are based on drawings that are scanned and mechanically produced. As he said in a video interview he gave about the triptych mural painting ''S. Croce'' (2010), they are always related to the 'raw space' and 'it is the element of approach which is important with murals', he also mentioned that 'If I work on a wall I feel much more free than on a canvas.' \n\nThe first permanent mural was created in 1995 in Antwerp at Caf\u00e9 Alberto.

{"title_page": "List of DOS commands", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nThis article presents a list of commands used by [[DOS]] [[operating system]]s, especially as used on [[x86]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s (PCs). [[List of DOS operating systems#Other operating systems|Other DOS operating systems]] are not part of the scope of this list.\n\nIn DOS, many standard [[system command]]s were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, a text-mode command prompt window, [[cmd.exe]], can still be used.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Command processing==\nThe command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal \u2014 built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or [[batch file]] on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.\n\nExternal commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command [[path (variable)|path]] set in the command interpreter.\n\nIn the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a ''<kbd>[[filespec]]</kbd>'' (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a ''<kbd>filename</kbd>'' parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a \"/\" or a \"-\" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.\n\nThe command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.\n\nMany commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.\n\n==DOS commands==\nA partial list of the most common commands for [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]] follows below.\n\n===APPEND===\nSets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. \nThe APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, . EXE, or .BAT file name extension).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\">{{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=Running MS-DOS Version 6.22 (20th Anniversary Edition), 6th Revised edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=0-7356-1812-7}}</ref>\n\n===ASSIGN===\n{{Further|Drive letter assignment}}\nThe command redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. It can also display drive assignments or reset all drive letters to their original assignments.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 2 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ATTRIB===\n{{Main|ATTRIB}}\nAttrib changes or views the attributes of one or more files. It defaults to display the attributes of all files in the current directory. The file attributes available include read-only, archive, system, and hidden attributes. The command has the capability to process whole folders and subfolders of files and also process all files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BACKUP and RESTORE===\nThese are commands to [[backup]] and restore files from an external disk. These appeared in version 2, and continued to [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 5 and MS-DOS 6 (PC DOS 7 had a deversioned check). In DOS 6, these were replaced by commercial programs (CPBACKUP, MSBACKUP), which allowed files to be restored to different locations.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BASIC and BASICA===\n{{Main|IBM BASIC}}\n\nAn implementation of the [[BASIC]] programming language for PCs. Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.\n\n[[IBM]] computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM's versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area.  BASICA last appeared in [[IBM PC DOS]] 5.02, and in [[OS/2]] (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.\n\nMicrosoft released [[GW-BASIC]] for machines with no ROM-BASIC.  Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.\n\nBASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02.  OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.\n\n===BREAK===\nThis command is used to instruct DOS to check whether the {{Keypress|Ctrl}} and {{Keypress|Break}} keys have been pressed before carrying out a program request.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CALL===\n{{See also|start (command)}}\nStarts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CD and CHDIR===\n{{Main|cd (command)}}\n\nThe CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working [[directory (file systems)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHCP===\nThe command either displays or changes the active [[Windows code page|code page]] used to display [[glyph|character glyphs]] in a [[Win32 console|console window]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHKDSK===\n{{Main|CHKDSK}}\n\nCHKDSK verifies a storage [[volume]] (for example, a [[hard disk]], [[Disk partitioning|disk partition]] or [[floppy disk]]) for file system integrity. The command has the ability to fix errors on a volume and recover information from defective [[disk sector]]s of a volume.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHOICE===\n{{Main|choice (command)}}\n\nThe CHOICE command is used in batch files to prompt the user to select one item from a set of single-character ''choices''.

Earlier versions of [[DR DOS]] supported this function with the built-in ''switch'' command (for numeric choices) or by beginning a command with a question mark.<ref name=\"drdos7ch7\" /> This command was formerly called ync (yes-no-cancel).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===CLS===\n{{Main|cls (command)}}\n\nThe CLS or CLRSCR command clears the [[Computer terminal|terminal screen]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMMAND===\n{{Main|COMMAND.COM}}\n\nStart a new instance of the command interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMP===\n{{Main|comp (command)}}\n\nShow differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 1 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COPY===\n{{Main|copy (command)}}\n\nMakes copies of existing files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CTTY===\nDefines the [[Computer terminal|terminal]] device (for example, COM1) to use for input and output.<ref> Does not automatically appear in Help </ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n\n===DATE===\nDisplays the [[system date]] and prompts the user to enter a new date.

Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. Since the RD (RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty, the DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory.\n\nThe <code>deltree</code> command is included in certain versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s.  It is specifically available only in versions of [[MS-DOS]] 6.0 and higher,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> and in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command ''rd'' or ''rmdir'' which has slightly different syntax. This command has been deprecated for Windows 7.\n\n===DIR===\n{{Main|dir (command)}}\n\nThe DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk's volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk. The command is one of the few commands that exist from the first versions of DOS.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> The command can display files in subdirectories. The resulting directory listing can be sorted by various criteria and filenames can be displayed in a chosen format.\n\n===DISKCOMP===\n{{Main|diskcomp}}\n\nA command for comparing the complete contents of a [[floppy disk]] to another one.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DISKCOPY===\n{{Main|diskcopy}}\n\nA command for copying the complete contents of a diskette to another diskette.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DOSKEY===\n{{Main|DOSKEY}}\n\nA command that adds [[command history]], [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] functionality, and improved editing features to the command-line interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DRVSPACE===\n{{Main|DriveSpace}}\n\nA [[disk compression]] utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.22.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ECHO===\n{{Main|echo (command)}}\n\nThe ECHO command prints its own arguments back out to the DOS equivalent of the [[Standard streams|standard output stream.]] (Hence the name, ECHO) Usually, this means directly to the screen, but the output of ''echo'' can be redirected, like any other command, to files or devices. Often used in [[batch file]]s to print text out to the user.\n\nAnother important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the <code>@echo off</code> statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a \"tidier\" output (the <code>@</code> symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EDIT===\n{{Main|MS-DOS Editor}}\n\nEDIT is a full-screen [[text editor]], included with MS-DOS versions 5 and 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and Windows 2000 and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the [[E (PC DOS)|DOS ''E'' Editor]] and DR-DOS used ''editor'' up to version 7.\n\n===EDLIN===\n{{Main|Edlin}}\n\nDOS line-editor.  It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today.  The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1-4 created an after-market for third-party editors.\n\nIn DOS 5, an extra command \"?\" was added to give the user much-needed help.\n\nDOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it's on the supplemental disks,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install. Windows NT 32-bit, and OS/2 have Edlin.\n\n===EMM386===\n{{Main|EMM386}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe EMM386 command enables or disables EMM386 expanded-memory support on a computer with an [[80386]] or higher processor. \n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== ERASE ===\nSee: [[List of DOS commands#DEL and ERASE|DEL and ERASE]]\n\n===EXE2BIN===\n{{Main|exe2bin}}\n\nConverts an [[executable]] ([[.exe]]) file into a [[binary file]] with the [[filename extension|extension]] [[COM file|.com]], which is a memory image of the program.\n\nThe size of the resident [[Code segment|code]] and [[Data segment|data sections]] combined in the input .exe file must be less than 64 KB.

Is is included on the MS-DOS 6 Supplemental Disk.<ref>https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/097/Q97835/</ref><ref>https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/117/Q117600/</ref>\nAccessDOS assists persons with disabilities.\n\n===FASTHELP===\n{{See also|help (command)}}\n\nProvides information for MS-DOS commands.\n\n===FASTOPEN===\n{{Main|FASTOPEN}}\n\nA command that provides accelerated access to frequently-used [[File system|files and directories]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FC===\n{{Main|File Compare}}\n\nShow differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later \u2013 primarily non-IBM releases.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FDISK===\n{{Main|fdisk}}\n\nThe FDISK command manipulates hard disk [[partition table]]s. The name derives from IBM's habit of calling hard drives ''fixed disks''. FDISK has the ability to display information about, create, and delete DOS partitions or [[Disk partitioning|logical DOS drive]]. It can also install a standard [[master boot record]] on the hard drive.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FIND===\n{{Main|Find (Windows)}}\n\nThe FIND command is a [[Filter (software)|filter]] to find lines in the input [[data stream]] that contain or don't contain a specified [[String (computer science)|string]] and send these to the output data stream. It may also be used as a [[Pipeline (software)|pipe]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FINDSTR===\nThe FINDSTR command is a GREP-oriented ''FIND''-like utility. Among its uses is the logical-OR lacking in FIND.\n:FINDSTR \"YES NO MAYBE\" *.txt\n::would find all files with one or more of the above-listed words YES, NO, MAYBE.\n\n===FOR===\n{{Main|For loop}}\n\nIteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.\nThe FOR loop can be used to [[parse]] a file or the output of a command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FORMAT===\n{{Main|format (command)}}\n\nDeletes the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] entries and the [[root directory]] of the drive/partition, and reformats it for MS-DOS.

It is an internal command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 4 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== MEMMAKER ===\nStarting with version 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> MS-DOS included the external program MemMaker which was used to free system memory (especially [[Conventional memory]]) by automatically reconfiguring the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] and [[CONFIG.SYS]] files. This was usually done by moving [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR programs]] and [[device driver]]s to the [[Upper memory area|upper memory]]. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether to enable [[Expanded memory|EMS Memory]], since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver. MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Using MS-DOS 6.22 | first = Jim | last = Cooper | publisher = [[Que Publishing]] | page = 455 |  isbn = 0789725738 | date = May 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u7oN-5y7nGsC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=configuring+memory+with+memmaker+cooper#v=onepage&q=configuring%20memory%20with%20memmaker%20cooper&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by [[Helix Software Company]] and were eliminated starting in [[MS-DOS 7]] ([[Windows 95]]); however, they could be obtained from Microsoft's FTP server as part of the OLDDOS.EXE package, alongside other tools. \n\nPC DOS uses another program called RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS's [[HIMEM]]/[[EMM386]] or a third-party memory manager.

From at least Windows 2000, the <code>set</code> command allows for the evaluation of strings into variables, thus providing ''inter alia'' a means of performing integer arithmetic.<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Karp\n| first      = David Aaron\n| author2    = [[Tim O'Reilly]]\n| author3    = Troy Mott\n| title      = Windows XP in a nutshell\n| url        = https://archive.org/details/windowsxpinnutsh00karp\n| url-access = registration\n| accessdate = 2010-11-26\n| edition    = 2\n| series     = Nutshell handbook\n| year       = 2005\n| publisher  = [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]\n| isbn       = 978-0-596-00900-7\n| page       = [https://archive.org/details/windowsxpinnutsh00karp/page/422 422]\n}}</ref>\n\n=== SETUP ===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\nThis command does a computer setup. With all computers running DOS versions 5 and\nlater, it runs the computer setup, such as Windows 95 setup and Windows 98 setup.\n\n=== SETVER ===\n{{See also|ver (command)}}\n\nSetVer is a [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program designed to return a different value to the version of DOS that is running.  This allows programs that look for a specific version of DOS to run under a different DOS.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SHARE ===\n{{Main|share (command)}}\n\nInstalls support for file sharing and locking capabilities.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SHIFT ===\nThe SHIFT command increases number of [[replaceable parameter]]s to more than the standard ten for use in [[batch file]]s.\nThis is done by changing the position of replaceable parameters. It replaces each of the replacement parameters with the subsequent one (e.g. {{codett|%0}} with {{codett|%1}}, {{codett|%1}} with {{codett|%2}}, etc.).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SIZER ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe external command SIZER.EXE is not intended to be started directly from the command prompt. Is used by [[MemMaker]] during the memory-optimization process.\n\n=== SMARTDRV ===\n{{Main|SmartDrive}}\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SORT ===\nA [[Filter (software)|filter]] to sort lines in the input data stream and send them to the output data stream. Similar to the Unix command <code>[[Sort (Unix)|sort]]</code>. Handles files up to 64k. This sort is always case insensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722869.aspx|title=Microsoft on \"sort\"|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SUBST ===\n{{Main|SUBST}}\n\nA utility to map a subdirectory to a drive letter.<ref name=\"murdock\" /> The opposite can be achieved via the [[#JOIN|JOIN]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SYS ===\n{{Main|SYS (command)}}\n\nA utility to make a volume bootable.  Sys rewrites the Volume Boot Code (the first sector of the partition that SYS is acting on) so that the code, when executed, will look for [[IO.SYS]].  SYS also copies the core DOS system files, IO.SYS, [[MSDOS.SYS]], and [[COMMAND.COM]], to the volume.  SYS does ''not'' rewrite the Master Boot Record, contrary to widely held belief.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== TELNET ===\nThe Telnet Client is a tool for developers and administrators to help manage and test network connectivity. <ref> Client must be activated from Admin </ref>\n\n=== TIME ===\n{{Main|TIME (command)}}\n\nDisplay the [[system time]] and waits for the user to enter a new time.  Complements the [[#DATE|DATE]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== TITLE===\n{{Main|title (command)}}\nEnables a user to change the title of their MS-DOS window.\n\n=== TREE ===\n{{Main|tree (command)}}\nIt is an external command, graphically displays the path of each directory and sub-directories on the specified drive.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== TRUENAME ===\nThe TRUENAME command will expand the name of a file, directory, or drive, and display the result. It will expand an abbreviated form which the command processor can recognise into its full form. It can see through <kbd>SUBST</kbd> and <kbd>JOIN</kbd> to find the actual directory.\n\nMS-DOS can find files and directories given their names, without full path information, if the search object is on a path specified by the environment variable [[PATH (environment variable)|PATH]]. For example, if <kbd>PATH</kbd> includes <kbd>C:\\PROGRAMS</kbd>, and file <kbd>MYPROG.EXE</kbd> is on this directory, then if <code>MYPROG</code> is typed at the command prompt, the command processor will execute <code>C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE</code>. In this case,\n\n TRUENAME MYPROG\n\nwould display\n\n C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE\n\nThis command displays the [[UNC path]]names of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch \"<kbd>/?</kbd>\" defines it as a \"Reserved command name\". It is available in MS-DOS 5.00.0. This command is similar to the [[which (command)|which]] command, which, given an executable found in $PATH, would give a full path and name. The C library function <code>realpath</code> performs this function. The Microsoft Windows command processors do not support this command.\n<real code.st>\n\n=== TYPE ===\n{{Main|TYPE (DOS command)}}\n\nDisplays a file. The <kbd>[[List of DOS commands#MORE|more]]</kbd> command is frequently used in conjunction with this command, e.g. <kbd>type ''long-text-file'' | more</kbd>. TYPE can be used to concatenate files (type file1 file2 > file3); however this won't work for large files{{dubious|date=November 2014}}{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\u2014use copy command instead.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== UNDELETE ===\n{{Main|Undeletion}}\n\nRestores file previously deleted with <kbd>del</kbd>. By default all recoverable files in the working directory are restored; options are used to change this behavior. If the MS-DOS <kbd>mirror</kbd> [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program is used, then deletion tracking files are created and can be used by <kbd>undelete</kbd>.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== UNFORMAT ===\n{{See also|format (command)}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe UNFORMAT command is used to undo the effects of formatting a disk.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VER ===\n{{Main|ver (command)}}\n\nAn internal DOS command, that reports the DOS version presently running, and since MS-DOS 5, whether DOS is loaded high.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VERIFY ===\nEnables or disables the feature to determine if files have been correctly written to disk. If no parameter is provided, the command will display the current setting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~murdock/verify.html|title=DOS Command: VERIFY|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VOL ===\n{{Main|vol (command)}}\n\nAn internal command that displays the disk volume label and serial number.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VSAFE ===\n{{Main|MSAV}}\n\nA [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program that continuously monitors the computer for viruses.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== XCOPY ===\n{{Main|XCOPY}}\n\nCopy entire directory trees. Xcopy is a version of the copy command that can move files and directories from one location to another.\n\nXCOPY usage and attributes can be obtained by typing \"XCOPY /?\" in the DOS Command line.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> \n\n== See also ==\n* [[:Category:Windows commands]]\n* [[Command-line interface]]\n* [[List of CONFIG.SYS directives]]\n* [[Timeline of DOS operating systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite book|author-last=Cooper|author-first=Jim|title=Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition|date=2001|publisher=[[Que Publishing]]|isbn=978-0789725738}}\n* {{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=MS-DOS Commands: Microsoft Quick Reference, 4th Revised edition|date=1990|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-1556152894}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikibooks|Guide to Windows Commands}}\n*[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands Command-Line Reference]  : Microsoft TechNet Database \"Command-Line Reference\"\n*[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749839.aspx The MS-DOS 6 Technical Reference on TechNet] contains the official Microsoft MS-DOS 6 command reference documention.\n*[http://www.drdos.com/dosdoc/ DR-DOS 7.03 online manual]\n*[http://www.mdgx.com/secrets.htm MDGx MS-DOS Undocumented + Hidden Secrets]\n\nThere are several guides to DOS commands available that are licensed under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]:\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130612114615/http://fd-doc.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php The FreeDOS Spec] at SourceForge is a [[plaintext]] specification, written in 1999, for how DOS commands should work in FreeDOS\n*[http://www.computerhope.com/msdos.htm MS-DOS commands]\n*[http://www.windows-commandline.com/windows-cmd-commands-reference/ Reference for windows commands with examples]\n*[http://www.textfiles.com/hacking/MICROSOFT/dosundoc.txt A Collection of Undocumented and Obscure Features in Various MS-DOS Versions]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Dos Commands}}\n[[Category:DOS commands]]\n[[Category:Microsoft lists|DOS commands]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nThis article presents a list of commands used by [[DOS]] [[operating system]]s, especially as used on [[x86]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s (PCs). [[List of DOS operating systems#Other operating systems|Other DOS operating systems]] are not part of the scope of this list.\n\nIn DOS, many standard [[system command]]s were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, a text-mode command prompt window, [[cmd.exe]], can still be used.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Command processing==\nThe command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal \u2014 built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or [[batch file]] on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.\n\nExternal commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command [[path (variable)|path]] set in the command interpreter.\n\nIn the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a ''<kbd>[[filespec]]</kbd>'' (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a ''<kbd>filename</kbd>'' parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a \"/\" or a \"-\" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.\n\nThe command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.\n\nMany commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.\n\n==DOS commands==\nA partial list of the most common commands for [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]] follows below.\n\n===APPEND===\nSets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. \nThe APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, . EXE, or .BAT file name extension).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\">{{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=Running MS-DOS Version 6.22 (20th Anniversary Edition), 6th Revised edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=0-7356-1812-7}}</ref>\n\n===ASSIGN===\n{{Further|Drive letter assignment}}\nThe command redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. It can also display drive assignments or reset all drive letters to their original assignments.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 2 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ATTRIB===\n{{Main|ATTRIB}}\nAttrib changes or views the attributes of one or more files. It defaults to display the attributes of all files in the current directory. The file attributes available include read-only, archive, system, and hidden attributes. The command has the capability to process whole folders and subfolders of files and also process all files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BACKUP and RESTORE===\nThese are commands to [[backup]] and restore files from an external disk. These appeared in version 2, and continued to [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 5 and MS-DOS 6 (PC DOS 7 had a deversioned check). In DOS 6, these were replaced by commercial programs (CPBACKUP, MSBACKUP), which allowed files to be restored to different locations.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BASIC and BASICA===\n{{Main|IBM BASIC}}\n\nAn implementation of the [[BASIC]] programming language for PCs. Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.\n\n[[IBM]] computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM's versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area.  BASICA last appeared in [[IBM PC DOS]] 5.02, and in [[OS/2]] (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.\n\nMicrosoft released [[GW-BASIC]] for machines with no ROM-BASIC.  Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.\n\nBASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02.  OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.\n\n===BREAK===\nThis command is used to instruct DOS to check whether the {{Keypress|Ctrl}} and {{Keypress|Break}} keys have been pressed before carrying out a program request.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CALL===\n{{See also|start (command)}}\nStarts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CD and CHDIR===\n{{Main|cd (command)}}\n\nThe CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working [[directory (file systems)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHCP===\nThe command either displays or changes the active [[Windows code page|code page]] used to display [[glyph|character glyphs]] in a [[Win32 console|console window]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHKDSK===\n{{Main|CHKDSK}}\n\nCHKDSK verifies a storage [[volume]] (for example, a [[hard disk]], [[Disk partitioning|disk partition]] or [[floppy disk]]) for file system integrity. The command has the ability to fix errors on a volume and recover information from defective [[disk sector]]s of a volume.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHOICE===\n{{Main|choice (command)}}\n\nThe CHOICE command is used in batch files to prompt the user to select one item from a set of single-character ''choices''. Choice was introduced as an external command with MS-DOS 6.0;<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhope.com/choicehl.htm|title=MS-DOS choice command help|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> [[Novell DOS]] 7<ref name=\"drdos7ch7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drdos.com/dosdoc/usergeng/07ugch7.htm|title=Caldera DR-DOS 7.03 User Guide|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> and PC DOS 7.0. Earlier versions of [[DR DOS]] supported this function with the built-in ''switch'' command (for numeric choices) or by beginning a command with a question mark.<ref name=\"drdos7ch7\" /> This command was formerly called ync (yes-no-cancel).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===CLS===\n{{Main|cls (command)}}\n\nThe CLS or CLRSCR command clears the [[Computer terminal|terminal screen]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMMAND===\n{{Main|COMMAND.COM}}\n\nStart a new instance of the command interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMP===\n{{Main|comp (command)}}\n\nShow differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 1 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COPY===\n{{Main|copy (command)}}\n\nMakes copies of existing files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CTTY===\nDefines the [[Computer terminal|terminal]] device (for example, COM1) to use for input and output.<ref> Does not automatically appear in Help </ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n\n===DATE===\nDisplays the [[system date]] and prompts the user to enter a new date. Complements the [[#TIME|TIME]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DBLBOOT===\n(Not a command: This is a batch file added to DOS 6.X Supplemental Disks to help create DoubleSpace boot floppies - see https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/100/Q100021/)\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n===DBLSPACE===\n{{Main|DriveSpace}}\n\nA [[disk compression]] utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.0 (released in 1993) and version 6.2.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DEBUG===\n{{Main|debug (command)}}\n\nA very primitive assembler and disassambler.\n\n===DEFRAG===\n{{Main|Microsoft Drive Optimizer}}\n\nThe command has the ability to analyze the file fragmentation on a disk drive or to [[Defragmentation|defragment]] a drive. This command is called DEFRAG in MS-DOS/PC DOS and <kbd>diskopt</kbd> in [[DR-DOS]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DEL and ERASE===\n{{Main|del (command)}}\n\nDEL (or the alternative form ERASE) is used to delete one or more files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DELTREE===\n{{Main|DELTREE}}\n\nDeletes a directory along with all of the files and subdirectories that it contains. Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. Since the RD (RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty, the DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory.\n\nThe <code>deltree</code> command is included in certain versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s.  It is specifically available only in versions of [[MS-DOS]] 6.0 and higher,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> and in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command ''rd'' or ''rmdir'' which has slightly different syntax. This command has been deprecated for Windows 7.\n\n===DIR===\n{{Main|dir (command)}}\n\nThe DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk's volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk. The command is one of the few commands that exist from the first versions of DOS.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> The command can display files in subdirectories. The resulting directory listing can be sorted by various criteria and filenames can be displayed in a chosen format.\n\n===DISKCOMP===\n{{Main|diskcomp}}\n\nA command for comparing the complete contents of a [[floppy disk]] to another one.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DISKCOPY===\n{{Main|diskcopy}}\n\nA command for copying the complete contents of a diskette to another diskette.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DOSKEY===\n{{Main|DOSKEY}}\n\nA command that adds [[command history]], [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] functionality, and improved editing features to the command-line interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DRVSPACE===\n{{Main|DriveSpace}}\n\nA [[disk compression]] utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.22.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ECHO===\n{{Main|echo (command)}}\n\nThe ECHO command prints its own arguments back out to the DOS equivalent of the [[Standard streams|standard output stream.]] (Hence the name, ECHO) Usually, this means directly to the screen, but the output of ''echo'' can be redirected, like any other command, to files or devices. Often used in [[batch file]]s to print text out to the user.\n\nAnother important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the <code>@echo off</code> statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a \"tidier\" output (the <code>@</code> symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EDIT===\n{{Main|MS-DOS Editor}}\n\nEDIT is a full-screen [[text editor]], included with MS-DOS versions 5 and 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and Windows 2000 and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the [[E (PC DOS)|DOS ''E'' Editor]] and DR-DOS used ''editor'' up to version 7.\n\n===EDLIN===\n{{Main|Edlin}}\n\nDOS line-editor.  It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today.  The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1-4 created an after-market for third-party editors.\n\nIn DOS 5, an extra command \"?\" was added to give the user much-needed help.\n\nDOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it's on the supplemental disks,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install. Windows NT 32-bit, and OS/2 have Edlin.\n\n===EMM386===\n{{Main|EMM386}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe EMM386 command enables or disables EMM386 expanded-memory support on a computer with an [[80386]] or higher processor. \n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== ERASE ===\nSee: [[List of DOS commands#DEL and ERASE|DEL and ERASE]]\n\n===EXE2BIN===\n{{Main|exe2bin}}\n\nConverts an [[executable]] ([[.exe]]) file into a [[binary file]] with the [[filename extension|extension]] [[COM file|.com]], which is a memory image of the program.\n\nThe size of the resident [[Code segment|code]] and [[Data segment|data sections]] combined in the input .exe file must be less than 64 KB. The file must also have no [[Call stack|stack segment]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 through 5. It is available separately for version 6 on the Supplemental Disk.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EXIT===\n{{Main|exit (command)}}\n\nExits the current command processor.  If the exit is used at the primary command, it has no effect unless in a DOS window under Microsoft Windows, in which case the window is closed and the user returns to the desktop.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EXPAND===\nThe Microsoft File Expansion Utility is used to uncompress one or more compressed [[cabinet (file format)|cabinet files]] (.CAB). The command dates back to 1990 and was supplied on floppy disc for MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref>https://ss64.com/nt/expand.html</ref><ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FAKEMOUS===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n===FASTHELP===\n{{See also|help (command)}}\n\nProvides information for MS-DOS commands.\n\n===FASTOPEN===\n{{Main|FASTOPEN}}\n\nA command that provides accelerated access to frequently-used [[File system|files and directories]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FC===\n{{Main|File Compare}}\n\nShow differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later \u2013 primarily non-IBM releases.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FDISK===\n{{Main|fdisk}}\n\nThe FDISK command manipulates hard disk [[partition table]]s. The name derives from IBM's habit of calling hard drives ''fixed disks''. FDISK has the ability to display information about, create, and delete DOS partitions or [[Disk partitioning|logical DOS drive]].

This was usually done by moving [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR programs]] and [[device driver]]s to the [[Upper memory area|upper memory]]. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether to enable [[Expanded memory|EMS Memory]], since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver. MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Using MS-DOS 6.22 | first = Jim | last = Cooper | publisher = [[Que Publishing]] | page = 455 |  isbn = 0789725738 | date = May 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u7oN-5y7nGsC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=configuring+memory+with+memmaker+cooper#v=onepage&q=configuring%20memory%20with%20memmaker%20cooper&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by [[Helix Software Company]] and were eliminated starting in [[MS-DOS 7]] ([[Windows 95]]); however, they could be obtained from Microsoft's FTP server as part of the OLDDOS.EXE package, alongside other tools. \n\nPC DOS uses another program called RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS's [[HIMEM]]/[[EMM386]] or a third-party memory manager.

It will expand an abbreviated form which the command processor can recognise into its full form. It can see through <kbd>SUBST</kbd> and <kbd>JOIN</kbd> to find the actual directory.\n\nMS-DOS can find files and directories given their names, without full path information, if the search object is on a path specified by the environment variable [[PATH (environment variable)|PATH]]. For example, if <kbd>PATH</kbd> includes <kbd>C:\\PROGRAMS</kbd>, and file <kbd>MYPROG.EXE</kbd> is on this directory, then if <code>MYPROG</code> is typed at the command prompt, the command processor will execute <code>C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE</code>. In this case,\n\n TRUENAME MYPROG\n\nwould display\n\n C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE\n\nThis command displays the [[UNC path]]names of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch \"<kbd>/?</kbd>\" defines it as a \"Reserved command name\". It is available in MS-DOS 5.00.0. This command is similar to the [[which (command)|which]] command, which, given an executable found in $PATH, would give a full path and name. The C library function <code>realpath</code> performs this function.

Dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC., there was thought to be over 5,000 tombs, although the most recent estimate suggests a figure of just under 4,000. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the [[Anapo]] river with its tributary, the [[Calcinara]], about {{cvt|23|km}} northwest of Syracuse. Together with the city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.\n\n==Geography==\n'''Pantalica''' is located on a limestone promontory surrounded by a deep gorge formed by the [[Anapo]] and [[Calcinara]] rivers between the towns of [[Ferla]] and [[Sortino]] in south-eastern [[Sicily]]. In addition to its archaeological interest it is an important nature reserve (Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica), with a variety of local flora and fauna and natural caves (notably the Grotta dei Pipistrelli (Bat Cave)). Various pathways facilitate visitor access, including a disused railway track (dismantled in 1956) along the Anapo valley bottom. The promontory can be accessed directly by car from Ferla, or by walking down the old mule track from the parking place on the road from Sortino and crossing over the Calcinara stream.\n\n[[File:Pantalica1770.jpg|thumb|Square rock-cut tombs in Pantalica]]\n[[File:Pantalica1757.jpg|thumb|Tomb entrance in Pantalica]]\n\n==History==\nIn the 13th century BC, some Sicilian coastal settlements were abandoned, possibly due to the arrival of the [[Sicels]] on the island and the onset of more unsettled conditions. New large sites, like Pantalica, appeared in the hilly coastal hinterlands, probably chosen for defensive reasons.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nPantalica evidently flourished for about 600 years, from about 1250 to 650 BC. The current name of the site probably dates from the Early Middle Ages or Arab period. The ancient name of the site is uncertain, but is associated by some archeologists with Hybla, after a Sicel king named Hyblon, who is mentioned by [[Thucydides]] in connection with the foundation of the early Greek colony at [[Megara Hyblaea]] in the year 728 BC. For several centuries before Greek colonization, Pantalica was undoubtedly one of the main sites of eastern Sicily, dominating the surrounding territory, including subsidiary settlements. By about 650 BC, however, it seems to have been a victim of the expansion of the city of Syracuse, which established an outpost at [[Akrai]] (near Palazzolo Acreide) at this time. Nevertheless, it was still occupied during classical antiquity, since finds of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC (Hellenistic period) are attested, as well as during the late antique or Byzantine periods. After the 12th century it was probably largely deserted, and overshadowed by Sortino.\n\nThe remains visible today consist mainly of numerous prehistoric [[burial chamber]]s cut into the limestone rock, sometimes provided with a porch or short entrance corridor in front of the burial chamber, originally sealed with stones or a slab. There are also some larger rock-cut houses of uncertain date, often said to be Byzantine, but possibly of earlier origin. The so-called ''anaktoron'', or princely palace, located near the top of the hill, is also controversial. Thought by some archeologists originally to have been a Late Bronze Age building, inspired by palatial buildings of the Greek (Mycenaean) Bronze Age, it was more certainly occupied in the Byzantine period. The remains of a large ditch, cut into the limestone, are clearly visible at Filiporto on the western side of the promontory, nearest to Ferla. This probably dates to the 4th century BC, and represents a defensive work of Greek military design, possibly in line with a policy of Dionysius of Syracuse, designed to secure allied sites in the hinterland. There are also three small medieval rock-cut chapels known respectively as the ''Grotta del Crocifisso'' (near the North cemetery), the ''Grotta di San Nicolicchio'' (on the southern side), and the ''Grotta di San Micidario'' (at Filiporto), which preserve very faint traces of frescoes, and attest the presence of small monastic communities.\n\nThe site was mainly excavated between 1895 and 1910 by the Italian archeologist, [[Paolo Orsi]], although most of the tombs had already been looted long before his time. The finds excavated by Orsi are on display in the Archaeological Museum in Syracuse. They include characteristic red-burnished pottery vessels and metal objects, including weaponry (small knives and daggers) and items of dress, such as bronze [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae (brooches)]] and rings, which were placed with the deceased in the tombs. Most of the tombs contained between one and seven individuals of all ages and both sexes. Many tombs were evidently re-opened periodically for more burials. The average human life span at this time was probably around 30 years of age.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}} The size of the prehistoric population is hard to estimate from the available data, but might have been 1000 people or more.\n\n==Main monuments==\nPantalica has five cemeteries spread over a large area:\n* The '''necropolis of Filiporto''' consists of almost 1000 tombs, located on the southwestern side of the promontory (accessed by road from Ferla). In the same area are the remains of a defensive rock-cut ditch of later date (probably 4th century BC) traversing the promontory at its narrowest point.\n* The '''North West necropolis''' is one of the earliest (12th and 11th century BC), and is traversed by the tarmac road from Ferla.\n* The '''Cavetta necropolis''' has tombs and rock-cut houses of the prehistoric and later periods, and can be seen from the road and designated viewing platforms.\n* The '''North necropolis''' is a spectacular cemetery of about 1000 tombs covering very steep slopes overlooking the Calcinara river, best seen from the track coming from Sortino and from viewing platforms near the path. Remains of large rock-cut dwellings are on the gentler slopes to the east.\n* The '''South necropolis''' extends along the Anapo river for over 1 kilometre and is easily seen from the trackway at the bottom of the valley (a path leads down to it from the anaktoron). The old railway station, restored, has information about local fauna and flora.\n\nThe so-called '''Anaktoron''' (a Mycenaean princely palace) on the top of the hill is a multi-roomed building of large blocks, with various rectangular rooms, excavated in the 19th century by Paolo Orsi. Its origins are obscure (see above) but it was certainly used in the Byzantine period, as attested by roof tiles and pottery. Since no other prehistoric houses have been found on the hilltop, which is rather eroded, the location of the original prehistoric residential quarters remains uncertain. There may have been various clusters of habitation associated with each major burial zone.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* L. Bernabo Brea ''Sicily before the Greeks.'' (London: Thames and Hudson 1957).\n* R.

The film centers around Danny Quinn, a former \"street kid\" from [[South Boston]], returning home to find his family deeper into organized crime than when he left, and his struggles to not fall back into his previous life.\n\n==Plot==\nDanny Quinn ([[Donnie Wahlberg]]) is a former \"street kid\" from [[South Boston]], colloquially known as \"Southie,\" who returns home from New York City after three years away. He finds his mother ([[Anne Meara]]) overwhelmed with worry as her other three kids are caught up in the madness of the hardscrabble neighborhood in which drinking, sex, and fighting is the way of life. Danny tracks down his brothers only to find out they're deeply embedded in the [[Irish_Mob#Boston|Irish mob]] in Boston and in debt to local mobster Colie Powers ([[Lawrence Tierney]]). His younger sister Kathy ([[Rose McGowan]]), meanwhile, became a barfly in Danny's absence. \n\nDanny must get his hands on some quick cash in order to stop his brothers from getting their legs broken and his sister off the streets. In his pursuit to help his ailing mother and right his family's name on the streets of Southie, Danny tracks down his old girlfriend from the neighborhood, Marianne ([[Amanda Peet]]), finding that the love he left behind still remains. She tells how she heard about the gunfight he was in with Joey Ward ([[Jimmy Cummings]]) and wants to know if that's why he left town. Danny confesses that real reason he left town was that he needed to stop drinking if he were to become the man that she would want him to be. \n\nUnable to find legitimate work and banned from union jobs due to a scuffle at a wedding, Danny becomes desperate for money. Two of his old pals know Danny needs money and offer him an opportunity to be a partner in an underground [[gambling]] club, though, they neglect to tell Danny that their silent partner is his old nemesis, Joey Ward. It doesn't take long before Danny finds out and he and Joey are face to face. In Danny's absence from the neighborhood, Joey's father Butchie has declared war on Colie Powers and without knowing this Danny finds himself caught up in the middle of their war as it looks like he's in business with the Wards. The mob war eventually comes to Danny's front door, and the stress of an attempted murder in front of his house kills Danny's mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Danny Quinn\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Kathy Quinn\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Mrs. Quinn\n* [[Lawrence Tierney]] as Colie Powers\n* [[John Shea]] as Peter Binda\n* [[Jimmy Cummings]] as Joey Ward\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Whitey\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Marianne Silva\n* [[Jere Shea]] as Martin Powers\n* Josh Marchette as Will Casey\n\n==Production==\n''Southie'' was originally written as \"Brass Ring\" by two young screenwriters from Boston, [[Jimmy Cummings]] and Dave McLaughlin. Cummings was born in Southie and left Boston with the hopes of becoming an actor. After several years of studying with actor [[George Loros]], Cummings began to produce stage plays from the money he made as the doorman at the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. Cummings returned to Boston in 1993 and after an attempted armed robbery, one of his friends told him \"...that was like a scene out of a movie...\" Cummings and McLaughlin later completed the play 'Brass Ring' based on separate plays from each other. John Shea met with Cummings and over the next year, Shea spent time in South Boston with Cummings getting to know the neighborhood. He committed to working with the writers on the screenplay and agreed to direct the film. During the next year, Shea worked with them on the script, scouted locations, and pieced the production together while raising the money needed to shoot the film.\n\nThe lead role was originally offered to [[Mark Wahlberg]] but he was not available following the success of the 1997 film, ''[[Boogie Nights]]''. Cummings' younger brother, Dan, suggested the leader of the 1990s boy band [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]] to play the leading role. Shea spent a day with [[Ron Howard]] in New York as Howard completed the sound mixing on the 1996 film ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'', in which Wahlberg had a supporting role. Shea liked what he saw and Wahlberg was offered the role. Cummings worked with [[Bill McCutchen]] and [[Hugh Wilson]] and the producers raised the financing and the independent film was a go.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nShooting was scheduled for February 1997, in the middle of a very cold and brutal Boston winter. The film was shot with a full union crew in twenty-four days.

The film centers around Danny Quinn, a former \"street kid\" from [[South Boston]], returning home to find his family deeper into organized crime than when he left, and his struggles to not fall back into his previous life.\n\n==Plot==\nDanny Quinn ([[Donnie Wahlberg]]) is a former \"street kid\" from [[South Boston]], colloquially known as \"Southie,\" who returns home from New York City after three years away. He finds his mother ([[Anne Meara]]) overwhelmed with worry as her other three kids are caught up in the madness of the hardscrabble neighborhood in which drinking, sex, and fighting is the way of life. Danny tracks down his brothers only to find out they're deeply embedded in the [[Irish_Mob#Boston|Irish mob]] in Boston and in debt to local mobster Colie Powers ([[Lawrence Tierney]]). His younger sister Kathy ([[Rose McGowan]]), meanwhile, became a barfly in Danny's absence. \n\nDanny must get his hands on some quick cash in order to stop his brothers from getting their legs broken and his sister off the streets. In his pursuit to help his ailing mother and right his family's name on the streets of Southie, Danny tracks down his old girlfriend from the neighborhood, Marianne ([[Amanda Peet]]), finding that the love he left behind still remains. She tells how she heard about the gunfight he was in with Joey Ward ([[Jimmy Cummings]]) and wants to know if that's why he left town. Danny confesses that real reason he left town was that he needed to stop drinking if he were to become the man that she would want him to be. \n\nUnable to find legitimate work and banned from union jobs due to a scuffle at a wedding, Danny becomes desperate for money. Two of his old pals know Danny needs money and offer him an opportunity to be a partner in an underground [[gambling]] club, though, they neglect to tell Danny that their silent partner is his old nemesis, Joey Ward. It doesn't take long before Danny finds out and he and Joey are face to face. In Danny's absence from the neighborhood, Joey's father Butchie has declared war on Colie Powers and without knowing this Danny finds himself caught up in the middle of their war as it looks like he's in business with the Wards. The mob war eventually comes to Danny's front door, and the stress of an attempted murder in front of his house kills Danny's mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Danny Quinn\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Kathy Quinn\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Mrs. Quinn\n* [[Lawrence Tierney]] as Colie Powers\n* [[John Shea]] as Peter Binda\n* [[Jimmy Cummings]] as Joey Ward\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Whitey\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Marianne Silva\n* [[Jere Shea]] as Martin Powers\n* Josh Marchette as Will Casey\n\n==Production==\n''Southie'' was originally written as \"Brass Ring\" by two young screenwriters from Boston, [[Jimmy Cummings]] and Dave McLaughlin. Cummings was born in Southie and left Boston with the hopes of becoming an actor. After several years of studying with actor [[George Loros]], Cummings began to produce stage plays from the money he made as the doorman at the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. Cummings returned to Boston in 1993 and after an attempted armed robbery, one of his friends told him \"...that was like a scene out of a movie...\" Cummings and McLaughlin later completed the play 'Brass Ring' based on separate plays from each other. John Shea met with Cummings and over the next year, Shea spent time in South Boston with Cummings getting to know the neighborhood. He committed to working with the writers on the screenplay and agreed to direct the film. During the next year, Shea worked with them on the script, scouted locations, and pieced the production together while raising the money needed to shoot the film.\n\nThe lead role was originally offered to [[Mark Wahlberg]] but he was not available following the success of the 1997 film, ''[[Boogie Nights]]''. Cummings' younger brother, Dan, suggested the leader of the 1990s boy band [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]] to play the leading role. Shea spent a day with [[Ron Howard]] in New York as Howard completed the sound mixing on the 1996 film [[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'', in which Wahlberg had a supporting role. Shea liked what he saw and Wahlberg was offered the role. Cummings worked with [[Bill McCutchen]] and [[Hugh Wilson]] and the producers raised the financing and the independent film was a go.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nShooting was scheduled for February 1997, in the middle of a very cold and brutal Boston winter. The film was shot with a full union crew in twenty-four days. [[Will Arnett]] was a friend of Cummings in New York and Anne Meara, a friend of Shea's, agreed to play the key role of the mother of the Quinn clan. \n\nCelebrated jazz drummer [[Johnny Blowers]] also makes an appearance in The Quencher tavern, \"telling Sinatra stories.\" The film ends as the real [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade goes through South Boston.
