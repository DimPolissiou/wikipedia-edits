Her roles in Australian television programs, including several appearances in the [[Crawford Productions]] police dramas ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'', ''[[Division 4]]'' and ''[[Matlock Police]]'', were nearly all teenage characters. Her first television role was in an episode of ''[[Delta (Australian TV series)|Delta]]'' where she played a 15-year-old who appeared in a semi-nude swimming scene. Mann also played a schoolgirl in the hit sex-comedy feature film ''[[Alvin Purple]]'' (1973) and was a young female cricketer in its 1974 sequel ''[[Alvin Purple Rides Again]]''.\n\nShe later played the more  permanent role of schoolgirl Debbie Chester in adult soap opera ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]''.

She reappeared in the series in 1983 playing a different character, and made other guest appearances in Australian television series until the mid-1980s.\n\nSince the mid-1980s she has worked as a casting director on various Australian films and television productions\n \n==Filmography== \n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n| Year\n| Title\n| Role\n|- \n| 1970 || ''Delta'' (TV series) || Daphne (episode The Honeymoon Blows)\n|-\n| 1971 || ''Exit'' (film short) || Jessica\n|- \n| 1973 || ''Ryan'' (TV series) || Nikki (episode: Tribe)\n|- \n| 1973 || ''[[Alvin Purple]]'' || Shirley\n|-\n|1971-1974 || ''Homicide'' || 3 roles</br/>-Anne Gardner (episode - Death on the Vine (1971)</br/>-Jenny Robinson (episode- The Adventurer (1973)</br/>-Kate Maxwell (episode: You've Gotto Do Something (1974)\n|-\n| 1974 || ''Peterson''  || Robin\n|-\n|1972-1974 || ''Division 4'' (TV series) || 6 roles</br/>- Pup (episode Rogues Gallery (1972)</br/>-Nurse 2 (episode Andrew Shannon (1972)</br/>-Sally (episode- The Oracle) (1972)</br/> Bev Compton (episode: Traveling Man)</br/>Josie (episode: For My Next Trick (1973))</br/>Nancy (episode: Man of Substance (1974)  \n|-\n| 1974 || ''Alvin Rides Again'' || Woman Cricketer\n|-\n| 1975 || ''Silent Number'' (TV series) || Sharon Lane (episode: Exposed to moral Danger)\n|- \n| 1973-1975 || ''Matlock Police''  (TV series) || 3 roles</br/>-Miss.
