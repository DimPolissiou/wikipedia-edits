The two commonly cited origins of this name are that it either came from \"stronghold by the bridge(s)\"<ref name=Glover>The Place names of Kent. Judith Glover. 1976 Batsford. 1982 Meresborough Books. {{ISBN|0-905270-61-4}}</ref> or is the latinisation of the British word ''Dourbruf'' meaning \"swiftstream\".<ref name=Kellys>\nKelly's Directory of Rochester 1951.</ref> Durobrivis was pronounced 'Robrivis. In later times, the word ''[[caester|c\u00e6ster]]'' (=castle, from Latin ''castrum'') was added to the name and the city was called ''Robrivis C\u00e6ster''. [[Bede]] mentions the city in ca. 730 and calls it ''Hrofes c\u00e6ster'', mistaking its meaning as Hrofi's fortified camp. From this we get c. 730 Hrof\u00e6sc\u00e6stre, 811 Hrofescester, 1086 Rovescester, 1610 Rochester.<ref name=Glover/> The Latinised adjective 'Roffensis' refers to Rochester.<ref name=Kellys/><!-- Should be in history- but that is fairly full and should only be a synopsis of the main article-- see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements]] for guidance-->\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Rochester, Kent}}\n\n[[File:Eastgate House, Rochester, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1582490.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Eastgate House, Rochester, Kent]]\nNeolithic remains have been found in the vicinity of Rochester; over time it has been variously occupied by [[Celts]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Jutes]] and/or [[Saxons]]. During the Celtic period it was one of the two administrative centres of the Cantiaci tribe. During the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a decisive battle was fought at the Medway somewhere near Rochester.  The first bridge was subsequently constructed early in the Roman period.  During the later Roman period the settlement was walled in stone. [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|King Ethelbert of Kent]] (560\u2013616) established a legal system which has been preserved in the 12th century ''[[Textus Roffensis]]''.  In AD 604 the bishopric and cathedral were founded.  During this period, from the recall of the legions until the [[Norman conquest]], Rochester was sacked at least twice and besieged on another occasion.\n\nThe [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] saw the building of the current cathedral (1080\u20131130, 1227 and 1343), the building of two castles and the establishment of a significant town.  Rochester Castle saw action in the sieges of 1215 and 1264. Its basic street plan was set out, constrained by the river, Watling Street, Rochester Priory and the [[Rochester Castle|castle]].\n\nRochester has produced two martyrs: [[John Fisher|St John Fisher]], executed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] for refusing to sanction the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]]; and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Bishop Nicholas Ridley]], executed by [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] for being an [[English Reformation]] [[protestant]].\n\nThe city was raided by the Dutch as part of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].  The Dutch, commanded by [[de Ruijter|Admiral de Ruijter]], broke through the [[Coastal defence and fortification|chain]] at [[Upnor]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/upnor.html|title=Fortified Places > Fortresses > Upnor Castle|website=www.fortified-places.com}}</ref> and sailed to Rochester Bridge capturing part of the English fleet and burning it.<ref name=Dutch>*The Dutch Raid, published by the City of Rochester Society 1998.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rochester Castle engraved by H.Adlard after G.F.Sargent. c1836 edited.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Rochester Castle from across the [[River Medway|Medway]] (engraving, G.F. Sargent c. 1836)]]\n\n===Military history===\n{{further|The Nore}}\nRochester has for centuries been of great strategic importance through its position near the confluence of the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[River Medway|Medway]]. [[Rochester Castle]] was built to guard the river crossing, and the Royal Dockyard's establishment at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] witnessed the beginning of the [[Royal Navy]]'s long period of supremacy. The town, as part of Medway, is surrounded by two circles of [[fortress]]es; the inner line built during the [[Napoleonic wars]] consists of [[Fort Clarence]], [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], [[Fort Amherst]] and [[Fort Gillingham]]. The outer line of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston Forts]] was built during the 1860s in light of the report by the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] and consists of [[Fort Borstal]], [[Fort Bridgewood]], [[Fort Luton]], and the [[Twydall|Twydall Redoubts]], with two additional forts on islands in the Medway, namely [[Fort Hoo]] and [[Fort Darnet]].\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] the [[Short Brothers]]' [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] manufacturing company developed the first plane to launch a torpedo, the [[Short Type 184|Short Admiralty Type 184]], at its seaplane factory on the River Medway not far from Rochester Castle. In the intervening period between the 20th century World Wars the company established a world-wide reputation as a constructor of flying boats with aircraft such as the [[Short Singapore|Singapore]], [[Short Empire|Empire]] 'C'-Class and [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]]. During the [[Second World War]], Shorts also designed and manufactured the first four-engined [[bomber]], the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]].\n\nThe [[UK]]'s decline in naval power and shipbuilding competitiveness led to the government decommissioning the RN Shipyard at Chatham in 1984, which led to the subsequent demise of much local maritime industry. Rochester and its neighbouring communities were hit hard by this and have experienced a painful adjustment to a [[post-industrial economy]], with much social deprivation and unemployment resulting. On the closure of Chatham Dockyard the area experienced an unprecedented surge in unemployment to 24%; this had dropped to 2.4% of the local population by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-26793760|title=Chatham Dockyard closure 'very positive for the area'|date=31 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Civic history and traditions===\nRochester was recognised as a City from 1211 to 1998. The City of Rochester's ancient status was unique, as it had no formal council or Charter Trustees nor a Mayor, instead having the office of Admiral of the River Medway, whose incumbent acted as ''de facto'' civic leader.<ref name=\"LondonGazette48875\">{{London Gazette|issue=48875|page=1173|date=28 January 1982}} Publishing Letters Patent dated 25 January 1982, text also available from [http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/ Medway Council archives website]</ref>\n\nSince Norman times Rochester had always governed land on the other side of the [[River Medway|Medway]] in [[Strood]], which was known as ''Strood [[Intra (disambiguation)|Intra]]''; before 1835 it was about {{convert|100|yards}} wide and stretched to Gun Lane. In the [[1835 Municipal Corporations Act]] the boundaries were extended to include more of Strood and Frindsbury, and part of Chatham known as ''Chatham Intra''.\n\nLike many of the mediaeval towns of England, Rochester had civic [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]] whose historic duties and rights were abolished by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. However, the ''[[Guild]] of Free Fishers and Dredgers'' continues to the present day and retains rights, duties and responsibilities on the Medway, between Sheerness and Hawkwood Stone.<ref>[http://www.freemen-few.org.uk/UserControls/FCKEditor/.../ROCHESTER.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref> This ancient corporate body convenes at the Admiralty Court whose [[Jury]] of Freemen is responsible for the conservancy of the River as enshrined in current legislation. The City Freedom can be obtained by residents after serving a period of \"servitude\", i.e. [[apprenticeship]] (traditionally seven years), before admission as a Freeman. The annual ceremonial [[beating the bounds|Beating of the Bounds]] by the River Medway takes place after the Admiralty Court, usually on the first Saturday of July.\n\n===Ecclesiastical parishes===\n[[File:Diocese of Rochester arms.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Arms of diocese of Rochester]]{{for| parishes in the wider Rochester area |Strood#Churches|Frindsbury#The Church of All Saints}}\nThere were three medieval [[parish]]es: St Nicholas', [[St. Margaret's Church, Rochester|St Margaret's]] and St Clement's.

The low-lying [[Hoo peninsula]] to the north of the town consists of [[London Clay]], and the [[alluvium]] brought down by the two rivers\u2014the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[River Medway|Medway]]\u2014whose confluence is in this area. The land rises from the river, and being on the dip slope of the [[North Downs]], this consists of [[chalk]] surmounted by the Blackheath Beds of sand and gravel.\n\nAs a [[human settlement]], Rochester became established as the lowest river crossing of the River Medway, well before the arrival of the Romans.\n\nIt is a focal point between two routes, being part of the main route connecting London with the Continent and the north-south routes following the course of the Medway connecting [[Maidstone]] and the [[Weald of Kent]] with the Thames and the North Sea. The Thames Marshes were an important source of [[Sea salt|salt]]. Rochester's roads follow north Kent's valleys and ridges of steep-sided [[chalk]] [[bourne (stream)|bournes]]. There are four ways out of town to the south: up Star Hill, via [[Dairy|The Delce]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-kent/vol4/pp153-182|title=The city and liberty of Rochester: The city parishes - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> along the Maidstone Road or through [[Borstal, Kent|Borstal]]. The town is inextricably linked with the neighbouring [[Medway Towns]] but separated from [[Maidstone]] by a protective [[ridge]] known as the [[North Downs|Downs]], a designated [[area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].\n\nAt its most limited geographical size, Rochester is defined as the market town within the [[city wall]]s, now associated with the historic medieval city. However, Rochester historically also included the ancient [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|wards]] of Strood Intra on the river's west bank, and Chatham Intra as well as the three old [[Parish (Church of England)|parishes]] on the Medway's east bank.\n\nThe [[diocese of Rochester]] is another geographical entity which can be referred to as Rochester.\n<!-- Within the city boundaries are several distinct areas: the town centre near the parish church and along the High Street; The Delce area; Strood estate constructed in 1927;\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title ='''Neighbouring areas of Rochester'''\n|Northwest = [[Strood]]\n|North = ''[[Hoo Peninsula]]''\n|Northeast = [[Chatham]]\n|West = [[Gravesend]]\n|Centre = Rochester\n|East = [[Gillingham, Kent]]\n|Southwest = [[Cuxton]] and [[Halling]]\n|South = [[Rochester Airport]] and [[Maidstone]]\n|Southeast = [[Walderslade, Kent]]\n}}\n\nOther nearby localities:\n*[[Chattenden]]\n*[[Cliffe]]\n*[[Cobham Park]]\n*[[Cooling]]\n*[[Hoo St Werbergh]]\n*[[Rainham, Kent]]\n-->\n\n==Climate==\nRochester has an [[oceanic climate]] similar to much of southern England, being accorded [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification|K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification-subtype]] of \"[[Oceanic climate|Cfb]]\" (Marine West Coast Climate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=68730&cityname=Gravesend,+England,+United+Kingdom&units=|title=Gravesend, England K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 August 2003, neighbouring [[Gravesend]] recorded one of the highest temperatures since meteorogical records began in the [[United Kingdom]], with a reading of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit),<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/10/newsid_3910000/3910801.stm 2003: Britain swelters in record heat]. http://www.bbc.co.uk 10 August 2003.

During the Celtic period it was one of the two administrative centres of the Cantiaci tribe. During the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a decisive battle was fought at the Medway somewhere near Rochester.  The first bridge was subsequently constructed early in the Roman period.  During the later Roman period the settlement was walled in stone. [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|King Ethelbert of Kent]] (560\u2013616) established a legal system which has been preserved in the 12th century ''[[Textus Roffensis]]''.  In AD 604 the bishopric and cathedral were founded.  During this period, from the recall of the legions until the [[Norman conquest]], Rochester was sacked at least twice and besieged on another occasion.\n\nThe [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] saw the building of the current cathedral (1080\u20131130, 1227 and 1343), the building of two castles and the establishment of a significant town.  Rochester Castle saw action in the sieges of 1215 and 1264. Its basic street plan was set out, constrained by the river, Watling Street, Rochester Priory and the [[Rochester Castle|castle]].\n\nRochester has produced two martyrs: [[John Fisher|St John Fisher]], executed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] for refusing to sanction the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]]; and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Bishop Nicholas Ridley]], executed by [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] for being an [[English Reformation]] [[protestant]].\n\nThe city was raided by the Dutch as part of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].

[[Rochester Castle]] was built to guard the river crossing, and the Royal Dockyard's establishment at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] witnessed the beginning of the [[Royal Navy]]'s long period of supremacy. The town, as part of Medway, is surrounded by two circles of [[fortress]]es; the inner line built during the [[Napoleonic wars]] consists of [[Fort Clarence]], [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], [[Fort Amherst]] and [[Fort Gillingham]]. The outer line of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston Forts]] was built during the 1860s in light of the report by the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] and consists of [[Fort Borstal]], [[Fort Bridgewood]], [[Fort Luton]], and the [[Twydall|Twydall Redoubts]], with two additional forts on islands in the Medway, namely [[Fort Hoo]] and [[Fort Darnet]].\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] the [[Short Brothers]]' [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] manufacturing company developed the first plane to launch a torpedo, the [[Short Type 184|Short Admiralty Type 184]], at its seaplane factory on the River Medway not far from Rochester Castle. In the intervening period between the 20th century World Wars the company established a world-wide reputation as a constructor of flying boats with aircraft such as the [[Short Singapore|Singapore]], [[Short Empire|Empire]] 'C'-Class and [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]]. During the [[Second World War]], Shorts also designed and manufactured the first four-engined [[bomber]], the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]].\n\nThe [[UK]]'s decline in naval power and shipbuilding competitiveness led to the government decommissioning the RN Shipyard at Chatham in 1984, which led to the subsequent demise of much local maritime industry. Rochester and its neighbouring communities were hit hard by this and have experienced a painful adjustment to a [[post-industrial economy]], with much social deprivation and unemployment resulting. On the closure of Chatham Dockyard the area experienced an unprecedented surge in unemployment to 24%; this had dropped to 2.4% of the local population by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-26793760|title=Chatham Dockyard closure 'very positive for the area'|date=31 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Civic history and traditions===\nRochester was recognised as a City from 1211 to 1998. The City of Rochester's ancient status was unique, as it had no formal council or Charter Trustees nor a Mayor, instead having the office of Admiral of the River Medway, whose incumbent acted as ''de facto'' civic leader.<ref name=\"LondonGazette48875\">{{London Gazette|issue=48875|page=1173|date=28 January 1982}} Publishing Letters Patent dated 25 January 1982, text also available from [http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/ Medway Council archives website]</ref>\n\nSince Norman times Rochester had always governed land on the other side of the [[River Medway|Medway]] in [[Strood]], which was known as ''Strood [[Intra (disambiguation)|Intra]]''; before 1835 it was about {{convert|100|yards}} wide and stretched to Gun Lane. In the [[1835 Municipal Corporations Act]] the boundaries were extended to include more of Strood and Frindsbury, and part of Chatham known as ''Chatham Intra''.\n\nLike many of the mediaeval towns of England, Rochester had civic [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]] whose historic duties and rights were abolished by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. However, the ''[[Guild]] of Free Fishers and Dredgers'' continues to the present day and retains rights, duties and responsibilities on the Medway, between Sheerness and Hawkwood Stone.<ref>[http://www.freemen-few.org.uk/UserControls/FCKEditor/.../ROCHESTER.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref> This ancient corporate body convenes at the Admiralty Court whose [[Jury]] of Freemen is responsible for the conservancy of the River as enshrined in current legislation. The City Freedom can be obtained by residents after serving a period of \"servitude\", i.e. [[apprenticeship]] (traditionally seven years), before admission as a Freeman. The annual ceremonial [[beating the bounds|Beating of the Bounds]] by the River Medway takes place after the Admiralty Court, usually on the first Saturday of July.\n\n===Ecclesiastical parishes===\n[[File:Diocese of Rochester arms.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Arms of diocese of Rochester]]{{for| parishes in the wider Rochester area |Strood#Churches|Frindsbury#The Church of All Saints}}\nThere were three medieval [[parish]]es: St Nicholas', [[St. Margaret's Church, Rochester|St Margaret's]] and St Clement's.

The low-lying [[Hoo peninsula]] to the north of the town consists of [[London Clay]], and the [[alluvium]] brought down by the two rivers\u2014the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[River Medway|Medway]]\u2014whose confluence is in this area. The land rises from the river, and being on the dip slope of the [[North Downs]], this consists of [[chalk]] surmounted by the Blackheath Beds of sand and gravel.\n\nAs a [[human settlement]], Rochester became established as the lowest river crossing of the River Medway, well before the arrival of the Romans.\n\nIt is a focal point between two routes, being part of the main route connecting London with the Continent and the north-south routes following the course of the Medway connecting [[Maidstone]] and the [[Weald of Kent]] with the Thames and the North Sea. The Thames Marshes were an important source of [[Sea salt|salt]]. Rochester's roads follow north Kent's valleys and ridges of steep-sided [[chalk]] [[bourne (stream)|bournes]]. There are four ways out of town to the south: up Star Hill, via [[Dairy|The Delce]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-kent/vol4/pp153-182|title=The city and liberty of Rochester: The city parishes - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> along the Maidstone Road or through [[Borstal, Kent|Borstal]]. The town is inextricably linked with the neighbouring [[Medway Towns]] but separated from [[Maidstone]] by a protective [[ridge]] known as the [[North Downs|Downs]], a designated [[area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].\n\nAt its most limited geographical size, Rochester is defined as the market town within the [[city wall]]s, now associated with the historic medieval city. However, Rochester historically also included the ancient [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|wards]] of Strood Intra on the river's west bank, and Chatham Intra as well as the three old [[Parish (Church of England)|parishes]] on the Medway's east bank.\n\nThe [[diocese of Rochester]] is another geographical entity which can be referred to as Rochester.\n<!-- Within the city boundaries are several distinct areas: the town centre near the parish church and along the High Street; The Delce area; Strood estate constructed in 1927;\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title ='''Neighbouring areas of Rochester'''\n|Northwest = [[Strood]]\n|North = ''[[Hoo Peninsula]]''\n|Northeast = [[Chatham]]\n|West = [[Gravesend]]\n|Centre = Rochester\n|East = [[Gillingham, Kent]]\n|Southwest = [[Cuxton]] and [[Halling]]\n|South = [[Rochester Airport]] and [[Maidstone]]\n|Southeast = [[Walderslade, Kent]]\n}}\n\nOther nearby localities:\n*[[Chattenden]]\n*[[Cliffe]]\n*[[Cobham Park]]\n*[[Cooling]]\n*[[Hoo St Werbergh]]\n*[[Rainham, Kent]]\n-->\n\n==Climate==\nRochester has an [[oceanic climate]] similar to much of southern England, being accorded [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification|K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification-subtype]] of \"[[Oceanic climate|Cfb]]\" (Marine West Coast Climate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=68730&cityname=Gravesend,+England,+United+Kingdom&units=|title=Gravesend, England K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 August 2003, neighbouring [[Gravesend]] recorded one of the highest temperatures since meteorogical records began in the [[United Kingdom]], with a reading of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit),<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/10/newsid_3910000/3910801.stm 2003: Britain swelters in record heat]. http://www.bbc.co.uk 10 August 2003.

This number increased to ten from the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 election]], and was increased again to twelve from the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]]. The system for electing Senators has changed several times since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The original arrangement used a [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] or \"winner takes all\" system, on a state-by-state basis.

For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]] had 35 of the 36 Senators, and from 1947 to 1950, the [[Australian Labor Party]] had 33 of the 36 Senators.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Sawer, Marian |author2=Miskin, Sarah |lastauthoramp=yes | title =Papers on Parliament No. 34 Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate | publisher = Department of the Senate | year = 1999 | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop34 | id = | isbn = 0-642-71061-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, [[single transferable vote]] [[proportional representation]] on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing Senators.

If the previous Senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting. The State Parliament can also be recalled to ratify a replacement.\n\n===House of Representatives===\n[[File:2016-ballot-paper-Higgins.png|thumb|right|2016 House of Representatives ballot paper used in the [[Division of Higgins]]]]\nThe lower house of the Australian Parliament, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is made up of single member electorates with roughly the same population. As is convention in the [[Westminster system]], the party or coalition of parties that has the majority in this House forms the Government with the leader of that party or coalition becoming the Prime Minister. If the government loses the confidence of the House, they are expected to call a new election or resign.\n\nParliament may determine the number of members of the House of Representatives but the Constitution provides that this number must be \"as nearly as practicable, twice the number of Senators\"; this requirement is commonly called the \"nexus provision\".

The presiding officer of the Senate is called the [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President]]; that of the House of Representatives is the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Elections for these positions are by secret ballot. Both offices are conventionally filled by members of the governing party, but the presiding officers are expected to oversee debate and enforce the rules in an impartial manner.<ref name=spe>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter6 |title=House of Representatives Practice, 6th Ed \u2013 Chapter 6 \u2013 The Speaker, Deputy Speakers and officers |year=2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Constitution authorises Parliament to set the [[quorum]] for each chamber. The quorum of the Senate is one-quarter of the total membership (nineteen); that of the House of Representatives is one-fifth of the total membership (thirty). In theory, if a quorum is not present, then a House may not continue to meet. In practice, members usually agree not to notice that a quorum is not present, so that debates on routine bills can continue without other members having to be present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Sometimes the Opposition will \"[[quorum call|call a quorum]]\" as a tactic to annoy the Government or delay proceedings, particularly when the Opposition feels it has been unfairly treated in the House. The session of the relevant House is suspended until a quorum is present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It is the responsibility of the Government [[whip (politics)|whips]] to ensure that, when a quorum is called, enough Government members are present to make up a quorum.\n\nBoth Houses may determine motions by [[voice vote]]: the presiding officer puts the question, and, after listening to shouts of \"Aye\" and \"No\" from the members, announces the result. The announcement of the presiding officer settles the question, unless at least two members demand a \"[[Division of the assembly|division]]\", or a recorded vote. In that case the bells are rung throughout Parliament House summoning Senators or Members to the chamber. During a division, members who favour the motion move to the right side of the chamber, whereas those opposed move to the left. They are then counted by the \"tellers\" (Government and Opposition whips), and the motion is passed or defeated accordingly. In the Senate, in order not to deprive a state of a vote in what is supposed to be a states' house, the President is permitted a vote along with other Senators (however, that right is rarely exercised); in the case of a tie, the President does not have a casting vote and the motion fails.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief06 |title=Senate Brief \u2013 No. 6 \u2013 The President of the Senate|work=Department of the Senate |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> In the House of Representatives, the Speaker does not vote, except in the case of a tie (see [[casting vote]]).<ref name=spe />\n\nMost legislation is introduced into the House of Representatives and goes through a number of stages to become a law.

The legislation can then be considered by a House committee, which reports back to the House on any recommendations. This is followed by a consideration in detail stage, where the House can explore the bill in detail and make any amendments. This is finally followed by a [[third reading]], where the bill is either passed or rejected by the House. If passed, the legislation is then sent to the Senate, which has a similar structure of debate and passage except that the consideration in detail stage is replaced by a [[committee of the whole]].

In effect, the Commonwealth can make grants subject to States implementing particular policies in their fields of legislative responsibility.

Because all seats are contested in the same election, it is easier for smaller parties to win seats under the single transferable vote system: the [[Election threshold|quota]] for the election of each senator in each Australian state in a full Senate election is 7.69% of the vote, while in a normal half-Senate election the quota is 14.28%.<ref>{{cite web |first= Damon |last= Muller| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2016/April/Double_Dissolutions |title=FlagPost \u2013 (Almost) everything you need to know about double dissolution elections|publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library|year=2016 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIf the conflict continues after such an election, the Governor-General may convene a [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|joint sitting of both Houses]] to consider the bill or bills, including any amendments which have been previously proposed in either House, or any new amendments. If a bill is passed by an [[absolute majority]] of the total membership of the joint sitting, it is treated as though it had been passed separately by both Houses, and is presented for royal assent. With proportional representation, and the small majorities in the Senate compared to the generally larger majorities in the House of Representatives, and the requirement that the number of members of the House be \"nearly as practicable\" twice that of the Senate, a joint sitting after a double dissolution is more likely than not to lead to a victory for the House over the Senate. This provision has only been invoked on one occasion, after the [[1974 Australian federal election|election]] following the 1974 double dissolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter13&section=04 |title=House of Representatives Practice, 6th Ed \u2013 Chapter 13 \u2013 Disagreements between the Houses \u2013 JOINT SITTING |year=2015 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref> However, there are other occasions when the two Houses meet as one: see [[Joint meetings of the Australian Parliament]].\n\n==Committees==\n{{see also|Australian Senate committees|Australian House of Representatives committees}}\n[[Image:AustralianSenateCommitteeRm.JPG|thumb|left|A Senate committee room in Parliament House, Canberra]]\n[[File:Australian Parliament Parliamentary Committees.webm|thumb|A short video on Australian Parliamentary Committees]]\nIn addition to the work of the main chambers, both the Senate and the House of Representatives also have a large number of committees which deal with matters referred to them by their respective Houses.

Rather than being modelled solely after the [[House of Lords]], as the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] was, the Australian Senate was in part modelled after the [[United States Senate]], by giving equal representation to each state.

Whereas in the House of Representatives the government's majority has sometimes limited that chamber's capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 352| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe constitutional text denies the Senate the power to originate or amend appropriation bills, in deference to the conventions of the classical Westminster system. Under a traditional Westminster system, the executive government is responsible for its use of public funds to the lower house, which has the power to bring down a government by [[Loss of supply|blocking its access to supply]] \u2013 i.e. [[revenue]] appropriated through taxation. The arrangement as expressed in the Australian Constitution, however, still leaves the Senate with the power to reject supply bills or defer their passage \u2013 undoubtedly one of the Senate's most powerful abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_01#h08 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 1 \u2013 The Senate and its constitutional role \u2013 Legislative powers|year=2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer supply to the Government. Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election or resign. If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary. But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important aspect \u2013 if he cannot get supply he must resign or advise an election.|author=Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]|source=Statement (dated 11 November 1975)<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe ability to block supply was the origin of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The [[Parliamentary opposition|Opposition]] used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day, [[Gough Whitlam]], contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict \u2013 firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the [[lower house]], and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed. The crisis was resolved in November 1975 when Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] dismissed Whitlam's government and appointed a caretaker government on condition that elections for both Houses of parliament be held.<ref name=kerr/> This action in itself was a source of controversy and debate continues on the proper usage of the Senate's ability to block supply and on whether such a power should even exist.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 300| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution. There must be legislation repeatedly blocked by the Senate which the government can then choose to use as a trigger for a double dissolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=An Early Double Dissolution?

The proceedings of parliamentary committees, wherever they meet, are also covered by privilege, and this extends to witnesses before such committees.\n\nFrom the beginning of Federation until 1987, Parliamentary privilege operated under Section 49 of the Constitution, which established the privileges of both Houses and their members to be the same as the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] at the time of the Constitution's enactment. The Parliament was also given the power to amend its privileges.<ref name=\"con49\"/> In 1987, the Parliament passed the \"Parliamentary Privileges Act\", which clarified the meaning and extent of privilege as well as how the Parliament deals with breaches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_02 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 2 \u2013 Parliamentary privilege: immunities and powers of the Senate|year=2017 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is a legal offence called [[contempt of Parliament]]. A person who speaks or acts in a manner contemptuous of the Parliament or its members can be tried and, if convicted, imprisoned. The Parliament previously had the power to hear such cases itself, and did so in the [[Browne\u2013Fitzpatrick privilege case, 1955]]. This power has now been delegated to the courts.

The opening ceremonies were both splendid and incongruous, given the sparsely built nature of Canberra of the time and its small population. The building was extensively decorated with British Empire and Australian flags and bunting. Temporary stands were erected bordering the lawns in front of the Parliament and these were filled with crowds.

Furthermore, the Constitution provides that each original state is entitled to at least six Senators. However, neither of these provisions applies to any newly admitted states, or to territories. Pursuant to an Act of Parliament passed in 1973, Senators are elected to represent the territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/ |title=Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973.

This number increased to ten from the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 election]], and was increased again to twelve from the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]]. The system for electing Senators has changed several times since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The original arrangement used a [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] or \"winner takes all\" system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by [[preferential block voting]]. Block voting tended to produce [[Landslide victory|landslide]] majorities and even \"wipe-outs\". For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]] had 35 of the 36 Senators, and from 1947 to 1950, the [[Australian Labor Party]] had 33 of the 36 Senators.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Sawer, Marian |author2=Miskin, Sarah |lastauthoramp=yes | title =Papers on Parliament No. 34 Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate | publisher = Department of the Senate | year = 1999 | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop34 | id = | isbn = 0-642-71061-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, [[single transferable vote]] [[proportional representation]] on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing Senators.

If the previous Senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting. The State Parliament can also be recalled to ratify a replacement.\n\n===House of Representatives===\n[[File:2016-ballot-paper-Higgins.png|thumb|right|2016 House of Representatives ballot paper used in the [[Division of Higgins]]]]\nThe lower house of the Australian Parliament, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is made up of single member electorates with roughly the same population. As is convention in the [[Westminster system]], the party or coalition of parties that has the majority in this House forms the Government with the leader of that party or coalition becoming the Prime Minister. If the government loses the confidence of the House, they are expected to call a new election or resign.\n\nParliament may determine the number of members of the House of Representatives but the Constitution provides that this number must be \"as nearly as practicable, twice the number of Senators\"; this requirement is commonly called the \"nexus provision\". Hence, the House presently consists of 150 members. Each state is allocated seats based on its population; however, each original state, regardless of size, is guaranteed at least five seats. The Constitution does not guarantee representation for the territories. Parliament granted a seat to the [[Northern Territory]] in 1922, and to the Australian Capital Territory in 1948; these territorial representatives, however, had only limited voting rights until 1968.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 |work=Documenting a Democracy |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html |accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref> Federal electorates have their boundaries redrawn or redistributed whenever a state or territory has its number of seats adjusted, if electorates are not generally matched by population size or if seven years have passed since the most recent redistribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Redist45thParl |title=Electoral Redistributions during the 45th Parliament |author=Barber, Stephen |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1901 to 1949, the House consisted of either 74 or 75 members (the Senate had 36).

The immediate justification for compulsory voting was the low voter turnout (59.38%) at the [[1922 Australian federal election|1922 federal election]], down from 71.59% at the [[1919 Australian federal election|1919 federal election]]. Compulsory voting was not on the platform of either the [[Stanley Bruce]]-led Nationalist/Country party coalition government or the [[Matthew Charlton]]-led Labor opposition. The actual initiative for change was made by [[Herbert Payne]], a backbench Tasmanian [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist]] Senator who on 16 July 1924 introduced a [[private member's bill|private Senator's bill]] in the Senate. Payne's bill was passed with little debate (the House of Representatives agreeing to it in less than an hour), and in neither house was a division required, hence no votes were recorded against the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-trek.com/writ-dtf/votehoax/c-puplic.htm |title=\"The case for compulsory voting\"; by Chris Puplick |publisher=Mind-trek.com |date=30 June 1997 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> The [[1925 Australian federal election|1925 federal election]] was the first to be conducted under compulsory voting, which saw the turnout figure rise to 91.4%.

The presiding officer of the Senate is called the [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President]]; that of the House of Representatives is the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Elections for these positions are by secret ballot. Both offices are conventionally filled by members of the governing party, but the presiding officers are expected to oversee debate and enforce the rules in an impartial manner.<ref name=spe>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter6 |title=House of Representatives Practice, 6th Ed \u2013 Chapter 6 \u2013 The Speaker, Deputy Speakers and officers |year=2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Constitution authorises Parliament to set the [[quorum]] for each chamber. The quorum of the Senate is one-quarter of the total membership (nineteen); that of the House of Representatives is one-fifth of the total membership (thirty). In theory, if a quorum is not present, then a House may not continue to meet. In practice, members usually agree not to notice that a quorum is not present, so that debates on routine bills can continue without other members having to be present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Sometimes the Opposition will \"[[quorum call|call a quorum]]\" as a tactic to annoy the Government or delay proceedings, particularly when the Opposition feels it has been unfairly treated in the House. The session of the relevant House is suspended until a quorum is present.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It is the responsibility of the Government [[whip (politics)|whips]] to ensure that, when a quorum is called, enough Government members are present to make up a quorum.\n\nBoth Houses may determine motions by [[voice vote]]: the presiding officer puts the question, and, after listening to shouts of \"Aye\" and \"No\" from the members, announces the result. The announcement of the presiding officer settles the question, unless at least two members demand a \"[[Division of the assembly|division]]\", or a recorded vote. In that case the bells are rung throughout Parliament House summoning Senators or Members to the chamber. During a division, members who favour the motion move to the right side of the chamber, whereas those opposed move to the left. They are then counted by the \"tellers\" (Government and Opposition whips), and the motion is passed or defeated accordingly. In the Senate, in order not to deprive a state of a vote in what is supposed to be a states' house, the President is permitted a vote along with other Senators (however, that right is rarely exercised); in the case of a tie, the President does not have a casting vote and the motion fails.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief06 |title=Senate Brief \u2013 No. 6 \u2013 The President of the Senate|work=Department of the Senate |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> In the House of Representatives, the Speaker does not vote, except in the case of a tie (see [[casting vote]]).<ref name=spe />\n\nMost legislation is introduced into the House of Representatives and goes through a number of stages to become a law.

This is followed by a consideration in detail stage, where the House can explore the bill in detail and make any amendments. This is finally followed by a [[third reading]], where the bill is either passed or rejected by the House. If passed, the legislation is then sent to the Senate, which has a similar structure of debate and passage except that the consideration in detail stage is replaced by a [[committee of the whole]].

There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt, these include; refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee.

Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The Constitution does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force.

From a comparative governmental perspective, the Australian Senate exhibits distinctive characteristics. Unlike upper Houses in other [[Westminster system]] governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power. Rather it was intended to play \u2013 and does play \u2013 an active role in legislation. Rather than being modelled solely after the [[House of Lords]], as the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] was, the Australian Senate was in part modelled after the [[United States Senate]], by giving equal representation to each state. The Constitution intended to give less populous states added voice in a Federal legislature, while also providing for the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_01#h02 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 1 \u2013 The Senate and its constitutional role \u2013 The Senate, bicameralism and federalism|year=2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its committees, is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government's majority has sometimes limited that chamber's capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 352| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe constitutional text denies the Senate the power to originate or amend appropriation bills, in deference to the conventions of the classical Westminster system. Under a traditional Westminster system, the executive government is responsible for its use of public funds to the lower house, which has the power to bring down a government by [[Loss of supply|blocking its access to supply]] \u2013 i.e. [[revenue]] appropriated through taxation. The arrangement as expressed in the Australian Constitution, however, still leaves the Senate with the power to reject supply bills or defer their passage \u2013 undoubtedly one of the Senate's most powerful abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_01#h08 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 1 \u2013 The Senate and its constitutional role \u2013 Legislative powers|year=2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer supply to the Government. Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election or resign. If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary. But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important aspect \u2013 if he cannot get supply he must resign or advise an election.|author=Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]|source=Statement (dated 11 November 1975)<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe ability to block supply was the origin of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The [[Parliamentary opposition|Opposition]] used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day, [[Gough Whitlam]], contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict \u2013 firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the [[lower house]], and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed. The crisis was resolved in November 1975 when Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] dismissed Whitlam's government and appointed a caretaker government on condition that elections for both Houses of parliament be held.<ref name=kerr/> This action in itself was a source of controversy and debate continues on the proper usage of the Senate's ability to block supply and on whether such a power should even exist.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bach| first = Stanley| authorlink =| title = Platypus and Parliament: The Australian Senate in Theory and Practice | publisher = Department of the Senate| year = 2003| url =http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl| pp = 300| isbn = 0-642-71291-3}}</ref>\n\nThe blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution.

The proceedings of parliamentary committees, wherever they meet, are also covered by privilege, and this extends to witnesses before such committees.\n\nFrom the beginning of Federation until 1987, Parliamentary privilege operated under Section 49 of the Constitution, which established the privileges of both Houses and their members to be the same as the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] at the time of the Constitution's enactment. The Parliament was also given the power to amend its privileges.<ref name=\"con49\"/> In 1987, the Parliament passed the \"Parliamentary Privileges Act\", which clarified the meaning and extent of privilege as well as how the Parliament deals with breaches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_02 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 2 \u2013 Parliamentary privilege: immunities and powers of the Senate|year=2017 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is a legal offence called [[contempt of Parliament]].

Turin in Basel in 1996 to enable the deposit and exchange of rare molecular and biomolecular research samples.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/history |title=History of MDPI |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe journal [[Molecules (journal)|''Molecules'']] was established in 1996 in collaboration with Springer-Verlag (now [[Springer Science+Business Media]]) in order to document the chemical samples of the MDPI collection. Several other journals were established by the MDPI Verein, including [[Entropy (journal)|''Entropy'']] (1999), the ''[[International Journal of Molecular Sciences]]'' (2000), [[Sensors (journal)|''Sensors'']] (2001), ''[[Marine Drugs]]'' (2003), and the ''[[International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health]]'' (2004). The publisher '''MDPI AG''' (see below) was spun off from MDPI Verein in 2010.\n\nMDPI Verein co-organized several [[academic conferences]], including the ''International Symposium on Frontiers in Molecular Science''. It also runs [[virtual conference]]s, such as the ''Electronic Conference on Synthetic Organic Chemistry'', which was started in 1997. In 2010 MDPI launched the platform Sciforum.net to host virtual conferences. In 2014, various virtual conferences were hosted in the areas of synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences, sensors, and sustainability. In 2015, MDPI co-organized two physical conferences with and at the [[University of Basel]], the ''4th Internationational Symposium on Sensor Science'' and the ''5th World Sustainability Forum''. Since 2015, scholars can organize their own conference for free on the Sciforum platform.\n\n=== MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) ===\nMDPI, a publisher of [[open-access]] [[scientific journal]]s, was spun off from the Molecular Diversity Preservation International organization. It was formally registered by Shu-Kun Lin and Dietrich Rordorf in May 2010 in Basel, Switzerland, and maintains editorial offices in China, Spain, Serbia, and the United Kingdom.<ref name=history />\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Controversial articles ===\nIn December 2011, the MDPI journal ''[[Life (journal)|Life]]'' published Erik D.

Several other journals were established by the MDPI Verein, including [[Entropy (journal)|''Entropy'']] (1999), the ''[[International Journal of Molecular Sciences]]'' (2000), [[Sensors (journal)|''Sensors'']] (2001), ''[[Marine Drugs]]'' (2003), and the ''[[International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health]]'' (2004). The publisher '''MDPI AG''' (see below) was spun off from MDPI Verein in 2010.\n\nMDPI Verein co-organized several [[academic conferences]], including the ''International Symposium on Frontiers in Molecular Science''. It also runs [[virtual conference]]s, such as the ''Electronic Conference on Synthetic Organic Chemistry'', which was started in 1997. In 2010 MDPI launched the platform Sciforum.net to host virtual conferences. In 2014, various virtual conferences were hosted in the areas of synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences, sensors, and sustainability. In 2015, MDPI co-organized two physical conferences with and at the [[University of Basel]], the ''4th Internationational Symposium on Sensor Science'' and the ''5th World Sustainability Forum''. Since 2015, scholars can organize their own conference for free on the Sciforum platform.\n\n=== MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) ===\nMDPI, a publisher of [[open-access]] [[scientific journal]]s, was spun off from the Molecular Diversity Preservation International organization.

With the rerouting of '''3''' trains, train lengths along the New Lots Line were reduced from 10 cars to 9 cars, within acceptable crowding levels, and train lengths along the Nostrand Avenue Line were increased from 9 to 10 cars, reducing crowding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1983|title=New IRT Schedules - Increased Service to Flatbush Avenue|url=|journal=New York Division Bulletin|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%252000253_1.pdf%23xml%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3Dffffffffa28002b6%26DocId%3D6932839%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D11%26hits%3D5fa%2B5fb%2B5fc%2B5fd%2B5fe%2B5ff%2B600%2B601%2B602%2B603%2B604%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%252000253_1.pdf&xml=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3Dffffffffa28002b6%26DocId%3D6932839%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D11%26hits%3D5fa%2B5fb%2B5fc%2B5fd%2B5fe%2B5ff%2B600%2B601%2B602%2B603%2B604%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&openFirstHlPage=false|title=Notice of Public Hearing|last=|first=|date=February 26, 1983|work=New York Amsterdam News|access-date=January 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn Spring 1995, rush hour '''5''' service to 241st Street was cut back to [[Nereid Avenue (IRT White Plains Road Line)|Nereid Avenue]]. 241st Street had insufficient capacity to terminate all '''2''' and '''5''' trains during rush hours, requiring some '''2''' and '''5''' trips to terminate at Nereid Avenue. To ease passenger confusion regarding which trips terminate where and to provide more reliable service, it was decided to have all '''2''' trips terminate at 241st Street and have all '''5''' trains terminate at 238th Street.

Dyre Avenue-bound '''5''' trains would start running local along the White Plains Road Line, while '''2''' trains would run express. Nereid Avenue-bound '''5''' trains would continue to run express in the Bronx. As part of the change, the frequency of service at White Plains Road Line local station would decrease from 12 trains per hour to 7 trains per hour. Market research showed that riders at these stations preferred Lexington Avenue Line service. In addition, riders on the line north of East 180th Street would gain express service.
