Its depot was moved to Brecon in Wales in 1873 and so, by 1879, about 30% of the recruits were Welsh.</ref> In addition, there were approximately 2,500 local African auxiliaries of the [[Natal Native Contingent]], many of whom were exiled or refugee Zulu. They were led by European officers, but were considered generally of poor quality by the British as they were prohibited from using their traditional fighting technique and inadequately trained in the European method as well as being indifferently armed. Also, there were some irregular colonial [[cavalry]] units, and a detachment of [[artillery]] consisting of six [[field gun]]s and several [[Congreve rocket]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maxwell |first=Tony |title= Searching for the Queen's Cowboys |publisher=Bratonmax |date=October 2009 |isbn= 978-0-9683256-1-2|page=236}} cite is only for the Congreve rocket battery</ref> Adding on wagon drivers, camp followers and servants, there were around 4,700 men in the No. 3 Column,<ref>Colenso, pp. 263, 1747: Imperial and Colonial Troops, 2,566 Native Contingent, 293 Drivers</ref> not including Durnford's No. 2 Column.

However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 3,400 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind five companies, around 80 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the 24th to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and approximately 200 local mounted irregulars. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, some 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance from Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

Further, they successfully concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours' striking distance of their enemy. The British made no such efforts. Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command.

These historians' view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to be the overall commander of the British forces, and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.\n\n===British perspective===\n[[File:Isandlwanazulumem.JPG|right|thumb|[[Memorial]] erected at the site commemorating the valour of the fallen Zulu [[impi]] at Isandlwana Hill, which is visible in the background<ref>Doyle, p. 131.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311. Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979. Details and diagrams of squares used by British</ref>\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{more citations needed|date = January 2013}}\nChelmsford realised that he would need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events. She asked Gladstone to meet Chelmsford; this meeting was brief, and during it Gladstone voiced his displeasure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bambatha Rebellion]]\n* [[Battle of Adwa]]\n* [[Battle of Blood River]]\n* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]]\n* [[British military history]]\n* [[Colony of Natal]]\n* [[List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients]]\n* [[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [[Natal Native Contingent]]\n* ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances |author2=assisted in those portions of the work that touch on military matters by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich|isbn=1-152-31729-6|archive-date=18 June 2007|url-status=live|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fz1CAAAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Doyle|editor1-first= Peter|editor2-last= Bennett|editor2-first= Matthew R.|title=Fields of Battle|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|year= 2002|isbn=1-4020-0433-8|first=Tony|last= Pollard|chapter=The Mountain is their Monument|pp=118\u2013}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

Knight's estimate of Zulu casualties is more in keeping with those suffered by the Zulu at [[Kambula]], where a British column forms an excellent defensive position with a wagon lager, six 7 pounder artillery pieces and 2,000 soldiers and inflicts 800(counted bodies) \u2013 1,000 killed on the Zulu. Similarly, Knight & Castle.''

However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 3,400 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind five companies, around 80 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the 24th to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and approximately 200 local mounted irregulars. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, some 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance from Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

Further, they successfully concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours' striking distance of their enemy. The British made no such efforts. Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford, and their victory at Isandlwana was a decisive defeat<ref>Lock, p. 225, \"That an awesome defeat had taken place was clear&nbsp;...\". Also, Laband, John. ''Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars'', Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8108-6078-3}}, p. 5, \"...&nbsp;the main Zulu army outmaneuvered, divided and annihilated the British No. 3 column at Isandlwana.\",  Knight, Ian and Hook, Adam.

Laband, p. 6, \"Chelmsford launched his 2nd invasion&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nRecent historians, notably Lock and Quantrill in ''Zulu Victory'', argue that from the Zulu perspective the [[theatre of operations]] included the diversions around [[Magogo]] Hills and Mangeni Falls and that these diversions, which drew more than half of Chelmsford's forces away from Isandlwana, were deliberate.<ref>Lock, p. 230.</ref> Also, the main Zulu force was not unexpectedly discovered in their encampment but was fully deployed and ready to advance on the British camp. These historians' view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to be the overall commander of the British forces, and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.\n\n===British perspective===\n[[File:Isandlwanazulumem.JPG|right|thumb|[[Memorial]] erected at the site commemorating the valour of the fallen Zulu [[impi]] at Isandlwana Hill, which is visible in the background<ref>Doyle, p. 131.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311. Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979.

He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events.

It also created the need for greater organization of political power (and the creation of [[social stratification]]), as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|title=Living the Revolution|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California \u2013 San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191022/http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Neolithic]] villages show evidence of the development of processing grain.

[[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of agriculture. Around the same time, millets and rices were starting to become domesticated in East Asia. Sorghum and millets were also being domesticated in sub-Saharan West Africa.\n\n==Cereals and civilization==\nCereals were the foundation of human civilization. Cereal frontiers coincided with civilizational frontiers. The term [[Fertile Crescent]] explicitely implies the spatial dependence of civilization on cereals. [[The Great Wall]] of China and the [[Roman limes|Roman limes]] demarkated the same northern limit of the cereal cultivation. The [[Silk Road]] stretched along the cereal belt of Eurasia. Numerous Chinese imperial edicts stated: \u201cAgriculture is the foundation of this empire,\u201d<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 86.</ref> while the foundation of agriculture were the [[Five Grains]].  \n\nCereals determined how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. For this reason, [[Shang Yang]] called agriculture and war \u201cthe One.\u201d<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 62.</ref> [[Guan Zhong]], [[Chanakya]] (the author of ''[[Arthashastra]]'')<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 63-64.</ref> and [[Hannibal]]<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 85.</ref> expressed similar concepts. At the dawn of history, the Sumerians believed that if agriculture of a state declines, [[Inanna]], the goddess of war, leaves this state.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 68.</ref> Several gods of antiquity combined the functions of what Shang Yang called \u201cthe One\u201d \u2013 agriculture and war: the Hittite [[Sun goddess of Arinna]], the Canaanite [[Lahmu]] and the Roman [[Janus]]. These were highly important gods in their time leaving their legacy until today. We still begin the year with the month of Janus (January). The Jews believe that Messiah will be born in the town of Lahmu ([[Bethlehem]]) and the Christians believe that he was already born there. Lahmu is the responsible why in Hebrew until today ''bread'' (''lehem'') and ''warfare'' (''lehima'') are of the same root.  In fact, most persistent and flourishing empires throughout history in both hemispheres were centered in regions fertile for cereals.\n\nHistorian Max Ostrovsky argues that this historic pattern never changed, not even in the [[Industrial Age]].<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 111-126.</ref> He stresses that all modern great powers have traditionally remained first and foremost great ''cereal'' powers. The \u201cfinest hour\u201d of the Axis powers \u201cended precisely the moment they threw themselves against the two largest cereal lebensraums\u201d (the United States and the USSR).<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 159.</ref> The outcome of the Cold War followed the Soviet grave and long-lasting cereal crisis, exacerbated by the cereal embargo imposed on the USSR in 1980.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 172.</ref> And, called \u201cthe grain basket of the world,\u201d the most productive \u201ccereal lebensraum\u201d dominates the world ever since.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 206.</ref>\n\nHaving analyzed the mechanism at work behind this pattern, Ostrovsky outlined that the cereal power determines the percentage of manpower available to non-agricultural sectors including the heavy industry vital for military power. He emphasized that chronologically the [[Industrial Revolution]] follows the modern Agricultural Revolution and spatially the world\u2019s industrial regions are bound to cereal regions. Taken from space, map of the global illumination is said to indicate by its brightest parts the industrial regions.<ref>https://www.shutterstock.com/nl/video/clip-28056478-world-city-lights-map-animation-silhouettes-continents</ref> These regions coincide with cereal regions. Ostrovsky formulized the universal indicator of national power which unambiguously demonstrates the unipolar international hierarchy of the present world order<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 119.</ref>:\n\n: ''Total cereal tonnage produced by one percent of nation\u2019s manpower''\n\n==The Green Revolution==\n{{main|Green Revolution}}\nDuring the second half of the 20th century there was a significant increase in the production of high-yield cereal crops worldwide, especially  wheat and rice, due to an initiative known as the [[Green Revolution]].<ref name=FAOGreenRevolution>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w2612e/w2612e06a.htm|title=Lessons from the green revolution: towards a new green revolution|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]|accessdate=5 June 2017|quote=The green revolution was a technology package comprising material components of improved high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of two staple cereals (rice or \"wheat\"), irrigation or controlled \"water\" supply and improved moisture utilization, fertilizers and pesticides and associated management skills.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518074944/http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w2612e/w2612e06a.htm|archivedate=18 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The strategies developed by the Green Revolution focused on fending off starvation and increasing yield-per-plant, and were very successful in raising overall yields of cereal grains, but did not give sufficient relevance to nutritional quality.<ref name=SandsMorris2009>{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377\u201389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 | type=Review }}</ref> These modern high yield-cereal crops tend have low [[Protein quality|quality proteins]], with [[essential amino acid]] deficiencies, are high in [[carbohydrate]]s, and lack balanced [[essential fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s and other quality factors.<ref name=SandsMorris2009 /> So-called ancient grains and heirloom varieties have seen an increase in popularity with the \"organic\" movements of the early 21st century, but there is a tradeoff in yield-per-plant, putting pressure on resource-poor areas as food crops are replaced with cash crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/did-quinoa-get-too-popular-for-its-own-good.htm|title=Did Quinoa Get Too Popular for Its Own Good?|date=2018-11-05|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Farming==\n[[File:040719 172 dorset marnhull.jpg|thumb|A wheat field in [[Dorset]], [[England]]]]\nWhile each individual species has its own peculiarities, the cultivation of all cereal crops is similar. Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the \"cool-season\" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately {{convert|30|\u00b0C|disp=sqbr}}, but this varies by species and variety). The \"warm-season\" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.\n\nFor the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need for fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>Kunzig, Robert (April 2011) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text The Big Idea: Perennial Grains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005202205/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text |date=5 October 2011 }}. National Geographic.</ref>\n\n===Planting===\n[[File:Dinr\u00eayes.jpg|thumb|Cereal [[grain]] seeds from left to right, top to bottom: [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oat]].]]\nThe warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.\n\nCool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.\n\nWinter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.\n\n===Harvesting===\n[[File:3-piantagione, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century]]\nOnce the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.\n\nIn developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[grain cradle]].\n\nIf a crop is harvested during humid weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.\n\nIn North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale. Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n[[File:RiceYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide rice production]]\n[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|right|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]\nThe following table shows the annual production of cereals in 1961,{{efn|1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.}} 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production.<ref name=\"prodstat\">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=26 December 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210214103/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | archivedate=10 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Grain\n! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production <br /> (millions of metric tons)\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013\n|-\n| [[Maize]] (corn)\n| align=\"center\" | 205\n| align=\"center\" | 851\n| align=\"center\" | 888\n| align=\"center\" | 872\n| align=\"center\" | 1016\n| A staple food of people in the Americas, Africa, and of [[livestock]] worldwide; often called corn in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

[[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of agriculture. Around the same time, millets and rices were starting to become domesticated in East Asia. Sorghum and millets were also being domesticated in sub-Saharan West Africa.\n\n==Cereals and civilization==\nCereals were the foundation of human civilization. Cereal frontiers coincided with civilizational frontiers. The term [[Fertile Crescent]] explicitely implies the spatial dependence of civilization on cereals. [[The Great Wall]] of China and the [[Roman limes|Roman limes]] demarkated the same northern limit of the cereal cultivation. The [[Silk Road]] stretched along the cereal belt of Eurasia. Numerous Chinese imperial edicts stated: \u201cAgriculture is the foundation of this empire,\u201d<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 86.</ref> while the foundation of agriculture were the [[Five Grains]].  \n\nCereals determined how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. For this reason, [[Shang Yang]] called agriculture and war \u201cthe One.\u201d<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 62.</ref> [[Guan Zhong]], [[Chanakya]] (the author of ''[[Arthashastra]]'')<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 63-64.</ref> and [[Hannibal]]<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 85.</ref> expressed similar concepts. At the dawn of history, the Sumerians believed that if agriculture of a state declines, [[Inanna]], the goddess of war, leaves this state.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 68.</ref> Several gods of antiquity combined the functions of what Shang Yang called \u201cthe One\u201d \u2013 agriculture and war: the Hittite [[Sun goddess of Arinna]], the Canaanite [[Lahmu]] and the Roman [[Janus]]. These were highly important gods in their time leaving their legacy until today. We still begin the year with the month of Janus (January). The Jews believe that Messiah will be born in the town of Lahmu ([[Bethlehem]]) and the Christians believe that he was already born there. Lahmu is the responsible why in Hebrew until today ''bread'' (''lehem'') and ''warfare'' (''lehima'') are of the same root.  In fact, most persistent and flourishing empires throughout history in both hemispheres were centered in regions fertile for cereals.\n\nHistorian Max Ostrovsky argues that this historic pattern never changed, not even in the [[Industrial Age]].<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 111-126.</ref> He stresses that all modern great powers have traditionally remained first and foremost great ''cereal'' powers. The \u201cfinest hour\u201d of the Axis powers \u201cended precisely the moment they threw themselves against the two largest cereal lebensraums\u201d (the United States and the USSR).<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 159.</ref> The outcome of the Cold War followed the Soviet grave and long-lasting cereal crisis, exacerbated by the cereal embargo imposed on the USSR in 1980.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 172.</ref> And, called \u201cthe grain basket of the world,\u201d the most productive \u201ccereal lebensraum\u201d dominates the world ever since.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 206.</ref>\n\nHaving analyzed the mechanism at work behind this pattern, Ostrovsky outlined that the cereal power determines the percentage of manpower available to non-agricultural sectors including the heavy industry vital for military power. He emphasized that chronologically the [[Industrial Revolution]] follows the modern Agricultural Revolution and spatially the world\u2019s industrial regions are bound to cereal regions. Taken from space, map of the global illumination is said to indicate by its brightest parts the industrial regions.<ref>https://www.shutterstock.com/nl/video/clip-28056478-world-city-lights-map-animation-silhouettes-continents</ref> These regions coincide with cereal regions.

Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the \"cool-season\" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately {{convert|30|\u00b0C|disp=sqbr}}, but this varies by species and variety). The \"warm-season\" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.\n\nFor the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need for fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>Kunzig, Robert (April 2011) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text The Big Idea: Perennial Grains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005202205/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text |date=5 October 2011 }}. National Geographic.</ref>\n\n===Planting===\n[[File:Dinr\u00eayes.jpg|thumb|Cereal [[grain]] seeds from left to right, top to bottom: [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oat]].]]\nThe warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.\n\nCool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.\n\nWinter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.\n\n===Harvesting===\n[[File:3-piantagione, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century]]\nOnce the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.\n\nIn developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[grain cradle]].\n\nIf a crop is harvested during humid weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.\n\nIn North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale. Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n[[File:RiceYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide rice production]]\n[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|right|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]\nThe following table shows the annual production of cereals in 1961,{{efn|1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.}} 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production.<ref name=\"prodstat\">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=26 December 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210214103/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | archivedate=10 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Grain\n! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production <br /> (millions of metric tons)\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013\n|-\n| [[Maize]] (corn)\n| align=\"center\" | 205\n| align=\"center\" | 851\n| align=\"center\" | 888\n| align=\"center\" | 872\n| align=\"center\" | 1016\n| A staple food of people in the Americas, Africa, and of [[livestock]] worldwide; often called corn in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

It is high in fiber and protein. Its flour is often used to make [[injera]]. It can also be eaten as a warm breakfast cereal similar to [[farina (food)|farina]] with a chocolate or nutty flavor. Its flour and whole grain products can usually be found in natural foods stores.\n* [[Wild rice]], grown in small amounts in North America.\n\nSeveral other species of wheat have also been domesticated, some very early in the history of agriculture:\n* [[Spelt]], a close relative of common wheat.\n* [[Einkorn]], a wheat species with a single grain.\n* [[Emmer]], one of the first crops domesticated in the [[Fertile Crescent]].\n* [[Durum]], the only [[tetraploid]] species of wheat currently cultivated, used to make [[semolina]].\n* [[Kamut]], an ancient relative of durum with an unknown history.\n\nIn 2013 global cereal production reached a record 2,521 million tonnes. A slight dip to 2,498 million tonnes was forecasted for 2014 by the FAO in July 2014.\n\n== Nutritional facts ==\nSome grains are deficient in the [[essential amino acid]], [[lysine]]. That is why many vegetarian cultures, in order to get a balanced diet, combine their diet of grains with [[legume]]s. Many legumes, however, are deficient in the essential amino acid [[methionine]], which grains contain. Thus, a [[protein combining|combination]] of legumes with [[grain]]s forms a well-balanced diet for vegetarians. Common examples of such combinations are [[dal]] (lentils) with [[rice]] by [[South India]]ns and [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], dal with wheat in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]], [[beans]] with corn tortillas, [[tofu]] with rice, and [[peanut butter]] with wheat bread (as sandwiches) in several other cultures, including the Americas.<ref name=\"vogel301\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/primemovernatura0000voge |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

[[Vacuum tube]] amplifiers are susceptible to (and sources of) [[noise]], and usually produce [[sound pressure level]]s only suitable for larger performance venues. Nonetheless, many purists believe that [[Digital Signal Processing]] will never be able to produce the [[dynamics (music)]], warmth, and complex [[harmonic distortion]] of [[vacuum tubes]]. Soultone advocated improved manufacturing techniques and materials, as well as carefully selected [[new old stock]] (NOS) and modern manufactured components, would produce modern variants of vintage classic amplifiers  with greater reliability and significantly less noise.\n\nWith their modern power controls, Soultone amplifiers can reproduce stadium sized tube distortion sounds all the way down to recording studio, or even bedroom levels. Power Scaling is a power controlling technology, licensed from [[London Power / Power Press]], that lowers the power tube voltages, including proportionately scaled bias voltages, in order to reduce the audible volume; the power amplifier itself is changed from larger to smaller with the turn of a knob.\n\nBy carefully crafting each instrument by hand, boutique builders like Soultone are able to retain a vintage character and flavor not found in other mass-produced products, even when using high-tech innovations.\n\n==Mainstream Competition==\nWith the success of this booming [[cottage industry]] in high dollar musical instrument amplification, the big four manufacturers jumped head long into the boutique manufacturing market. [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], and [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] all currently offer entirely hand wired re-creations of their vintage products, often at costs lower than boutique competition. These products hold an even greater appeal to consumers, as they join the coveted hand-wired hype with household names and corporate longevity. While builders like Soultone have managed to survive this onslaught by combining modern and vintage processes, techniques, and materials, much of this cottage industry is quickly vanishing. Only time will tell if any of these new companies will remain viable, as the big four manufacturers become more responsive to potential buyer's actual desires, thanks largely to the internet. These larger companies have deeper products to dedicate to extensive market research, which could revitalize the musical instrument market with newer products that utilize the \"modern vintage\" approach. Boutique builders may in the end be relying upon their early reputation and momentum to sustain business growth.\n\n==Product Line==\n{{Empty section|date=September 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Guitar amplifier manufacturers|List of guitar amp brands]]\n*[[Guitar speaker]]\n*[[Power attenuator (guitar)]]\n*[[Distortion (guitar)]]\n*[[Instrument amplifier]]\n*[[Bass instrument amplification]]\n*[[Electronic amplifier]]\n*[[Valve sound]]\n*[[Guitar effects]]\n*[[Guitar speaker cabinet]]\n*[[Re-amp]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110345/http://www.soultoneamps.com/index.php Soultone's amplifier pages] \u2014 Manufacturer's web pages.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060715020157/http://www.londonpower.com/index.html London Power] - Kevin O'Connor web pages.\n\n[[Category:Companies based in Chandler, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Guitar amplifier manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Koavf", "label": "safe", "comment": "Marked as unreferenced.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soultone"}

The name represents a Turkish form of the word ''[[\u2018Alawi]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0648\u064a}}) \"of or pertaining to Ali\".\n\nA minority viewpoint is that of the [[Ishikism|Ishikists]], who assert, \"Alevi\" was derived from \"Alev\" (\"[[flame]]\" in Turkish) in reference to fire which is extensively used in Alevi rituals. According to them the use of candles is based on [[Quran]] chapter 24, verses 35 and 36: <blockquote>\"''God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which there is a lamp, the lamp is encased in a glass, the glass is like a radiant planet, which is lit from a blessed olive tree that is neither of the east nor of the west, its oil nearly gives off light even if not touched by fire. Light upon light, God guides to His light whom He pleases. And God sets forth examples for the people, and God is aware of all things. (Lit is such a Light) in houses, which God has permitted to be raised to honor; for the celebration, in them, of His name: In them is He glorified in the mornings and in the evenings, (again and again).''\")</blockquote>\n\n== Beliefs ==\n{{main|Faith|Iman (concept)}}\nAccording to scholar [[Soner Cagaptay|Soner \u00c7a\u011faptay]], Alevism is a \"relatively unstructured interpretation of Islam\".<ref name=Cagaptay-2012/> Journalist Patrick Kingsley states that for some self-described Alevi, their religion is \"simply a cultural identity, rather than a form of worship\".<ref name=\"22-7-17-nyt\" />\n\nMany teachings are based on an orally transmitted tradition, traditionally kept secret from outsiders (but now widely accessible). Alevis commonly profess the Islamic [[shahada]], but adding \"Ali is the ''friend'' of God\".\n\nThe basis for Alevis' most distinctive beliefs is found in the [[Buyruks]] (compiled writings and dialogues of Sheikh [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]], and other worthies). Also included are hymns ''(nefes)'' by figures such as [[Shah Ismail]] or [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], stories of [[Hajji Bektash]] and other lore.\n\n=== God ===\n{{Main|Allah|Muhammad-Ali|Haqq-Muhammad-Ali}}\nIn Alevi cosmology, God is also called [[Al-Haqq]] (the Truth)<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Hande S\u00f6zer ''Managing Invisibility: Dissimulation and Identity Maintenance among Alevi Bulgarian Turks'' BRILL 2014 {{ISBN|978-9-004-27919-3}} page 114</ref> or referred to as [[Allah]].

Each Imam represents a different aspect of the world. They are realized as twelve services or ''On \u0130ki Hizmet'' which are performed by members of the Alevi community. Each Imam is believed to be a reflection of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]], the first Imam of the Shi'ites, and there are references to the \"First Ali\" ''(Birinci Ali),'' [[Hassan ibn Ali|Imam Hasan]] the \"Second 'Ali\" ''(\u0130kinci Ali),'' and so on up to the \"Twelfth 'Ali\" ''(Onikinci Ali),'' [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Imam Mehdi]]. The Twelfth Imam is hidden and represents the [[Messianic Age]].\n\n=== Plurality ===\nThere are two sides to creation, one from a spiritual center to plurality, another from plurality to the spiritual center. Plurality is the separation of pure consciousness from the divine source. It is seen as a curtain alienating creation from the divine source and an illusion which called the ''[[Zahir (Islam)|Z\u0101her\u012b]]'' or ''exoteric'' side to reality. The hidden or true nature of creation is called the ''[[batin (Islam)|b\u0101\u1e6den\u012b]]''<ref name=\"B\u0101\u1e6den\u012b\"/> or the ''esoteric.''\n\nThe fact of plurality in nature is attributed to the infinite potential energy of Kull-i Nafs when it takes corporeal form as it descends into being from Allah. During the Cem ceremony, the cantor or ''a\u015f\u0131k'' sings:\n\n:\"All of us alive or lifeless are from one, this is ineffable, Sultan.\n:For to love and to fall in love has been my fate from time immemorial.\"\n\nThis is sung as a reminder that the reason for creation is love, so that the followers may know themselves and each other and that they may love that which they know.\n[[File:Baghi tomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]'s historical [[tomb]] of [[Al-Baqi']] before being destroyed in 1926.]]\n\n=== The Perfect human being ===\n{{main|Al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil}}\nLinked to the concept of the Prototypical Human is that of the \"Perfect Human Being\" ''([[Alevi Insan-i Kamil|Insan-i Kamil]]).'' Although it is common to refer to Ali and [[Haji Bektash Veli]] or the other Alevi saints as manifestations of the perfect human being, the Perfect Human Being is also identified with our true identity as pure [[consciousness]], hence the [[Qur'an]]ic concept of human beings not having original sin, consciousness being pure and perfect. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The human task is to fully realize this state while still in material human form.\n\nThe perfect human being is also defined in practical terms, as one who is in full moral control of his or her hands, tongue and loins ''(eline diline beline sahip)''; treats all kinds of people equally ''(yetmi\u015f iki millete ayn\u0131 g\u00f6zle bakar)''; and serves the interests of others.

Isolated from both the Sunni [[Ottomans]] and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Alevis developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, Alevis developed a tradition of opposition to all forms of external religion.<ref name=\"angelfire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/ALEVI.html|title=The Alevi of Anatolia|website=angelfire.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423153420/http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/ALEVI.html|archivedate=23 April 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome of the differences that mark Alevis from Sunnis are that they regard themselves as true Muslim followers of Haji Bektash who emphasize the role of Ali in addition to the oneness of God and the prophecy of Muhammad. They accept Ali as the only legitimate successor to Muhammad add to the Witness formula (shahade) the words \"and Ali is God's Friend\". Muhammad and Ali are emanations of the Divine Light - Muhammad is the announcer and Ali is the preserver. Alevis venerate Ehlibeyt - the House of the Prophet (Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hassan, Hussein) - seen as transcendent and superior to all others, and offer them love and reverence (sevgi ve saygi). They reject all enemies of ehlibeyt, especially the Umayyads who are seen as the personification of evil: they imposed Sunnism as the dominant orthodoxy to enslave the masses; distorted true Islam.\n\nAlevis accept Twelver Shi\u2018a beliefs about [[Ali]] and [[the Twelve Imams]]. Moreover, Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] decreed Alevis to be part of the Shia fold in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Nasr, V page 1\">Nasr, V: \"The Shia Revival,\" page 1. Norton, W. W. & Company, Inc, 2006</ref> There are, however, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals that are appreciably different than those of Twelver Shias in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[Lebanon]]. In particular, much of mystical language in the Alevi tradition is inspired by Sufi traditions. Some sources link ''Alevism'' in particular to the [[heterodox]] [[syncretic]]<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\"/> [[Sufi]] group known as the [[Bektashi Order]], which is also Shi'ite.\n\nFurthermore, during the period of [[Ottoman Empire]], Alevis were forbidden to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict endogamy which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group.<ref name=\"Sar\u0131-2017-26\">{{cite book|last1=Sar\u0131|first1=Eren|title=The Alevi Of Anatolia: During the great Turkish expansion from Central Asia .|date=2017|publisher=noktaekitap|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x0y1DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=To+prevent+penetration+by+hostile+outsiders,+the+Alevis+insisted+on+strict+endogamy+which+eventually+made+them+into+a+quasi-ethnic+group#v=onepage&q=To%20prevent%20penetration%20by%20hostile%20outsiders%2C%20the%20Alevis%20insisted%20on%20strict%20endogamy%20which%20eventually%20made%20them%20into%20a%20quasi-ethnic%20group&f=false|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre.

Alevism started in the 14th century by mystical Islamic dissenters in Central Asia, and represent more of a movement rather than a sect.\n\n== Practices ==\n{{main|Four Doors}}\nThe Alevi spiritual path (''yol'') is commonly understood to take place through four major life-stages, or \"gates\".\nThese may be further subdivided into \"[[Four Doors|four gates]], forty levels\" (''[[Four Doors|D\u00f6rt Kap\u0131 K\u0131rk Makam]]''). The first gate (religious law) is considered elementary (and this may be perceived as subtle criticism of other Muslim traditions).\n\nThe following are major crimes that cause an Alevi to be declared ''d\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcn'' (shunned):<ref>Also see, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, ibid, pp. 78\u201381.

The existence of the third and fourth gates is mostly theoretical, though some older Alevis have apparently received initiation into the third.<ref>Kristina Kehl-Bordrogi reports this among the {{lang|tr|Tahtac\u0131}}.

The ceremony's prototype is the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Muhammad's nocturnal ascent into heaven]], where he beheld a gathering of forty saints (''K\u0131rklar Meclisi''), and the Divine Reality made manifest in their leader, Ali.\n\nThe [[Jem (Alevism)|Cem]] ceremony features music, singing, and dancing (''[[:tr:Semah|Sam\u0101h]]'') in which both women and men participate. Rituals are performed in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Zazaki language|Zazaki]], [[Kurmanji language|Kurmanji]] and other local languages.\n\n;Ba\u011flama\n{{main|Ba\u011flama}}\nDuring the [[Jem (Alevism)|''Cem ceremony'']] the ''[[:tr:Halk ozan\u0131|\u00c2\u015f\u0131k]]'' plays the [[Ba\u011flama]] whilst singing spiritual songs, some of which are centuries old and well known amongst Alevis. Every song, called a ''Nefes,'' has spiritual meaning and aims to teach the participants important lessons. One such song goes thus:\n\n:\"Learn from your mistakes and be knowledgeable,\n:Don't look for faults in others,\n:Look at 73 different people in the same way,\n:God loves and created them all, so don't say anything against them.\"\n\n;Sam\u0101h\nA family of ritual dances characterized by turning and swirling, is an inseparable part of any ''cem''. ''Sam\u0101h'' is performed by men and women together, to the accompaniment of the [[Ba\u011flama]]. The dances symbolize (for example) the revolution of the planets around the Sun (by man and woman turning in circles), and the putting off of one's self and uniting with God.\n\n;G\u00f6rg\u00fc Cemi\nThe Rite of Integration ''(g\u00f6rg\u00fc cemi)'' is a complex ritual occasion in which a variety of tasks are allotted to incumbents bound together by extrafamilial brotherhood ''(m\u00fcsahiplik),'' who undertake a dramatization of unity and integration under the direction of the spiritual leader ''(dede).''\n\n;Dem\nThe love of the creator for the created and vice versa is symbolised in the [[Jem (Alevism)|''Cem ceremony'']] by the use of fruit juice and/or red wine{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''[Dem]'' which represents the intoxication of the lover in the beloved. During the ceremony ''Dem'' is one of the twelve duties of the participants.

Painted by [[Fausto Zonaro]].]]\n{{main|Day of Ashura|Nowruz}}\n[[Nowruz|Newruz]] \"New Day\" is the Persian New Year observed on 21 March (the [[Spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|Spring equinox]]) as a celebration of newness and reconciliation. It is celebrated by many modern [[Turkic peoples]] as well. Apart from the original beliefs of the [[Zoroastrian]]s regarding the New Year, Alevis also celebrate and commemorate the birth of Ali, his wedding with Fatima, the rescue of [[Yusuf]] from the well, and the creation of the world on this day. Various cem ceremonies and special programs are held.\n\n==== Mourning of Muharram ====\n[[File:ImamHusaynMosqueKarbalaIraq.jpg|thumb|The grave of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] at [[Karbala]].]]\n{{main|Mourning of Muharram}}\nThe Muslim month of [[Muharram]] begins 20 days after [[Eid ul-Adha]] ({{lang|tr|Kurban Bayram\u0131}}). Alevis observe a fast for the first twelve days. This is called \"{{lang-tr|Muharrem M\u00e2temi}}\", \"{{lang-tr|Y\u00e2s-\u0131 Muharrem}}\" or \"{{lang-tr|M\u00e2tem Orucu}}\" ''([[Mourning of Muharram]])''. This culminates in the festival of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] ({{lang|tr|A\u015fure}}), which commemorates the martyrdom of [[Husayn]] at [[Karbala]]. The fast is broken with a special dish (also called ''a\u015fure'') prepared from a variety (often twelve) of fruits, nuts, and grains. Many events are associated with this celebration, including the salvation of Husayn's son [[Ali ibn Husayn]] from the massacre at Karbala, thus allowing the bloodline of the family of Muhammad to continue.\n\n==== H\u0131d\u0131rellez ====\n[[File:Khidr and elijah.jpg|thumb|A [[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Elijah]] and [[Khidr|al-Khi\u1e0dr]] ''(A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] version of [[Stories of the Prophets]])''.]]\n{{main|H\u0131d\u0131rellez|Khidr}}\n[[H\u0131d\u0131rellez]] honors the mysterious figure [[Khidr]] ({{lang-tr|H\u0131z\u0131r}}) who is sometimes identified with [[Elijah]] (Ilyas), and is said to have drunk of the water of life. Some hold that Khidr comes to the rescue of those in distress on land, while Elijah helps those at sea; and that they meet at a rose tree in the evening of every 6 May. The festival is also celebrated in parts of the Balkans by the name of \"Erdelez,\" where it falls on the same day as [[\u0110ur\u0111evdan]] or [[St. George's Day]].\n\nKhidr is also honored with a three-day fast in mid-February called ''H\u0131z\u0131r Orucu''. In addition to avoiding any sort of comfort or enjoyment, Alevis also abstain from food and water for the entire day, though they do drink liquids other than water during the evening.\n\nNote that the dates of the Khidr holidays can differ among Alevis, most of whom use a lunar calendar, but some a solar calendar.\n\n==== M\u00fcsahiplik ====\n{{main|M\u00fcsahiplik}}\n''M\u00fcsahiplik'' (roughly, \"Companionship\") is a covenant relationship between two men of the same age, preferably along with their wives. In a ceremony in the presence of a dede the partners make a lifelong commitment to care for the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of each other and their children. The ties between couples who have made this commitment is at least as strong as it is for blood relatives, so much so that m\u00fcsahiplik is often called spiritual brotherhood ''(manevi karde\u015flik).'' The children of covenanted couples may not marry.<ref>Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi. 1988. Die Kizilbash/Aleviten, pp. 182\u2013204.</ref>\n\nKrisztina Kehl-Bodrogi reports that the {{lang|tr|Tahtac\u0131}} identify ''m\u00fcsahiplik'' with the first gate ''(\u015feriat),'' since they regard it as a precondition for the second ''(tarikat).'' Those who attain to the third gate ''(marifat'', \"[[gnosis]]\") must have been in a ''m\u00fcsahiplik'' relationship for at least twelve years. Entry into the third gate dissolves the ''m\u00fcsahiplik'' relationship (which otherwise persists unto death), in a ceremony called ''\u00d6z Verme \u00c2yini'' (\"ceremony of giving up the self\").\n\nThe value corresponding to the second gate (and necessary to enter the third) is ''\u00e2\u015final\u0131k'' (\"intimacy,\" perhaps with God).

In this connection, scholar Martin van Bruinessen notes a sign from Turkey's Ministry of Religion, attached to Istanbul's shrine of [[Ey\u00fcp Sultan Mosque|Ey\u00fcp Sultan]], which presents<blockquote>...a long list of \u2018superstitious\u2019 practices that are emphatically declared to be non-Islamic and objectionable, such as lighting candles or placing \u2018wishing stones\u2019 on the tomb, tying pieces of cloth to the shrine or to the trees in front of it, throwing money on the tomb, asking the dead directly for help, circling seven times around the trees in the courtyard or pressing one\u2019s face against the walls of the t\u00fcrbe in the hope of a supernatural cure, tying beads to the shrine and expecting supernatural support from them, sacrificing roosters or turkeys as a vow to the shrine. The list is probably an inventory of common local practices the authorities wish to prevent from re-emerging.<ref>''Religious practices in the Turco-Iranian World,'' 2005.</ref></blockquote>Other, similar practices include kissing door frames of holy rooms; not stepping on the threshold of holy buildings; seeking prayers from reputed healers; and making ''[[lokma]]'' and sharing it with others.\n\n===== Ziyarat to sacred places =====\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|header=Holy [[ziyarat]] places\n|width=216\n|image1=Eyupsultan.JPG\n|caption1=The [[tomb]] of [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] is a place of [[ziyarat]] at the [[Ey\u00fcp Sultan Mosque]] in [[Ey\u00fcp]], [[Istanbul]].\n|image2=Karacaahmet 1.jpg\n|caption2=[[Karacaahmet Cemetery]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].\n}}\n{{main|Hac\u0131bekta\u015f|Battal Gazi|Karacaahmet Cemetery|\u015eahkulu}}\nPerforming [[ziyarat]] and [[dua|du'a]] at the tombs of Alevi-Bektashi saints or [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] is quite common. Some of the most frequently visited sites are the shrines of [[\u015eahkulu Rebellion|\u015eahkulu]] and [[Karacaahmet Cemetery|Karacaahmet]] (both in [[Istanbul]]), Abdal Musa ([[Antalya]]), [[Battal Gazi]] ([[Eski\u015fehir]]), the annual celebrations held at [[Hac\u0131bekta\u015f]] ''(16 August)'' and [[Sivas]] (the [[Pir Sultan]] [[Abdal]] K\u00fclt\u00fcr Etkinlikleri, 23\u201324 June).\n\nIn contrast with the traditional secrecy of the [[Jem (Alevism)|''Cem ceremony'']] ritual, the events at these cultural centers and sites are open to the public. In the case of the [[Hac\u0131bekta\u015f|Hacibekta\u015f celebration]], since 1990 the activities there have been taken over by Turkey's Ministry of Culture in the interest of promoting tourism and Turkish patriotism rather than Alevi spirituality.\n\nSome Alevis make pilgrimages to mountains and other natural sites believed to be imbued with holiness.\n{{further|Pir (Sufism)|Pir Sultan Abdal}}\n\n===== Almsgiving =====\n{{main|Dergah|Vak\u0131f|Zakat}}\nAlevis are expected to give [[Zakat]] but not in the Orthodox-Islamic sense rather there is no [[Calculation of Zak\u0101t|set formula or prescribed amount]] for annual charitable donation as there is in Orthadox Islam (2.5% of possessions above a certain minimum). Rather, they are expected to give the 'excess' according to Qur'an verse 2:219. A common method of Alevi almsgiving is through donating food (especially sacrificial animals) to be shared with worshippers and guests. Alevis also donate money to be used to help the poor, to support the religious, educational and cultural activities of Alevi centers and organizations ''(derg\u00e2h, vak\u0131f, dernek),'' and to provide scholarships for students.\n\n== Society ==\n=== Leadership structure ===\nIn contrast to the Bektashi ''tariqa'', which like other Sufi orders is based on a [[silsila]] \"initiatory chain or lineage\" of teachers and their students, Alevi leaders succeed to their role on the basis of family descent. Perhaps ten percent of Alevis belong to a religious elite called ''ocak'' \"hearth\", indicating descent from Ali and/or various other saints and heroes. ''Ocak'' members are called ''ocakzade''s or \"sons of the hearth\". This system apparently originated with Safavid [[Persia]].\n\nAlevi leaders are variously called ''[[murshid]], [[Pir (Sufism)|pir]], [[Rehber (Alevism)|rehber]]'' or ''[[dedes|dede]].'' Groups that conceive of these as ranks of a hierarchy (as in the Bektashi ''tariqa'') disagree as to the order. The last of these, ''dede'' \"grandfather\", is the term preferred by the scholarly literature. ''Ocakzade''s may attain to the position of ''dede'' on the basis of selection (by a father from among several sons), character, and learning. In contrast to Alevi rhetoric on the equality of the sexes, it is generally assumed that only males may fill such leadership roles.\n\nTraditionally ''Dedes'' did not merely lead rituals, but led their communities, often in conjunction with local notables such as the [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|a\u011fas]] (large landowners) of the [[Tunceli Province|Dersim]] Region. They also acted as judges or arbiters, presiding over village courts called ''[[D\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcnl\u00fck Meydan\u0131]]''.\n\nOrdinary Alevi would owe allegiance to a particular ''dede'' lineage (but not others) on the basis of pre-existing family or village relations. Some fall instead under the authority of Bektashi [[dargah]] (lodges).\n\nIn the wake of 20th century urbanization (which removed young laborers from the villages) and socialist influence (which looked upon the [[Dedes]] with suspicion), the old hierarchy has largely broken down. Many ''Dedes'' now receive salaries from Alevi cultural centers, which arguably subordinates their role. Such centers no longer feature community business or deliberation, such as the old ritual of reconciliation, but emphasize musical and dance performance to the exclusion of these.<ref>See Martin Stokes' study.</ref> Dedes are now approached on a voluntary basis, and their role has become more circumscribed \u2013 limited to religious rituals, research, and giving advice.\n{{Sufism|collapsed=1}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|header=[[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] in [[Hagia Sophia]]\n|width=258\n|image1=01HSI1 (2099855672).jpg \n|caption1='''[[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]''' at right and '''[[Husayn ibn Ali]]''' at left in [[Hagia Sophia]].\n|image2=Name of Prophet Muhammad in Arabic in Hagia Sophia, April 2013.JPG\n|caption2='''[[Hasan ibn Ali]]''' in [[Hagia Sophia]].\n|image3=Hagia Sophia 83.JPG\n|caption3='''[[Husayn ibn Ali]]''' in [[Hagia Sophia]].\n}}\n\n=== Position of women ===\nAccording to John Shindeldecker \"Alevis are proud to point out that they are [[monogamy|monogamous]], Alevi women are encouraged to get the best education they can, and Alevi women are free to go into any occupation they choose.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/02/10/religious-diversity-and-the-alevi-struggle-for-equality-in-turkey/|title=Religious Diversity And The Alevi Struggle For Equality In Turkey|last=Flows|first=Capital|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Relations with other Muslim groups ===\nAlevis are classified as a sect of Shia Islam,<ref>{{cite web|editor=Miller, Tracy |date=October 2009 |format=PDF |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World\u2019s Muslim Population, Pew Research Center |url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010050756/http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-10 }}</ref> as Alevis accept Twelver Shi\u2018a beliefs about Ali and the Twelve Imams, and Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] decreed Alevis to be part of the Shia fold in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Nasr, V page 1\"/> However, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals are appreciably different than those of mainstream, orthodox [[Ja'fari]]-[[Theology of Twelvers|Twelver]] [[Shi\u2018ah]]. According to more orthodox Shia Muslims, Alevis are labeled as ''\"[[Batiniyya]]\" groups'' since Alevis praise Ali beyond what mainstream Shia Muslims expect. According to Alevis, Ali and Muhammad are likened to the two sides of a coin, or the two halves of an apple.\n\n==== Sufi elements in Alevism ====\n{{Further|Qalandariyya|Qutb ad-D\u012bn Haydar}}\nDespite this essentially Shi\u2018i orientation, much of Aleviness' mystical language is inspired by Sufi traditions. For example, the Alevi concept of God is derived from the philosophy of [[Ibn al-'Arabi|Ibn Arabi]] and involves a chain of [[Emanationism|emanation]] from God, to spiritual man, earthly man, animals, plants, and minerals. The goal of spiritual life is to follow this path in the reverse direction, to unity with God, or [[Haqq]] (Reality, Truth). From the highest perspective, all is God (see ''[[Wahdat-ul-Wujood]]).'' Alevis admire [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]], a 10th-century Sufi who was accused of blasphemy and subsequently executed in [[Baghdad]] for saying \"I am the Truth\" ''([[Anal Haq|Ana al-Haqq]]).''\n\nThere is some tension between folk tradition Aleviness and the Bektashi Order, which is a Sufi order founded on Alevi beliefs.<ref>Ataseven, I: \"The Alevi-Bektasi Legacy: Problems of Acquisition and Explanation\", page 1. Coronet Books Inc, 1997</ref> In certain Turkish communities other Sufi orders ( the [[Khalwati order|Halveti]]-[[Jerrahi]] and some of the [[Rifa'i]]) have incorporated significant Alevi influence.\n\n==== Relations with majority Sunnis ====\nThe relationship between Alevis and Sunnis is one of mutual suspicion and prejudice dating back to the Ottoman period. Hundreds of Alevis were murdered in sectarian violence in the years that preceded the [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|1980 coup]], and as late as the 1990s dozens were killed with impunity.<ref name=\"22-7-17-nyt\" /> While pogroms have not occurred since them, the Erdogan has declared \u201ca [[cemevi]] is not a place of worship, it is a center for cultural activities.

Their conversion to Islam in this period was achieved largely through the efforts not of textual scholars (ulema) expounding the finer points of Koranic exegesis and shari\u2018a law, but by charismatic [[Sufi]] dervishes whose cult of Muslim saint worship, mystical divination and [[millenarianism]] spoke more directly to the steppe mindset. These tribes dominated Anatolia for centuries with their religious warriors (ghazi) spearheading the drive against Byzantines and Crusaders.<ref>https://ebookshia.com/upload/bookFiles/656/\u0634\u064a\u0639\u0647_\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646_\u0632\u064a\u0631_\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0647_\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a.PDF</ref>\n{{further|Ak Koyunlu|Kara Koyunlu}}\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n{{further|Ottoman persecution of Alevis|K\u0131z\u0131lba\u015f|\u015eahkulu|Shahkulu Uprising}}\nAs in Khorasan and West Asia before, the Turkmens who spearheaded the Ottomans\u2019 drive into the Balkans and West Asia were more inspired by a vaguely Shiite folk Islam than by formal religion. Many times, Ottoman campaigns were\naccompanied or guided by Bekta\u015fi dervishes, spiritual heirs of the 13th century sufi saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]], himself a native of [[Khorasan]]. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman state became increasingly determined to assert its fiscal but also its juridical and political control over the farthest reaches of the Empire. The resulting [[Qizilbash]] revolts, a series of millenarian anti-state uprisings by the heterodox Turkmen population of Anatolia that culminated in the establishment of a militantly Shiite rival state in neighbouring Iran<ref>https://ebookshia.com/upload/bookFiles/656/\u0634\u064a\u0639\u0647_\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646_\u0632\u064a\u0631_\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0647_\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a.PDF</ref>. The Ottoman Empire later proclaimed themselves its defenders against the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid Shia]] state and related sects. This created a gap between the Sunni Ottoman ruling elite and the Alevi Anatolian population. Anatolia became a battlefield between Safavids and Ottomans, each determined to include it in their empire.\n\n===Republic===\nAccording to Eren Sar\u0131, Alevi saw Kemal Atat\u00fcrk as a [[Mahdi]] \"savior sent to save them from the Sunni Ottoman yoke\".<ref name=\"Sar\u0131-2017-26\"/> However, pogroms against Alevi did not cease after the establishment of Atat\u00fcrk's republic. In attacks against leftists in the 1970s, ultranationalists and reactionaries killed many Alevis. Malatya in 1978, Mara\u015f in 1979, and \u00c7orum in 1980 witnessed the murder of hundreds of Alevis, the torching of hundreds of homes, and lootings.<ref name=memorializeturkey/><ref name=turkishpolicy/>\n\nWhen he came to power in 2003, then Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan|Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] initially promised to strengthen the rights of minorities.

Beginning in the 1960s, many Alevis have migrated to the large cities of western and southern Turkey \u2013 and to western Europe, especially Germany \u2013 and are now heavily urbanized.\n* There is also a native 3000 Alevi community in [[Western Thrace]], [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|author =\u039c\u03c0\u03bf\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 |url=http://www.tovima.gr/world/article/?aid=379767 |title=\u03a4\u039f \u0392\u0397\u039c\u0391 \u2013 \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03b2\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \"\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2\" \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u2013 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 |publisher=Tovima.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n[[File:Hajji Bektash Wali.jpeg|thumb|The founder of the [[Bektashiyyah]] Sufi order [[Haji Bektash Veli|Hac\u0131 Bekta\u015f-\u0131 Veli ''(\u1e24\u0101jj\u012b Bakt\u0101sh Wal\u012b)'']], a [[murid]] of [[Malamatiyya|Mal\u0101mat\u012b]]-[[Qalandariyya|Qal\u0101nd\u0101r\u012b]] [[Sheikh]] [[Qutb ad-D\u012bn Haydar]], who introduced the [[Ahmad Yasavi]]'s [[doctrine]] of ''\"[[Four Doors|Four Doors and Forty Stending]]\"'' into his [[tariqah]].]]\n\n=== Social groups ===\nA Turkish scholar working in France has distinguished four main groups among contemporary Alevis, which cautiously show their distinctive features in modern Turkey.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Alevisme.jpg|thumb|left|[[Calligraphic]] hat in Alevi-[[Bektashism]].]]\n:The first congregation regards themselves as true Muslims and are prepared to cooperate with the state. It adheres to the way of [[Jafar as-Sadiq]], the Sixth Imam. Its concept of ''[[God in Islam|God]]'' is closer to that of orthodox Islam, but like the other two groups already mentioned it considers the [[Quran]] to have been manipulated by the early Sunni [[Caliph]]s in order to eliminate [[Ali]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n:The second group, is said to be under active influence from official Iranian Shi'a to be confirmed adherents to [[Twelver]] and to reject [[Bektashism and folk religion]]. It follows [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] and opposes secular state power.<ref name=\":2\">Bilici, F: \"The Function of Alevi-Bektashi Theology in Modern Turkey\", seminar. Swedish Research Institute, 1996</ref>\n\n:The third group is mainly represented by people who belong to the political left and presumed ''the Aleviness'' just as an outlook on the individual human life rather than a religious conviction by persistently renouncing the ties of the [[Batiniyya]]-Alevism with Twelver political branch of Shia Islam. The followers of this congregation, who later turned out to be the very stern defenders of ''[[Ishikism|Erdo\u011fan \u00c7\u0131nar]],'' hold ritual unions of a religious character and have established cultural associations named after [[Pir Sultan Abdal]] as well. According to their philosophy, human being should enjoy a central role reminiscent of the doctrine of ''[[Khurramites]],'' and as illustrated by [[Hurufism|Hurufi]] phrase of ''God is Man'' quoted above in the context of the [[Trinity]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n:The fourth {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}who adopted some aspirations of ''[[Christian mysticism]],'' is more directed towards heterodox [[mysticism]] and stands closer to the [[Hajji Bektash]]i Brotherhood. According to the philosophy developed by this congregation, [[Christianity|Christian]] [[mysticism|mystic]] [[St Francis of Assisi]] and [[Hindu]] [[Mahatma Gandhi]] are supposedly considered better

This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the Celebi clan, who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called ''Bel evladlar\u0131'' (children of the loins), and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the ''Baba\u011fan,'' those faithful to the path ''([[tariqa|yol]] evladlar\u0131 \u2013 children of the [[tariqa|way]])'' who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\n==== Bektashiyyah doctrine: ''Bektashism and Hurufism'' ====\n{{main|Mysticism|Four Doors|Hajji Bektash Wali|Sharia|Tariqa|Haqiqa|Marifa}}\nThe Bektashi Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide \u2013 called a ''[[Baba (honorific)|baba]]'' in Bektashi parlance \u2013 as well as the doctrine of \"the four gates that must be traversed\": the \"[[Sharia]]\" ''([[religious law]]),'' \"Tariqah\" ''(the spiritual path),'' \"[[Marifa]]\" ''(true knowledge),'' \"[[Haqiqa]]h\" ''(truth).''\n\n===== Wahdat al-Mawjud =====\n{{main|Wahdat al-mawjud}}\n[[File:Syariah-thariqah-hakikah2.jpg|thumb|left|'''[[Four Doors|Four Spiritual Stations]] in Bektashiyyah:''' Sharia, tariqa, [[haqiqa]], and the fourth station, [[marifa]], which is considered \"unseen\", is actually ''the center'' of the ''[[haqiqa]]'' region. [[Marifa]] is the essence of all four stations.]]\n\nBektashism places much emphasis on the concept of [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat al-Mawjud]] \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f, the \"Unity of Being\" that was formulated by [[Ibn Arabi]]. This has often been labeled as [[pantheism]], although creation explained like Wahdat al-wujud [[panentheism]]. It becomes Wahdat al-Mawjud the unity of Haqq-Kosmos-Human . Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked veneration of Ali, the Twelve Imams, and the ritual commemoration of [[Day of Ashura|Ashurah]] marking the Battle of Karbala. The old [[Iran|Persian]] holiday of [[Nowruz]] is celebrated by Bektashis as [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]] Ali's birthday.\n\nIn keeping with the central belief of ''[[Wahdat al-mawjud|Wahdat Al-Mawjud]]'' the Bektashi see reality contained in [[Haqq-Muhammad-Ali]], a single unified entity. Bektashi do not consider this a form of [[trinity]]. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (''muhabbet'') and yearly confession of sins to a ''baba'' (''magfirat-i zunub'' \u0645\u063a\u0641\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0646\u0648\u0628). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|mystical interpretation]] and understanding of the [[Qur'an]] and the prophetic practice ([[Sunnah]]). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Rumi|Jelalludin Rumi]] who are close in spirit to them.\n\n===== Batiniyya and Ismailism =====\n{{Ismailis|collapsed=1}}\n[[File:G\u00fclBaba1.jpg|thumb|258px|[[Cenotaph]] for the [[Bektashi]] [[dervish]] [[G\u00fcl Baba]] at his [[t\u00fcrbe]] in [[Buda]].]]\n{{main|Batiniyya|Ismailism}}\n\nBektashis hold that the Qur'an has two levels of meaning: an outer (''[[Zahir (Islam)|Z\u0101her]]'' \u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631) and an inner (''[[Batin (Islam)|b\u0101\u1e6den]]'' \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646).<ref name=\"B\u0101\u1e6den\u012b\"/> They hold the latter to be superior and eternal and this is reflected in their understanding of both the universe and humanity, which is a view that can also be found in [[Ismailism]] and [[Batiniyya]].<ref name=\"B\u0100\u1e6cEN\u012aYA\">{{cite web|last=Halm|first=H|title=B\u0100\u1e6cEN\u012aYA|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bateniya|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=1 May 2015|authorlink= }}</ref>\n\nBektashism is also [[Initiation|initiatic]] and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the [[Reality]]. First level members are called ''a\u015f\u0131ks'' \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called ''nasip'') one becomes a ''m\u00fchip'' \u0645\u062d\u0628. After some time as a ''m\u00fchip'', one can take further vows and become a ''[[dervish]]''. The next level above dervish is that of ''baba''. The ''baba'' (lit. father) is considered to be the head of a ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]'' and qualified to give spiritual guidance (''irshad'' \u0625\u0631\u0634\u0627\u062f). Above the ''[[Baba (Alevism)|baba]]'' is the rank of ''halife-baba'' (or ''[[Dedes|dede]]'', grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the ''\"[[:tr:Dedebabal\u0131k|dedebaba]]\" (great-grandfather).'' The ''dedebaba'' was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the ''dedebaba'' was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of [[Hajji Bektash Wali]] in the central Anatolian town of [[Hac\u0131bekta\u015f|Hac\u0131bekta\u015f ''(Solucakarah\u00fcy\u00fck)'']].\n{{further|Bektashism|Hurufism}}\n\n[[File:Hismael Sophi.jpg|thumb|258px|[[Shah Ismail I]], the [[Sheikh]] of the Safavi tariqa, founder of the Safavid Dynasty of Iran, of Kurdish ethnicity, and the [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[K\u0131z\u0131lba\u015f]] [[army|armies]].]]\n\n==== Qizilbash ====\n{{main|Qizilbash|Safavids}}\n\nThe [[Kizilbash]] ''(red-heads)'' were Turkmen tribes who adhered to the Safavid Sufi Order, whose Sheikhs claimed descent from Ali. Under Isma`il (d. 1524) they became dominant in Eastern Anatolia and conquered Azerbaijan with its capital Tabriz, where Isma`il named himself Shah in 1501 and went on to conquer all of Iran. His missionaries spread a message of revolt against the Sunni Ottomans in Anatolia, claiming that Isma`il was the awaited [[mahdi]] ''([[messiah]]),'' and Anatolia became the scene of protracted warfare between Ottomans and Safavids.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\n===== Qizilbash doctrine: ''K\u0131z\u0131lba\u015fl\u0131k'' =====\nQizilbash and Bektashi tariqah shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as [[Alevi]]s in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Qizilbash and Bektashi developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, all members of ''Alevism'' developed a tradition of opposition ''(ib\u0101\u1e25a)'' to all forms of external religion.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\nThe doctrine of Qizilbashism is well explained in the following poem written by the [[Shaykh]] of Safaviyya tariqah [[Ismail I]]:\n\n{{Quotation|\u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0646\u0633\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0632\u0647 \u0645 / [[I (pronoun)|M\u0259n]] daha n\u0259sn\u0259 bilm\u0259z\u0259m, // I don't know any other object,\n\n\u0622\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0301\u062f\u064a\u0631 / [[Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali|M\u0259h\u0259mm\u0259d \u018fli]]dir. // [[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]].\n\n\u0627\u0624\u0632\u0648\u0645 \u063a\u0648\u0631\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0647 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0645 / \u00d6z\u00fcm q\u00fcrb\u0259tt\u0259 salmazam, // I can't let out my own essence to places far from my homeland,\n\n\u0622\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0301\u062f\u064a\u0631 / [[Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali|M\u0259h\u0259mm\u0259d \u018fli]]dir. // [[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]].\n\n\u0627\u0648\u0646\u0644\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u064a\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0631\u060c \u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0631 / Onlar birdir, bir olubdur, // They are unique, a single one, i.e. [[Haqq-Muhammad-Ali]],\n\n\u064a\u0626\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u06af\u0624\u064a\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0631 / [[Earth|Yerd\u0259n]] [[Sky|g\u00f6y\u0259]] nur olubdur, // It's a [[N\u016br (Islam)|n\u016br]] from [[Earth]] to [[Sky]],\n\n\u062f\u0624\u0631\u062f \u06af\u0648\u0634\u0647 \u062f\u0647 \u0633\u064a\u0631\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0631\u060c / [[Four (number)|D\u00f6rd]] [[celestial pole|gu\u015f\u0259d\u0259]] sirr olubdur, // It's a mysterious [[occult]] [[secret]] in every corner of the square,\n\n\u0622\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0301\u062f\u064a\u0631 / [[Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali|M\u0259h\u0259mm\u0259d \u018fli]]dir. // [[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]].\n\n\u062e\u062a\u0627\u064a\u0649 \u0628\u0648 \u064a\u0648\u0644\u062f\u0627 \u0633\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0631 / [[Khatai|X\u0259tai]] bu [[tariqah|yolda]] [[secret|sird]]ir, // [[Khatai]] in this tariqah is a mysterious [[occult]] [[secret]],\n\n\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0626\u0631\u0647 \u0646\u0644\u0631 \u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0631 / [[Secret|Sirr]]in ver\u0259nl\u0259r d\u0259 [[soldier|\u0259rdir]], // Those reveal their own [[secret]] are [[Private (rank)|private]] as well,\n\n\u0622\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0633\u064a\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0631\u060c \u06af\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0648\u0631 / [[Moon|Ayda]] [[secret|sird]]ir, [[day|g\u00fcnd\u0259]] nurdur, // [[Secret]] on [[Moon]], [[N\u016br (Islam)|n\u016br]] on [[Sun]],\n\n\u0622\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649\u0301\u062f\u064a\u0631 / [[God in Islam|Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali|M\u0259h\u0259mm\u0259d \u018fli]]dir. // [[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]].}}\n\nThe lines of poetry above may easily be judged as an act of \"[[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]\" ''([[polytheism]])'' by the Sunni [[Ulama]], but they have a [[Batin (Islam)|b\u0101\u1e6den\u012b]]<ref name=\"B\u0101\u1e6den\u012b\"/> [[Ta'wil|ta\u02bew\u012bl]] ''(inner explanation)'' in Qizilbashism.\n{{Further|Khatai|Muhammad-Ali|Haqq-Muhammad-Ali}}\n\n== Alevi music ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Asik Veysel.jpg|thumb|[[A\u015f\u0131k Veysel \u015eat\u0131ro\u011flu]].]]\nAlevi religious services, referred to collectively as ''cem'' or ''\u00e2y\u00een'', include spiritual exercises that incorporate elements of ''[[zikr]]'' (\"remembrance\" or recitation of God's names, in this case without controlled breathing, but with some elements of body posturing) and ''[[sema]]'' (ritual dance). The latter is accompanied by sung mystical poetry in the vernacular, and by the sacred ritual instrument known as ''[[ba\u011flama]]'' or ''[[baglama|saz]]'' (a plucked folk lute with frets).\n\nSuch music is performed by specialists known as ''z\u00e2kir'', ''a\u015f\u0131k'', ''sazende'' or ''g\u00fcvende'', depending on regional usage. They are recruited from Alevi communities and descended from ''dede'' lineages. Many are also known to be poet/minstrels ''(a\u015f\u0131k, ozan)'' who perpetuate the tradition of dervish-lodge ''([[Khanqah|tekke]])'' poets such as [[Yunus Emre]] ''(13th century),'' [[Nes\u00eem\u00ee]] ''(14th century),'' [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], [[Khatai|Hat\u00e2'\u00ee]] and Gen\u00e7 Abdal ''(16th century)'' and Kul Himmet and Kul H\u00fcseyn ''(17th century).'' The poetry was composed in the Turkish vernacular and follows the principles of folk prosody known as ''hece vezne'' in which the focus is the number of syllables.\n[[File:Ruhi su mezar ta\u015f\u0131.JPG|thumb|The [[tomb]] of [[Ruhi Su]] at [[Zincirlikuyu Mezarl\u0131\u011f\u0131]] in [[Istanbul]].]]\nThe specialized sacred musical repertoire of Alevi musicians includes\n:*''Deyi\u015f'' (songs of mystical love)\n:*''Nefes'' (hymns concerning the mystical experience)\n:*''D\u00fcvaz'' or ''d\u0131wes im\u00e2m'' (hymns in honor of the 12 Alid imams)\n:*''Mersiye'' (laments concerning the martyrdom of Imam Huseyn at Karbala)\n:*''Mira\u00e7lama'' (songs about the ascent of the [[Muhammad]] to heaven)\n:*''[[:tr:Semah|Sam\u0101h]]'' (ritual dance accompanied by folk lutes and sung poetry)\n\nThe dances are performed by couples, and choreographies employ circle and line formations as well as arrangements where couples face one another, thus synchronizing their movements more closely. As the tempo of the music increases, the figures become more complex and intense. There are many regional variants of sema, but the most widespread and important are the Dance of the Forty ''(K\u0131rklar Semah\u0131)'' and the Dance of the Cranes ''(Turnalar Semah\u0131).''\n\n[[Jem (Alevism)|The ''\u00e2y\u00een-\u00ee-cem'']] can be heard on the ''JVC CD Turkey \u2013 An Esoteric Sufi Ceremony''. The recording was made in Istanbul in 1993, and the ceremony includes in an order typical of a [[Jem (Alevism)|''cem'']]: a ''deyi\u015f'' that reiterates the line of descent of the sect in a historical framework, two ''divas'' (one based on the poetry of [[Khatai|Hat\u00e2'\u00ee]], and the other on the poetry of Kul Himmet), prayer formulas, the ''ill-[[Allah|\u00c2ll\u00e2h]]'' genre that incorporates the ''tahl\u00eel'' formula into the poem to create an atmosphere of ''zikr'' while sect members create rhythmic intensity by hitting their knees in time to the music and sway their bodies slightly, the Dance of the Forty (K\u0131rklar Semah), the Dance of the Cranes ''(Turnalar Semah\u0131)'' and prayer formulas.\n\nAlevis have a significant role in Turkish music and poetry. [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], a 16th-century Alevi poet whose poems and songs often contain spiritual themes, is revered as a saint and hero. Important figures are the Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]], widely regarded as having been Alevi, and [[Kaygusuz Abdal]]. Their poems shape Turkish culture up to now, and are also performed by modern artists. Songs attributed to these poets have been embraced by left-wingers in the 20th century. The [[Ashik|a\u015f\u0131k]] bards are also influenced by Alevi tradition.\n\nMany of the major traditional musicians in Turkey are Alevi, including [[Arif Sa\u011f]], [[Musa Ero\u011flu]], [[Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f]],<ref>{{cite web |title='Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f'\u0131 camiden yolcu ederek sevap m\u0131 i\u015flediniz?' |url=https://t24.com.tr/haber/neset-ertasi-camiden-yolcu-ederek-sevap-mi-islediniz,214123 |website=T24 |language=Tr}}</ref> [[Erdal Erzincan]], [[A\u015f\u0131k Mahzuni \u015eerif]], [[A\u015f\u0131k Feyzullah \u00c7\u0131nar]], [[A\u015f\u0131k Veysel \u015eat\u0131ro\u011flu]], [[Ali Ekber \u00c7i\u00e7ek]], [[Sabahat Akkiraz]], [[Belk\u0131s Akkale]], and [[Ula\u015f \u00d6zdemir]].

The name represents a Turkish form of the word ''[[\u2018Alawi]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0648\u064a}}) \"of or pertaining to Ali\".\n\nA minority viewpoint is that of the [[Ishikism|Ishikists]], who assert, \"Alevi\" was derived from \"Alev\" (\"[[flame]]\" in Turkish) in reference to fire which is extensively used in Alevi rituals. According to them the use of candles is based on [[Quran]] chapter 24, verses 35 and 36: <blockquote>\"''God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which there is a lamp, the lamp is encased in a glass, the glass is like a radiant planet, which is lit from a blessed olive tree that is neither of the east nor of the west, its oil nearly gives off light even if not touched by fire. Light upon light, God guides to His light whom He pleases. And God sets forth examples for the people, and God is aware of all things. (Lit is such a Light) in houses, which God has permitted to be raised to honor; for the celebration, in them, of His name: In them is He glorified in the mornings and in the evenings, (again and again).''\")</blockquote>\n\n== Beliefs ==\n{{main|Faith|Iman (concept)}}\nAccording to scholar [[Soner Cagaptay|Soner \u00c7a\u011faptay]], Alevism is a \"relatively unstructured interpretation of Islam\".<ref name=Cagaptay-2012/> Journalist Patrick Kingsley states that for some self-described Alevi, their religion is \"simply a cultural identity, rather than a form of worship\".<ref name=\"22-7-17-nyt\" />\n\nMany teachings are based on an orally transmitted tradition, traditionally kept secret from outsiders (but now widely accessible). Alevis commonly profess the Islamic [[shahada]], but adding \"Ali is the ''friend'' of God\".\n\nThe basis for Alevis' most distinctive beliefs is found in the [[Buyruks]] (compiled writings and dialogues of Sheikh [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]], and other worthies). Also included are hymns ''(nefes)'' by figures such as [[Shah Ismail]] or [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], stories of [[Hajji Bektash]] and other lore.\n\n=== God ===\n{{Main|Allah|Muhammad-Ali|Haqq-Muhammad-Ali}}\nIn Alevi cosmology, God is also called [[Al-Haqq]] (the Truth)<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Hande S\u00f6zer ''Managing Invisibility: Dissimulation and Identity Maintenance among Alevi Bulgarian Turks'' BRILL 2014 {{ISBN|978-9-004-27919-3}} page 114</ref> or referred to as [[Allah]].

Each Imam represents a different aspect of the world. They are realized as twelve services or ''On \u0130ki Hizmet'' which are performed by members of the Alevi community. Each Imam is believed to be a reflection of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]], the first Imam of the Shi'ites, and there are references to the \"First Ali\" ''(Birinci Ali),'' [[Hassan ibn Ali|Imam Hasan]] the \"Second 'Ali\" ''(\u0130kinci Ali),'' and so on up to the \"Twelfth 'Ali\" ''(Onikinci Ali),'' [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Imam Mehdi]]. The Twelfth Imam is hidden and represents the [[Messianic Age]].\n\n=== Plurality ===\nThere are two sides to creation, one from a spiritual center to plurality, another from plurality to the spiritual center. Plurality is the separation of pure consciousness from the divine source. It is seen as a curtain alienating creation from the divine source and an illusion which called the ''[[Zahir (Islam)|Z\u0101her\u012b]]'' or ''exoteric'' side to reality. The hidden or true nature of creation is called the ''[[batin (Islam)|b\u0101\u1e6den\u012b]]''<ref name=\"B\u0101\u1e6den\u012b\"/> or the ''esoteric.''\n\nThe fact of plurality in nature is attributed to the infinite potential energy of Kull-i Nafs when it takes corporeal form as it descends into being from Allah. During the Cem ceremony, the cantor or ''a\u015f\u0131k'' sings:\n\n:\"All of us alive or lifeless are from one, this is ineffable, Sultan.\n:For to love and to fall in love has been my fate from time immemorial.\"\n\nThis is sung as a reminder that the reason for creation is love, so that the followers may know themselves and each other and that they may love that which they know.\n[[File:Baghi tomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]'s historical [[tomb]] of [[Al-Baqi']] before being destroyed in 1926.]]\n\n=== The Perfect human being ===\n{{main|Al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil}}\nLinked to the concept of the Prototypical Human is that of the \"Perfect Human Being\" ''([[Alevi Insan-i Kamil|Insan-i Kamil]]).'' Although it is common to refer to Ali and [[Haji Bektash Veli]] or the other Alevi saints as manifestations of the perfect human being, the Perfect Human Being is also identified with our true identity as pure [[consciousness]], hence the [[Qur'an]]ic concept of human beings not having original sin, consciousness being pure and perfect. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The human task is to fully realize this state while still in material human form.\n\nThe perfect human being is also defined in practical terms, as one who is in full moral control of his or her hands, tongue and loins ''(eline diline beline sahip)''; treats all kinds of people equally ''(yetmi\u015f iki millete ayn\u0131 g\u00f6zle bakar)''; and serves the interests of others.

Alevis venerate Ehlibeyt - the House of the Prophet (Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hassan, Hussein) - seen as transcendent and superior to all others, and offer them love and reverence (sevgi ve saygi). They reject all enemies of ehlibeyt, especially the Umayyads who are seen as the personification of evil: they imposed Sunnism as the dominant orthodoxy to enslave the masses; distorted true Islam.\n\nAlevis accept Twelver Shi\u2018a beliefs about [[Ali]] and [[the Twelve Imams]].

The first gate (religious law) is considered elementary (and this may be perceived as subtle criticism of other Muslim traditions).\n\nThe following are major crimes that cause an Alevi to be declared ''d\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcn'' (shunned):<ref>Also see, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, ibid, pp. 78\u201381.

The ceremony's prototype is the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Muhammad's nocturnal ascent into heaven]], where he beheld a gathering of forty saints (''K\u0131rklar Meclisi''), and the Divine Reality made manifest in their leader, Ali.\n\nThe [[Jem (Alevism)|Cem]] ceremony features music, singing, and dancing (''[[:tr:Semah|Sam\u0101h]]'') in which both women and men participate.

Every song, called a ''Nefes,'' has spiritual meaning and aims to teach the participants important lessons. One such song goes thus:\n\n:\"Learn from your mistakes and be knowledgeable,\n:Don't look for faults in others,\n:Look at 73 different people in the same way,\n:God loves and created them all, so don't say anything against them.\"\n\n;Sam\u0101h\nA family of ritual dances characterized by turning and swirling, is an inseparable part of any ''cem''. ''Sam\u0101h'' is performed by men and women together, to the accompaniment of the [[Ba\u011flama]]. The dances symbolize (for example) the revolution of the planets around the Sun (by man and woman turning in circles), and the putting off of one's self and uniting with God.\n\n;G\u00f6rg\u00fc Cemi\nThe Rite of Integration ''(g\u00f6rg\u00fc cemi)'' is a complex ritual occasion in which a variety of tasks are allotted to incumbents bound together by extrafamilial brotherhood ''(m\u00fcsahiplik),'' who undertake a dramatization of unity and integration under the direction of the spiritual leader ''(dede).''\n\n;Dem\nThe love of the creator for the created and vice versa is symbolised in the [[Jem (Alevism)|''Cem ceremony'']] by the use of fruit juice and/or red wine{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''[Dem]'' which represents the intoxication of the lover in the beloved.

It is celebrated by many modern [[Turkic peoples]] as well. Apart from the original beliefs of the [[Zoroastrian]]s regarding the New Year, Alevis also celebrate and commemorate the birth of Ali, his wedding with Fatima, the rescue of [[Yusuf]] from the well, and the creation of the world on this day. Various cem ceremonies and special programs are held.\n\n==== Mourning of Muharram ====\n[[File:ImamHusaynMosqueKarbalaIraq.jpg|thumb|The grave of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] at [[Karbala]].]]\n{{main|Mourning of Muharram}}\nThe Muslim month of [[Muharram]] begins 20 days after [[Eid ul-Adha]] ({{lang|tr|Kurban Bayram\u0131}}). Alevis observe a fast for the first twelve days. This is called \"{{lang-tr|Muharrem M\u00e2temi}}\", \"{{lang-tr|Y\u00e2s-\u0131 Muharrem}}\" or \"{{lang-tr|M\u00e2tem Orucu}}\" ''([[Mourning of Muharram]])''. This culminates in the festival of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] ({{lang|tr|A\u015fure}}), which commemorates the martyrdom of [[Husayn]] at [[Karbala]]. The fast is broken with a special dish (also called ''a\u015fure'') prepared from a variety (often twelve) of fruits, nuts, and grains. Many events are associated with this celebration, including the salvation of Husayn's son [[Ali ibn Husayn]] from the massacre at Karbala, thus allowing the bloodline of the family of Muhammad to continue.\n\n==== H\u0131d\u0131rellez ====\n[[File:Khidr and elijah.jpg|thumb|A [[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Elijah]] and [[Khidr|al-Khi\u1e0dr]] ''(A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] version of [[Stories of the Prophets]])''.]]\n{{main|H\u0131d\u0131rellez|Khidr}}\n[[H\u0131d\u0131rellez]] honors the mysterious figure [[Khidr]] ({{lang-tr|H\u0131z\u0131r}}) who is sometimes identified with [[Elijah]] (Ilyas), and is said to have drunk of the water of life. Some hold that Khidr comes to the rescue of those in distress on land, while Elijah helps those at sea; and that they meet at a rose tree in the evening of every 6 May. The festival is also celebrated in parts of the Balkans by the name of \"Erdelez,\" where it falls on the same day as [[\u0110ur\u0111evdan]] or [[St. George's Day]].\n\nKhidr is also honored with a three-day fast in mid-February called ''H\u0131z\u0131r Orucu''. In addition to avoiding any sort of comfort or enjoyment, Alevis also abstain from food and water for the entire day, though they do drink liquids other than water during the evening.\n\nNote that the dates of the Khidr holidays can differ among Alevis, most of whom use a lunar calendar, but some a solar calendar.\n\n==== M\u00fcsahiplik ====\n{{main|M\u00fcsahiplik}}\n''M\u00fcsahiplik'' (roughly, \"Companionship\") is a covenant relationship between two men of the same age, preferably along with their wives. In a ceremony in the presence of a dede the partners make a lifelong commitment to care for the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of each other and their children. The ties between couples who have made this commitment is at least as strong as it is for blood relatives, so much so that m\u00fcsahiplik is often called spiritual brotherhood ''(manevi karde\u015flik).'' The children of covenanted couples may not marry.<ref>Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi. 1988. Die Kizilbash/Aleviten, pp. 182\u2013204.</ref>\n\nKrisztina Kehl-Bodrogi reports that the {{lang|tr|Tahtac\u0131}} identify ''m\u00fcsahiplik'' with the first gate ''(\u015feriat),'' since they regard it as a precondition for the second ''(tarikat).'' Those who attain to the third gate ''(marifat'', \"[[gnosis]]\") must have been in a ''m\u00fcsahiplik'' relationship for at least twelve years. Entry into the third gate dissolves the ''m\u00fcsahiplik'' relationship (which otherwise persists unto death), in a ceremony called ''\u00d6z Verme \u00c2yini'' (\"ceremony of giving up the self\").\n\nThe value corresponding to the second gate (and necessary to enter the third) is ''\u00e2\u015final\u0131k'' (\"intimacy,\" perhaps with God). Its counterpart for the third gate is called ''pe\u015finelik''; for the fourth gate ''(h\u00e2kikat'', Ultimate Truth), ''c\u0131ng\u0131lda\u015fl\u0131k'' or ''cengilde\u015flik'' (translations uncertain).<ref>See again \"The significance of ''[[m\u00fcsahiplik]]'' among the Alevis\" in ''Synchronistic Religious Communities in the Near East'' (co-edited by her, with B.

In this connection, scholar Martin van Bruinessen notes a sign from Turkey's Ministry of Religion, attached to Istanbul's shrine of [[Ey\u00fcp Sultan Mosque|Ey\u00fcp Sultan]], which presents<blockquote>...a long list of \u2018superstitious\u2019 practices that are emphatically declared to be non-Islamic and objectionable, such as lighting candles or placing \u2018wishing stones\u2019 on the tomb, tying pieces of cloth to the shrine or to the trees in front of it, throwing money on the tomb, asking the dead directly for help, circling seven times around the trees in the courtyard or pressing one\u2019s face against the walls of the t\u00fcrbe in the hope of a supernatural cure, tying beads to the shrine and expecting supernatural support from them, sacrificing roosters or turkeys as a vow to the shrine. The list is probably an inventory of common local practices the authorities wish to prevent from re-emerging.<ref>''Religious practices in the Turco-Iranian World,'' 2005.</ref></blockquote>Other, similar practices include kissing door frames of holy rooms; not stepping on the threshold of holy buildings; seeking prayers from reputed healers; and making ''[[lokma]]'' and sharing it with others.\n\n===== Ziyarat to sacred places =====\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|header=Holy [[ziyarat]] places\n|width=216\n|image1=Eyupsultan.JPG\n|caption1=The [[tomb]] of [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] is a place of [[ziyarat]] at the [[Ey\u00fcp Sultan Mosque]] in [[Ey\u00fcp]], [[Istanbul]].\n|image2=Karacaahmet 1.jpg\n|caption2=[[Karacaahmet Cemetery]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].\n}}\n{{main|Hac\u0131bekta\u015f|Battal Gazi|Karacaahmet Cemetery|\u015eahkulu}}\nPerforming [[ziyarat]] and [[dua|du'a]] at the tombs of Alevi-Bektashi saints or [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] is quite common. Some of the most frequently visited sites are the shrines of [[\u015eahkulu Rebellion|\u015eahkulu]] and [[Karacaahmet Cemetery|Karacaahmet]] (both in [[Istanbul]]), Abdal Musa ([[Antalya]]), [[Battal Gazi]] ([[Eski\u015fehir]]), the annual celebrations held at [[Hac\u0131bekta\u015f]] ''(16 August)'' and [[Sivas]] (the [[Pir Sultan]] [[Abdal]] K\u00fclt\u00fcr Etkinlikleri, 23\u201324 June).\n\nIn contrast with the traditional secrecy of the [[Jem (Alevism)|''Cem ceremony'']] ritual, the events at these cultural centers and sites are open to the public. In the case of the [[Hac\u0131bekta\u015f|Hacibekta\u015f celebration]], since 1990 the activities there have been taken over by Turkey's Ministry of Culture in the interest of promoting tourism and Turkish patriotism rather than Alevi spirituality.\n\nSome Alevis make pilgrimages to mountains and other natural sites believed to be imbued with holiness.\n{{further|Pir (Sufism)|Pir Sultan Abdal}}\n\n===== Almsgiving =====\n{{main|Dergah|Vak\u0131f|Zakat}}\nAlevis are expected to give [[Zakat]] but not in the Orthodox-Islamic sense rather there is no [[Calculation of Zak\u0101t|set formula or prescribed amount]] for annual charitable donation as there is in Orthadox Islam (2.5% of possessions above a certain minimum). Rather, they are expected to give the 'excess' according to Qur'an verse 2:219. A common method of Alevi almsgiving is through donating food (especially sacrificial animals) to be shared with worshippers and guests. Alevis also donate money to be used to help the poor, to support the religious, educational and cultural activities of Alevi centers and organizations ''(derg\u00e2h, vak\u0131f, dernek),'' and to provide scholarships for students.\n\n== Society ==\n=== Leadership structure ===\nIn contrast to the Bektashi ''tariqa'', which like other Sufi orders is based on a [[silsila]] \"initiatory chain or lineage\" of teachers and their students, Alevi leaders succeed to their role on the basis of family descent. Perhaps ten percent of Alevis belong to a religious elite called ''ocak'' \"hearth\", indicating descent from Ali and/or various other saints and heroes. ''Ocak'' members are called ''ocakzade''s or \"sons of the hearth\". This system apparently originated with Safavid [[Persia]].\n\nAlevi leaders are variously called ''[[murshid]], [[Pir (Sufism)|pir]], [[Rehber (Alevism)|rehber]]'' or ''[[dedes|dede]].'' Groups that conceive of these as ranks of a hierarchy (as in the Bektashi ''tariqa'') disagree as to the order. The last of these, ''dede'' \"grandfather\", is the term preferred by the scholarly literature. ''Ocakzade''s may attain to the position of ''dede'' on the basis of selection (by a father from among several sons), character, and learning. In contrast to Alevi rhetoric on the equality of the sexes, it is generally assumed that only males may fill such leadership roles.\n\nTraditionally ''Dedes'' did not merely lead rituals, but led their communities, often in conjunction with local notables such as the [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|a\u011fas]] (large landowners) of the [[Tunceli Province|Dersim]] Region. They also acted as judges or arbiters, presiding over village courts called ''[[D\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcnl\u00fck Meydan\u0131]]''.\n\nOrdinary Alevi would owe allegiance to a particular ''dede'' lineage (but not others) on the basis of pre-existing family or village relations. Some fall instead under the authority of Bektashi [[dargah]] (lodges).\n\nIn the wake of 20th century urbanization (which removed young laborers from the villages) and socialist influence (which looked upon the [[Dedes]] with suspicion), the old hierarchy has largely broken down. Many ''Dedes'' now receive salaries from Alevi cultural centers, which arguably subordinates their role. Such centers no longer feature community business or deliberation, such as the old ritual of reconciliation, but emphasize musical and dance performance to the exclusion of these.<ref>See Martin Stokes' study.</ref> Dedes are now approached on a voluntary basis, and their role has become more circumscribed \u2013 limited to religious rituals, research, and giving advice.\n{{Sufism|collapsed=1}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|header=[[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] in [[Hagia Sophia]]\n|width=258\n|image1=01HSI1 (2099855672).jpg \n|caption1='''[[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]''' at right and '''[[Husayn ibn Ali]]''' at left in [[Hagia Sophia]].\n|image2=Name of Prophet Muhammad in Arabic in Hagia Sophia, April 2013.JPG\n|caption2='''[[Hasan ibn Ali]]''' in [[Hagia Sophia]].\n|image3=Hagia Sophia 83.JPG\n|caption3='''[[Husayn ibn Ali]]''' in [[Hagia Sophia]].\n}}\n\n=== Position of women ===\nAccording to John Shindeldecker \"Alevis are proud to point out that they are [[monogamy|monogamous]], Alevi women are encouraged to get the best education they can, and Alevi women are free to go into any occupation they choose.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/02/10/religious-diversity-and-the-alevi-struggle-for-equality-in-turkey/|title=Religious Diversity And The Alevi Struggle For Equality In Turkey|last=Flows|first=Capital|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Relations with other Muslim groups ===\nAlevis are classified as a sect of Shia Islam,<ref>{{cite web|editor=Miller, Tracy |date=October 2009 |format=PDF |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World\u2019s Muslim Population, Pew Research Center |url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010050756/http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-10 }}</ref> as Alevis accept Twelver Shi\u2018a beliefs about Ali and the Twelve Imams, and Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] decreed Alevis to be part of the Shia fold in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Nasr, V page 1\"/> However, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals are appreciably different than those of mainstream, orthodox [[Ja'fari]]-[[Theology of Twelvers|Twelver]] [[Shi\u2018ah]]. According to more orthodox Shia Muslims, Alevis are labeled as ''\"[[Batiniyya]]\" groups'' since Alevis praise Ali beyond what mainstream Shia Muslims expect. According to Alevis, Ali and Muhammad are likened to the two sides of a coin, or the two halves of an apple.\n\n==== Sufi elements in Alevism ====\n{{Further|Qalandariyya|Qutb ad-D\u012bn Haydar}}\nDespite this essentially Shi\u2018i orientation, much of Aleviness' mystical language is inspired by Sufi traditions. For example, the Alevi concept of God is derived from the philosophy of [[Ibn al-'Arabi|Ibn Arabi]] and involves a chain of [[Emanationism|emanation]] from God, to spiritual man, earthly man, animals, plants, and minerals. The goal of spiritual life is to follow this path in the reverse direction, to unity with God, or [[Haqq]] (Reality, Truth). From the highest perspective, all is God (see ''[[Wahdat-ul-Wujood]]).'' Alevis admire [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]], a 10th-century Sufi who was accused of blasphemy and subsequently executed in [[Baghdad]] for saying \"I am the Truth\" ''([[Anal Haq|Ana al-Haqq]]).''\n\nThere is some tension between folk tradition Aleviness and the Bektashi Order, which is a Sufi order founded on Alevi beliefs.<ref>Ataseven, I: \"The Alevi-Bektasi Legacy: Problems of Acquisition and Explanation\", page 1.

Their conversion to Islam in this period was achieved largely through the efforts not of textual scholars (ulema) expounding the finer points of Koranic exegesis and shari\u2018a law, but by charismatic [[Sufi]] dervishes whose cult of Muslim saint worship, mystical divination and [[millenarianism]] spoke more directly to the steppe mindset. These tribes dominated Anatolia for centuries with their religious warriors (ghazi) spearheading the drive against Byzantines and Crusaders.<ref>https://ebookshia.com/upload/bookFiles/656/\u0634\u064a\u0639\u0647_\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646_\u0632\u064a\u0631_\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0647_\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a.PDF</ref>\n{{further|Ak Koyunlu|Kara Koyunlu}}\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n{{further|Ottoman persecution of Alevis|K\u0131z\u0131lba\u015f|\u015eahkulu|Shahkulu Uprising}}\nAs in Khorasan and western Asia before, the Turkmens who spearheaded the Ottomans\u2019 drive into the Balkans and West Asia were more inspired by a vaguely Shiite folk Islam than by formal religion. Many times, Ottoman campaigns were\naccompanied or guided by Bekta\u015fi dervishes, spiritual heirs of the 13th century sufi saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]], himself a native of [[Khorasan]]. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman state became increasingly determined to assert its fiscal but also its juridical and political control over the farthest reaches of the Empire. The resulting [[Qizilbash]] revolts, a series of millenarian anti-state uprisings by the heterodox Turkmen population of Anatolia that culminated in the establishment of a militantly Shiite rival state in neighbouring Iran<ref>https://ebookshia.com/upload/bookFiles/656/\u0634\u064a\u0639\u0647_\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646_\u0632\u064a\u0631_\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0647_\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a.PDF</ref>. The Ottoman Empire later proclaimed themselves its defenders against the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid Shia]] state and related sects. This created a gap between the Sunni Ottoman ruling elite and the Alevi Anatolian population.

This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the Celebi clan, who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called ''Bel evladlar\u0131'' (children of the loins), and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the ''Baba\u011fan,'' those faithful to the path ''([[tariqa|yol]] evladlar\u0131 \u2013 children of the [[tariqa|way]])'' who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership.<ref name=angelfire/>\n\n==== Bektashiyyah doctrine: ''Bektashism and Hurufism'' ====\n{{main|Mysticism|Four Doors|Hajji Bektash Wali|Sharia|Tariqa|Haqiqa|Marifa}}\nThe Bektashi Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide \u2013 called a ''[[Baba (honorific)|baba]]'' in Bektashi parlance \u2013 as well as the doctrine of \"the four gates that must be traversed\": the \"[[Sharia]]\" ''([[religious law]]),'' \"Tariqah\" ''(the spiritual path),'' \"[[Marifa]]\" ''(true knowledge),'' \"[[Haqiqa]]h\" ''(truth).''\n\n===== Wahdat al-Mawjud =====\n{{main|Wahdat al-mawjud}}\n[[File:Syariah-thariqah-hakikah2.jpg|thumb|left|'''[[Four Doors|Four Spiritual Stations]] in Bektashiyyah:''' Sharia, tariqa, [[haqiqa]], and the fourth station, [[marifa]], which is considered \"unseen\", is actually ''the center'' of the ''[[haqiqa]]'' region. [[Marifa]] is the essence of all four stations.]]\n\nBektashism places much emphasis on the concept of [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat al-Mawjud]] \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f, the \"Unity of Being\" that was formulated by [[Ibn Arabi]]. This has often been labeled as [[pantheism]], although creation explained like Wahdat al-wujud [[panentheism]]. It becomes Wahdat al-Mawjud the unity of Haqq-Kosmos-Human . Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked veneration of Ali, the Twelve Imams, and the ritual commemoration of [[Day of Ashura|Ashurah]] marking the Battle of Karbala. The old [[Iran|Persian]] holiday of [[Nowruz]] is celebrated by Bektashis as [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]] Ali's birthday.\n\nIn keeping with the central belief of ''[[Wahdat al-mawjud|Wahdat Al-Mawjud]]'' the Bektashi see reality contained in [[Haqq-Muhammad-Ali]], a single unified entity. Bektashi do not consider this a form of [[trinity]]. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (''muhabbet'') and yearly confession of sins to a ''baba'' (''magfirat-i zunub'' \u0645\u063a\u0641\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0646\u0648\u0628). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|mystical interpretation]] and understanding of the [[Qur'an]] and the prophetic practice ([[Sunnah]]). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Rumi|Jelalludin Rumi]] who are close in spirit to them.\n\n===== Batiniyya and Ismailism =====\n{{Ismailis|collapsed=1}}\n[[File:G\u00fclBaba1.jpg|thumb|258px|[[Cenotaph]] for the [[Bektashi]] [[dervish]] [[G\u00fcl Baba]] at his [[t\u00fcrbe]] in [[Buda]].]]\n{{main|Batiniyya|Ismailism}}\n\nBektashis hold that the Qur'an has two levels of meaning: an outer (''[[Zahir (Islam)|Z\u0101her]]'' \u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631) and an inner (''[[Batin (Islam)|b\u0101\u1e6den]]'' \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646).<ref name=\"B\u0101\u1e6den\u012b\"/> They hold the latter to be superior and eternal and this is reflected in their understanding of both the universe and humanity, which is a view that can also be found in [[Ismailism]] and [[Batiniyya]].<ref name=\"B\u0100\u1e6cEN\u012aYA\">{{cite web|last=Halm|first=H|title=B\u0100\u1e6cEN\u012aYA|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bateniya|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=1 May 2015|authorlink= }}</ref>\n\nBektashism is also [[Initiation|initiatic]] and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the [[Reality]]. First level members are called ''a\u015f\u0131ks'' \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called ''nasip'') one becomes a ''m\u00fchip'' \u0645\u062d\u0628. After some time as a ''m\u00fchip'', one can take further vows and become a ''[[dervish]]''. The next level above dervish is that of ''baba''. The ''baba'' (lit. father) is considered to be the head of a ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]'' and qualified to give spiritual guidance (''irshad'' \u0625\u0631\u0634\u0627\u062f). Above the ''[[Baba (Alevism)|baba]]'' is the rank of ''halife-baba'' (or ''[[Dedes|dede]]'', grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the ''\"[[:tr:Dedebabal\u0131k|dedebaba]]\" (great-grandfather).'' The ''dedebaba'' was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the ''dedebaba'' was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of [[Hajji Bektash Wali]] in the central Anatolian town of [[Hac\u0131bekta\u015f|Hac\u0131bekta\u015f ''(Solucakarah\u00fcy\u00fck)'']].\n{{further|Bektashism|Hurufism}}\n\n[[File:Hismael Sophi.jpg|thumb|258px|[[Shah Ismail I]], the [[Sheikh]] of the Safavi tariqa, founder of the Safavid Dynasty of Iran, of Kurdish ethnicity, and the [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[K\u0131z\u0131lba\u015f]] [[army|armies]].]]\n\n==== Qizilbash ====\n{{main|Qizilbash|Safavids}}\n\nThe [[Kizilbash]] ''(red-heads)'' were Turkmen tribes who adhered to the Safavid Sufi Order, whose Sheikhs claimed descent from Ali. Under Isma`il (d. 1524) they became dominant in Eastern Anatolia and conquered Azerbaijan with its capital Tabriz, where Isma`il named himself Shah in 1501 and went on to conquer all of Iran.

Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Qizilbash and Bektashi developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community.

The latter is accompanied by sung mystical poetry in the vernacular, and by the sacred ritual instrument known as ''[[ba\u011flama]]'' or ''[[baglama|saz]]'' (a plucked folk lute with frets).\n\nSuch music is performed by specialists known as ''z\u00e2kir'', ''a\u015f\u0131k'', ''sazende'' or ''g\u00fcvende'', depending on regional usage. They are recruited from Alevi communities and descended from ''dede'' lineages. Many are also known to be poet/minstrels ''(a\u015f\u0131k, ozan)'' who perpetuate the tradition of dervish-lodge ''([[Khanqah|tekke]])'' poets such as [[Yunus Emre]] ''(13th century),'' [[Nes\u00eem\u00ee]] ''(14th century),'' [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], [[Khatai|Hat\u00e2'\u00ee]] and Gen\u00e7 Abdal ''(16th century)'' and Kul Himmet and Kul H\u00fcseyn ''(17th century).'' The poetry was composed in the Turkish vernacular and follows the principles of folk prosody known as ''hece vezne'' in which the focus is the number of syllables.\n[[File:Ruhi su mezar ta\u015f\u0131.JPG|thumb|The [[tomb]] of [[Ruhi Su]] at [[Zincirlikuyu Mezarl\u0131\u011f\u0131]] in [[Istanbul]].]]\nThe specialized sacred musical repertoire of Alevi musicians includes\n:*''Deyi\u015f'' (songs of mystical love)\n:*''Nefes'' (hymns concerning the mystical experience)\n:*''D\u00fcvaz'' or ''d\u0131wes im\u00e2m'' (hymns in honor of the 12 Alid imams)\n:*''Mersiye'' (laments concerning the martyrdom of Imam Huseyn at Karbala)\n:*''Mira\u00e7lama'' (songs about the ascent of the [[Muhammad]] to heaven)\n:*''[[:tr:Semah|Sam\u0101h]]'' (ritual dance accompanied by folk lutes and sung poetry)\n\nThe dances are performed by couples, and choreographies employ circle and line formations as well as arrangements where couples face one another, thus synchronizing their movements more closely. As the tempo of the music increases, the figures become more complex and intense. There are many regional variants of sema, but the most widespread and important are the Dance of the Forty ''(K\u0131rklar Semah\u0131)'' and the Dance of the Cranes ''(Turnalar Semah\u0131).''\n\n[[Jem (Alevism)|The ''\u00e2y\u00een-\u00ee-cem'']] can be heard on the ''JVC CD Turkey \u2013 An Esoteric Sufi Ceremony''. The recording was made in Istanbul in 1993, and the ceremony includes in an order typical of a [[Jem (Alevism)|''cem'']]: a ''deyi\u015f'' that reiterates the line of descent of the sect in a historical framework, two ''divas'' (one based on the poetry of [[Khatai|Hat\u00e2'\u00ee]], and the other on the poetry of Kul Himmet), prayer formulas, the ''ill-[[Allah|\u00c2ll\u00e2h]]'' genre that incorporates the ''tahl\u00eel'' formula into the poem to create an atmosphere of ''zikr'' while sect members create rhythmic intensity by hitting their knees in time to the music and sway their bodies slightly, the Dance of the Forty (K\u0131rklar Semah), the Dance of the Cranes ''(Turnalar Semah\u0131)'' and prayer formulas.\n\nAlevis have a significant role in Turkish music and poetry. [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], a 16th-century Alevi poet whose poems and songs often contain spiritual themes, is revered as a saint and hero. Important figures are the Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]], widely regarded as having been Alevi, and [[Kaygusuz Abdal]]. Their poems shape Turkish culture up to now, and are also performed by modern artists. Songs attributed to these poets have been embraced by left-wingers in the 20th century. The [[Ashik|a\u015f\u0131k]] bards are also influenced by Alevi tradition.\n\nMany of the major traditional musicians in Turkey are Alevi, including [[Arif Sa\u011f]], [[Musa Ero\u011flu]], [[Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f]],<ref>{{cite web |title='Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f'\u0131 camiden yolcu ederek sevap m\u0131 i\u015flediniz?' |url=https://t24.com.tr/haber/neset-ertasi-camiden-yolcu-ederek-sevap-mi-islediniz,214123 |website=T24 |language=Tr}}</ref> [[Erdal Erzincan]], [[A\u015f\u0131k Mahzuni \u015eerif]], [[A\u015f\u0131k Feyzullah \u00c7\u0131nar]], [[A\u015f\u0131k Veysel \u015eat\u0131ro\u011flu]], [[Ali Ekber \u00c7i\u00e7ek]], [[Sabahat Akkiraz]], [[Belk\u0131s Akkale]], and [[Ula\u015f \u00d6zdemir]].

It played a major role in the evolution and growth of Indian journalism and made a striking contribution to creating and nurturing the [[Indian Independence Movement|Indian freedom struggle]]. In 1920, [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Communist revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] described ''ABP'' as the best nationalist paper in India.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n''ABP'' was born as a Bengali weekly in February 1868 in the village of Amrita Bazaar in Jessore district (now located in modern-day Bangladesh). It was started by the Ghosh brothers to fight the cause of peasants who were being exploited by indigo planters. Sisir Kumar Ghosh was the first editor. The ''Patrika'' operated out of a battered wooden press purchased for Rs 32.\n\nIn 1871, the ''Patrika'' moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata), due to the outbreak of plague in Amrita Bazaar. Here it functioned as a bilingual weekly, publishing news and views in English and Bengali. Its anti-government views and vast influence among the people was a thorn in the flesh of the government. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the Viceroy of India promulgated the Vernacular Press Act on 1878 mainly against ABP.\n\nThe ''Patrika'' became a daily in 1891. It was the first Indian-owned English daily to go into investigative journalism. During the tenure of [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], a ''Patrika'' journalist rummaged through the waste paper basket of the Viceroy's office and pieced together a torn up letter detailing the Viceroy's plans to annexe Kashmir. ''ABP'' published the letter on its front page, where it was read by the Maharaja of Kashmir, who immediately went to London and lobbied for his independence.\n\nSisir Kumar Ghosh also launched vigorous campaigns against restrictions on civil liberties and economic exploitation. He wanted Indians to be given important posts in the administration. Both he and his brother Motilal were deeply attached to Bal Gangadhar Tilak. When Tilak was prosecuted for sedition in 1897, they raised funds in Calcutta for his defence. They also published a scathing editorial against the judge who sentenced Tilak to 6 years of imprisonment, for 'presuming to teach true patriotism to a proved and unparalleled patriot.'\n\nThe ''Patrika'' had many brushes with [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy of India at the time of the Partition of Bengal (1905). It referred to him as 'Young and a little foppish, and without previous training but invested with unlimited powers.' Because of such editorials, the Press Act of 1910 was passed and a security of Rs 5,000 was demanded from ABP. Motilal Ghosh was also charged with sedition but his eloquence won the case.\n\nAfter this, the ''Patrika'' started prefacing articles criticising the British government with ridiculously exuberant professions of loyalty to the British crown. When Subhas Chandra Bose and other students were expelled from Calcutta Presidency College, the ''Patrika'' took up their case and succeeded in having them re-admitted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nEven after Motilal Ghosh's death in 1922, the ''Patrika'' kept up its nationalist spirit. Higher securities of Rs 10,000 were demanded from it during the [[Salt Satyagraha]]. Its editor Tushar Kanti Ghosh (son of Sisir Kumar Ghosh) was imprisoned. The ''Patrika'' contributed its share to the success of its freedom movement under the leadership of Gandhi and suffered for its views and actions at the hands of the British rulers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe ''Patrika'' espoused the cause of communal harmony during the [[Partition of India]]. During the great Calcutta killings of 1946, the ''Patrika'' left its editorial columns blank for three days.
