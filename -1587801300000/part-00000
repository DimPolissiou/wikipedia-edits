{"title_page": "List of peace activists", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{See also|Anti-war movement|Peace movement}}\n\nThis '''list of peace activists''' includes people who have proactively advocated [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], philosophical, and non-military resolution of major territorial or ideological disputes through [[nonviolent]] means and methods. Peace [[activist]]s usually work with others in the overall [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] and [[peace movement]]s to focus the world's attention on what they perceive to be the irrationality of violent conflicts, decisions, and actions. They thus initiate and facilitate wide public dialogues intended to nonviolently alter long-standing societal agreements directly relating to, and held in place by, the various violent, habitual, and historically fearful thought-processes residing at the core of these conflicts, with the intention of peacefully ending the conflicts themselves.\n\n{{compact ToC|side=no|top=yes|num=no|extlinks=no|custom1=See also|custom2=Notes|custom3=Sources|custom4=Further reading}}\n\n==A==\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:VittorioArrigoni.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vittorio Arrigoni]]]] -->\n[[File:UriAvnery.jpg|thumb|[[Uri Avnery]]]]\n* [[Dekha Ibrahim Abdi]] (1964\u20132011) \u2013 Kenyan peace activist, government consultant\n* [[David Adams (peace activist)|David Adams]] (born 1939) \u2013 American author and peace activist, task force chair of the United Nations [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]], coordinator of the [[Culture of Peace News Network]]\n* [[Jane Addams]] (1860\u20131935) \u2013 American, national chairman of [[Woman's Peace Party]], president of [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]\n* [[Ruth Adler]] (1944\u20131994) \u2013 feminist, and human rights campaigner in Scotland\n* [[Eqbal Ahmad]] (1933/34\u20131999) \u2013 Pakistani political scientist, activist\n* [[Martti Ahtisaari]] (born 1937) \u2013 former president of Finland, active in conflict resolution\n* [[Robert Baker Aitken]] (1917 \u2013 2010) - [[Zen]] Buddhist [[R\u014dshi]] and anti-war activist, [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear testing]] activist, and proponent of [[deep ecology]]\n* [[Tadatoshi Akiba]] (born 1942) \u2013 Japanese pacifist and [[nuclear disarmament]] advocate, former mayor of [[Hiroshima]]\n* [[Widad Akrawi]] (born 1969) \u2013 Danish-Kurdish peace advocate, organizer\n* [[Stew Albert]] (1939\u20132006) \u2013 American anti-Vietnam war activist, organizer\n* [[Abdulkadir Yahya Ali]] (1957\u20132005) \u2013 Somali peace activist and founder of the Center for Research and Dialogue In Somalia\n* [[B.

They were Shoodars before independence, as it's in history, they were forced to accept Islam, while some historians state that they were sex slaves of Mughals. Others believe they're descendants of Clan Loot. It developed as a port around the 15th century AD.<ref name=Tripati/> The port was used for the coastal trade between northern Odisha and [[Kolkata]] to the northeast, and continued to be used to a small extent after independence in 1947. During April, 1998, an agreement was signed to develop the [[Port of Dhamara]], about seven kilometers away on the coast of the [[Bay of Bengal]], as a deep water port.<ref name=DPCL/>\n\nThe temple of the Goddess Maa Dhamrai is located in the town.

Located in the north-western part of the state, it is one of the 30 administrative districts and has its Headquarters at [[Debagarh|Deogarh]] town.\n \nThe district covers an area of 2781.66&nbsp;km\u00b2. The district has a population of 312,520 (2011 Census). As of 2011 it is the least populous district of [[Odisha]] (out of [[List of districts of Odisha|30]]).<ref name=\"districtcensus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php|title=District Census 2011 |accessdate = 2011-09-30|year=2011|publisher=Census2011.co.in}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Bamra State}}\nThe district was created on 1 January 1994 by bifurcating the erstwhile [[Sambalpur district]]. It is domiciled by both tribal and non-tribal people in almost equal proportion.\n\n[[Debagarh|Deogarh]] is the former capital of Bamanda or [[Bamra]] princely state of British India.  The king of this princely state belongs to Ganga vamsi dynasty and one of the extended royal family of Gajapati emperor of Odisha.\n\nRaja Shri Basudeb Sudhal Deb (1869\u20131903) was an enlightened ruler, he did much to further conditions in princely state and for the cause of Oriya nationalism. His contribution was more towards Literature, Education and Art. He established an educational institution, which is currently well known as [[Raja Basu Dev High School]]. His son had equally contributed to the social, cultural and scientific development of Deogarh.  Bamanda was the first princely state to introduce postal, telegraph and electricity in India.\n\nBamanda is a citadel of creative artists which dates back to 5th century A.D. when [[Mathara dynasty|Mathara]] Royal Family was at the helm of the Administration.  After this dynasty, Ganga Rulers came into power and established their capital at Deogarh. Deogarh attained all-round prosperity during the reign of Raja Basudev Sudhal Dev, the most enlightened rulers of this clan. A new horizon was innovated in the field of communication by the foundation of Jagannath Ballav press in 1886 and publication of a weekly magazine the \"Sambalpur Hitaishini\" in 1889. It was during his rule that the jail, police station, post offices, Dispensaries were established and irrigation system was introduced. He had a telephone line of 78 Miles connecting Bamara and Barkote in 1900 was the longest in India during that period. Bamanda's own postal system was very developed. It got affiliated to the British Postal system in 1895. Sir Sudhal Dev, the then King of Bamanda had coined and issued postage stamps in his own Kingdom.

It is domiciled by both tribal and non-tribal people in almost equal proportion.\n\n[[Debagarh|Deogarh]] is the former capital of Bamanda or [[Bamra]] princely state of British India.  The king of this princely state belongs to Ganga vamsi dynasty and one of the extended royal family of Gajapati emperor of Odisha.\n\nRaja Shri Basudeb Sudhal Deb (1869\u20131903) was an enlightened ruler, he did much to further conditions in princely state and for the cause of Oriya nationalism. His contribution was more towards Literature, Education and Art. He established an educational institution, which is currently well known as [[Raja Basu Dev High School]]. His son had equally contributed to the social, cultural and scientific development of Deogarh.  Bamanda was the first princely state to introduce postal, telegraph and electricity in India.\n\nBamanda is a citadel of creative artists which dates back to 5th century A.D. when [[Mathara dynasty|Mathara]] Royal Family was at the helm of the Administration.  After this dynasty, Ganga Rulers came into power and established their capital at Deogarh. Deogarh attained all-round prosperity during the reign of Raja Basudev Sudhal Dev, the most enlightened rulers of this clan. A new horizon was innovated in the field of communication by the foundation of Jagannath Ballav press in 1886 and publication of a weekly magazine the \"Sambalpur Hitaishini\" in 1889. It was during his rule that the jail, police station, post offices, Dispensaries were established and irrigation system was introduced. He had a telephone line of 78 Miles connecting Bamara and Barkote in 1900 was the longest in India during that period. Bamanda's own postal system was very developed. It got affiliated to the British Postal system in 1895. Sir Sudhal Dev, the then King of Bamanda had coined and issued postage stamps in his own Kingdom. He had promulgated paper currency also in his state.\n\nAfter him, his illustrious son Raja Sachidananda Tribhuban Dev undertook the improvement activities of the erstwhile estate. The most outstanding developmental activities was the introduction of the hydro-electric system in Kodarkot water fall by which the Palace, cloth loom, Sugar factory established in 1908 at Rambhei got power supply.

The perfumery products including Kewda attar, Kewda water and Kewda oil (rooh Kewda) derived from this plant are. The [[Ganjam district]] of [[Odisha]] supplies about 85-90% of the India's kewda essence. Kewda grows in the 45&nbsp;km x 15&nbsp;km coastal belt along the [[Bay of Bengal]].\n\n== Kewda industry in Ganjam ==\nThe kewda industry in [[Ganjam]] provides income of 4.5-6 million USD (300-400 million INR) to the local farmers. About 140 traditional distillation units operate in the small scale industries in nearly 200 villages and hamlets of the district producing an estimated 35 million flowers (3,500 tons) worth 10 million [[USD]] annually.\n\nIn [[Odisha]] about 200 kilos of Rooh Kewda are prepared each year at a cost of $7000 per kilo as compared to $1500-$1800 for a fine attar. The attar contains, on the average about 3-5% essence of Kewda with the rest being sandalwood oil. When Rooh Kewda is being prepared 5 different stills are charged with 600 flowers each. Three distillations are done on one batch of flowers. It means that three receivers are assigned to each deg. The first distillate(Agari) yields 10-12 kilos of aromatic water, the second distillate(Pichari) yields the same. In the third(Tigari) liquid parafin is sometimes kept to prepare a cheap quality \"attar\" or only the distillate is kept for making an inexpensive hydrosol. Only the first two distillates(Agari and Pichari) are kept for making the rooh. These are cooled down and in the evening the aromatic water is poured into one deg. It is immediately sealed and the bamboo pipe is connected to the receiver. Very gentle heat is given to the deg and about 5-6 kilos of distillate is collected in the receiver. During this time the receiver must be kept very cool and it is constantly rotated while fresh water is added four to five times.It takes about 1 hour to produce 5-6 kilos of distillate. The receiver is then hung horizontally on a wooden stand. The water is separated and the oil is collected by a special separating funnel. All of the remaining [[hydrosol]] is used in making the next batch of ruh which commences on the next day. About a thousand flowers(about 370 lbs) of flowers produces 1 ounce of Rooh Kewda. The Ruh is very very potent. It contains some of the most precious top notes of the oil which cannot even be captured effectively in an absolute.\n\nThe fragrant [[hydrosol]] produced either as a primary or secondary product has many uses. It is also one of the most important flavoring agents in preparing various food items including syrups, sweets, syrups, and soft drinks.\"Pandanus water is popular in Northern India and mainly used to flavor the fantastic sweets Indians can prepare from so commonplace ingredients as [[milk]] and [[sugar]]: [[rasagola]] (cottage cheese balls cooked in syrup), [[Gulab jamun]] (fried cottage cheese balls served with syrup) and [[rasmalai]] (cottage cheese balls in condensed milk); the latter is also sometimes prepared with saffron instead. Another application are the highly aromatic rice dishes the Moghul cuisine is famous for ([[biriyani]], see cardamom).\n\nIt is important to note that one seldom encounters a genuine kewda ruh, attar or hydrosol in the local market. The chief constituent of kewda oil is methyl ether of [[beta-phenylethyl alcohol]](60-80%) which gives the characteristic aroma of the flowers. This aromatic component is synthesized on a large scale in India and it is widely used to produce so-called kewda products. This single constituent is readily identifiable by any person with some knowledge of perfumery, but in India, the cheapest product is often which is sold the most. There is not yet a great awareness about the difference between natural and synthetic products. The genuine oil, while containing a high percentage of the above-mentioned component contains a great number of other aromatic molecules which truly give the oil its complete profile. A simple gc/ms will easily detect this adulteration as well as show the complexity of the real oil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kewda, From the Travel Journal.

The perfumery products including Kewda attar, Kewda water and Kewda oil (rooh Kewda) derived from this plant are. The [[Ganjam district]] of [[Odisha]] supplies about 85-90% of the India\u2019s kewda essence. Kewda grows in the 45&nbsp;km x 15&nbsp;km coastal belt along the [[Bay of Bengal]].\n\n== Kewda industry in Ganjam ==\nThe kewda industry in [[Ganjam]] provides income of 4.5-6 million USD (300-400 million INR) to the local farmers. About 140 traditional distillation units operate in the small scale industries in nearly 200 villages and hamlets of the district producing an estimated 35 million flowers (3,500 tons) worth 10 million [[USD]] annually.\n\nIn [[Odisha]] about 200 kilos of Rooh Kewda are prepared each year at a cost of $7000 per kilo as compared to $1500-$1800 for a fine attar. The attar contains, on the average about 3-5% essence of Kewda with the rest being sandalwood oil. When Rooh Kewda is being prepared 5 different stills are charged with 600 flowers each. Three distillations are done on one batch of flowers. It means that three receivers are assigned to each deg. The first distillate(Agari) yields 10-12 kilos of aromatic water, the second distillate(Pichari) yields the same. In the third(Tigari) liquid parafin is sometimes kept to prepare a cheap quality \"attar\" or only the distillate is kept for making an inexpensive hydrosol. Only the first two distillates(Agari and Pichari) are kept for making the rooh. These are cooled down and in the evening the aromatic water is poured into one deg. It is immediately sealed and the bamboo pipe is connected to the receiver. Very gentle heat is given to the deg and about 5-6 kilos of distillate is collected in the receiver.
