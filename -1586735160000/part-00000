'90'''\" (also known simply as \"Freedom!\") is a song written, produced, and  performed by [[George Michael]], and released on [[Columbia Records]] in 1990. The \"'90\" added to the end of the title is to prevent confusion with a hit by Michael's former band [[Wham!]], also titled \"[[Freedom (Wham! song)|Freedom]]\". The song's backing beat is a sample from [[James Brown]]'s song \"[[Funky Drummer]]\".\n\nIt was the third single taken from ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'', though released as the second single from the album in the United States and Australia. \"Freedom! '90\" was one of a few uptempo songs on this album. It was a major hit and peaked at No. 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|United States ''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song refers to Michael's past success with Wham!, yet also shows a new side of himself as a new man, who is more cynical about the music business than he had been before. Michael refused to appear in the video and allowed a group of supermodels to appear instead.\n\nMichael performed this song, alongside his 2012 single \"[[White Light (George Michael song)|White Light]]\", during the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]].\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:David Fincher (2012) 3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|The music video for \"Freedom! '90\" was directed by [[David Fincher]].]]\nBy 1990, Michael had grown weary of the pressures of fame, telling the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"At some point in your career, the situation between yourself and the camera reverses. For a certain number of years, you court it and you need it, but ultimately, it needs you more and it's a bit like a relationship. The minute that happens, it turns you off ... and it does feel like it is taking something from you.\" As a direct result, he advertently decided not to appear in photo shoots and music videos,<ref name=Allure>Rogers, Patrick (August 2015). [http://www.allure.com/celebrity-trends/2015/25th-anniversary-george-michael-freedom-video \"The 25th Anniversary of George Michael's 'Freedom' Music Video\"] ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]''.</ref><ref name=Q>Deevoy, Adrian (September 1990). \"Strictly No Admittance: The privatisation of George Michael\". ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''.</ref> saying, \"I would like to never step in front of a camera again.\"<ref name=Q/>\n\nAlthough he relented and decided to film a video for his new song, he still refused to appear in it. Instead, inspired by [[Peter Lindbergh]]'s now-iconic portrait of [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Linda Evangelista]], [[Tatjana Patitz]], [[Christy Turlington]], and [[Cindy Crawford]] for the January 1990 cover of the British edition of ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'', Michael asked the five models to appear in the video. While it was not uncommon at the time for models to appear in music videos, usually such models played the love interest of the singer, as with [[Christie Brinkley]]'s appearance in her future husband [[Billy Joel]]'s \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" video, or Turlington's appearance in [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" video when she was 17 years old. For \"Freedom! '90\", the five models would not portray Michael's on-screen girlfriends, but would [[lip sync]] the song in his place.<ref name=Allure/> The video also included model John Pearson<ref>Guy Trebay and Jacob Bernstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/fashion/george-michael-freedom-video.html https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/fashion/george-michael-freedom-video.html], ''NYTimes'', 30 Dec 2016.</ref> and  fashion photographer [[Mario Sorrenti]].<ref>Patrick Rogers and Sophia Panych, [https://www.allure.com/gallery/george-michael-freedom-video-behind-the-scenes Behind George Michael's \"Freedom! '90\" Video: All the Secrets You Never Knew], ''Allure'', 26 Dec 2016.</ref>\n\nEvangelista took some persuading before agreeing to appear in the video, saying, \"He thought it would make us into a big deal, that it would be good for us. I was like, 'Please, we're here. We've already arrived!'\" After speaking with Michael, she was convinced, and rearranged her schedule. In a 2015 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article, Evangelista reflected on her decision positively, saying, \"Little did I know that to this day, when someone meets me for the first time, they bring up that video. That's what they remember. So yeah, George was right.\" An initial disagreement over their salaries was resolved when Annie Veltri, who represented Crawford, Evangelista, Campbell, and Patitz at [[Elite Model Management]], made it clear that all of her clients would receive the same compensation\u2014$15,000 a day.<ref name=Allure/>\n\nThe video was directed by [[David Fincher]], having directed videos by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Aerosmith]], and [[Paula Abdul]] (who choreographed George Michael's Faith Tour).   His team for the multi-day \"Freedom! '90\" shoot included Camilla Nickerson, who went on to become a ''Vogue'' contributing editor, as the clothes stylist, hair stylist [[Guido Palau|Guido]] and makeup artist Carol Brown. The video was shot in a vast building in the [[London Borough of Merton]] that Nickerson says exhibited \"a grandeur and a ''[[Blade Runner]]'' feel\". Video was shot by cinematographer [[Mike Southon (cinematographer)|Mike Southon]].<ref name=Allure/>\n\nThe 92-sketch storyboard called for each model to film on separate days, with the exception of Evangelista and Turlington, who appear in a scene together. Each model was assigned a verse to lip-synch, while for the song's chorus, Fincher envisioned the three iconic items from Michael's 1987 music video \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\" that had come to symbolize his public image: his leather jacket, a [[Wurlitzer]] jukebox, and guitar, exploding in a ball of flame, except the leather jacket, at each occurrence of the word \"freedom\" during the chorus.  Before the chorus, the leather jacket was simply ignited and burned. Whereas \"Faith\" had opened with a jukebox [[phonograph]] needle touching a vinyl record, \"Freedom! '90\" opens with a [[compact disc]] player's laser beam reading a CD.<ref name=Allure/> In a 2004 interview with [[Adam Mattera|Adam Mattera]] for UK magazine ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', Michael reflected on the significance of the video's symbolism: \"By the end of the ''Faith'' tour I was so miserable because I absolutely knew that I was gay... I didn't suddenly want to come out. I wanted to do it with some kind of dignity. So I thought 'okay, you have to start deconstructing this whole image.' \" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://attitude.co.uk/article/george-michael-discusses-open-relationships-in-frank-2004-attitude-interview-part-3-1/13320/|title=George Michael's candid 2004 interview with Attitude |publisher=Attitude |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nNickerson envisioned a \"low-key street style\" for the wardrobe, which she characterizes as \"a sort of undone beauty\", in contrast to the prevailing \"vampy, larger-than-life\" direction in which the fashion industry, typified by models doing film work, was moving at the time. The black sweater worn by Evangelista was from Nickerson's own closet, and the studded biker boots worn by Campbell belonged to Nickerson's boyfriend. Most of the wardrobe budget, however, went to the 60-foot-long linen sheet used by Turlington, the nature of which was specified by Fincher. Guido looked to each model's personality to devise hairdos that would effect a sense of their \"true beauty\". Evangelista was up until 3:00am the night before the shoot dying her hair platinum blonde, which reflected the cool-blue lights of the set, while Campbell's hair was curled and pulled up with a headband for a 1960s \"tough chic\" in order to highlight her movement for a shot in which she dances solo. Patitz's hair was framed with soft curls and Turlington's was gelled back to exploit her statuesque form as her character crosses the screen trailing the linen sheet. Brown also tried to bring out each model's personality with makeup, saying, \"Cindy was the sexy one; Christy was the cool, classic one; and Linda was the chameleon. She could do anything.\" Following Fincher's instruction that Crawford's makeup look \"completely trashed, as if she'd been in a steamy atmosphere,\" Brown did Crawford's makeup, and then oiled it down by covering her with glycerin. Crawford spent most of her time topless and sitting in an empty bathtub, resting on an apple box so that enough of her would be visible.<ref name=Allure/>\n\nThe video premiered a few weeks after the shoot, and went into heavy rotation on MTV. Reflecting on the video in 2015, Crawford stated that, at the time, they perceived themselves to simply be making \"a really cool video,\" but that in retrospect, the video exhibits a dark humor: As MTV had altered the music industry so that physical beauty was now necessary to sell music, the video used five beautiful faces in lieu of the song's vocalist to poke fun at this.<ref name=Allure/>\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n'''7\" single (UK)''' \u2013 {{small|(Released 30 October 1990)}}\n# \"Freedom!

'90\" was 6:30 long, but a shorter version was made available for radio consumption.  The radio edit was made by removing the upbeat in several portions of the song and cutting straight to the upbeat. The addition of the year to the title was to distinguish the song from \"[[Freedom (Wham! song)|Freedom]]\", a number one hit in the UK for [[Wham!]] in 1984 (number 3 in the US in 1985). It was the second US single from the album ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'', and had contrasting fortunes on each side of the Atlantic\u2014it peaked number 28 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], but was a major success on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching number 8 and selling over 500,000 copies to earn a Gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. It remained in the ''Billboard'' top 40 for 12 weeks in late 1990 and early 1991.<ref>Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits (8th Ed. 2004)</ref> In Canada, Michael achieved another chart-topper.

'90'''\" (also known simply as \"Freedom!\") is a song written, produced, and  performed by [[George Michael]], and released on [[Columbia Records]] in 1990. The \"'90\" added to the end of the title is to prevent confusion with a hit by Michael's former band [[Wham!]], also titled \"[[Freedom (Wham! song)|Freedom]]\". The song's backing beat is a sample from [[James Brown]]'s song \"[[Funky Drummer]]\".\n\nIt was the third single taken from ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'', though released as the second single from the album in the United States and Australia. \"Freedom! '90\" was one of a few uptempo songs on this album. It was a major hit and peaked at No. 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|United States ''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song refers to Michael's past success with Wham!, yet also shows a new side of himself as a new man, who is more cynical about the music business than he had been before. Michael refused to appear in the video and allowed a group of supermodels to appear instead.\n\nMichael performed this song, alongside his 2012 single \"[[White Light (George Michael song)|White Light]]\", during the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]].\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:David Fincher (2012) 3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|The music video for \"Freedom! '90\" was directed by [[David Fincher]].]]\nBy 1990, Michael had grown weary of the pressures of fame, telling the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"At some point in your career, the situation between yourself and the camera reverses. For a certain number of years, you court it and you need it, but ultimately, it needs you more and it's a bit like a relationship. The minute that happens, it turns you off ... and it does feel like it is taking something from you.\" As a direct result, he advertently decided not to appear in photo shoots and music videos,<ref name=Allure>Rogers, Patrick (August 2015). [http://www.allure.com/celebrity-trends/2015/25th-anniversary-george-michael-freedom-video \"The 25th Anniversary of George Michael's 'Freedom' Music Video\"] ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]''.</ref><ref name=Q>Deevoy, Adrian (September 1990). \"Strictly No Admittance: The privatisation of George Michael\". ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''.</ref> saying, \"I would like to never step in front of a camera again.\"<ref name=Q/>\n\nAlthough he relented and decided to film a video for his new song, he still refused to appear in it. Instead, inspired by [[Peter Lindbergh]]'s now-iconic portrait of [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Linda Evangelista]], [[Tatjana Patitz]], [[Christy Turlington]], and [[Cindy Crawford]] for the January 1990 cover of the British edition of ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'', Michael asked the five models to appear in the video. While it was not uncommon at the time for models to appear in music videos, usually such models played the love interest of the singer, as with [[Christie Brinkley]]'s appearance in her future husband [[Billy Joel]]'s \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" video, or Turlington's appearance in [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" video when she was 17 years old. For \"Freedom! '90\", the five models would not portray Michael's on-screen girlfriends, but would [[lip sync]] the song in his place.<ref name=Allure/> The video also included model John Pearson<ref>Guy Trebay and Jacob Bernstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/fashion/george-michael-freedom-video.html https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/fashion/george-michael-freedom-video.html], ''NYTimes'', 30 Dec 2016.</ref> and  fashion photographer [[Mario Sorrenti]].<ref>Patrick Rogers and Sophia Panych, [https://www.allure.com/gallery/george-michael-freedom-video-behind-the-scenes Behind George Michael's \"Freedom! '90\" Video: All the Secrets You Never Knew], ''Allure'', 26 Dec 2016.</ref>\n\nEvangelista took some persuading before agreeing to appear in the video, saying, \"He thought it would make us into a big deal, that it would be good for us. I was like, 'Please, we're here. We've already arrived!'\" After speaking with Michael, she was convinced, and rearranged her schedule. In a 2015 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article, Evangelista reflected on her decision positively, saying, \"Little did I know that to this day, when someone meets me for the first time, they bring up that video. That's what they remember. So yeah, George was right.\" An initial disagreement over their salaries was resolved when Annie Veltri, who represented Crawford, Evangelista, Campbell, and Patitz at [[Elite Model Management]], made it clear that all of her clients would receive the same compensation\u2014$15,000 a day.<ref name=Allure/>\n\nThe video was directed by [[David Fincher]], having directed videos by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Aerosmith]], and [[Paula Abdul]] (who choreographed George Michael's Faith Tour).   His team for the multi-day \"Freedom! '90\" shoot included Camilla Nickerson, who went on to become a ''Vogue'' contributing editor, as the clothes stylist, hair stylist [[Guido Palau|Guido]] and makeup artist Carol Brown. The video was shot in a vast building in the [[London Borough of Merton]] that Nickerson says exhibited \"a grandeur and a ''[[Blade Runner]]'' feel\". Video was shot by cinematographer [[Mike Southon (cinematographer)|Mike Southon]].<ref name=Allure/>\n\nThe 92-sketch storyboard called for each model to film on separate days, with the exception of Evangelista and Turlington, who appear in a scene together. Each model was assigned a verse to lip-synch, while for the song's chorus, Fincher envisioned the three iconic items from Michael's 1987 music video \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\" that had come to symbolize his public image: his leather jacket, a [[Wurlitzer]] jukebox, and guitar, exploding in a ball of flame, except the leather jacket, at each occurrence of the word \"freedom\" during the chorus.  Before the chorus, the leather jacket was simply ignited and burned. Whereas \"Faith\" had opened with a jukebox [[phonograph]] needle touching a vinyl record, \"Freedom! '90\" opens with a [[compact disc]] player's laser beam reading a CD.<ref name=Allure/> In a 2004 interview with [[Adam Mattera|Adam Mattera]] for UK magazine ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', Michael reflected on the significance of the video's symbolism: \"By the end of the ''Faith'' tour I was so miserable because I absolutely knew that I was gay... I didn't suddenly want to come out. I wanted to do it with some kind of dignity. So I thought 'okay, you have to start deconstructing this whole image.' \" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://attitude.co.uk/article/george-michael-discusses-open-relationships-in-frank-2004-attitude-interview-part-3-1/13320/|title=George Michael's candid 2004 interview with Attitude |publisher=Attitude |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nNickerson envisioned a \"low-key street style\" for the wardrobe, which she characterizes as \"a sort of undone beauty\", in contrast to the prevailing \"vampy, larger-than-life\" direction in which the fashion industry, typified by models doing film work, was moving at the time. The black sweater worn by Evangelista was from Nickerson's own closet, and the studded biker boots worn by Campbell belonged to Nickerson's boyfriend. Most of the wardrobe budget, however, went to the 60-foot-long linen sheet used by Turlington, the nature of which was specified by Fincher. Guido looked to each model's personality to devise hairdos that would effect a sense of their \"true beauty\". Evangelista was up until 3:00am the night before the shoot dying her hair platinum blonde, which reflected the cool-blue lights of the set, while Campbell's hair was curled and pulled up with a headband for a 1960s \"tough chic\" in order to highlight her movement for a shot in which she dances solo. Patitz's hair was framed with soft curls and Turlington's was gelled back to exploit her statuesque form as her character crosses the screen trailing the linen sheet. Brown also tried to bring out each model's personality with makeup, saying, \"Cindy was the sexy one; Christy was the cool, classic one; and Linda was the chameleon. She could do anything.\" Following Fincher's instruction that Crawford's makeup look \"completely trashed, as if she'd been in a steamy atmosphere,\" Brown did Crawford's makeup, and then oiled it down by covering her with glycerin. Crawford spent most of her time topless and sitting in an empty bathtub, resting on an apple box so that enough of her would be visible.<ref name=Allure/>\n\nThe video premiered a few weeks after the shoot, and went into heavy rotation on MTV. Reflecting on the video in 2015, Crawford stated that, at the time, they perceived themselves to simply be making \"a really cool video,\" but that in retrospect, the video exhibits a dark humor: As MTV had altered the music industry so that physical beauty was now necessary to sell music, the video used five beautiful faces in lieu of the song's vocalist to poke fun at this.<ref name=Allure/>\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n'''7\" single (UK)''' \u2013 {{small|(Released 30 October 1990)}}\n# \"Freedom!

'90\" was 6:30 long, but a shorter version was made available for radio consumption.  The radio edit was made by removing the upbeat in several portions of the song and cutting straight to the upbeat. The addition of the year to the title was to distinguish the song from \"[[Freedom (Wham! song)|Freedom]]\", a number one hit in the UK for [[Wham!]] in 1984 (number 3 in the US in 1985). It was the second US single from the album ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'', and had contrasting fortunes on each side of the Atlantic\u2014it peaked number 28 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], but was a major success on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching number 8 and selling over 500,000 copies to earn a Gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. It remained in the ''Billboard'' top 40 for 12 weeks in late 1990 and early 1991.<ref>Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits (8th Ed. 2004)</ref> In Canada, Michael achieved another chart-topper.

This article recounts controversies and allegations relating to both the domestic version of CNN, and its sister channels [[CNN International]] and [[CNN-News18]].\n\n==Allegations of bias==\n\nCNN has often been the subject of allegations of [[political party|party]] [[Media bias|bias]]. In research conducted by the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by CNN of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: \"The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates\u2014by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator\u2019s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/2007/10/the-invisible-primary-invisible-no-longer/ |title=The Invisible Primary \u2014 Invisible No Longer - Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy |publisher=Shorensteincenter.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\nIn September 2009, a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the network favorably, and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see CNN unfavorably.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/media/14survey.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Trust in News Media Falls to New Low in Pew Survey | first=Richard | last=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Octavia Nasr firing===\nIn 2010, Chief [[Middle East]] correspondent [[Octavia Nasr]] was fired after a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying she was \"Sad to hear of the passing of Saved [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]]...

Her reason for her removal was given as \"As you know, her tweet over the weekend created a wide reaction.

In research conducted by the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by CNN of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: \"The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates\u2014by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator\u2019s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/2007/10/the-invisible-primary-invisible-no-longer/ |title=The Invisible Primary \u2014 Invisible No Longer - Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy |publisher=Shorensteincenter.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\nIn September 2009, a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the network favorably, and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see CNN unfavorably.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/media/14survey.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Trust in News Media Falls to New Low in Pew Survey | first=Richard | last=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Octavia Nasr firing===\nIn 2010, Chief [[Middle East]] correspondent [[Octavia Nasr]] was fired after a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying she was \"Sad to hear of the passing of Saved [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]]...

However, although they would work, there are further problems:\n* Portable [[Bluetooth]] adapters for wired headsets, can be used as workaround to connect the microphone blocker to wireless hardware devices with Bluetooth connectivity, however while making them susceptible to [[bluesnarfing]].\n* Some hardware devices (eg some [[Google Nexus]] smartphones) have in addition to the internal recording microphone an internal noise cancellation microphone that that may be on all the time, or that may be on in a way that is independent from what is plugged into the audio jack connector.\n\n===Working alternatives===\n* [[Security_switch#Hardware_kill_switch|Hardware kill switch]] (HKS): Some hardware devices can physically disconnect and/or cut power to integrated components with [[security switch]]es.

A [[mobile phone charm]] (especially with TRS connector instead of a rubber plug) can be used to [[concealment device|conceal]] a dummy blocker.\n\nA microphone blocking plug can be used to [[debug]] [[software-defined radio]] that demands a connector to be plugged but they cannot be used to stream radio due to its low [[antenna efficiency]].\n\n====Life hack====\n{{also|Life hack}}\n\nCommon products that can be used as microphone blockers:\n* A 3.5 mm soldering jack plug (TR, TRS, or TRRS), with metal or plastic base - A slim plug with [[right angle]] is recommended to fit the jack plug hole in smartphone cases and to not cause frictions in the socket.\n* A 3.5 TRRS male-male jack plug cable - Another cheap solution that provides two microphone blocking plugs, the cost per plug is usually cheaper than commercial microphone blocking plugs. The cable can either be cut to provide two separate plugs or be left intact to allow plugging into two mobile phones.\n* A headphone cable with microphone, a wired headset, or a wired microphone - More expensive and will provide just one blocking plug.\n\nIt's possible that microphone connectors without a microphone circuit like the above solutions offer low security, because when you plug a connector that has no microphone or microphone circuit, software has the ability to override the default behavior.\n\n===Microphone blocking adapter===\n[[Headset (audio)|Headset]] with an integrated microphone blocker also exist, allowing users to use the [[headphones]] (ie. for listening to music) without risking being eavesdropped. Microphone blocking adapters are phone connectors adapters with a microphone channel and a mechanism that produces a [[False_positives_and_false_negatives#False_positive_error|false positive]] signal simulating a connected microphone. This mechanism cannot be built by pairing multiple connectors: a headset connected to a 3.5 mm TRRS headset extension cable adapter further connected to a 3.5 TRS headphone cable adapter won't trick a connected mobile phone to disconnect its external microphone.\n\n==Applications==\nThis section describes use for both microphone blocking plugs and adapters.\n\n===Eavesdropping protection===\n{{also|Covert listening device|telephone call recording laws|telephone tapping}}\n\nA microphone blocker is a cheap, simple accessory that provides [[countersurveillance]] against eavesdropping, for example recording eavesdropping from [[Signals intelligence|interception]] (like [[cellphone surveillance]]), or [[phone hacking]].

Some products are shipped with a female connectors (with a [[keychain]] hole, or a small strap attached directly to smartphone cases) to prevent loss when the male connector is detached. A [[mobile phone charm]] (especially with TRS connector instead of a rubber plug) can be used to [[concealment device|conceal]] a dummy blocker.\n\nA microphone blocking plug can be used to [[debug]] [[software-defined radio]] that demands a connector to be plugged but they cannot be used to stream radio due to its low [[antenna efficiency]].\n\n====Life hack====\n{{also|Life hack}}\n\nCommon products that can be used as microphone blockers:\n* A 3.5 mm soldering jack plug (TR, TRS, or TRRS), with metal or plastic base - A slim plug with [[right angle]] is recommended to fit the jack plug hole in smartphone cases and to not cause frictions in the socket.\n* A 3.5 TRRS male-male jack plug cable - Another cheap solution that provides two microphone blocking plugs, the cost per plug is usually cheaper than commercial microphone blocking plugs. The cable can either be cut to provide two separate plugs or be left intact to allow plugging into two mobile phones.\n* A headphone cable with microphone, a wired headset, or a wired microphone - More expensive and will provide just one blocking plug.\n\nIt's possible that microphone connectors without a microphone circuit like the above solutions offer low security, because when you plug a connector that has no microphone or microphone circuit, software has the ability to override the default behavior.\n\n===Microphone blocking adapter===\n[[Headset (audio)|Headset]] with an integrated microphone blocker also exist, allowing users to use the [[headphones]] (ie. for listening to music) without risking being eavesdropped. Microphone blocking adapters are phone connectors adapters with a microphone channel and a mechanism that produces a [[False_positives_and_false_negatives#False_positive_error|false positive]] signal simulating a connected microphone. This mechanism cannot be built by pairing multiple connectors: a headset connected to a 3.5 mm TRRS headset extension cable adapter further connected to a 3.5 TRS headphone cable adapter won't trick a connected mobile phone to disconnect its external microphone.\n\n==Applications==\nThis section describes use for both microphone blocking plugs and adapters.\n\n===Eavesdropping protection===\n{{also|Covert listening device|telephone call recording laws|telephone tapping}}\n\nA microphone blocker is a cheap, simple accessory that provides [[countersurveillance]] against eavesdropping, for example recording eavesdropping from [[Signals intelligence|interception]] (like [[cellphone surveillance]]), or [[phone hacking]].
