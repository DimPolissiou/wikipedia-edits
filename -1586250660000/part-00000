Javier Rodriguez Iglesias, {{a.k.a.}} DJ Linetech, produced their first few songs before he was replaced by Peter Goos. The repertoire mainly consisted of 1980s covers. Dancers Alex da Luz and Jorg Van der Heyden completed the original band setup. The group briefly changed their name to Basics (B6), with the additions of female singer CJ and dancer Sofie. As B6, they recorded their first official music video for a remix that Goos made of the [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] hit \"[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]\", which was broadcast on Belgian television channel [[FilmNet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gravitynoir.com/videos_90s/|title=Gravity Noir - Enola Gay (B6 featuring Patrick Knight)|date=1997|website=Gravity Noir|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> The band continued to record demos in the late 1990s under their independent labels Jumping Man Records<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/46485-Jumping-Man-Records|title=Jumping Man Records Label|last=Records|first=Jumping Man|date=1991|website=Discogs|access-date=2019-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828032010/https://www.discogs.com/label/46485-Jumping-Man-Records|archive-date=2019-08-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and A Gravity Production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1092075-A-Gravity-Production/|title=A Gravity Production Label|last=Production|first=A Gravity|date=23 April 2011|website=Discogs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908035911/https://www.discogs.com/label/1092075-A-Gravity-Production|archive-date=8 September 2019|access-date=2019-08-06|url-status=live}}</ref> On 23 April 2011, a first official single called ''I've Got the Power'' was released, under the name of \"The Sisters of Divine Pleasure\", featuring Knight as [[drag queen]] Titless Strang\u00e9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/3CK2ctdmagnuLWfFuQCALU?5=|title=I've got the power by Patrick Knight|date=23 April 2011|website=Spotify|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> In 2016, Knight decided to return to using the name Gravity Noir.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/performer/Gravity%20Noir/writer/Patrick%20Knight|title=ACE repertory|last=Gravity Noir|first=Patrick Knight|date=7 April 2016|website=ASCAP|access-date=2019-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127100731/https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/performer/Gravity%20Noir/writer/Patrick%20Knight|archive-date=27 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Later years and up to present days ==\n[[File:Gravity Noir - Andrew Williams (Band member).jpg|thumb|Andrew Williams]] \nGravity Noir sought to offer members the opportunity to showcase their individual talents and creativity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gravitynoir.com/about|title=About Gravity Noir|last=Gravity Noir|first=About|date=18 March 2016|website=Gravity Noir|archive-url=https://gravitynoir.com/about|archive-date=18 March 2016|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Andrew Williams joined the band in 2016 as a vocalist and wind instrumentalist, and to provide graphic designs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gravitynoir.com/andy-s-art|title=Andy's Art|last=Art|first=Andy's|date=18 March 2016|website=Gravity Noir|archive-url=https://gravitynoir.com/andy-s-art|archive-date=18 March 2016|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Williams is an artistic painter from [[Wakefield]] in [[West Yorkshire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.painters-online.co.uk/artists/andreww16/|title=Andrew Williams|last=on line|first=Painters|date=3 September 2012|website=painters-online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109115519/https://www.painters-online.co.uk/artists/andreww16/|archive-date=9 November 2019|access-date=2019-11-09|url-status=live}}</ref>{{relevance inline|date=March 2020}} Female lead singer Ambrosia Dash, who had lent her voice for Knight's solo projects, has sung several songs since Gravity Noir's comeback.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gravitynoir.com/bandmembers|title=Bandmembers|last=Ambrosia|first=Dash|date=18 March 2016|website=Gravity Noir|archive-url=https://gravitynoir.com/bandmembers|archive-date=18 March 2016|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAn official single and associated video clip called ''Mystery Knight''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://middeleeuwsterapel.nl/videoclip-gravity-noir/|title=Music Video Gravity Noir|last=Ter Apel|first=Middeleeuws|date=13 September 2016|website=Middeleeuws Ter Apel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723145134/https://middeleeuwsterapel.nl/videoclip-gravity-noir/|archive-date=23 July 2019|access-date=2019-07-23|url-status=live}}</ref> was released by Gravity Noir on 7&nbsp;April 2016.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> December 26, 1893{{spaced ndash}}September 9, 1976), also known as '''Chairman Mao''', was a Chinese [[Communism|communist]] [[revolutionary]] who became the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which he ruled as the [[chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. Ideologically a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]], his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]].\n\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]]. He had a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and an [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at [[Peking University]], and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender]] and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government]], which withdrew to [[Taiwan]].\n\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|proclaimed the foundation of the PRC]], a [[single-party state]] controlled by the CPC. In the following years he solidified his control through [[Chinese Land Reform|campaigns against landlords]], [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries|suppression of \"counter-revolutionaries\"]], \"[[Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns]]\" and through the [[Korean War]]. From 1953\u20131958, Mao played an important role in enforcing [[planned economy]] in China, constructing the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|first Constitution of the PRC]], launching the [[Industry of China|industrialisation program]], and initiating the \"[[Two Bombs, One Satellite]]\" project. On the other hand, in 1955-1957, Mao launched the [[Sufan movement]] and the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], with at least 550,000 people persecuted in the latter, most of whom were intellectuals and dissidents. In 1958, he launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] to [[Industrial society|industrial]], which led to the [[Great Chinese Famine|deadliest famine in history]] and the deaths of 20\u201346 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the [[Socialist Education Movement]], and in 1966 he initiated the [[Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent [[class struggle]], widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of [[Mao's cult of personality]]. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions, including [[Liu Shaoqi]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|2nd Chairman of the PRC]]. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its [[family planning policy]], forcing Mao's successors such as [[Deng Xiaoping]] to take [[One-child policy|stricter policies]] to cope with the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation crisis]].\n\nA controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in [[Modern history|modern world history]]. He is also known as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary. During Mao's era, China was involved in the [[Korean War]], the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the rise of [[Khmer Rouge]]; in particular, in 1972, Mao [[1972 Nixon visit to China|welcomed U.S. President Richard Nixon]] in Beijing, signalling the start of [[Open Door Policy#In modern China|a policy]] of opening China to the world. Supporters credit him with driving [[imperialism]] out of China, modernising the nation and building it into a [[world power]], promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, as well as increasing [[life expectancy]] of average Chinese. Conversely, his regime has been called autocratic and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and condemned for bringing about mass repression and destroying religious and cultural artifacts and sites. It was additionally responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 30 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, [[Laogai|prison labour]] and mass executions.\n\n==English Romanization of name==\nDuring Mao's lifetime the English-language media universally rendered his name as '''Mao Tse-tung''', using the [[Wade-Giles]] system of transliteration for Standard Chinese though with the circumflex accent in the syllable \"Ts\u00ea\" dropped. Due to its recognizability, the spelling was used widely, even by the Foreign Ministry of the PRC after pinyin (''[[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]]'') became the PRC's official romanization system for [[Mandarin Chinese]] in 1958.  For example, the well-known booklet of Mao's political statements, ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|\"The Little Red Book\"]]'', was officially entitled ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung'' in English translations.  {{citation needed span|While the pinyin-derived spelling \"Mao Zedong\" is increasingly common, the Wade-Giles-derived spelling \"Mao Tse-tung\" continues to be used in modern publications to some extent.|date=January 2020|reason=As with all material on the Wikipedia website, a source does actually need to be provided for these claims.}}  The spelling \"Mao Zedong\" will be used in the rest of this article, except in citations and reference to the titles of books, articles, and other media.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Mao Zedong}}\n\n===Youth and the Xinhai Revolution: 1893\u20131911===\nMao Zedong was born on December 26, 1893 in [[Shaoshan]] village, [[Hunan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schram|1y=1966|1p=19|2a1=Hollingworth|2y=1985|2p=15|3a1=Pantsov|3a2=Levine|3y=2012|3p=11}} His father, [[Mao Yichang]], was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan.

Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.\n\nUnder the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. The combined effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\">{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- Book has only 188 pages, so page 553 does not look right --></ref>\n\nIn an effort to win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based upon the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of that fictitious harvest for state use, primarily for use in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that rural peasants were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. China's population suffered from the Great Famine during the late 20th century. This came as a result of the lack of food production and distribution to the population of China. The people of urban areas in China were given food stamps each month, but the people of rural areas were expected to grow their own crops and give some of the crops back to the government. The deaths in the rural parts of China out ranked the ones in the Urban cities. Also, the government of China continued to export food to other countries during the Great Famine; this food could have been used to feed the starving citizens. These factors lead to the catastrophic death of about 52 million citizens.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Yushi|first=Mao|date=September 1, 2014|title=Lessons from China's Great Famine|journal=Cato Journal|volume=34|pages=483\u201390|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> The famine was a direct cause of the death of some 30 million Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7225.1619\n| last1 = Smil | first1 = V.\n| title = China's great famine: 40 years later\n| journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)\n| volume = 319\n| issue = 7225\n| pages = 1619\u201321\n| year = 1999\n| pmid = 10600969\n| pmc = 1127087\n}}</ref> Further, many children who became emaciated and malnourished during years of hardship and struggle for survival died shortly after the Great Leap Forward came to an end in 1962.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\"/>\n\nThe extent of Mao's knowledge of the severity of the situation has been disputed.

At a secret meeting in the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai dated March 25, 1959, Mao specifically ordered the party to procure up to one third of all the grain, much more than had ever been the case.

My own view is that this is an instance of Mao's use of hyperbole, another being his casual acceptance of death of half the population during a nuclear war. In other contexts, Mao did not in fact accept mass death. Zhou's Chronology shows that in October 1958, Mao expressed real concern that 40,000 people in Yunnan had starved to death (p. 173).

Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths. At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of \"production at the expense of livelihood.\" While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed. After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned. Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them. Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price. Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals.<ref name=\"wilfulness\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that rightists and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,<ref name=\"Becker81\">{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}</ref> and instead launched a series of \"anti-grain concealment\" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}</ref> Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the cause of the disaster, Mao lost esteem among many of the top party cadres. He was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, and he lost political power to moderate leaders such as [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Mao, however, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal.</blockquote>\n\nThe worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}</ref> As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:\n\n<blockquote>The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAt a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the \"Conference of the Seven Thousand\", State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.<ref name=\"Chang\">{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lsHLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT373&lpg=PT373&dq=Liu+Shaoqi+and+Deng+Xiaoping+rescued+the+economy+by+disbanding+the+people's+communes,+introducing+elements+of+private+control+of+peasant+smallholdings+and+importing+grain+from+Canada+and+Australia+to+mitigate+the+worst+effects+of+famine.|title=50 Great Military Leaders of All Time|last=Tibbetts|first=Jann|date=2016-07-30|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-85505-66-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], Beijing, 1972]]\n\nAt the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as \"right opportunists.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92\u201393}}</ref> A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=127}}</ref>\n\nThe number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\"/> exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.<ref name=\"Becker81\"/>\n\nCensuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958\u201361, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths, as given by [[Hu Yaobang]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=761}}</ref> [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\">Mark O'Neill.

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] resulted in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s withdrawal of all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of [[world communism]]. The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out for local control of the left in numerous countries.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20029719|title = Sino-Soviet Competition in Africa|journal = Foreign Affairs|volume = 42|issue = 4|pages = 640\u2013654|last1 = Scalapino|first1 = Robert A.|year = 1964|doi = 10.2307/20029719}}</ref> Lorenz M. L\u00fcthi argues:\n\n<blockquote>The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement.

Only [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] openly sided with China, thereby forming an alliance between the two countries which would last until after Mao's death in 1976. Warned that the Soviets had nuclear weapons, Mao minimized the threat. Becker says that \"Mao believed that the bomb was a 'paper tiger', declaring to Khrushchev that it would not matter if China lost 300 million people in a nuclear war: the other half of the population would survive to ensure victory\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jasper|last=Becker|title=The Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyGtw4cXJjMC&pg=PA271|year=2002|publisher=Oxford UP|page=271|isbn=978-0-19-972722-3}}</ref>\n\nStalin had established himself as the successor of \"correct\" Marxist thought well before Mao controlled the [[Communist Party of China]], and therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps because of seniority) that the leadership of Marxist doctrine would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favoured Soviets were now denounced as \"revisionists\" and listed alongside \"American imperialism\" as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nPartly surrounded by hostile American military bases in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]], China was now confronted with a new threat from the Soviet Union north and west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of China were in hostile confrontation with each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution===\n{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old ruling elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"perpetual revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.<ref>{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}</ref> State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power as China's head of state and government but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role as Chairman of the Communist Party of China, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalise Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966. Some scholars, such as Mobo Gao, claim the case for this is overstated.<ref>For a full treatment of this idea, see {{Harvnb|Gao|2008}}</ref> Others, such as [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]], hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward.<ref>Jonathan Mirsky.

Chaos reigned in much of the nation, and millions were persecuted. During the Cultural Revolution, nearly all of the schools and universities in China were closed, and the young intellectuals living in cities were ordered to the countryside to be \"re-educated\" by the peasants, where they performed hard manual labour and other work.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of much of China's traditional cultural heritage and the imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as the creation of general economic and social chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined during this period, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into every part of Chinese life, depicted by such Chinese films as ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'', ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]''.

Lin was later officially named as Mao's successor. By 1971, however, a divide between the two men had become apparent. Official history in China states that Lin was planning a military coup or an assassination attempt on Mao. Lin Biao died on September 13, 1971 in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> December 26, 1893{{spaced ndash}}September 9, 1976), also known as '''Chairman Mao''', was a Chinese [[Communism|communist]] [[revolutionary]] who became the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which he ruled as the [[chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. Ideologically a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]], his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]].\n\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]]. He had a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and an [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at [[Peking University]], and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender]] and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government]], which withdrew to [[Taiwan]].\n\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|proclaimed the foundation of the PRC]], a [[single-party state]] controlled by the CPC. In the following years he solidified his control through [[Chinese Land Reform|campaigns against landlords]], [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries|suppression of \"counter-revolutionaries\"]], \"[[Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns]]\" and through the [[Korean War]], which altogether caused the deaths of several-million Chinese. From 1953\u20131958, Mao played an important role in enforcing [[planned economy]] in China, constructing the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|first Constitution of the PRC]], launching the [[Industry of China|industrialisation program]], and initiating the \"[[Two Bombs, One Satellite]]\" project. On the other hand, in 1955-1957, Mao launched the [[Sufan movement]] and the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], with at least 550,000 people persecuted in the latter, most of whom were intellectuals and dissidents. In 1958, he launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] to [[Industrial society|industrial]], which led to the [[Great Chinese Famine|deadliest famine in history]] and the deaths of 20\u201346 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the [[Socialist Education Movement]], and in 1966 he initiated the [[Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent [[class struggle]], widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of [[Mao's cult of personality]]. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions, including [[Liu Shaoqi]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|2nd Chairman of the PRC]]. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its [[family planning policy]], forcing Mao's successors such as [[Deng Xiaoping]] to take [[One-child policy|stricter policies]] to cope with the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation crisis]].\n\nA controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in [[Modern history|modern world history]]. He is also known as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary. During Mao's era, China was involved in the [[Korean War]], the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the rise of [[Khmer Rouge]]; in particular, in 1972, Mao [[1972 Nixon visit to China|welcomed U.S. President Richard Nixon]] in Beijing, signalling the start of [[Open Door Policy#In modern China|a policy]] of opening China to the world. Supporters credit him with driving [[imperialism]] out of China, modernising the nation and building it into a [[world power]], promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, as well as increasing [[life expectancy]] of average Chinese. Conversely, his regime has been called autocratic and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and condemned for bringing about mass repression and destroying religious and cultural artifacts and sites. It was additionally responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 30 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, [[Laogai|prison labour]] and mass executions.\n\n==English Romanization of name==\nDuring Mao's lifetime the English-language media universally rendered his name as '''Mao Tse-tung''', using the [[Wade-Giles]] system of transliteration for Standard Chinese though with the circumflex accent in the syllable \"Ts\u00ea\" dropped. Due to its recognizability, the spelling was used widely, even by the Foreign Ministry of the PRC after pinyin (''[[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]]'') became the PRC's official romanization system for [[Mandarin Chinese]] in 1958.  For example, the well-known booklet of Mao's political statements, ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|\"The Little Red Book\"]]'', was officially entitled ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung'' in English translations.  {{citation needed span|While the pinyin-derived spelling \"Mao Zedong\" is increasingly common, the Wade-Giles-derived spelling \"Mao Tse-tung\" continues to be used in modern publications to some extent.|date=January 2020|reason=As with all material on the Wikipedia website, a source does actually need to be provided for these claims.}}  The spelling \"Mao Zedong\" will be used in the rest of this article, except in citations and reference to the titles of books, articles, and other media.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Mao Zedong}}\n\n===Youth and the Xinhai Revolution: 1893\u20131911===\nMao Zedong was born on December 26, 1893 in [[Shaoshan]] village, [[Hunan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schram|1y=1966|1p=19|2a1=Hollingworth|2y=1985|2p=15|3a1=Pantsov|3a2=Levine|3y=2012|3p=11}} His father, [[Mao Yichang]], was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan. Growing up in rural Hunan, Mao described his father as a stern disciplinarian, who would beat him and his three siblings, the boys [[Mao Zemin|Zemin]] and [[Mao Zetan|Zetan]], as well as an adopted girl, [[Mao Zejian|Zejian]].<ref>{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=19\u201320}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=4\u20135, 15}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=13\u201314}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=13\u2013}}.</ref> Mao's mother, [[Wen Qimei]], was a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude.<ref name=\"Schram1966 p20 Terrill 1980 11\">{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=14, 17}}.</ref> Mao too became a Buddhist, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years.<ref name=\"Schram1966 p20 Terrill 1980 11\"/> At age 8, Mao was sent to Shaoshan Primary School.

Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.\n\nUnder the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. The combined effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\">{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- Book has only 188 pages, so page 553 does not look right --></ref>\n\nIn an effort to win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based upon the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of that fictitious harvest for state use, primarily for use in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that rural peasants were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. China's population suffered from the Great Famine during the late 20th century. This came as a result of the lack of food production and distribution to the population of China. The people of urban areas in China were given food stamps each month, but the people of rural areas were expected to grow their own crops and give some of the crops back to the government. The deaths in the rural parts of China out ranked the ones in the Urban cities. Also, the government of China continued to export food to other countries during the Great Famine; this food could have been used to feed the starving citizens.

At a secret meeting in the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai dated March 25, 1959, Mao specifically ordered the party to procure up to one third of all the grain, much more than had ever been the case. At the meeting he announced that \"To distribute resources evenly will only ruin the Great Leap Forward. When there is not enough to eat, people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.\"<ref name=Dikottersite>{{cite web|title=Famine 2|url=http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|website=web.mac.com|accessdate=28 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809001243/http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|archivedate=August 9, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jasper|title=A utopian nightmare|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/8659581/a-utopian-nightmare/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=2012-10-13}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nProfessor Emeritus Thomas P.

My own view is that this is an instance of Mao's use of hyperbole, another being his casual acceptance of death of half the population during a nuclear war. In other contexts, Mao did not in fact accept mass death. Zhou's Chronology shows that in October 1958, Mao expressed real concern that 40,000 people in Yunnan had starved to death (p. 173). Shortly after the March 25 meeting, he worried about 25.2 million people who were at risk of starvation.<ref name=\"wilfulness\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas P.|first1=Bernstein|title=Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959\u20131960: A Study in Wilfulness|journal=The China Quarterly|date=June 2006|volume=186|issue=186|pages=421\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0305741006000221|jstor=20192620}}</ref> But from late summer on, Mao essentially forgot about this issue, until, as noted, the \"Xinyang Incident\" came to light in October 1960.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Thomas P.|title=Book Reviews: Zhou Xun (ed), The Great Famine in China, 1958\u20131962: A Documentary History|journal=China Perspectives|volume=2013/2|issue=Real Estate Speculation and its Social Consequences|pages=74|url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/6196|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=June 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:People's commone canteen3.jpg|thumb|Early in the Great Leap Forward, commune members were encouraged to eat their fill in communal canteens,<ref>{{Harvnb|Dik\u00f6tter|2010|p=54}}</ref> and later many canteens shut down as they ran out of food and fuel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dik\u00f6tter|2010|p=281}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the article \"Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959\u20131960: A Study in Wilfulness\", published in 2006 in ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', Professor Thomas P. Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths. At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of \"production at the expense of livelihood.\" While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed. After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned. Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them. Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price. Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals.<ref name=\"wilfulness\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that rightists and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,<ref name=\"Becker81\">{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}</ref> and instead launched a series of \"anti-grain concealment\" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}</ref> Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the cause of the disaster, Mao lost esteem among many of the top party cadres. He was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, and he lost political power to moderate leaders such as [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Mao, however, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal.</blockquote>\n\nThe worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}</ref> As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:\n\n<blockquote>The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAt a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the \"Conference of the Seven Thousand\", State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.<ref name=\"Chang\">{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lsHLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT373&lpg=PT373&dq=Liu+Shaoqi+and+Deng+Xiaoping+rescued+the+economy+by+disbanding+the+people's+communes,+introducing+elements+of+private+control+of+peasant+smallholdings+and+importing+grain+from+Canada+and+Australia+to+mitigate+the+worst+effects+of+famine.|title=50 Great Military Leaders of All Time|last=Tibbetts|first=Jann|date=2016-07-30|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-85505-66-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], Beijing, 1972]]\n\nAt the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as \"right opportunists.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92\u201393}}</ref> A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=127}}</ref>\n\nThe number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\"/> exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.<ref name=\"Becker81\"/>\n\nCensuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958\u201361, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths, as given by [[Hu Yaobang]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=761}}</ref> [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\">Mark O'Neill.

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] resulted in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s withdrawal of all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of [[world communism]]. The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out for local control of the left in numerous countries.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20029719|title = Sino-Soviet Competition in Africa|journal = Foreign Affairs|volume = 42|issue = 4|pages = 640\u2013654|last1 = Scalapino|first1 = Robert A.|year = 1964|doi = 10.2307/20029719}}</ref> Lorenz M. L\u00fcthi argues:\n\n<blockquote>The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement.

Only [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] openly sided with China, thereby forming an alliance between the two countries which would last until after Mao's death in 1976. Warned that the Soviets had nuclear weapons, Mao minimized the threat. Becker says that \"Mao believed that the bomb was a 'paper tiger', declaring to Khrushchev that it would not matter if China lost 300 million people in a nuclear war: the other half of the population would survive to ensure victory\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jasper|last=Becker|title=The Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyGtw4cXJjMC&pg=PA271|year=2002|publisher=Oxford UP|page=271|isbn=978-0-19-972722-3}}</ref>\n\nStalin had established himself as the successor of \"correct\" Marxist thought well before Mao controlled the [[Communist Party of China]], and therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps because of seniority) that the leadership of Marxist doctrine would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favoured Soviets were now denounced as \"revisionists\" and listed alongside \"American imperialism\" as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nPartly surrounded by hostile American military bases in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]], China was now confronted with a new threat from the Soviet Union north and west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of China were in hostile confrontation with each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution===\n{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old ruling elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"perpetual revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.<ref>{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}</ref> State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power as China's head of state and government but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role as Chairman of the Communist Party of China, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalise Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966. Some scholars, such as Mobo Gao, claim the case for this is overstated.<ref>For a full treatment of this idea, see {{Harvnb|Gao|2008}}</ref> Others, such as [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]], hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward.<ref>Jonathan Mirsky.

Lin Biao died on September 13, 1971 in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures.

And Jackson still appears on $20 bills, even though Americans tend to view as heinous the institution of slavery (of which he was a passionate defender) and the early 19th-century military campaigns against Native Americans (in which he took part).\n\nAt times Jackson, for all his flaws, is invoked as representing an egalitarian strain within the American democratic tradition, a [[self-made man]] of the people who rose to power via straight talk and was not allied with moneyed interests.

Sixty-four teams participate in the competition, including all clubs from the [[Bundesliga]] and the [[2. Bundesliga]]. It is considered the second-most important club title in German football after the Bundesliga championship. Taking place from August until June, the winner qualifies for the [[DFL-Supercup]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]] unless the winner already qualifies for the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe competition was founded in 1935, then called the ''[[Hans von Tschammer und Osten|Tschammer]]-Pokal''. The first titleholder were [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]]. In 1937, [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] were the first team to win [[Double (association football)|the double]]. The Tschammer-Pokal was suspended in 1944 due to [[World War II]] and disbanded following the demise of [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1952\u201353, the cup was reinstated in [[West Germany]] as the ''DFB-Pokal'', named after the DFB, and was won by [[Rot-Weiss Essen]]. ([[FDGB-Pokal]], the [[East Germany|East German]] equivalent, started in 1949 and operated through the [[1990\u201391 NOFV-Pokal|1991 season]], when it merged with the DFB-Pokal.)\n\n[[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] have won the most titles with 19 wins, while they are also the current title holders. [[Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf]] hold the record for most consecutive tournament game wins (18) between 1978 and 1981, winning the cup in 1979 and 1980.\n\n==Format==\n[[Image:DFB Pokal.jpg|thumb|right|The trophy]]\nThe competition format has varied considerably since the inception of the ''Tschammer-Pokal'' in 1935.\n\n===Participation===\nThe DFB-Pokal begins with a round of 64 teams. The 36 teams of the [[Bundesliga]] and [[2. Bundesliga]], along with the top four finishers of the [[3. Liga]] are automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots 21 are given to the cup winners of the regional football associations, the ''[[Verbandspokal]]e''. The three remaining slots are given to the three regional associations with the most men's teams. They may assign the slot as they see fit but usually give it to the runner-up in the association cup. As every team taking part in the [[German football league system]] is entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualify for the association cups, every team can in principle compete in the DFB-Pokal. Reserve teams like [[Borussia Dortmund II]] are not permitted to enter.<ref name=rules>{{cite web|title=DFB Cup Men \u2013 Mode |publisher=DFB |year=2008 |accessdate=9 October 2008 |url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460546 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609211623/https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460546 |archivedate=9 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Seeding===\nFor the first round, the 64 teams are split into two pots of 32.

Sixty-four teams participate in the competition, including all clubs from the [[Bundesliga]] and the [[2. Bundesliga]]. It is considered the second-most important club title in German football after the Bundesliga championship. Taking place from August until June, the winner qualifies for the [[DFL-Supercup]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]] unless the winner already qualifies for the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe competition was founded in 1935, then called the ''[[Hans von Tschammer und Osten|Tschammer]]-Pokal''. The first titleholder were [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]]. In 1937, [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] were the first team to win [[Double (association football)|the double]]. The Tschammer-Pokal was suspended in 1944 due to [[World War II]] and disbanded following the demise of [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1952\u201353, the cup was reinstated in [[West Germany]] as the ''DFB-Pokal'', named after the DFB, and was won by [[Rot-Weiss Essen]]. ([[FDGB-Pokal]], the [[East Germany|East German]] equivalent, started in 1949 and operated through the [[1990\u201391 NOFV-Pokal|1991 season]], when it merged with the DFB-Pokal.)\n\n[[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] have won the most titles with 19 wins, while they are also the current title holders. [[Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf]] hold the record for most consecutive tournament game wins (18) between 1978 and 1981, winning the cup in 1979 and 1980.\n\n==Format==\n[[Image:DFB Pokal.jpg|thumb|right|The trophy]]\nThe competition format has varied considerably since the inception of the ''Tschammer-Pokal'' in 1935.\n\n===Participation===\nThe DFB-Pokal begins with a round of 64 teams. The 36 teams of the [[Bundesliga]] and [[2. Bundesliga]], along with the top four finishers of the [[3. Liga]] are automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots 21 are given to the cup winners of the regional football associations, the ''[[Verbandspokal]]e''. The three remaining slots are given to the three regional associations with the most men's teams. They may assign the slot as they see fit but usually give it to the runner-up in the association cup. As every team taking part in the [[German football league system]] is entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualify for the association cups, every team can in principle compete in the DFB-Pokal. Reserve teams like [[Borussia Dortmund II]] are not permitted to enter.<ref name=rules>{{cite web|title=DFB Cup Men \u2013 Mode |publisher=DFB |year=2008 |accessdate=9 October 2008 |url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460546 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609211623/https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460546 |archivedate=9 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Seeding===\nFor the first round, the 64 teams are split into two pots of 32. One pot contains the 18 teams from the previous season of the Bundesliga and the top 14 teams from the previous season of the 2. Bundesliga. The other pot contains the bottom 4 teams from the previous season of the 2. Bundesliga, the top 4 teams from the previous season of the 3. Liga and the 24 amateur teams that qualified through regional football tournaments. Teams from one pot are drawn against teams from the other pot. Since [[1982\u201383 DFB-Pokal|1982]], the teams from the pot containing amateur teams play the game at home.\n\nFor the second round, the teams are again divided into two pots according to the same principles. Depending on the results of the first round, the pots might not be equal in terms of number. Teams from one pot are drawn against teams from the other pot until one pot is empty. The remaining teams are then drawn against each other with the team first drawn playing the game at home.\n\nFor the remaining rounds, other than the final, the teams are drawn from one pot. Since [[1984\u201385 DFB-Pokal|1985]] the final has been held in the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Berlin]].<ref name=rules />\n\n===Match rules===\nExtra time will be played if the scores are level after 90 minutes with a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] following if needed.<ref name=rules />\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DFB-Pokal logo 2001.png|100px|thumb|right|DFB-Pokal logo (2001\u20132010)]] -->\nHistorically the number of participants in the main tournament has varied between four from [[1955\u201356 DFB-Pokal|1956]] until [[1959\u201360 DFB-Pokal|1960]] and 128 from [[1973\u201374 DFB-Pokal|1973]] through [[1981\u201382 DFB-Pokal|1982]] resulting in tournaments of two to seven rounds. Since the inception of the [[Bundesliga]] in 1963 all clubs from the Bundesliga are automatically qualified for the DFB-Pokal as are all clubs from the 2. Bundesliga since its inception in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974]]. Reserve sides for most of the time were allowed to participate in the DFB-Pokal but have been excluded since [[2008\u201309 DFB-Pokal|2008]].\n\nThe final has been held at the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Berlin]] every season since [[1984\u201385 DFB-Pokal|1985]]. Before 1985, the host of the final was determined on short notice. In the decision, the [[German Football Association]] took into consideration that, due to the political situation between [[Germany]] and [[East Germany]], Berlin was not chosen to be a venue for the [[UEFA Euro 1988]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Sebastian Schneider|title=Nur zuhause feiern wir nicht|url=http://www.rbb-online.de/sport/beitrag/2016/05/fussball-dfb-pokal-finale-berlin-olympiastadion.html|website=RBB Online|publisher=Radio Berlin Brandenburg|accessdate=11 May 2017|language=German|date=21 May 2016|quote=Seit 1985 wird das Pokalfinale im Olympiastadion gespielt, der DFB vergab es damals als politischen Gnadenakt in die \"Frontstadt\" West-Berlin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Sven Goldmann|title=Berlin, Berlin, so feiert nur Berlin|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/30-jahre-dfb-pokalfinale-in-berlin-berlin-berlin-so-feiert-nur-berlin/11845726.html|website=Der Tagesspiegel|publisher=Der Tagesspiegel|accessdate=11 May 2017|language=German|date=30 May 2015|quote=Am Anfang steht ein Kompensationsgesch\u00e4ft.

If the score was still level after 120 minutes the game was replayed with the home field right reversed. In the 1939 ''Tschammer-Pokal'' the semi-final between [[SV Waldhof Mannheim|Waldhof Mannheim]] and [[Wacker Wien]] was played to a draw three times before the game was decided by lot. The [[German Football Association]] decided to hold a penalty shootout if the replay was another draw after a similar situation arose in the [[1969\u201370 DFB-Pokal|1970 cup]], when the match between [[Alemannia Aachen]] and [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] had to be decided by lot after two draws.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DFB-Pokal logo 2010.svg|100px|thumb|right|DFB-Pokal logo (2010\u20132016){{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 19 January 2020|F7}}]] -->\nIn [[1971\u201372 DFB-Pokal|1971\u201372]] and [[1972\u201373 DFB-Pokal|1972\u201373]], the matches were held over two legs. The second leg was extended by two additional 15-minute overtime periods if the aggregate was a draw after both legs. In case the extension brought no decision, a penalty shootout was held.\n\nIn [[1976\u201377 DFB-Pokal|1977]], the final [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] vs. [[Hertha BSC]] had to be replayed, leading to great logistical difficulties. In the aftermath, the DFB opted not to replay cup finals in the future, instead holding a penalty shootout after extra time. Eventually, this change was extended to all cup games in [[1991\u201392 DFB-Pokal|1991]].\n\n===International qualification===\nSince 1960, the winner of the DFB-Pokal qualified for the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. If the cup winner had already qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Club Champions Cup]], the losing finalist moved into the Cup Winners' Cup instead. Following the abolition of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1999, the winner of the DFB-Pokal qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], known as the UEFA Europa League since 2009. If the DFB-Pokal winner or both finalists qualify through the Bundesliga for European cup competitions, the best placed team of the Bundesliga not already qualified for at least the Europa League receives the spot.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = dfb.de | url = https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=3110 | title = Internationale Vereinswettbewerbe: Qualifikation zum Europa-Cup | language = German | trans-title = International Club Competitions: Qualification for the Europa Cup  | accessdate= 8 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tschammerpokal===\nThe first German cup was held in 1935.

This continued after the establishment of the Bundesliga in 1963. Semi-professional and amateur clubs could only enter the competition from 1974 onwards, when it was enlarged. Up until 2008, only the top two divisions of German football, the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, were fully professional but from 2008, with the establishment of the 3.

Further milestones were the reserve side of [[Hertha BSC]], [[Hertha BSC II]], reaching the cup final in 1993, a first for a third division club and a reserve team.

{"title_page": "Fourier transform", "text_new": "The '''Fourier transform''' ('''FT''') decomposes a [[function (mathematics)|function]] (often a function of time, or a [[signal]]) into its constituent frequencies. A special case is the expression of a musical [[Chord (music)|chord]] in terms of the volumes and frequencies of its constituent notes. The term ''Fourier transform'' refers to both the [[frequency domain]] representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of [[Time in physics|time]]. The Fourier transform of a function of time is itself a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function of frequency, whose magnitude ([[absolute value|modulus]]) represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] is the [[phase offset]] of the basic sinusoid in that frequency. The Fourier transform is not limited to functions of time, but the [[Domain of a function|domain of the original function]] is commonly referred to as the ''[[time domain]]''.  There is also an ''inverse Fourier transform'' that mathematically synthesizes the original function from its frequency domain representation.\n<!--Sorry... I need more explanation than the following statement.  So you can be sure that a majority of readers also do.\nThis can then be displayed as a graphic, with the time domain replaced by a ''spatial domain''.

The Fourier transform decomposes a function into eigenfunctions for the group of translations.\n| image=Fourier_unit_pulse.svg\n| image-width = 300\n| annotations =\n{{Annotation|20|40|<math>\\scriptstyle f(t)</math>}}\n{{Annotation|170|40|<math>\\scriptstyle \\hat{f}(\\omega)</math>}}\n{{Annotation|20|140|<math>\\scriptstyle g(t)</math>}}\n{{Annotation|170|140|<math>\\scriptstyle \\hat{g}(\\omega)</math>}}\n{{Annotation|130|80|<math>\\scriptstyle t</math>}}\n{{Annotation|280|85|<math>\\scriptstyle \\omega</math>}}\n{{Annotation|130|192|<math>\\scriptstyle t</math>}}\n{{Annotation|280|180|<math>\\scriptstyle \\omega</math>}}\n}}\n{{Fourier transforms}}\n\nLinear operations performed in one domain (time or frequency) have corresponding operations in the other domain, which are sometimes easier to perform. The operation of [[derivative|differentiation]] in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by the frequency,<ref group=\"remark\">Up to an imaginary constant factor whose magnitude depends on what Fourier transform convention is used.</ref> so some [[differential equation]]s are easier to analyze in the frequency domain. Also, [[convolution]] in the time domain corresponds to ordinary multiplication in the frequency domain (see [[Convolution theorem]]). After performing the desired operations, transformation of the result can be made back to the time domain. [[Harmonic analysis]] is the systematic study of the relationship between the frequency and time domains, including the kinds of functions or operations that are \"simpler\" in one or the other, and has deep connections to many areas of modern mathematics.\n\nFunctions that are localized in the time domain have Fourier transforms that are spread out across the frequency domain and vice versa, a phenomenon known as the [[#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]]. The [[critical point (mathematics)|critical]] case for this principle is the [[Gaussian function]], of substantial importance in [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]] as well as in the study of physical phenomena exhibiting [[normal distribution]] (e.g., [[diffusion]]). The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. [[Joseph Fourier]] introduced the transform in his study of [[heat transfer]], where Gaussian functions appear as solutions of the [[heat equation]].\n\nThe Fourier transform can be formally defined as an [[improper integral|improper]] [[Riemann integral]], making it an [[integral transform]], although this definition is not suitable for many applications requiring a more sophisticated integration theory.<ref group=\"remark\">Depending on the application a [[Lebesgue integral]], [[distribution (mathematics)|distributional]], or other approach may be most appropriate.</ref> For example, many relatively simple applications use the [[Dirac delta function]], which can be treated formally as if it were a function, but the justification requires a mathematically more sophisticated viewpoint.<ref group=\"remark\">{{harvtxt|Vretblad|2000}} provides solid justification for these formal procedures without going too deeply into [[functional analysis]] or the [[distribution (mathematics)|theory of distributions]].</ref> The Fourier transform can also be generalized to functions of several variables on Euclidean space, sending a function of {{nowrap|3-dimensional}} 'position space' to a function of {{nowrap|3-dimensional}} momentum (or a function of space and time to a function of [[4-momentum]]). This idea makes the spatial Fourier transform very natural in the study of waves, as well as in [[quantum mechanics]], where it is important to be able to represent wave solutions as functions of either position or momentum and sometimes both. In general, functions to which Fourier methods are applicable are complex-valued, and possibly [[vector-valued function|vector-valued]].<ref group=\"remark\">In [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] one encounters vector-valued Fourier transforms of multi-component wave functions. In [[quantum field theory]], operator-valued Fourier transforms of operator-valued functions of spacetime are in frequent use, see for example {{harvtxt|Greiner|Reinhardt|1996}}.</ref> Still further generalization is possible to functions on [[group (mathematics)|groups]], which, besides the original Fourier transform on {{math|'''\u211d'''}} or {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} (viewed as groups under addition), notably includes the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT, group = [[integers|{{math|'''\u2124'''}}]]), the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT, group = [[cyclic group|{{math|'''\u2124''' mod ''N''}}]]) and the [[Fourier series]] or circular Fourier transform (group = [[circle group|{{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}}]], the unit circle \u2248 closed finite interval with endpoints identified). The latter is routinely employed to handle [[periodic function]]s. The [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) is an algorithm for computing the DFT.\n\n==Definition==\nThe Fourier transform of a function {{mvar|f}} is traditionally denoted <math> \\hat{f}</math>, by adding a [[circumflex]] to the symbol of the function.

The [[#Fourier transform on Euclidean space|Fourier transform on Euclidean space]] is treated separately, in which the variable {{mvar|x}} often represents position and {{mvar|\u03be}} momentum. The conventions chosen in this article are those of [[harmonic analysis]], and are characterized as the unique conventions such that the Fourier transform is both [[Unitary operator|unitary]] on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} and an algebra homomorphism from {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} to {{math|''L''<sup>\u221e</sup>}}, without renormalizing the Lebesgue measure.<ref>{{harvnb|Folland|1989}}.</ref>\n\nMany other characterizations of the Fourier transform exist. For example, one uses the [[Stone\u2013von Neumann theorem]]: the Fourier transform is the unique unitary [[intertwiner]] for the symplectic and Euclidean Schr\u00f6dinger representations of the [[Heisenberg group]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Fourier analysis#History|Fourier series#History}}\nIn 1822, [[Joseph Fourier]] showed that some functions could be written as an infinite sum of harmonics.<ref>{{harvnb|Fourier|1822}}.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\n{{See also|Fourier analysis}}\n[[File:Fourier transform time and frequency domains (small).gif|frame|right|In the first frames of the animation, a function {{mvar|f}} is resolved into Fourier series: a linear combination of sines and cosines (in blue). The component frequencies of these sines and cosines spread across the frequency spectrum, are represented as peaks in the frequency domain (actually [[Dirac delta function]]s, shown in the last frames of the animation). The frequency domain representation of the function, {{math|''f\u0302''}}, is the collection of these peaks at the frequencies that appear in this resolution of the function.]]\nOne motivation for the Fourier transform comes from the study of [[Fourier series]]. In the study of Fourier series, complicated but periodic functions are written as the sum of simple waves mathematically represented by [[sine]]s and [[cosine]]s. The Fourier transform is an extension of the Fourier series that results when the period of the represented function is lengthened and allowed to approach [[infinity (mathematics)|infinity]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taneja|2008|p=192}}.</ref>\n\nDue to the properties of sine and cosine, it is possible to recover the amplitude of each wave in a Fourier series using an integral. In many cases it is desirable to use [[Euler's formula]], which states that {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup> {{=}} cos(2\u03c0''\u03b8'') + ''i'' sin(2\u03c0''\u03b8'')}}, to write Fourier series in terms of the basic waves {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup>}}. This has the advantage of simplifying many of the formulas involved, and provides a formulation for Fourier series that more closely resembles the definition followed in this article. Re-writing sines and cosines as [[complex exponentials]] makes it necessary for the Fourier coefficients to be complex valued. The usual interpretation of this complex number is that it gives both the [[amplitude]] (or size) of the wave present in the function and the [[phase (waves)|phase]] (or the initial angle) of the wave. These complex exponentials sometimes contain negative \"frequencies\". If {{mvar|\u03b8}} is measured in seconds, then the waves {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup>}} and {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup>}} both complete one cycle per second, but they represent different frequencies in the Fourier transform. Hence, frequency no longer measures the number of cycles per unit time, but is still closely related.\n\nThere is a close connection between the definition of Fourier series and the Fourier transform for functions {{mvar|f}} that are zero outside an interval. For such a function, we can calculate its Fourier series on any interval that includes the points where {{mvar|f}} is not identically zero. The Fourier transform is also defined for such a function. As we increase the length of the interval in which we calculate the Fourier series, then the Fourier series coefficients begin to resemble the Fourier transform and the sum of the Fourier series of {{mvar|f}} begins to resemble the inverse Fourier transform. More precisely, suppose {{mvar|T}} is large enough that the interval {{math|[\u2212{{sfrac|''T''|2}}, {{sfrac|''T''|2}}]}} contains the interval in which {{mvar|f}} is not identically zero. Then, the {{mvar|n}}th series coefficient {{mvar|c<sub>n</sub>}} is given by:\n\n:<math>c_n = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-\\frac{T}{2}}^\\frac{T}{2} f(x)\\, e^{-2\\pi i\\left(\\frac{n}{T}\\right) x} \\, dx.</math>\n\nComparing this to the definition of the Fourier transform, it follows that:\n\n:<math>c_n = \\frac{1}{T}\\hat f\\left(\\frac{n}{T}\\right)</math>\n\nsince {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is zero outside {{math|[\u2212{{sfrac|''T''|2}}, {{sfrac|''T''|2}}]}}. Thus, the Fourier coefficients are equal to the values of the Fourier transform sampled on a grid of width {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}}}}, multiplied by the grid width {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}}}}.\n\nUnder appropriate conditions, the Fourier series of {{mvar|f}} will equal the function {{mvar|f}}. In other words, {{mvar|f}} can be written:\n\n:<math>f(x)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty c_n\\, e^{2\\pi i\\left(\\frac{n}{T}\\right) x} =\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat{f}(\\xi_n)\\ e^{2\\pi i\\xi_n x}\\Delta\\xi,</math>\n\nwhere the last sum is simply the first sum rewritten using the definitions {{math|''\u03be<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|n|T}}''}}, and {{math|\u0394''\u03be'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''n'' + 1|''T''}} \u2212 {{sfrac|''n''|''T''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''T''}}}}.\n\nThis second sum is a [[Riemann sum]]. By letting {{math|''T'' \u2192 \u221e}} it will converge to the integral for the inverse Fourier transform as expressed above. Under suitable conditions, this argument may be made precise.<ref name=\"Stein-Shakarchi-2003\">{{harvnb|Stein|Shakarchi|2003}}.</ref>\n\nIn the study of Fourier series the numbers {{mvar|c<sub>n</sub>}} could be thought of as the \"amount\" of the wave present in the Fourier series of {{mvar|f}}. Similarly, as seen above, the Fourier transform can be thought of as a function that measures how much of each individual frequency is present in our function {{mvar|f}}, and we can recombine these waves by using an integral (or \"continuous sum\") to reproduce the original function.\n\n==Example==\nThe following figures provide a visual illustration how the Fourier transform measures whether a frequency is present in a particular function. The depicted function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'') {{=}} cos(6\u03c0''t'') ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03c0''t''<sup>2</sup></sup>}} oscillates at 3&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] (if {{mvar|t}} measures seconds) and tends quickly to 0. (The second factor in this equation is an [[Envelope (waves)|envelope function]] that shapes the continuous sinusoid into a short pulse. Its general form is a [[Gaussian function]]). This function was specially chosen to have a real Fourier transform that can be easily plotted. The first image contains its graph. In order to calculate <math>\\hat{f}(3)</math> we must integrate {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i''(3''t'')</sup>''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}}. The second image shows the plot of the real and imaginary parts of this function. The real part of the integrand is almost always positive, because when {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}} is negative, the real part of {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i''(3''t'')</sup>}} is negative as well. Because they oscillate at the same rate, when {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}} is positive, so is the real part of {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i''(3''t'')</sup>}}. The result is that when you integrate the real part of the integrand you get a relatively large number (in this case {{sfrac|1|2}}). On the other hand, when you try to measure a frequency that is not present, as in the case when we look at <math>\\hat{f}(5)</math>, you see that both real and imaginary component of this function vary rapidly between positive and negative values, as plotted in the third image. Therefore, in this case, the integrand oscillates fast enough so that the integral is very small and the value for the Fourier transform for that frequency is nearly zero.\n\nThe general situation may be a bit more complicated than this, but this in spirit is how the Fourier transform measures how much of an individual frequency is present in a function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}}.\n<gallery widths=\"360px\" heights=\"360px\">\nFile:Function ocsillating at 3 hertz.svg|Original function showing oscillation 3&nbsp;Hz.\nFile:Onfreq.svg| Real and imaginary parts of integrand for Fourier transform at 3&nbsp;Hz\nFile:Offfreq.svg| Real and imaginary parts of integrand for Fourier transform at 5&nbsp;Hz\nFile:Fourier transform of oscillating function.svg| Magnitude of Fourier transform, with 3 and 5&nbsp;Hz labeled.\n</gallery>\n\n==Properties of the Fourier transform==\nHere we assume {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}, {{math|''g''(''x'')}} and {{math|''h''(''x'')}} are ''integrable functions'': [[Lebesgue-measurable]] on the real line satisfying:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |f(x)| \\, dx < \\infty.</math>\n\nWe denote the Fourier transforms of these functions as {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}}, {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u0125''(''\u03be'')}} respectively.\n\n===Basic properties===\nThe Fourier transform has the following basic properties:<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\">{{harvnb|Pinsky|2002}}.</ref>\n\n====Linearity====\n\n: For any [[complex number]]s {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, if {{math|''h''(''x'') {{=}} ''af''&nbsp;(''x'') + ''bg''(''x'')}}, then {{math|''\u0125''(''\u03be'') {{=}} ''a'' \u00b7 ''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'') + ''b'' \u00b7 ''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}}.\n\n====Translation / time shifting====\n[[File:Fourier transform - time shifted signal.gif|thumb|middle|right|upright=1.75|Animation showing the Fourier Transform of a time shifted signal.

Indeed, denoting the Fourier transform operator by {{mathcal|F}}, so {{math|{{mathcal|F}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;) :{{=}} ''f\u0302''}}, then for suitable functions, applying the Fourier transform twice simply flips the function: {{math|{{mathcal|F}}{{isup|2}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&thinsp;(\u2212''x'')}}, which can be interpreted as \"reversing time\". Since reversing time is two-periodic, applying this twice yields {{math|{{mathcal|F}}{{isup|4}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;) {{=}} ''f''}}, so the Fourier transform operator is four-periodic, and similarly the inverse Fourier transform can be obtained by applying the Fourier transform three times: {{math|{{mathcal|F}}{{isup|3}}(&thinsp;''f\u0302''&thinsp;) {{=}} ''f''}}. In particular the Fourier transform is invertible (under suitable conditions).\n\nMore precisely, defining the ''parity operator'' {{mathcal|P}} that inverts time, {{math|{{mathcal|P}}[&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;] : ''t'' \u21a6 ''f''&thinsp;(\u2212''t'')}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathcal{F}^0 &= \\mathrm{Id}, \\quad\n  \\mathcal{F}^1  = \\mathcal{F}, \\\\\n  \\mathcal{F}^2 &= \\mathcal{P}, \\quad\n  \\mathcal{F}^3 = \\mathcal{F}^{-1} = \\mathcal{P} \\circ \\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{F} \\circ \\mathcal{P}, \\\\\n  \\mathcal{F}^4  &= \\mathrm{Id}\n\\end{align}</math>\nThese equalities of operators require careful definition of the space of functions in question, defining equality of functions (equality at every point? equality [[almost everywhere]]?) and defining equality of operators \u2013 that is, defining the topology on the function space and operator space in question. These are not true for all functions, but are true under various conditions, which are the content of the various forms of the [[Fourier inversion theorem]].\n\nThis fourfold periodicity of the Fourier transform is similar to a rotation of the plane by 90\u00b0, particularly as the two-fold iteration yields a reversal, and in fact this analogy can be made precise. While the Fourier transform can simply be interpreted as switching the time domain and the frequency domain, with the inverse Fourier transform switching them back, more geometrically it can be interpreted as a rotation by 90\u00b0 in the [[time\u2013frequency domain]] (considering time as the {{mvar|x}}-axis and frequency as the {{mvar|y}}-axis), and the Fourier transform can be generalized to the [[fractional Fourier transform]], which involves rotations by other angles. This can be further generalized to [[linear canonical transformation]]s, which can be visualized as the action of the [[special linear group]] {{math|[[SL2(R)|SL<sub>2</sub>('''\u211d''')]]}} on the time\u2013frequency plane, with the preserved symplectic form corresponding to the [[#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]], below. This approach is particularly studied in [[signal processing]], under [[time\u2013frequency analysis]].\n\n===Units and duality===\n\nIn mathematics, one often does not think of any units as being attached to the two variables {{mvar|t}} and {{mvar|\u03be}}. <!--If one identifies these two copies of the real line, then one can regard the Fourier transformation as a linear mapping from {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} to itself.--> But in physical applications, {{mvar|\u03be}} must have inverse units to the units of {{mvar|t}}. For example, if {{mvar|t}} is measured in seconds, {{mvar|\u03be}}\nshould be in cycles per second for the formulas here to be valid. If the scale of {{mvar|t}} is changed and {{mvar|t}} is measured in units of 2{{pi}} seconds, then either {{mvar|\u03be}} must be in the so-called \"[[angular frequency]]\", or one must insert some constant scale factor into some of the formulas. If {{mvar|t}} is measured in units of length, then {{mvar|\u03be}} must be in inverse length, e.g., [[wavenumber]]s. That is to say, there are two copies of the real line: one measured in one set of units, where {{mvar|t}} ranges, and the other in inverse units to the units of {{mvar|t}}, and which is the range of {{mvar|\u03be}}. So these are two distinct copies of the real line, and cannot be identified with each other. Therefore, the Fourier transform goes from one space of functions to a different space of functions: functions which have a different domain of definition.\n\nIn general, {{mvar|\u03be}} must always be taken to be a [[linear form]] on the space of {{mvar|t}}s, which is to say that the second real line is the [[dual space]] of the first real line. See the article on [[linear algebra]] for a more formal explanation and for more details. This point of view becomes essential in generalisations of the Fourier transform to general [[symmetry groups]], including the case of Fourier series.\n\nThat there is no one preferred way (often, one says \"no canonical way\") to compare the two copies of the real line which are involved in the Fourier transform\u2014fixing the units on one line does not force the scale of the units on the other line\u2014is the reason for the plethora of rival conventions on the definition of the Fourier transform. The various definitions resulting from different choices of units differ by various constants. If the units of {{mvar|t}} are in seconds but the units of {{mvar|\u03be}} are in angular frequency, then the angular frequency variable is often denoted by one or another Greek letter, for example, {{math|''\u03c9'' {{=}} 2\u03c0''\u03be''}} is quite common. Thus (writing {{math|''x\u0302''<sub>1</sub>}} for the alternative definition and {{math|''x\u0302''}} for the definition adopted in this article)\n\n:<math>\\hat x_1(\\omega) = \\hat x \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}\\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} \\, dt</math>\n\nas before, but the corresponding alternative inversion formula would then have to be\n\n:<math> x(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat x_1(\\omega) e^{it\\omega} \\, d\\omega .</math>\n\nTo have something involving angular frequency but with greater symmetry between the Fourier transform and the inversion formula, one very often sees still another alternative definition of the Fourier transform, with a factor of {{sqrt|2{{pi}}}}, thus\n\n:<math>\\hat x_2 (\\omega) = \\frac 1 {\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} \\, dt ,</math>\nand the corresponding inversion formula then has to be\n\n:<math> x(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat x_2(\\omega) e^{it\\omega} \\, d\\omega .</math>\n\nIn some unusual conventions, such as those employed by the FourierTransform command of the [[Wolfram Language]], the Fourier transform has {{mvar|i}} in the exponent instead of {{math|\u2212''i''}}, and vice versa for the inversion formula.  Many of the identities involving the Fourier transform remain valid in those conventions, provided all terms that explicitly involve {{math|''i''}} have it replaced by {{math|&minus;''i''}}.\n\nFor example, in probability theory, the characteristic function {{mvar|\u03d5}} of the probability density function {{mvar|f}} of a random variable {{mvar|X}} of continuous type is defined without a negative sign in the exponential, and since the units of {{mvar|x}} are ignored, there is no 2{{pi}} either:\n\n:<math>\\phi (\\lambda) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) e^{i\\lambda x} \\,dx.</math>\n\n(In probability theory, and in mathematical statistics, the use of the Fourier\u2014Stieltjes transform is preferred, because so many random variables are not of continuous type, and do not possess a density function, and one must treat not functions but [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], i.e., measures which possess \"atoms\".)\n\nFrom the higher point of view of [[Character theory|group characters]], which is much more abstract, all these arbitrary choices disappear, as will be explained in the later section of this article, which treats the notion of the Fourier transform of a function on a [[Locally compact abelian group|locally compact Abelian group]].\n\n===Uniform continuity and the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma===\n[[File:Rectangular function.svg|thumb|The [[rectangular function]] is [[Lebesgue integrable]].]]\n[[File:Sinc function (normalized).svg|thumb|The [[sinc function]], which is the Fourier transform of the rectangular function, is bounded and continuous, but not Lebesgue integrable.]]\nThe Fourier transform may be defined in some cases for non-integrable functions, but the Fourier transforms of integrable functions have several strong properties.\n\nThe Fourier transform {{math|''f\u0302''}} of any integrable function {{mvar|f}} is [[uniformly continuous]] and<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\">{{harvnb|Katznelson|1976}}.</ref>\n:<math>\\left\\|\\hat{f}\\right\\|_\\infty \\leq \\left\\|f\\right\\|_1</math>\n\nBy the ''[[Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma]]'',<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\">{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971}}.</ref>\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi) \\to 0\\text{ as }|\\xi| \\to \\infty.</math>\n\nHowever, <math>\\hat{f}</math> need not be integrable. For example, the Fourier transform of the [[rectangular function]], which is integrable, is the [[sinc function]], which is not [[Lebesgue integrable]], because its [[improper integral]]s behave analogously to the [[alternating harmonic series]], in converging to a sum without being [[absolutely convergent]].\n\nIt is not generally possible to write the ''inverse transform'' as a [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, when both {{mvar|f}} and <math>\\hat{f}</math> are integrable, the inverse equality\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat f(\\xi) e^{2 i \\pi x \\xi} \\, d\\xi</math>\n\nholds [[almost everywhere]]. That is, the Fourier transform is [[injective]] on {{math|[[Lp space|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''')]]}}. (But if {{mvar|f}} is continuous, then equality holds for every {{mvar|x}}.)\n\n===Plancherel theorem and Parseval's theorem===\nLet {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}} be integrable, and let {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} be their Fourier transforms. If ''f''&thinsp;(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') are also [[square-integrable]], then the Parseval formula follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1987|p=187}}.</ref>\n\n: <math>\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\overline{g(x)} \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\overline{\\hat{g}(\\xi)} \\,d\\xi,</math>\n\nwhere the bar denotes [[complex conjugation]].\n\nThe [[Plancherel theorem]], which follows from the above, states that<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1987|p=186}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left| f(x) \\right|^2\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left| \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\right|^2\\,d\\xi. </math>\n\nPlancherel's theorem makes it possible to extend the Fourier transform, by a continuity argument, to a [[unitary operator]] on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}}. On {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''') \u2229 ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}}, this extension agrees with original Fourier transform defined on {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''')}}, thus enlarging the domain of the Fourier transform to {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''') + ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} (and consequently to {{math|{{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}('''\u211d''')}} for {{math|1 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 2}}). Plancherel's theorem has the interpretation in the sciences that the Fourier transform preserves the [[energy]] of the original quantity. The terminology of these formulas is not quite standardised. Parseval's theorem was proved only for Fourier series, and was first proved by Lyapunov. But Parseval's formula makes sense for the Fourier transform as well, and so even though in the context of the Fourier transform it was proved by Plancherel, it is still often referred to as Parseval's formula, or Parseval's relation, or even Parseval's theorem.\n\nSee [[Pontryagin duality]] for a general formulation of this concept in the context of locally compact abelian groups.\n\n===Poisson summation formula===\n{{Main|Poisson summation formula}}\n\nThe Poisson summation formula (PSF) is an equation that relates the [[Fourier series]] coefficients of the [[periodic summation]] of a function to values of the function's continuous Fourier transform. The Poisson summation formula says that for sufficiently regular functions {{mvar|f}},\n\n:<math> \\sum_n \\hat f(n) = \\sum_n f (n).</math>\n\nIt has a variety of useful forms that are derived from the basic one by application of the Fourier transform's scaling and time-shifting properties. The formula has applications in engineering, physics, and [[number theory]]. The frequency-domain dual of the standard Poisson summation formula is also called the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]].\n\nPoisson summation is generally associated with the physics of periodic media, such as heat conduction on a circle. The fundamental solution of the heat equation on a circle is called a [[theta function]]. It is used in [[number theory]] to prove the transformation properties of theta functions, which turn out to be a type of [[modular form]], and it is connected more generally to the theory of [[automorphic form]]s where it appears on one side of the [[Selberg trace formula]].\n\n===Differentiation===\nSuppose {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an absolutely continuous differentiable function, and both {{math|''f''}} and its derivative {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''}} are integrable. Then the Fourier transform of the derivative is given by\n:<math>\\widehat{f'\\;}(\\xi)=2\\pi i\\xi\\hat{f}(\\xi).</math>\nMore generally, the Fourier transformation of the {{mvar|n}}th derivative {{math|''f''{{isup|(''n'')}}}} is given by\n:<math>\\widehat{f^{(n)}}(\\xi)=(2\\pi i\\xi)^n\\hat{f}(\\xi).</math>\n\nBy applying the Fourier transform and using these formulas, some [[ordinary differential equation]]s can be transformed into algebraic equations, which are much easier to solve. These formulas also give rise to the rule of thumb \"{{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is smooth [[if and only if]] {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} quickly falls to 0 for {{math|{{abs|''\u03be''}} \u2192 \u221e}}.\" By using the analogous rules for the inverse Fourier transform, one can also say \"{{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} quickly falls to 0 for {{math|{{abs|''x''}} \u2192 \u221e}} if and only if {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} is smooth.\"\n\n===Convolution theorem===\n{{Main|Convolution theorem}}\n\nThe Fourier transform translates between [[convolution]] and multiplication of functions. If {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}} are integrable functions with Fourier transforms {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} respectively, then the Fourier transform of the convolution is given by the product of the Fourier transforms {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} (under other conventions for the definition of the Fourier transform a constant factor may appear).\n\nThis means that if:\n\n:<math>h(x) = (f*g)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(y)g(x - y)\\,dy,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2217}} denotes the convolution operation, then:\n\n:<math>\\hat{h}(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(\\xi)\\cdot \\hat{g}(\\xi).</math>\n\nIn [[LTI system theory|linear time invariant (LTI) system theory]], it is common to interpret {{math|''g''(''x'')}} as the [[impulse response]] of an LTI system with input {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and output {{math|''h''(''x'')}}, since substituting the [[Dirac delta function|unit impulse]] for {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} yields {{math|''h''(''x'') {{=}} ''g''(''x'')}}. In this case, {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} represents the [[frequency response]] of the system.\n\nConversely, if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} can be decomposed as the product of two square integrable functions {{math|''p''(''x'')}} and {{math|''q''(''x'')}}, then the Fourier transform of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is given by the convolution of the respective Fourier transforms {{math|''p\u0302''(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''q\u0302''(''\u03be'')}}.\n\n===Cross-correlation theorem===\n{{Main|Cross-correlation}}\n\nIn an analogous manner, it can be shown that if {{math|''h''(''x'')}} is the [[cross-correlation]] of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}}:\n\n:<math>h(x) = (f \\star g)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\overline{f(y)}g(x + y)\\,dy</math>\n\nthen the Fourier transform of {{math|''h''(''x'')}} is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{h}(\\xi) = \\overline{\\hat{f}(\\xi)} \\cdot \\hat{g}(\\xi).</math>\n\nAs a special case, the [[autocorrelation]] of function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is:\n\n:<math>h(x) = (f \\star f)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\overline{f(y)}f(x + y)\\,dy</math>\n\nfor which\n\n:<math>\\hat{h}(\\xi) = \\overline{\\hat{f}(\\xi)}\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\left|\\hat{f}(\\xi)\\right|^2.</math>\n\n===Eigenfunctions===\nOne important choice of an orthonormal basis for {{math|[[Square-integrable function|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')]]}} is given by the Hermite functions\n\n: <math>\\psi_n(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{2}}{\\sqrt{n!}} e^{-\\pi x^2}\\mathrm{He}_n\\left(2x\\sqrt{\\pi}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{math|He<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}} are the \"probabilist's\" [[Hermite polynomial]]s, defined as\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{He}_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\left(\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^n e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}</math>\n\nUnder this convention for the Fourier transform, we have that\n\n: <math> \\hat\\psi_n(\\xi) = (-i)^n \\psi_n(\\xi) </math>.\n\nIn other words, the Hermite functions form a complete [[orthonormal]] system of [[eigenfunctions]] for the Fourier transform on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}}.<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\" /> However, this choice of eigenfunctions is not unique. There are only four different [[eigenvalue]]s of the Fourier transform (\u00b11 and \u00b1{{mvar|i}}) and any linear combination of eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue gives another eigenfunction. As a consequence of this, it is possible to decompose {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} as a direct sum of four spaces {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''H''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''H''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|''H''<sub>3</sub>}} where the Fourier transform acts on {{math|He<sub>''k''</sub>}} simply by multiplication by {{math|''i''<sup>''k''</sup>}}.\n\nSince the complete set of Hermite functions provides a resolution of the identity, the Fourier transform can be represented by such a sum of terms weighted by the above eigenvalues, and these sums can be explicitly summed. This approach to define the Fourier transform was first done by [[Norbert Wiener]].<ref name=\"Duoandikoetxea-2001\">{{harvnb|Duoandikoetxea|2001}}.</ref> Among other properties, Hermite functions decrease exponentially fast in both frequency and time domains, and they are thus used to define a generalization of the Fourier transform, namely the [[fractional Fourier transform]] used in time-frequency analysis.<ref name=\"Boashash-2003\">{{harvnb|Boashash|2003}}.</ref> In [[physics]], this transform was introduced by [[Edward Condon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Condon|1937}}.</ref>\n\n===Connection with the Heisenberg group===\nThe [[Heisenberg group]] is a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[unitary operator]]s on the [[Hilbert space]] {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} of square integrable complex valued functions {{mvar|f}} on the real line, generated by the translations {{math|(''T<sub>y</sub> f''&thinsp;)(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&nbsp;(''x'' + ''y'')}} and multiplication by {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup>}}, {{math|(''M<sub>\u03be</sub> f''&thinsp;)(''x'') {{=}} ''e''<sup>2\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup> ''f''&nbsp;(''x'')}}.

As an abstract group, the Heisenberg group is the three-dimensional [[Lie group]] of triples {{math|(''x'', ''\u03be'', ''z'') \u2208 '''\u211d'''<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 ''U''(1)}}, with the group law\n:<math>\\left(x_1, \\xi_1, t_1\\right) \\cdot \\left(x_2, \\xi_2, t_2\\right) = \\left(x_1 + x_2, \\xi_1 + \\xi_2, t_1 t_2 e^{2\\pi i \\left(x_1\\xi_1 + x_2\\xi_2 + x_1\\xi_2\\right)}\\right).</math>\n\nDenote the Heisenberg group by {{math|''H''<sub>1</sub>}}.

It is not possible to arbitrarily concentrate both a function and its Fourier transform.\n\nThe trade-off between the compaction of a function and its Fourier transform can be formalized in the form of an [[uncertainty principle]] by viewing a function and its Fourier transform as [[conjugate variables]] with respect to the [[symplectic form]] on the [[time\u2013frequency representation|time\u2013frequency domain]]: from the point of view of the [[linear canonical transformation]], the Fourier transform is rotation by 90\u00b0 in the time\u2013frequency domain, and preserves the [[Symplectic vector space|symplectic form]].\n\nSuppose {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an integrable and [[square-integrable]] function. Without loss of generality, assume that {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is normalized:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |f(x)|^2 \\,dx=1.</math>\n\nIt follows from the [[Plancherel theorem]] that {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} is also normalized.\n\nThe spread around {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} may be measured by the ''dispersion about zero''<ref>{{harvnb|Pinsky|2002|p=131}}.</ref> defined by\n\n:<math>D_0(f)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x^2|f(x)|^2\\,dx.</math>\n\nIn probability terms, this is the [[Moment (mathematics)|second moment]] of {{math|{{abs|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} about zero.\n\nThe uncertainty principle states that, if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is absolutely continuous and the functions {{math|''x''\u00b7''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''x'')}} are square integrable, then<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\" />\n\n:<math>D_0(f)D_0\\left(\\hat{f}\\right) \\geq \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}</math>.\n\nThe equality is attained only in the case\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} f(x) &= C_1 \\, e^{-\\pi \\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2} }\\\\\n\\therefore \\hat{f}(\\xi) &= \\sigma C_1 \\, e^{-\\pi\\sigma^2\\xi^2} \\end{align} </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c3'' > 0}} is arbitrary and {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|{{radic|2|4}}|{{sqrt|''\u03c3''}}}}}} so that {{mvar|f}} is {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}-normalized.<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\" /> In other words, where {{mvar|f}} is a (normalized) [[Gaussian function]] with variance {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>}}, centered at zero, and its Fourier transform is a Gaussian function with variance {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>\u22122</sup>}}.\n\nIn fact, this inequality implies that:\n\n: <math>\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-x_0)^2|f(x)|^2\\,dx\\right)\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty(\\xi-\\xi_0)^2\\left|\\hat{f}(\\xi)\\right|^2\\,d\\xi\\right)\\geq \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}</math>\n\nfor any {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''\u03be''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 '''\u211d'''}}.<ref name=\"Stein-Shakarchi-2003\" />\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], the [[momentum]] and position [[wave function]]s are Fourier transform pairs, to within a factor of [[Planck's constant]]. With this constant properly taken into account, the inequality above becomes the statement of the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|Shakarchi|2003|p=158}}.</ref>\n\nA stronger uncertainty principle is the [[Hirschman uncertainty|Hirschman uncertainty principle]], which is expressed as:\n\n:<math>H\\left(\\left|f\\right|^2\\right)+H\\left(\\left|\\hat{f}\\right|^2\\right)\\ge \\log\\left(\\frac{e}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''H''(''p'')}} is the [[differential entropy]] of the [[probability density function]] {{math|''p''(''x'')}}:\n\n:<math>H(p) = -\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x)\\log\\bigl(p(x)\\bigr) \\, dx</math>\n\nwhere the logarithms may be in any base that is consistent. The equality is attained for a Gaussian, as in the previous case.\n\n===Sine and cosine transforms===\n{{main|Sine and cosine transforms}}\n\nFourier's original formulation of the transform did not use complex numbers, but rather sines and cosines. Statisticians and others still use this form. An absolutely integrable function {{mvar|f}} for which Fourier inversion holds good can be expanded in terms of genuine frequencies (avoiding negative frequencies, which are sometimes considered hard to interpret physically<ref>{{harvnb|Chatfield|2004|p=113}}.</ref>) {{mvar|\u03bb}} by\n\n:<math>f(t) = \\int_0^\\infty \\bigl( a(\\lambda ) \\cos( 2\\pi \\lambda t) + b(\\lambda ) \\sin( 2\\pi \\lambda t)\\bigr) \\, d\\lambda.</math>\n\nThis is called an expansion as a trigonometric integral, or a Fourier integral expansion. The coefficient functions {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} can be found by using variants of the Fourier cosine transform and the Fourier sine transform (the normalisations are, again, not standardised):\n\n:<math> a (\\lambda) = 2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(t) \\cos(2\\pi\\lambda t) \\, dt</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> b (\\lambda) = 2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(t) \\sin(2\\pi\\lambda t) \\, dt. </math>\n\nOlder literature refers to the two transform functions, the Fourier cosine transform, {{mvar|a}}, and the Fourier sine transform, {{mvar|b}}.\n\nThe function {{mvar|f}} can be recovered from the sine and cosine transform using\n\n:<math> f(t) = 2\\int_0 ^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau) \\cos\\bigl( 2\\pi \\lambda(\\tau-t)\\bigr) \\, d\\tau \\, d\\lambda.</math>\n\ntogether with trigonometric identities.

The set {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} consists of the [[solid spherical harmonics]] of degree {{mvar|k}}. The solid spherical harmonics play a similar role in higher dimensions to the Hermite polynomials in dimension one. Specifically, if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03c0{{abs|''x''}}<sup>2</sup></sup>''P''(''x'')}} for some {{math|''P''(''x'')}} in {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, then {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'') {{=}} ''i''{{isup|\u2212''k''}} ''f''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}}. Let the set {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} be the closure in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} of linear combinations of functions of the form {{math|''f''&thinsp;({{abs|''x''}})''P''(''x'')}} where {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is in {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The space {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is then a direct sum of the spaces {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and the Fourier transform maps each space {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to itself and is possible to characterize the action of the Fourier transform on each space {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" />\n\nLet {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''<sub>0</sub>({{abs|''x''}})''P''(''x'')}} (with {{math|''P''(''x'')}} in {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}), then\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi)=F_0(|\\xi|)P(\\xi)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>F_0(r)=2\\pi i^{-k}r^{-\\frac{n+2k-2}{2}}\\int_0^\\infty f_0(s)J_\\frac{n+2k-2}{2}(2\\pi rs)s^\\frac{n+2k}{2}\\,ds.</math>\n\nHere {{math|''J''<sub>{{sfrac|''n'' + 2''k'' \u2212 2|2}}</sub>}} denotes the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind with order {{math|{{sfrac|''n'' + 2''k'' \u2212 2|2}}}}. When {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} this gives a useful formula for the Fourier transform of a radial function.<ref>{{harvnb|Grafakos|2004}}.</ref> This is essentially the [[Hankel transform]]. Moreover, there is a simple recursion relating the cases {{math|''n'' + 2}} and {{mvar|n}}<ref>{{harvnb|Grafakos|Teschl|2013}}.</ref> allowing to compute, e.g., the three-dimensional Fourier transform of a radial function from the one-dimensional one.\n\n===Restriction problems===\nIn higher dimensions it becomes interesting to study ''restriction problems'' for the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of an integrable function is continuous and the restriction of this function to any set is defined. But for a square-integrable function the Fourier transform could be a general ''class'' of square integrable functions. As such, the restriction of the Fourier transform of an {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} function cannot be defined on sets of measure 0. It is still an active area of study to understand restriction problems in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} for {{math|1 < ''p'' < 2}}. Surprisingly, it is possible in some cases to define the restriction of a Fourier transform to a set {{mvar|S}}, provided {{mvar|S}} has non-zero curvature. The case when {{mvar|S}} is the unit sphere in {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is of particular interest. In this case the Tomas\u2013[[Elias Stein|Stein]] restriction theorem states that the restriction of the Fourier transform to the unit sphere in {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a bounded operator on {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} provided {{math|1 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 {{sfrac|2''n'' + 2|''n'' + 3}}}}.\n\nOne notable difference between the Fourier transform in 1 dimension versus higher dimensions concerns the partial sum operator. Consider an increasing collection of measurable sets {{math|''E''<sub>''R''</sub>}} indexed by {{math|''R'' \u2208 (0,\u221e)}}: such as balls of radius {{mvar|R}} centered at the origin, or cubes of side {{math|2''R''}}. For a given integrable function {{mvar|f}}, consider the function {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} defined by:\n\n:<math>f_R(x) = \\int_{E_R}\\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi ix\\cdot\\xi}\\, d\\xi, \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n.</math>\n\nSuppose in addition that {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|1 < ''p'' < \u221e}}, if one takes {{math|''E<sub>R</sub>'' {{=}} (\u2212''R'', ''R'')}}, then {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} converges to {{mvar|f}} in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} as {{mvar|R}} tends to infinity, by the boundedness of the [[Hilbert transform]]. Naively one may hope the same holds true for {{math|''n'' > 1}}. In the case that {{mvar|E<sub>R</sub>}} is taken to be a cube with side length {{mvar|R}}, then convergence still holds. Another natural candidate is the Euclidean ball {{math|''E''<sub>''R''</sub> {{=}} {''\u03be'' : {{abs|''\u03be''}} < ''R''}|}}. In order for this partial sum operator to converge, it is necessary that the multiplier for the unit ball be bounded in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. For {{math|''n'' \u2265 2}} it is a celebrated theorem of [[Charles Fefferman]] that the multiplier for the unit ball is never bounded unless {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}.<ref name=\"Duoandikoetxea-2001\" /> In fact, when {{math|''p'' \u2260 2}}, this shows that not only may {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} fail to converge to {{mvar|f}} in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}, but for some functions {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} is not even an element of {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}.\n\n==Fourier transform on function spaces==\n\n===On {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} spaces===\n\n====On {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}}====\n\nThe definition of the Fourier transform by the integral formula\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)e^{-2\\pi i \\xi\\cdot x}\\,dx</math>\n\nis valid for Lebesgue integrable functions {{mvar|f}}; that is, {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}.\n\nThe Fourier transform {{math|{{mathcal|F}} : ''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>) \u2192 ''L''<sup>\u221e</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is a [[bounded operator]]. This follows from the observation that\n\n:<math>\\left\\vert\\hat{f}(\\xi)\\right\\vert \\leq \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\vert f(x)\\vert \\,dx,</math>\n\nwhich shows that its [[operator norm]] is bounded by 1. Indeed, it equals 1, which can be seen, for example, from the [[#rect|transform of the rect function]]. The image of {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} is a subset of the space {{math|''C''<sub>0</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} of continuous functions that tend to zero at infinity (the [[Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma]]), although it is not the entire space. Indeed, there is no simple characterization of the image.\n\n====On {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}====\n\nSince compactly supported smooth functions are integrable and dense in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, the [[Plancherel theorem]] allows us to extend the definition of the Fourier transform to general functions in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} by continuity arguments. The Fourier transform in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is no longer given by an ordinary Lebesgue integral, although it can be computed by an [[improper integral]], here meaning that for an {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} function {{mvar|f}},\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_{|x|\\le R} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x\\cdot\\xi}\\,dx</math>\n\nwhere the limit is taken in the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} sense. (More generally, you can take a sequence of functions that are in the intersection of {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} and {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} and that converges to {{mvar|f}} in the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}-norm, and define the Fourier transform of {{mvar|f}} as the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} -limit of the Fourier transforms of these functions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/math262/Lectures/Lecture03.pdf|title=Applied Fourier Analysis and Elements of Modern Signal Processing Lecture 3 |date= January 12, 2016|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>)\n\nMany of the properties of the Fourier transform in {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} carry over to {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}, by a suitable limiting argument.\n\nFurthermore, {{math|{{mathcal|F}} : ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>) \u2192 ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is a [[unitary operator]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=Thm. 2.3}}.</ref> For an operator to be unitary it is sufficient to show that it is bijective and preserves the inner product, so in this case these follow from the Fourier inversion theorem combined with the fact that for any {{math|''f'', ''g'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} we have\n\n: <math>\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)\\mathcal{F}g(x)\\,dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\mathcal{F}f(x)g(x)\\,dx. </math>\n\nIn particular, the image of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is itself under the Fourier transform.\n\n====On other {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}====\n\nThe definition of the Fourier transform can be extended to functions in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} for {{math|1 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 2}} by decomposing such functions into a fat tail part in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} plus a fat body part in {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}}. In each of these spaces, the Fourier transform of a function in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is in {{math|''L''{{isup|''q''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, where {{math|''q'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|''p'' \u2212 1}}}} is the H\u00f6lder conjugate of {{mvar|p}} (by the [[Hausdorff\u2013Young inequality]]). However, except for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, the image is not easily characterized. Further extensions become more technical. The Fourier transform of functions in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} for the range {{math|2 < ''p'' < \u221e}} requires the study of distributions.<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" /> In fact, it can be shown that there are functions in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} with {{math|''p'' > 2}} so that the Fourier transform is not defined as a function.<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" />\n\n===Tempered distributions===\n{{Main|Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform}}\nOne might consider enlarging the domain of the Fourier transform from {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup> + ''L''<sup>2</sup>}} by considering [[generalized function]]s, or distributions. A distribution on {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a continuous linear functional on the space {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} of compactly supported smooth functions, equipped with a suitable topology. The strategy is then to consider the action of the Fourier transform on {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} and pass to distributions by duality. The obstruction to doing this is that the Fourier transform does not map {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} to {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. In fact the Fourier transform of an element in {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} can not vanish on an open set; see the above discussion on the uncertainty principle. The right space here is the slightly larger space of [[Schwartz space|Schwartz functions]]. The Fourier transform is an automorphism on the Schwartz space, as a topological vector space, and thus induces an automorphism on its dual, the space of tempered distributions.<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" /> The tempered distributions include all the integrable functions mentioned above, as well as well-behaved functions of polynomial growth and distributions of compact support.\n\nFor the definition of the Fourier transform of a tempered distribution, let {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} be integrable functions, and let {{math|''f\u0302''}} and {{math|''\u011d''}} be their Fourier transforms respectively. Then the Fourier transform obeys the following multiplication formula,<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" />\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\hat{f}(x)g(x)\\,dx=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}f(x)\\hat{g}(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nEvery integrable function {{mvar|f}} defines (induces) a distribution {{mvar|T<sub>f</sub>}} by the relation\n\n:<math>T_f(\\varphi)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}f(x)\\varphi(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nfor all Schwartz functions {{mvar|\u03c6}}. So it makes sense to define Fourier transform {{math|''T\u0302<sub>f</sub>''}} of {{math|''T<sub>f</sub>''}} by\n\n:<math>\\hat{T}_f (\\varphi)= T_f\\left(\\hat{\\varphi}\\right)</math>\n\nfor all Schwartz functions {{mvar|\u03c6}}. Extending this to all tempered distributions {{mvar|T}} gives the general definition of the Fourier transform.\n\nDistributions can be differentiated and the above-mentioned compatibility of the Fourier transform with differentiation and convolution remains true for tempered distributions.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform===\nThe Fourier transform of a finite Borel measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} on {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is given by:<ref>{{harvnb|Pinsky|2002|p=256}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\hat\\mu(\\xi)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2\\pi i x \\cdot \\xi}\\,d\\mu.</math>\n\nThis transform continues to enjoy many of the properties of the Fourier transform of integrable functions. One notable difference is that the [[Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma]] fails for measures.<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" /> In the case that {{math|''d\u03bc'' {{=}} ''f''&thinsp;(''x'') ''dx''}}, then the formula above reduces to the usual definition for the Fourier transform of {{mvar|f}}. In the case that {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the probability distribution associated to a random variable {{mvar|X}}, the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform is closely related to the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]], but the typical conventions in probability theory take {{math|''e''<sup>''ix\u03be''</sup>}} instead of {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup>}}.<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\" /> In the case when the distribution has a [[probability density function]] this definition reduces to the Fourier transform applied to the probability density function, again with a different choice of constants.\n\nThe Fourier transform may be used to give a characterization of measures. [[Bochner's theorem]] characterizes which functions may arise as the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform of a positive measure on the circle.<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" />\n\nFurthermore, the [[Dirac delta function]], although not a function, is a finite [[Borel measure]]. Its Fourier transform is a constant function (whose specific value depends upon the form of the Fourier transform used).\n\n===Locally compact abelian groups===\n{{Main|Pontryagin duality}}\nThe Fourier transform may be generalized to any locally compact abelian group. A locally compact abelian group is an [[abelian group]] that is at the same time a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff topological space]] so that the group operation is continuous. If {{mvar|G}} is a locally compact abelian group, it has a translation invariant measure {{mvar|\u03bc}}, called [[Haar measure]]. For a locally compact abelian group {{mvar|G}}, the set of irreducible, i.e. one-dimensional, unitary representations are called its [[character group|characters]]. With its natural group structure and the topology of pointwise convergence, the set of characters {{mvar|\u011c}} is itself a locally compact abelian group, called the ''Pontryagin dual'' of {{mvar|G}}. For a function {{mvar|f}} in {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}}, its Fourier transform is defined by<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" />\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi)=\\int_G \\xi(x)f(x)\\,d\\mu\\qquad\\text{for any }\\xi\\in\\hat G.</math>\n\nThe Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma holds in this case; {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} is a function vanishing at infinity on {{mvar|\u011c}}.\n\nThe Fourier transform on {{mvar|T}}=R/Z is an example; here {{mvar|T}} is a locally compact abelian group, and the Haar measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} on {{mvar|T}} can be thought of as the Lebesgue measure on [0,1). Consider the representation of {{mvar|T}} on the complex plane {{mvar|C}} that is a 1-dimensional complex vector space. There are a group of representations (which are irreducible since {{mvar|C}} is 1-dim) <math>\\{e_{k}: T\\rightarrow GL_{1}(C)=C^{*}\\mid k\\in Z\\}</math> where <math>e_{k}(x)=e^{2\\pi ikx}</math> for <math>x\\in T</math>.\n\nThe character of such representation, that is the trace of <math>e_{k}(x)</math> for each <math>x\\in T</math> and <math>k\\in Z</math>, is <math>e^{2\\pi i kx}</math> itself. In the case of representation of finite group, the character table of the group {{mvar|G}} are rows of vectors such that each row is the character of one irreducible representation of {{mvar|G}}, and these vectors form an orthonormal basis of the space of class functions that map from {{mvar|G}} to {{mvar|C}} by Schur's lemma. Now the group {{mvar|T}} is no longer finite but still compact, and it preserves the orthonormality of character table. Each row of the table is the function <math>e_{k}(x)</math> of <math>x\\in T,</math> and the inner product between two class functions (all functions being class functions since {{mvar|T}} is abelian) {{mvar|f}},<math>g\\in L^{2}(T, d\\mu)</math> is defined as <math><f,g>=\\frac{1}{|T|}\\int_{[0,1)}f(y)\\overline{g}(y)d\\mu(y)</math> with the normalizing factor <math>|T|=1.</math> The sequence <math>\\{e_{k}\\mid k\\in Z\\}</math> is an orthonormal basis of the space of class functions <math>L^{2}(T,d\\mu).</math>\n\nFor any representation {{mvar|V}} of a finite group {{mvar|G}}, <math>\\chi_{v}</math> can be expressed as the span <math>\\sum_{i}<\\chi_{v},\\chi_{v_{i}}>\\chi_{v_{i}}</math>(<math>V_{i}</math> are the irreps of {{mvar|G}}), s.t <math><\\chi_{v},\\chi_{v_{i}}>=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}\\chi_{v}(g)\\overline{\\chi}_{v_{i}}(g)</math>. Similarly for <math>G=T</math> and <math>f\\in L^{2}(T,d\\mu)</math>, <math>f(x)=\\sum_{k\\in Z}\\hat{f}(k)e_{k}</math>. The Pontriagin dual <math>\\hat{T}</math> is <math>\\{e_{k}\\}(k\\in Z)</math> and for <math>f\\in L^{2}(T,d\\mu)</math>,  <math>\\hat{f}(k)=\\frac{1}{|T|}\\int_{[0,1)}f(y)e^{-2\\pi iky}dy</math> is its Fourier transform for <math>e_{k}\\in \\hat{T}</math>.\n\n===Gelfand transform===\n{{Main|Gelfand representation}}\nThe Fourier transform is also a special case of [[Gelfand transform]]. In this particular context, it is closely related to the Pontryagin duality map defined above.\n\nGiven an abelian [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] {{mvar|G}}, as before we consider space {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}}, defined using a Haar measure. With convolution as multiplication, {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}} is an abelian [[Banach algebra]]. It also has an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] * given by\n\n:<math>f^*(g) = \\overline{f\\left(g^{-1}\\right)}.</math>\n\nTaking the completion with respect to the largest possibly {{math|''C''*}}-norm gives its enveloping {{math|''C''*}}-algebra, called the group {{math|''C''*}}-algebra {{math|''C''*(''G'')}} of {{mvar|G}}. (Any {{math|''C''*}}-norm on {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}} is bounded by the {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} norm, therefore their supremum exists.)\n\nGiven any abelian {{math|''C''*}}-algebra {{mvar|A}}, the Gelfand transform gives an isomorphism between {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''C''<sub>0</sub>(''A''^)}}, where {{math|''A''^}} is the multiplicative linear functionals, i.e. one-dimensional representations, on {{mvar|A}} with the weak-* topology. The map is simply given by\n\n:<math>a \\mapsto \\bigl( \\varphi \\mapsto \\varphi(a) \\bigr)</math>\n\nIt turns out that the multiplicative linear functionals of {{math|''C''*(''G'')}}, after suitable identification, are exactly the characters of {{mvar|G}}, and the Gelfand transform, when restricted to the dense subset {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}} is the Fourier\u2013Pontryagin transform.\n\n===Compact non-abelian groups===\nThe Fourier transform can also be defined for functions on a non-abelian group, provided that the group is [[compact space|compact]]. Removing the assumption that the underlying group is abelian, irreducible unitary representations need not always be one-dimensional. This means the Fourier transform on a non-abelian group takes values as Hilbert space operators.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewitt|Ross|1970|loc=Chapter 8}}.</ref> The Fourier transform on compact groups is a major tool in [[representation theory]]<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|2001}}.</ref> and [[non-commutative harmonic analysis]].\n\nLet {{mvar|G}} be a compact [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]]. Let {{math|\u03a3}} denote the collection of all isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional irreducible [[unitary representation]]s, along with a definite choice of representation {{math|''U''{{isup|(''\u03c3'')}}}} on the [[Hilbert space]] {{math|''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} of finite dimension {{math|''d<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} for each {{math|''\u03c3'' \u2208 \u03a3}}. If {{mvar|\u03bc}} is a finite [[Borel measure]] on {{mvar|G}}, then the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the operator on {{math|''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} defined by\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\hat{\\mu}\\xi,\\eta\\right\\rangle_{H_\\sigma} = \\int_G \\left\\langle \\overline{U}^{(\\sigma)}_g\\xi,\\eta\\right\\rangle\\,d\\mu(g)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|{{overline|''U''}}{{isup|(''\u03c3'')}}}} is the complex-conjugate representation of {{math|''U''<sup>(''\u03c3'')</sup>}} acting on {{math|''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}}. If {{mvar|\u03bc}} is [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to the [[Haar measure|left-invariant probability measure]] {{mvar|\u03bb}} on {{mvar|G}}, [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem|represented]] as\n\n:<math>d\\mu = f \\, d\\lambda</math>\n\nfor some {{math|''f'' \u2208 [[Lp space|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''\u03bb'')]]}}, one identifies the Fourier transform of {{mvar|f}} with the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{mvar|\u03bc}}.\n\nThe mapping\n:<math>\\mu\\mapsto\\hat{\\mu}</math>\ndefines an isomorphism between the [[Banach space]] {{math|''M''(''G'')}} of finite Borel measures (see [[rca space]]) and a closed subspace of the Banach space {{math|'''C'''<sub>\u221e</sub>(\u03a3)}} consisting of all sequences {{math|''E'' {{=}} (''E<sub>\u03c3</sub>'')}} indexed by {{math|\u03a3}} of (bounded) linear operators {{math|''E<sub>\u03c3</sub>'' : ''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>'' \u2192 ''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} for which the norm\n\n:<math>\\|E\\| = \\sup_{\\sigma\\in\\Sigma}\\left\\|E_\\sigma\\right\\|</math>\n\nis finite. The \"[[convolution theorem]]\" asserts that, furthermore, this isomorphism of Banach spaces is in fact an isometric isomorphism of [[C* algebra]]s into a subspace of {{math|'''C'''<sub>\u221e</sub>(\u03a3)}}. Multiplication on {{math|''M''(''G'')}} is given by [[convolution]] of measures and the involution * defined by\n\n:<math>f^*(g) = \\overline{f\\left(g^{-1}\\right)},</math>\n\nand {{math|'''C'''<sub>\u221e</sub>(\u03a3)}} has a natural {{math|''C''*}}-algebra structure as Hilbert space operators.\n\nThe [[Peter\u2013Weyl theorem]] holds, and a version of the Fourier inversion formula ([[Plancherel's theorem]]) follows: if {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>2</sup>(''G'')}}, then\n\n:<math>f(g) = \\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\Sigma} d_\\sigma \\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\hat{f}(\\sigma)U^{(\\sigma)}_g\\right)</math>\n\nwhere the summation is understood as convergent in the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} sense.\n\nThe generalization of the Fourier transform to the noncommutative situation has also in part contributed to the development of [[noncommutative geometry]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In this context, a categorical generalization of the Fourier transform to noncommutative groups is [[Tannaka\u2013Krein duality]], which replaces the group of characters with the category of representations. However, this loses the connection with harmonic functions.\n\n==Alternatives==\nIn [[signal processing]] terms, a function (of time) is a representation of a signal with perfect ''time resolution'', but no frequency information, while the Fourier transform has perfect ''frequency resolution'', but no time information: the magnitude of the Fourier transform at a point is how much frequency content there is, but location is only given by phase (argument of the Fourier transform at a point), and [[standing wave]]s are not localized in time \u2013 a sine wave continues out to infinity, without decaying. This limits the usefulness of the Fourier transform for analyzing signals that are localized in time, notably [[transient (acoustics)|transients]], or any signal of finite extent.\n\nAs alternatives to the Fourier transform, in [[time-frequency analysis]], one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals in a form that has some time information and some frequency information \u2013 by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the [[short-time Fourier transform]] or [[fractional Fourier transform]], or other functions to represent signals, as in [[wavelet transform]]s and [[chirplet transform]]s, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the [[continuous wavelet transform]].<ref name=\"Boashash-2003\" />\n\n==Applications==\n{{see also|Spectral density#Applications}}\n\n[[File:Commutative diagram illustrating problem solving via the Fourier transform.svg|thumb|400px|Some problems, such as certain differential equations, become easier to solve when the Fourier transform is applied. In that case the solution to the original problem is recovered using the inverse Fourier transform.]]\n\n===Analysis of differential equations===\nPerhaps the most important use of the Fourier transformation is to solve [[partial differential equation]]s.\nMany of the equations of the mathematical physics of the nineteenth century can be treated this way. Fourier studied the heat equation, which in one dimension and in dimensionless units is\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2 y(x,t)}{ \\partial^2 x } =\\frac{\\partial y(x,t) }{ \\partial t}.</math>\n\nThe example we will give, a slightly more difficult one, is the wave equation in one dimension,\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2y(x,t)}{\\partial^2 x }=\\frac{\\partial^2y(x,t)}{\\partial^2t}.</math>\n\nAs usual, the problem is not to find a solution: there are infinitely many. The problem is that of the so-called \"boundary problem\": find a solution which satisfies the \"boundary conditions\"\n\n:<math>y(x,0) = f(x) , \\qquad \\frac{\\partial y(x,0) }{ \\partial t}= g(x).</math>\n\nHere, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are given functions. For the heat equation, only one boundary condition can be required (usually the first one). But for the wave equation, there are still infinitely many solutions {{mvar|y}} which satisfy the first boundary condition. But when one imposes both conditions, there is only one possible solution.\n\nIt is easier to find the Fourier transform {{mvar|\u0177}} of the solution than to find the solution directly. This is because the Fourier transformation takes differentiation into multiplication by the Fourier-dual variable, and so a partial differential equation applied to the original function is transformed into multiplication by polynomial functions of the dual variables applied to the transformed function. After {{mvar|\u0177}} is determined, we can apply the inverse Fourier transformation to find {{mvar|y}}.\n\nFourier's method is as follows. First, note that any function of the forms\n\n:<math> \\cos\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x\\pm t)\\bigr) \\mbox{ or } \\sin\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x \\pm t)\\bigr)</math>\n\nsatisfies the wave equation. These are called the elementary solutions.\n\nSecond, note that therefore any integral\n\n:<math>y(x,t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} a_+(\\xi)\\cos\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x +t)\\bigr) + a_-(\\xi)\\cos\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x -t)\\bigr) + b_+(\\xi)\\sin\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x +t)\\bigr) + b_-(\\xi)\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\xi(x -t)\\right) \\, d\\xi</math>\n\n(for arbitrary {{math|''a''<sub>+</sub>, ''a''<sub>\u2212</sub>, ''b''<sub>+</sub>, ''b''<sub>\u2212</sub>}}) satisfies the wave equation. (This integral is just a kind of continuous linear combination, and the equation is linear.)\n\nNow this resembles the formula for the Fourier synthesis of a function. In fact, this is the real inverse Fourier transform of {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} in the variable {{mvar|x}}.\n\nThe third step is to examine how to find the specific unknown coefficient functions {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} that will lead to {{mvar|y}} satisfying the boundary conditions. We are interested in the values of these solutions at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. So we will set {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. Assuming that the conditions needed for Fourier inversion are satisfied, we can then find the Fourier sine and cosine transforms (in the variable {{mvar|x}}) of both sides and obtain\n\n:<math> 2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty y(x,0) \\cos(2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = a_++a_-</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty y(x,0) \\sin(2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = b_++b_-.</math>\n\nSimilarly, taking the derivative of {{mvar|y}} with respect to {{mvar|t}} and then applying the Fourier sine and cosine transformations yields\n\n:<math> 2\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial y(u,0)}{\\partial t} \\sin (2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = (2\\pi\\xi)\\left(-a_++a_-\\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\partial y(u,0)}{\\partial t} \\cos (2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = (2\\pi\\xi)\\left(b_+-b_-\\right).</math>\n\nThese are four linear equations for the four unknowns {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}}, in terms of the Fourier sine and cosine transforms of the boundary conditions, which are easily solved by elementary algebra, provided that these transforms can be found.\n\nIn summary, we chose a set of elementary solutions, parametrised by {{mvar|\u03be}}, of which the general solution would be a (continuous) linear combination in the form of an integral over the parameter {{mvar|\u03be}}. But this integral was in the form of a Fourier integral. The next step was to express the boundary conditions in terms of these integrals, and set them equal to the given functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}. But these expressions also took the form of a Fourier integral because of the properties of the Fourier transform of a derivative. The last step was to exploit Fourier inversion by applying the Fourier transformation to both sides, thus obtaining expressions for the coefficient functions {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} in terms of the given boundary conditions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}.\n\nFrom a higher point of view, Fourier's procedure can be reformulated more conceptually. Since there are two variables, we will use the Fourier transformation in both {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|t}} rather than operate as Fourier did, who only transformed in the spatial variables. Note that {{mvar|\u0177}} must be considered in the sense of a distribution since {{math|''y''(''x'', ''t'')}} is not going to be {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}}: as a wave, it will persist through time and thus is not a transient phenomenon. But it will be bounded and so its Fourier transform can be defined as a distribution. The operational properties of the Fourier transformation that are relevant to this equation are that it takes differentiation in {{mvar|x}} to multiplication by {{math|2\u03c0''i\u03be''}} and differentiation with respect to {{mvar|t}} to multiplication by {{math|2\u03c0''if''}} where {{mvar|f}} is the frequency. Then the wave equation becomes an algebraic equation in {{mvar|\u0177}}:\n\n:<math>\\xi^2 \\hat y (\\xi, f) = f^2 \\hat y (\\xi, f).</math>\n\nThis is equivalent to requiring {{math|''\u0177''(''\u03be'', ''f''&thinsp;) {{=}} 0}} unless {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} \u00b1''f''}}. Right away, this explains why the choice of elementary solutions we made earlier worked so well: obviously {{math|''f\u0302'' {{=}} ''\u03b4''(''\u03be'' \u00b1 ''f''&thinsp;)}} will be solutions. Applying Fourier inversion to these delta functions, we obtain the elementary solutions we picked earlier. But from the higher point of view, one does not pick elementary solutions, but rather considers the space of all distributions which are supported on the (degenerate) conic {{math|''\u03be''{{isup|2}} \u2212 ''f''{{isup|2}} {{=}} 0}}.\n\nWe may as well consider the distributions supported on the conic that are given by distributions of one variable on the line {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} ''f''}} plus distributions on the line {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} \u2212''f''}} as follows: if {{mvar|\u03d5}} is any test function,\n\n:<math>\\iint \\hat y \\phi(\\xi,f) \\, d\\xi \\, df = \\int s_+ \\phi(\\xi,\\xi) \\, d\\xi + \\int s_- \\phi(\\xi,-\\xi) \\, d\\xi,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''s''<sub>+</sub>}}, and {{math|''s''<sub>\u2212</sub>}}, are distributions of one variable.\n\nThen Fourier inversion gives, for the boundary conditions, something very similar to what we had more concretely above (put {{math|''\u03d5''(''\u03be'', ''f''&thinsp;) {{=}} ''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i''(''x\u03be''+''tf''&thinsp;)</sup>}}, which is clearly of polynomial growth):\n\n:<math> y(x,0) = \\int\\bigl\\{s_+(\\xi) + s_-(\\xi)\\bigr\\} e^{2\\pi i\\xi x+0} \\, d\\xi </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial y(x,0)}{\\partial t} = \\int\\bigl\\{s_+(\\xi) - s_-(\\xi)\\bigr\\} 2\\pi i \\xi e^{2\\pi i\\xi x+0} \\, d\\xi.</math>\n\nNow, as before, applying the one-variable Fourier transformation in the variable {{mvar|x}} to these functions of {{mvar|x}} yields two equations in the two unknown distributions {{math|''s''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} (which can be taken to be ordinary functions if the boundary conditions are {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} or {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}).\n\nFrom a calculational point of view, the drawback of course is that one must first calculate the Fourier transforms of the boundary conditions, then assemble the solution from these, and then calculate an inverse Fourier transform. Closed form formulas are rare, except when there is some geometric symmetry that can be exploited, and the numerical calculations are difficult because of the oscillatory nature of the integrals, which makes convergence slow and hard to estimate. For practical calculations, other methods are often used.\n\nThe twentieth century has seen the extension of these methods to all linear partial differential equations with polynomial coefficients, and by extending the notion of Fourier transformation to include Fourier integral operators, some non-linear equations as well.\n\n===Fourier transform spectroscopy===\n{{main|Fourier transform spectroscopy}}\nThe Fourier transform is also used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and in other kinds of [[spectroscopy]], e.g. infrared ([[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|FTIR]]). In NMR an exponentially shaped free induction decay (FID) signal is acquired in the time domain and Fourier-transformed to a Lorentzian line-shape in the frequency domain. The Fourier transform is also used in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[mass spectrometry]].\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n\nThe Fourier transform is useful in [[quantum mechanics]] in two different ways. To begin with, the basic conceptual structure of quantum mechanics postulates the existence of pairs of [[complementary variables]], connected by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. For example, in one dimension, the spatial variable {{mvar|q}} of, say, a particle, can only be measured by the quantum mechanical \"[[position operator]]\" at the cost of losing information about the momentum {{mvar|p}} of the particle. Therefore, the physical state of the particle can either be described by a function, called \"the wave function\", of {{mvar|q}} or by a function of {{mvar|p}} but not by a function of both variables. The variable {{mvar|p}} is called the conjugate variable to {{mvar|q}}. In classical mechanics, the physical state of a particle (existing in one dimension, for simplicity of exposition) would be given by assigning definite values to both {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} simultaneously. Thus, the set of all possible physical states is the two-dimensional real vector space with a {{mvar|p}}-axis and a {{mvar|q}}-axis called the [[phase space]].\n\nIn contrast, quantum mechanics chooses a polarisation of this space in the sense that it picks a subspace of one-half the dimension, for example, the {{mvar|q}}-axis alone, but instead of considering only points, takes the set of all complex-valued \"wave functions\" on this axis. Nevertheless, choosing the {{mvar|p}}-axis is an equally valid polarisation, yielding a different representation of the set of possible physical states of the particle which is related to the first representation by the Fourier transformation\n\n:<math>\\phi(p) = \\int \\psi (q) e^{2\\pi i \\frac{pq}{h}}\\, dq.</math>\n\nPhysically realisable states are {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}, and so by the Plancherel theorem, their Fourier transforms are also {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}.  (Note that since {{mvar|q}} is in units of distance and {{mvar|p}} is in units of momentum, the presence of Planck's constant in the exponent makes the exponent [[Nondimensionalization|dimensionless]], as it should be.)\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform can be used to pass from one way of representing the state of the particle, by a wave function of position, to another way of representing the state of the particle: by a wave function of momentum. Infinitely many different polarisations are possible, and all are equally valid. Being able to transform states from one representation to another is sometimes convenient.\n\nThe other use of the Fourier transform in both quantum mechanics and [[quantum field theory]] is to solve the applicable wave equation. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] for a time-varying wave function in one-dimension, not subject to external forces, is\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\psi(x,t) = i \\frac h{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(x,t).</math>\n\nThis is the same as the heat equation except for the presence of the imaginary unit {{mvar|i}}. Fourier methods can be used to solve this equation.\n\nIn the presence of a potential, given by the potential energy function {{math|''V''(''x'')}}, the equation becomes\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\psi(x,t) + V(x)\\psi(x,t) = i \\frac h{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(x,t).</math>\n\nThe \"elementary solutions\", as we referred to them above, are the so-called \"stationary states\" of the particle, and Fourier's algorithm, as described above, can still be used to solve the boundary value problem of the future evolution of {{mvar|\u03c8}} given its values for {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. Neither of these approaches is of much practical use in quantum mechanics. Boundary value problems and the time-evolution of the wave function is not of much practical interest: it is the stationary states that are most important.\n\nIn relativistic quantum mechanics, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation becomes a wave equation as was usual in classical physics, except that complex-valued waves are considered. A simple example, in the absence of interactions with other particles or fields, is the free one-dimensional Klein\u2013Gordon\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Fock equation, this time in dimensionless units,\n\n:<math>\\left (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} +1 \\right) \\psi(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi(x,t).</math>\n\nThis is, from the mathematical point of view, the same as the wave equation of classical physics solved above (but with a complex-valued wave, which makes no difference in the methods). This is of great use in quantum field theory: each separate Fourier component of a wave can be treated as a separate harmonic oscillator and then quantized, a procedure known as \"second quantization\". Fourier methods have been adapted to also deal with non-trivial interactions.\n\n===Signal processing===\nThe Fourier transform is used for the spectral analysis of time-series. The subject of statistical signal processing does not, however, usually apply the Fourier transformation to the signal itself. Even if a real signal is indeed transient, it has been found in practice advisable to model a signal by a function (or, alternatively, a stochastic process) which is stationary in the sense that its characteristic properties are constant over all time. The Fourier transform of such a function does not exist in the usual sense, and it has been found more useful for the analysis of signals to instead take the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function.\n\nThe autocorrelation function {{mvar|R}} of a function {{mvar|f}} is defined by\n\n:<math>R_f (\\tau) = \\lim_{T\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2T} \\int_{-T}^T f(t) f(t+\\tau) \\, dt. </math>\n\nThis function is a function of the time-lag {{mvar|\u03c4}} elapsing between the values of {{mvar|f}} to be correlated.\n\nFor most functions {{mvar|f}} that occur in practice, {{mvar|R}} is a bounded even function of the time-lag {{mvar|\u03c4}} and for typical noisy signals it turns out to be uniformly continuous with a maximum at {{math|''\u03c4'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe autocorrelation function, more properly called the autocovariance function unless it is normalized in some appropriate fashion, measures the strength of the correlation between the values of {{mvar|f}} separated by a time lag. This is a way of searching for the correlation of {{mvar|f}} with its own past. It is useful even for other statistical tasks besides the analysis of signals. For example, if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}} represents the temperature at time {{mvar|t}}, one expects a strong correlation with the temperature at a time lag of 24 hours.\n\nIt possesses a Fourier transform,\n\n:<math> P_f(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty R_f (\\tau) e^{-2\\pi i \\xi\\tau} \\, d\\tau. </math>\n\nThis Fourier transform is called the power spectral density function of {{mvar|f}}. (Unless all periodic components are first filtered out from {{mvar|f}}, this integral will diverge, but it is easy to filter out such periodicities.)\n\nThe power spectrum, as indicated by this density function {{mvar|P}}, measures the amount of variance contributed to the data by the frequency {{mvar|\u03be}}. In electrical signals, the variance is proportional to the average power (energy per unit time), and so the power spectrum describes how much the different frequencies contribute to the average power of the signal. This process is called the spectral analysis of time-series and is analogous to the usual analysis of variance of data that is not a time-series ([[ANOVA]]).\n\nKnowledge of which frequencies are \"important\" in this sense is crucial for the proper design of filters and for the proper evaluation of measuring apparatuses. It can also be useful for the scientific analysis of the phenomena responsible for producing the data.\n\nThe power spectrum of a signal can also be approximately measured directly by measuring the average power that remains in a signal after all the frequencies outside a narrow band have been filtered out.\n\nSpectral analysis is carried out for visual signals as well. The power spectrum ignores all phase relations, which is good enough for many purposes, but for video signals other types of spectral analysis must also be employed, still using the Fourier transform as a tool.\n\n==Other notations==\nOther common notations for {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} include:\n\n:<math>\\tilde{f}(\\xi),\\ \\tilde{f}(\\omega),\\ F(\\xi),\\ \\mathcal{F}\\left(f\\right)(\\xi),\\ \\left(\\mathcal{F}f\\right)(\\xi),\\ \\mathcal{F}(f),\\ \\mathcal F(\\omega),\\ F(\\omega),\\ \\mathcal F(j\\omega),\\ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\},\\ \\mathcal{F} \\bigl(f(t)\\bigr),\\ \\mathcal{F} \\bigl\\{f(t)\\bigr\\}.</math>\n\nDenoting the Fourier transform by a capital letter corresponding to the letter of function being transformed (such as {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''F''(''\u03be'')}}) is especially common in the sciences and engineering. In electronics, omega ({{mvar|\u03c9}}) is often used instead of {{mvar|\u03be}} due to its interpretation as angular frequency, sometimes it is written as {{math|''F''(&thinsp;''j\u03c9'')}}, where {{mvar|j}} is the [[imaginary unit]], to indicate its relationship with the [[Laplace transform]], and sometimes it is written informally as {{math|''F''(2\u03c0''f''&thinsp;)}} in order to use ordinary frequency. In some contexts such as particle physics, the same symbol <math>f</math> may be used for both for a function as well as it Fourier transform, with the two only distinguished by their [[Argument of a function|argument]]: <math>f(k_1 + k_2)</math> would refer to the Fourier transform because of the momentum argument, while <math>f(x_0 + \\pi \\vec r)</math> would refer to the original function because of the positional argument. Although tildes may be used as in <math>\\tilde{f}</math> to indicate Fourier transforms, tildes may also be used to indicate a modification of a quantity with a more [[Lorentz invariant]] form, such as <math>\\tilde{dk} = \\frac{dk}{(2\\pi)^32\\omega}</math>, so care must be taken.\n\nThe interpretation of the complex function {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} may be aided by expressing it in [[polar coordinate]] form\n\n:<math>\\hat f(\\xi) = A(\\xi) e^{i\\varphi(\\xi)}</math>\n\nin terms of the two real functions {{math|''A''(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u03c6''(''\u03be'')}} where:\n\n:<math>A(\\xi) = \\left|\\hat f(\\xi)\\right|,</math>\n\nis the [[amplitude]] and\n\n:<math>\\varphi (\\xi) = \\arg \\left( \\hat f(\\xi) \\right), </math>\n\nis the [[phase (waves)|phase]] (see [[Arg (mathematics)|arg function]]).\n\nThen the inverse transform can be written:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\int _{-\\infty}^\\infty A(\\xi)\\ e^{ i\\bigl(2\\pi \\xi x +\\varphi (\\xi)\\bigr)}\\,d\\xi,</math>\n\nwhich is a recombination of all the frequency components of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. Each component is a complex [[sinusoid]] of the form {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup>}} whose amplitude is {{math|''A''(''\u03be'')}} and whose initial [[phase (waves)|phase angle]] (at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}) is {{math|''\u03c6''(''\u03be'')}}.\n\nThe Fourier transform may be thought of as a mapping on function spaces. This mapping is here denoted {{mathcal|F}} and {{math|{{mathcal|F}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} is used to denote the Fourier transform of the function {{mvar|f}}. This mapping is linear, which means that {{mathcal|F}} can also be seen as a linear transformation on the function space and implies that the standard notation in linear algebra of applying a linear transformation to a vector (here the function {{math|''f''&thinsp;}}) can be used to write {{math|{{mathcal|F}} ''f''}} instead of {{math|{{mathcal|F}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}}. Since the result of applying the Fourier transform is again a function, we can be interested in the value of this function evaluated at the value {{mvar|\u03be}} for its variable, and this is denoted either as {{math|{{mathcal|F}} ''f''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} or as {{math|(&thinsp;{{mathcal|F}} ''f''&thinsp;)(''\u03be'')}}. Notice that in the former case, it is implicitly understood that {{mathcal|F}} is applied first to {{mvar|f}} and then the resulting function is evaluated at {{mvar|\u03be}}, not the other way around.\n\nIn mathematics and various applied sciences, it is often necessary to distinguish between a function {{mvar|f}} and the value of {{mvar|f}} when its variable equals {{mvar|x}}, denoted {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. This means that a notation like {{math|{{mathcal|F}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;(''x''))}} formally can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of the values of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|x}}. Despite this flaw, the previous notation appears frequently, often when a particular function or a function of a particular variable is to be transformed. For example,\n\n:<math>\\mathcal F\\bigl( \\operatorname{rect}(x) \\bigr) = \\operatorname{sinc}(\\xi)</math>\n\nis sometimes used to express that the Fourier transform of a [[rectangular function]] is a [[sinc function]], or\n\n:<math>\\mathcal F\\bigl(f(x + x_0)\\bigr) = \\mathcal F\\bigl(f(x)\\bigr) e^{2\\pi i \\xi x_0}</math>\n\nis used to express the shift property of the Fourier transform.\n\nNotice, that the last example is only correct under the assumption that the transformed function is a function of {{mvar|x}}, not of {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}.\n\n==Other conventions==\nThe Fourier transform can also be written in terms of [[angular frequency]]:\n\n:<math>\\omega = 2\\pi \\xi,</math>\n\nwhose units are [[radian]]s per second.\n\nThe substitution {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''\u03c9''|2\u03c0}}}} into the formulas above produces this convention:\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\omega) = \\int_{\\mathbb R^n} f(x) e^{-i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx.</math>\n\nUnder this convention, the inverse transform becomes:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^n} \\int_{\\mathbb R^n} \\hat{f}(\\omega)e^{i\\omega \\cdot x}\\, d\\omega.</math>\n\nUnlike the convention followed in this article, when the Fourier transform is defined this way, it is no longer a [[unitary transformation]] on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. There is also less symmetry between the formulas for the Fourier transform and its inverse.\n\nAnother convention is to split the factor of {{math|(2\u03c0)<sup>''n''</sup>}} evenly between the Fourier transform and its inverse, which leads to definitions:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}(\\omega) &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{- i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx, \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}(\\omega) e^{ i\\omega \\cdot x}\\, d\\omega.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nUnder this convention, the Fourier transform is again a unitary transformation on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. It also restores the symmetry between the Fourier transform and its inverse.\n\nVariations of all three conventions can be created by conjugating the complex-exponential [[integral kernel|kernel]] of both the forward and the reverse transform. The signs must be opposites. Other than that, the choice is (again) a matter of convention.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of popular forms of the Fourier transform, one-dimensional\n|-\n! ordinary frequency {{mvar|\u03be}} (Hz)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_1(\\xi)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\cdot e^{-2 \\pi i x\\cdot\\xi}\\, dx = \\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\cdot \\hat{f}_2(2 \\pi \\xi) = \\hat{f}_3(2 \\pi \\xi) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}_1(\\xi)\\cdot e^{2 \\pi i x\\cdot \\xi}\\, d\\xi \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | angular frequency {{mvar|\u03c9}} (rad/s)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_2(\\omega)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\cdot  e^{-i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\cdot \\hat{f}_1 \\! \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\cdot \\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}_2(\\omega)\\cdot e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! non-unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\cdot  e^{-i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\hat{f}_1 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = \\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\cdot \\hat{f}_2(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}_3(\\omega)\\cdot e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Generalization for {{math|''n''}}-dimensional functions\n|-\n! ordinary frequency {{mvar|\u03be}} (Hz)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_1(\\xi)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-2 \\pi i x\\cdot\\xi}\\, dx = (2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}\\hat{f}_2(2 \\pi \\xi) = \\hat{f}_3(2 \\pi \\xi) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}_1(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i x\\cdot \\xi}\\, d\\xi \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | angular frequency {{mvar|\u03c9}} (rad/s)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_2(\\omega)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\hat{f}_1 \\! \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}_2(\\omega)e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! non-unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\hat{f}_1 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = (2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2} \\hat{f}_2(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^n} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}_3(\\omega) e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|}\n\nAs discussed above, the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of a random variable is the same as the [[Fourier transform#Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform|Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform]] of its distribution measure, but in this context it is typical to take a different convention for the constants.

Unlike any of the conventions appearing above, this convention takes the opposite sign in the exponent.\n\n== Computation methods ==\n\nThe appropriate computation method largely depends how the original mathematical function is represented and the desired form of the output function.\n\nSince the fundamental definition of a Fourier transform is an integral, functions that can be expressed as [[closed-form expression]]s are commonly computed by working the integral analytically to yield a closed-form expression in the Fourier transform conjugate variable as the result. This is the method used to generate tables of Fourier transforms,<ref name=\"Zwillinger_2014\">{{harvnb|Gradshteyn|Ryzhik|Geronimus|Tseytlin|2015}}.</ref> including those found in the table below ([[Fourier transform#Tables of important Fourier transforms]]).\n\nMany computer algebra systems such as [[Matlab]] and [[Mathematica]] that are capable of [[symbolic integration]] are capable of computing Fourier transforms analytically. For example, to compute the Fourier transform of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'') {{=}} cos(6\u03c0''t'') ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03c0''t''<sup>2</sup></sup>}} one might enter the command {{code|integrate cos(6*pi*t) exp(\u2212pi*t^2) exp(-i*2*pi*f*t) from -inf to inf}} into [[Wolfram Alpha]].\n\n===Numerical integration of closed-form functions===\nIf the input function is in closed-form and the desired output function is a series of ordered pairs (for example a table of values from which a graph can be generated) over a specified domain, then the Fourier transform can be generated by [[numerical integration]] at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which a value of the output variable is desired.<ref>{{harvnb|Press|Flannery|Teukolsky|Vetterling|1992}}.</ref> Note that this method requires computing a separate numerical integration for each value of frequency for which a value of the Fourier transform is desired.<ref>{{harvnb|Bailey|Swarztrauber|1994}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lado|1971}}.</ref> The numerical integration approach works on a much broader class of functions than the analytic approach, because it yields results for functions that do not have closed form Fourier transform integrals.\n\n===Numerical integration of a series of ordered pairs===\nIf the input function is a series of ordered pairs (for example, a time series from measuring an output variable repeatedly over a time interval) then the output function must also be a series of ordered pairs (for example, a complex number vs. frequency over a specified domain of frequencies), unless certain assumptions and approximations are made allowing the output function to be approximated by a closed-form expression. In the general case where the available input series of ordered pairs are assumed be samples representing a continuous function over an interval (amplitude vs. time, for example), the series of ordered pairs representing the desired output function can be obtained by numerical integration of the input data over the available interval at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which the value of the Fourier transform is desired.<ref>{{harvnb|Simonen|Olkkonen|1985}}.</ref>\n\nExplicit numerical integration over the ordered pairs can yield the Fourier transform output value for any desired value of the conjugate Fourier transform variable (frequency, for example), so that a spectrum can be produced at any desired step size and over any desired variable range for accurate determination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases corresponding to isolated peaks. Unlike limitations in DFT and FFT methods, explicit numerical integration can have any desired step size and compute the Fourier transform over any desired range of the conjugate Fourier transform variable (for example, frequency).\n\n===Discrete Fourier transforms and fast Fourier transforms===\nIf the ordered pairs representing the original input function are equally spaced in their input variable (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform is known as a [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of step size equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled every 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1&nbsp;Hz frequency spacing.\n\n==Tables of important Fourier transforms==\nThe following tables record some closed-form Fourier transforms. For functions {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}, {{math|''g''(''x'')}} and {{math|''h''(''x'')}} denote their Fourier transforms by {{math|''f\u0302''}}, {{math|''\u011d''}}, and {{math|''\u0125''}} respectively. Only the three most common conventions are included. It may be useful to notice that entry 105 gives a relationship between the Fourier transform of a function and the original function, which can be seen as relating the Fourier transform and its inverse.\n\n===Functional relationships, one-dimensional===\nThe Fourier transforms in this table may be found in {{harvtxt|Erd\u00e9lyi|1954}} or {{harvtxt|Kammler|2000|loc=appendix}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !!

A special case is the expression of a musical [[Chord (music)|chord]] in terms of the volumes and frequencies of its constituent notes. The term ''Fourier transform'' refers to both the [[frequency domain]] representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of [[Time in physics|time]]. The Fourier transform of a function of time is itself a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function of frequency, whose magnitude ([[absolute value|modulus]]) represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] is the [[phase offset]] of the basic sinusoid in that frequency. The Fourier transform is not limited to functions of time, but the [[Domain of a function|domain of the original function]] is commonly referred to as the ''[[time domain]]''.  There is also an ''inverse Fourier transform'' that mathematically synthesizes the original function from its frequency domain representation.\n<!--Sorry... I need more explanation than the following statement.  So you can be sure that a majority of readers also do.\nThis can then be displayed as a graphic, with the time domain replaced by a ''spatial domain''.

The operation of [[derivative|differentiation]] in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by the frequency,<ref group=\"remark\">Up to an imaginary constant factor whose magnitude depends on what Fourier transform convention is used.</ref> so some [[differential equation]]s are easier to analyze in the frequency domain. Also, [[convolution]] in the time domain corresponds to ordinary multiplication in the frequency domain (see [[Convolution theorem]]). After performing the desired operations, transformation of the result can be made back to the time domain. [[Harmonic analysis]] is the systematic study of the relationship between the frequency and time domains, including the kinds of functions or operations that are \"simpler\" in one or the other, and has deep connections to many areas of modern mathematics.\n\nFunctions that are localized in the time domain have Fourier transforms that are spread out across the frequency domain and vice versa, a phenomenon known as the [[#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]]. The [[critical point (mathematics)|critical]] case for this principle is the [[Gaussian function]], of substantial importance in [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]] as well as in the study of physical phenomena exhibiting [[normal distribution]] (e.g., [[diffusion]]). The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. [[Joseph Fourier]] introduced the transform in his study of [[heat transfer]], where Gaussian functions appear as solutions of the [[heat equation]].\n\nThe Fourier transform can be formally defined as an [[improper integral|improper]] [[Riemann integral]], making it an [[integral transform]], although this definition is not suitable for many applications requiring a more sophisticated integration theory.<ref group=\"remark\">Depending on the application a [[Lebesgue integral]], [[distribution (mathematics)|distributional]], or other approach may be most appropriate.</ref> For example, many relatively simple applications use the [[Dirac delta function]], which can be treated formally as if it were a function, but the justification requires a mathematically more sophisticated viewpoint.<ref group=\"remark\">{{harvtxt|Vretblad|2000}} provides solid justification for these formal procedures without going too deeply into [[functional analysis]] or the [[distribution (mathematics)|theory of distributions]].</ref> The Fourier transform can also be generalized to functions of several variables on Euclidean space, sending a function of {{nowrap|3-dimensional}} 'position space' to a function of {{nowrap|3-dimensional}} momentum (or a function of space and time to a function of [[4-momentum]]). This idea makes the spatial Fourier transform very natural in the study of waves, as well as in [[quantum mechanics]], where it is important to be able to represent wave solutions as functions of either position or momentum and sometimes both. In general, functions to which Fourier methods are applicable are complex-valued, and possibly [[vector-valued function|vector-valued]].<ref group=\"remark\">In [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] one encounters vector-valued Fourier transforms of multi-component wave functions. In [[quantum field theory]], operator-valued Fourier transforms of operator-valued functions of spacetime are in frequent use, see for example {{harvtxt|Greiner|Reinhardt|1996}}.</ref> Still further generalization is possible to functions on [[group (mathematics)|groups]], which, besides the original Fourier transform on {{math|'''\u211d'''}} or {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} (viewed as groups under addition), notably includes the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT, group = [[integers|{{math|'''\u2124'''}}]]), the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT, group = [[cyclic group|{{math|'''\u2124''' mod ''N''}}]]) and the [[Fourier series]] or circular Fourier transform (group = [[circle group|{{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}}]], the unit circle \u2248 closed finite interval with endpoints identified). The latter is routinely employed to handle [[periodic function]]s. The [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) is an algorithm for computing the DFT.\n\n==Definition==\nThe Fourier transform of a function {{mvar|f}} is traditionally denoted <math> \\hat{f}</math>, by adding a [[circumflex]] to the symbol of the function.

The [[#Fourier transform on Euclidean space|Fourier transform on Euclidean space]] is treated separately, in which the variable {{mvar|x}} often represents position and {{mvar|\u03be}} momentum. The conventions chosen in this article are those of [[harmonic analysis]], and are characterized as the unique conventions such that the Fourier transform is both [[Unitary operator|unitary]] on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} and an algebra homomorphism from {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} to {{math|''L''<sup>\u221e</sup>}}, without renormalizing the Lebesgue measure.<ref>{{harvnb|Folland|1989}}.</ref>\n\nMany other characterizations of the Fourier transform exist. For example, one uses the [[Stone\u2013von Neumann theorem]]: the Fourier transform is the unique unitary [[intertwiner]] for the symplectic and Euclidean Schr\u00f6dinger representations of the [[Heisenberg group]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Fourier analysis#History|Fourier series#History}}\nIn 1822, [[Joseph Fourier]] showed that some functions could be written as an infinite sum of harmonics.<ref>{{harvnb|Fourier|1822}}.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\n{{See also|Fourier analysis}}\n[[File:Fourier transform time and frequency domains (small).gif|frame|right|In the first frames of the animation, a function {{mvar|f}} is resolved into Fourier series: a linear combination of sines and cosines (in blue). The component frequencies of these sines and cosines spread across the frequency spectrum, are represented as peaks in the frequency domain (actually [[Dirac delta function]]s, shown in the last frames of the animation). The frequency domain representation of the function, {{math|''f\u0302''}}, is the collection of these peaks at the frequencies that appear in this resolution of the function.]]\nOne motivation for the Fourier transform comes from the study of [[Fourier series]]. In the study of Fourier series, complicated but periodic functions are written as the sum of simple waves mathematically represented by [[sine]]s and [[cosine]]s. The Fourier transform is an extension of the Fourier series that results when the period of the represented function is lengthened and allowed to approach [[infinity (mathematics)|infinity]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taneja|2008|p=192}}.</ref>\n\nDue to the properties of sine and cosine, it is possible to recover the amplitude of each wave in a Fourier series using an integral. In many cases it is desirable to use [[Euler's formula]], which states that {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup> {{=}} cos(2\u03c0''\u03b8'') + ''i'' sin(2\u03c0''\u03b8'')}}, to write Fourier series in terms of the basic waves {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup>}}. This has the advantage of simplifying many of the formulas involved, and provides a formulation for Fourier series that more closely resembles the definition followed in this article. Re-writing sines and cosines as [[complex exponentials]] makes it necessary for the Fourier coefficients to be complex valued. The usual interpretation of this complex number is that it gives both the [[amplitude]] (or size) of the wave present in the function and the [[phase (waves)|phase]] (or the initial angle) of the wave. These complex exponentials sometimes contain negative \"frequencies\". If {{mvar|\u03b8}} is measured in seconds, then the waves {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup>}} and {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i\u03b8''</sup>}} both complete one cycle per second, but they represent different frequencies in the Fourier transform. Hence, frequency no longer measures the number of cycles per unit time, but is still closely related.\n\nThere is a close connection between the definition of Fourier series and the Fourier transform for functions {{mvar|f}} that are zero outside an interval. For such a function, we can calculate its Fourier series on any interval that includes the points where {{mvar|f}} is not identically zero. The Fourier transform is also defined for such a function. As we increase the length of the interval in which we calculate the Fourier series, then the Fourier series coefficients begin to resemble the Fourier transform and the sum of the Fourier series of {{mvar|f}} begins to resemble the inverse Fourier transform. More precisely, suppose {{mvar|T}} is large enough that the interval {{math|[\u2212{{sfrac|''T''|2}}, {{sfrac|''T''|2}}]}} contains the interval in which {{mvar|f}} is not identically zero. Then, the {{mvar|n}}th series coefficient {{mvar|c<sub>n</sub>}} is given by:\n\n:<math>c_n = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-\\frac{T}{2}}^\\frac{T}{2} f(x)\\, e^{-2\\pi i\\left(\\frac{n}{T}\\right) x} \\, dx.</math>\n\nComparing this to the definition of the Fourier transform, it follows that:\n\n:<math>c_n = \\frac{1}{T}\\hat f\\left(\\frac{n}{T}\\right)</math>\n\nsince {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is zero outside {{math|[\u2212{{sfrac|''T''|2}}, {{sfrac|''T''|2}}]}}. Thus, the Fourier coefficients are equal to the values of the Fourier transform sampled on a grid of width {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}}}}, multiplied by the grid width {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}}}}.\n\nUnder appropriate conditions, the Fourier series of {{mvar|f}} will equal the function {{mvar|f}}. In other words, {{mvar|f}} can be written:\n\n:<math>f(x)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty c_n\\, e^{2\\pi i\\left(\\frac{n}{T}\\right) x} =\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat{f}(\\xi_n)\\ e^{2\\pi i\\xi_n x}\\Delta\\xi,</math>\n\nwhere the last sum is simply the first sum rewritten using the definitions {{math|''\u03be<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|n|T}}''}}, and {{math|\u0394''\u03be'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''n'' + 1|''T''}} \u2212 {{sfrac|''n''|''T''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''T''}}}}.\n\nThis second sum is a [[Riemann sum]]. By letting {{math|''T'' \u2192 \u221e}} it will converge to the integral for the inverse Fourier transform as expressed above. Under suitable conditions, this argument may be made precise.<ref name=\"Stein-Shakarchi-2003\">{{harvnb|Stein|Shakarchi|2003}}.</ref>\n\nIn the study of Fourier series the numbers {{mvar|c<sub>n</sub>}} could be thought of as the \"amount\" of the wave present in the Fourier series of {{mvar|f}}. Similarly, as seen above, the Fourier transform can be thought of as a function that measures how much of each individual frequency is present in our function {{mvar|f}}, and we can recombine these waves by using an integral (or \"continuous sum\") to reproduce the original function.\n\n==Example==\nThe following figures provide a visual illustration how the Fourier transform measures whether a frequency is present in a particular function. The depicted function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'') {{=}} cos(6\u03c0''t'') ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03c0''t''<sup>2</sup></sup>}} oscillates at 3&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] (if {{mvar|t}} measures seconds) and tends quickly to 0. (The second factor in this equation is an [[Envelope (waves)|envelope function]] that shapes the continuous sinusoid into a short pulse. Its general form is a [[Gaussian function]]). This function was specially chosen to have a real Fourier transform that can be easily plotted. The first image contains its graph. In order to calculate <math>\\hat{f}(3)</math> we must integrate {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i''(3''t'')</sup>''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}}. The second image shows the plot of the real and imaginary parts of this function. The real part of the integrand is almost always positive, because when {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}} is negative, the real part of {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i''(3''t'')</sup>}} is negative as well. Because they oscillate at the same rate, when {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}} is positive, so is the real part of {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''i''(3''t'')</sup>}}. The result is that when you integrate the real part of the integrand you get a relatively large number (in this case {{sfrac|1|2}}). On the other hand, when you try to measure a frequency that is not present, as in the case when we look at <math>\\hat{f}(5)</math>, you see that both real and imaginary component of this function vary rapidly between positive and negative values, as plotted in the third image. Therefore, in this case, the integrand oscillates fast enough so that the integral is very small and the value for the Fourier transform for that frequency is nearly zero.\n\nThe general situation may be a bit more complicated than this, but this in spirit is how the Fourier transform measures how much of an individual frequency is present in a function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}}.\n<gallery widths=\"360px\" heights=\"360px\">\nFile:Function ocsillating at 3 hertz.svg|Original function showing oscillation 3&nbsp;Hz.\nFile:Onfreq.svg| Real and imaginary parts of integrand for Fourier transform at 3&nbsp;Hz\nFile:Offfreq.svg| Real and imaginary parts of integrand for Fourier transform at 5&nbsp;Hz\nFile:Fourier transform of oscillating function.svg| Magnitude of Fourier transform, with 3 and 5&nbsp;Hz labeled.\n</gallery>\n\n==Properties of the Fourier transform==\nHere we assume {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}, {{math|''g''(''x'')}} and {{math|''h''(''x'')}} are ''integrable functions'': [[Lebesgue-measurable]] on the real line satisfying:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |f(x)| \\, dx < \\infty.</math>\n\nWe denote the Fourier transforms of these functions as {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}}, {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u0125''(''\u03be'')}} respectively.\n\n===Basic properties===\nThe Fourier transform has the following basic properties:<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\">{{harvnb|Pinsky|2002}}.</ref>\n\n====Linearity====\n\n: For any [[complex number]]s {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, if {{math|''h''(''x'') {{=}} ''af''&nbsp;(''x'') + ''bg''(''x'')}}, then {{math|''\u0125''(''\u03be'') {{=}} ''a'' \u00b7 ''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'') + ''b'' \u00b7 ''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}}.\n\n====Translation / time shifting====\n[[File:Fourier transform - time shifted signal.gif|thumb|middle|right|upright=1.75|Animation showing the Fourier Transform of a time shifted signal.

Since reversing time is two-periodic, applying this twice yields {{math|{{mathcal|F}}{{isup|4}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;) {{=}} ''f''}}, so the Fourier transform operator is four-periodic, and similarly the inverse Fourier transform can be obtained by applying the Fourier transform three times: {{math|{{mathcal|F}}{{isup|3}}(&thinsp;''f\u0302''&thinsp;) {{=}} ''f''}}.

These are not true for all functions, but are true under various conditions, which are the content of the various forms of the [[Fourier inversion theorem]].\n\nThis fourfold periodicity of the Fourier transform is similar to a rotation of the plane by 90\u00b0, particularly as the two-fold iteration yields a reversal, and in fact this analogy can be made precise. While the Fourier transform can simply be interpreted as switching the time domain and the frequency domain, with the inverse Fourier transform switching them back, more geometrically it can be interpreted as a rotation by 90\u00b0 in the [[time\u2013frequency domain]] (considering time as the {{mvar|x}}-axis and frequency as the {{mvar|y}}-axis), and the Fourier transform can be generalized to the [[fractional Fourier transform]], which involves rotations by other angles. This can be further generalized to [[linear canonical transformation]]s, which can be visualized as the action of the [[special linear group]] {{math|[[SL2(R)|SL<sub>2</sub>('''\u211d''')]]}} on the time\u2013frequency plane, with the preserved symplectic form corresponding to the [[#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]], below. This approach is particularly studied in [[signal processing]], under [[time\u2013frequency analysis]].\n\n===Units and duality===\n\nIn mathematics, one often does not think of any units as being attached to the two variables {{mvar|t}} and {{mvar|\u03be}}. <!--If one identifies these two copies of the real line, then one can regard the Fourier transformation as a linear mapping from {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} to itself.--> But in physical applications, {{mvar|\u03be}} must have inverse units to the units of {{mvar|t}}. For example, if {{mvar|t}} is measured in seconds, {{mvar|\u03be}}\nshould be in cycles per second for the formulas here to be valid. If the scale of {{mvar|t}} is changed and {{mvar|t}} is measured in units of 2{{pi}} seconds, then either {{mvar|\u03be}} must be in the so-called \"[[angular frequency]]\", or one must insert some constant scale factor into some of the formulas. If {{mvar|t}} is measured in units of length, then {{mvar|\u03be}} must be in inverse length, e.g., [[Wavenumber|wavenumbers]]. That is to say, there are two copies of the real line: one measured in one set of units, where {{mvar|t}} ranges, and the other in inverse units to the units of {{mvar|t}}, and which is the range of {{mvar|\u03be}}. So these are two distinct copies of the real line, and cannot be identified with each other. Therefore, the Fourier transform goes from one space of functions to a different space of functions: functions which have a different domain of definition.\n\nIn general, {{mvar|\u03be}} must always be taken to be a [[linear form]] on the space of {{mvar|t}}s, which is to say that the second real line is the [[dual space]] of the first real line. See the article on [[linear algebra]] for a more formal explanation and for more details. This point of view becomes essential in generalisations of the Fourier transform to general [[symmetry groups]], including the case of Fourier series.\n\nThat there is no one preferred way (often, one says \"no canonical way\") to compare the two copies of the real line which are involved in the Fourier transform\u2014fixing the units on one line does not force the scale of the units on the other line\u2014is the reason for the plethora of rival conventions on the definition of the Fourier transform. The various definitions resulting from different choices of units differ by various constants. If the units of {{mvar|t}} are in seconds but the units of {{mvar|\u03be}} are in angular frequency, then the angular frequency variable is often denoted by one or another Greek letter, for example, {{math|''\u03c9'' {{=}} 2\u03c0''\u03be''}} is quite common. Thus (writing {{math|''x\u0302''<sub>1</sub>}} for the alternative definition and {{math|''x\u0302''}} for the definition adopted in this article)\n\n:<math>\\hat x_1(\\omega) = \\hat x \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}\\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} \\, dt</math>\n\nas before, but the corresponding alternative inversion formula would then have to be\n\n:<math> x(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat x_1(\\omega) e^{it\\omega} \\, d\\omega .</math>\n\nTo have something involving angular frequency but with greater symmetry between the Fourier transform and the inversion formula, one very often sees still another alternative definition of the Fourier transform, with a factor of {{sqrt|2{{pi}}}}, thus\n\n:<math>\\hat x_2 (\\omega) = \\frac 1 {\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} \\, dt ,</math>\nand the corresponding inversion formula then has to be\n\n:<math> x(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat x_2(\\omega) e^{it\\omega} \\, d\\omega .</math>\n\nIn some unusual conventions, such as those employed by the FourierTransform command of the [[Wolfram Language]], the Fourier transform has {{mvar|i}} in the exponent instead of {{math|\u2212''i''}}, and vice versa for the inversion formula.  Many of the identities involving the Fourier transform remain valid in those conventions, provided all terms that explicitly involve {{math|''i''}} have it replaced by {{math|&minus;''i''}}.\n\nFor example, in probability theory, the characteristic function {{mvar|\u03d5}} of the probability density function {{mvar|f}} of a random variable {{mvar|X}} of continuous type is defined without a negative sign in the exponential, and since the units of {{mvar|x}} are ignored, there is no 2{{pi}} either:\n\n:<math>\\phi (\\lambda) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) e^{i\\lambda x} \\,dx.</math>\n\n(In probability theory, and in mathematical statistics, the use of the Fourier\u2014Stieltjes transform is preferred, because so many random variables are not of continuous type, and do not possess a density function, and one must treat not functions but [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], i.e., measures which possess \"atoms\".)\n\nFrom the higher point of view of [[Character theory|group characters]], which is much more abstract, all these arbitrary choices disappear, as will be explained in the later section of this article, which treats the notion of the Fourier transform of a function on a [[Locally compact abelian group|locally compact Abelian group]].\n\n===Uniform continuity and the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma===\n[[File:Rectangular function.svg|thumb|The [[rectangular function]] is [[Lebesgue integrable]].]]\n[[File:Sinc function (normalized).svg|thumb|The [[sinc function]], which is the Fourier transform of the rectangular function, is bounded and continuous, but not Lebesgue integrable.]]\nThe Fourier transform may be defined in some cases for non-integrable functions, but the Fourier transforms of integrable functions have several strong properties.\n\nThe Fourier transform {{math|''f\u0302''}} of any integrable function {{mvar|f}} is [[uniformly continuous]] and<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\">{{harvnb|Katznelson|1976}}.</ref>\n:<math>\\left\\|\\hat{f}\\right\\|_\\infty \\leq \\left\\|f\\right\\|_1</math>\n\nBy the ''[[Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma]]'',<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\">{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971}}.</ref>\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi) \\to 0\\text{ as }|\\xi| \\to \\infty.</math>\n\nHowever, <math>\\hat{f}</math> need not be integrable. For example, the Fourier transform of the [[rectangular function]], which is integrable, is the [[sinc function]], which is not [[Lebesgue integrable]], because its [[improper integral]]s behave analogously to the [[alternating harmonic series]], in converging to a sum without being [[absolutely convergent]].\n\nIt is not generally possible to write the ''inverse transform'' as a [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, when both {{mvar|f}} and <math>\\hat{f}</math> are integrable, the inverse equality\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat f(\\xi) e^{2 i \\pi x \\xi} \\, d\\xi</math>\n\nholds [[almost everywhere]]. That is, the Fourier transform is [[injective]] on {{math|[[Lp space|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''')]]}}. (But if {{mvar|f}} is continuous, then equality holds for every {{mvar|x}}.)\n\n===Plancherel theorem and Parseval's theorem===\nLet {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}} be integrable, and let {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} be their Fourier transforms. If ''f''&thinsp;(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') are also [[square-integrable]], then the Parseval formula follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1987|p=187}}.</ref>\n\n: <math>\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\overline{g(x)} \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\overline{\\hat{g}(\\xi)} \\,d\\xi,</math>\n\nwhere the bar denotes [[complex conjugation]].\n\nThe [[Plancherel theorem]], which follows from the above, states that<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1987|p=186}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left| f(x) \\right|^2\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left| \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\right|^2\\,d\\xi. </math>\n\nPlancherel's theorem makes it possible to extend the Fourier transform, by a continuity argument, to a [[unitary operator]] on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}}. On {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''') \u2229 ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}}, this extension agrees with original Fourier transform defined on {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''')}}, thus enlarging the domain of the Fourier transform to {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d''') + ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} (and consequently to {{math|{{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}('''\u211d''')}} for {{math|1 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 2}}). Plancherel's theorem has the interpretation in the sciences that the Fourier transform preserves the [[energy]] of the original quantity. The terminology of these formulas is not quite standardised. Parseval's theorem was proved only for Fourier series, and was first proved by Lyapunov. But Parseval's formula makes sense for the Fourier transform as well, and so even though in the context of the Fourier transform it was proved by Plancherel, it is still often referred to as Parseval's formula, or Parseval's relation, or even Parseval's theorem.\n\nSee [[Pontryagin duality]] for a general formulation of this concept in the context of locally compact abelian groups.\n\n===Poisson summation formula===\n{{Main|Poisson summation formula}}\n\nThe Poisson summation formula (PSF) is an equation that relates the [[Fourier series]] coefficients of the [[periodic summation]] of a function to values of the function's continuous Fourier transform. The Poisson summation formula says that for sufficiently regular functions {{mvar|f}},\n\n:<math> \\sum_n \\hat f(n) = \\sum_n f (n).</math>\n\nIt has a variety of useful forms that are derived from the basic one by application of the Fourier transform's scaling and time-shifting properties. The formula has applications in engineering, physics, and [[number theory]]. The frequency-domain dual of the standard Poisson summation formula is also called the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]].\n\nPoisson summation is generally associated with the physics of periodic media, such as heat conduction on a circle. The fundamental solution of the heat equation on a circle is called a [[theta function]]. It is used in [[number theory]] to prove the transformation properties of theta functions, which turn out to be a type of [[modular form]], and it is connected more generally to the theory of [[automorphic form]]s where it appears on one side of the [[Selberg trace formula]].\n\n===Differentiation===\nSuppose {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an absolutely continuous differentiable function, and both {{math|''f''}} and its derivative {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''}} are integrable. Then the Fourier transform of the derivative is given by\n:<math>\\widehat{f'\\;}(\\xi)=2\\pi i\\xi\\hat{f}(\\xi).</math>\nMore generally, the Fourier transformation of the {{mvar|n}}th derivative {{math|''f''{{isup|(''n'')}}}} is given by\n:<math>\\widehat{f^{(n)}}(\\xi)=(2\\pi i\\xi)^n\\hat{f}(\\xi).</math>\n\nBy applying the Fourier transform and using these formulas, some [[ordinary differential equation]]s can be transformed into algebraic equations, which are much easier to solve. These formulas also give rise to the rule of thumb \"{{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is smooth [[if and only if]] {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} quickly falls to 0 for {{math|{{abs|''\u03be''}} \u2192 \u221e}}.\" By using the analogous rules for the inverse Fourier transform, one can also say \"{{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} quickly falls to 0 for {{math|{{abs|''x''}} \u2192 \u221e}} if and only if {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} is smooth.\"\n\n===Convolution theorem===\n{{Main|Convolution theorem}}\n\nThe Fourier transform translates between [[convolution]] and multiplication of functions. If {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}} are integrable functions with Fourier transforms {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} respectively, then the Fourier transform of the convolution is given by the product of the Fourier transforms {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} (under other conventions for the definition of the Fourier transform a constant factor may appear).\n\nThis means that if:\n\n:<math>h(x) = (f*g)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(y)g(x - y)\\,dy,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2217}} denotes the convolution operation, then:\n\n:<math>\\hat{h}(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(\\xi)\\cdot \\hat{g}(\\xi).</math>\n\nIn [[LTI system theory|linear time invariant (LTI) system theory]], it is common to interpret {{math|''g''(''x'')}} as the [[impulse response]] of an LTI system with input {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and output {{math|''h''(''x'')}}, since substituting the [[Dirac delta function|unit impulse]] for {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} yields {{math|''h''(''x'') {{=}} ''g''(''x'')}}. In this case, {{math|''\u011d''(''\u03be'')}} represents the [[frequency response]] of the system.\n\nConversely, if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} can be decomposed as the product of two square integrable functions {{math|''p''(''x'')}} and {{math|''q''(''x'')}}, then the Fourier transform of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is given by the convolution of the respective Fourier transforms {{math|''p\u0302''(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''q\u0302''(''\u03be'')}}.\n\n===Cross-correlation theorem===\n{{Main|Cross-correlation}}\n\nIn an analogous manner, it can be shown that if {{math|''h''(''x'')}} is the [[cross-correlation]] of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}}:\n\n:<math>h(x) = (f \\star g)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\overline{f(y)}g(x + y)\\,dy</math>\n\nthen the Fourier transform of {{math|''h''(''x'')}} is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{h}(\\xi) = \\overline{\\hat{f}(\\xi)} \\cdot \\hat{g}(\\xi).</math>\n\nAs a special case, the [[autocorrelation]] of function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is:\n\n:<math>h(x) = (f \\star f)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\overline{f(y)}f(x + y)\\,dy</math>\n\nfor which\n\n:<math>\\hat{h}(\\xi) = \\overline{\\hat{f}(\\xi)}\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\left|\\hat{f}(\\xi)\\right|^2.</math>\n\n===Eigenfunctions===\nOne important choice of an orthonormal basis for {{math|[[Square-integrable function|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')]]}} is given by the Hermite functions\n\n: <math>\\psi_n(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{2}}{\\sqrt{n!}} e^{-\\pi x^2}\\mathrm{He}_n\\left(2x\\sqrt{\\pi}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{math|He<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}} are the \"probabilist's\" [[Hermite polynomial]]s, defined as\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{He}_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\left(\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^n e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}</math>\n\nUnder this convention for the Fourier transform, we have that\n\n: <math> \\hat\\psi_n(\\xi) = (-i)^n \\psi_n(\\xi) </math>.\n\nIn other words, the Hermite functions form a complete [[orthonormal]] system of [[eigenfunctions]] for the Fourier transform on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}}.<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\" /> However, this choice of eigenfunctions is not unique. There are only four different [[eigenvalue]]s of the Fourier transform (\u00b11 and \u00b1{{mvar|i}}) and any linear combination of eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue gives another eigenfunction. As a consequence of this, it is possible to decompose {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} as a direct sum of four spaces {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''H''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''H''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|''H''<sub>3</sub>}} where the Fourier transform acts on {{math|He<sub>''k''</sub>}} simply by multiplication by {{math|''i''<sup>''k''</sup>}}.\n\nSince the complete set of Hermite functions provides a resolution of the identity, the Fourier transform can be represented by such a sum of terms weighted by the above eigenvalues, and these sums can be explicitly summed. This approach to define the Fourier transform was first done by [[Norbert Wiener]].<ref name=\"Duoandikoetxea-2001\">{{harvnb|Duoandikoetxea|2001}}.</ref> Among other properties, Hermite functions decrease exponentially fast in both frequency and time domains, and they are thus used to define a generalization of the Fourier transform, namely the [[fractional Fourier transform]] used in time-frequency analysis.<ref name=\"Boashash-2003\">{{harvnb|Boashash|2003}}.</ref> In [[physics]], this transform was introduced by [[Edward Condon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Condon|1937}}.</ref>\n\n===Connection with the Heisenberg group===\nThe [[Heisenberg group]] is a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[unitary operator]]s on the [[Hilbert space]] {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d''')}} of square integrable complex valued functions {{mvar|f}} on the real line, generated by the translations {{math|(''T<sub>y</sub> f''&thinsp;)(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&nbsp;(''x'' + ''y'')}} and multiplication by {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup>}}, {{math|(''M<sub>\u03be</sub> f''&thinsp;)(''x'') {{=}} ''e''<sup>2\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup> ''f''&nbsp;(''x'')}}.

As an abstract group, the Heisenberg group is the three-dimensional [[Lie group]] of triples {{math|(''x'', ''\u03be'', ''z'') \u2208 '''\u211d'''<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 ''U''(1)}}, with the group law\n:<math>\\left(x_1, \\xi_1, t_1\\right) \\cdot \\left(x_2, \\xi_2, t_2\\right) = \\left(x_1 + x_2, \\xi_1 + \\xi_2, t_1 t_2 e^{2\\pi i \\left(x_1\\xi_1 + x_2\\xi_2 + x_1\\xi_2\\right)}\\right).</math>\n\nDenote the Heisenberg group by {{math|''H''<sub>1</sub>}}.

As with the one-dimensional case, there are many conventions. For an integrable function {{math|''f''&thinsp;('''x''')}}, this article takes the definition:\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) = \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) = \\int_{\\R^n} f(\\mathbf{x}) e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\, d\\mathbf{x}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''\u03be'''}} are {{mvar|n}}-dimensional [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]], and {{math|'''x''' \u00b7 '''\u03be'''}} is the [[dot product]] of the vectors. The dot product is sometimes written as {{math|\u27e8'''x''', '''\u03be'''\u27e9}}.\n\nAll of the basic properties listed above hold for the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional Fourier transform, as do Plancherel's and Parseval's theorem. When the function is integrable, the Fourier transform is still uniformly continuous and the [[Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma]] holds.<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" />\n\n===Uncertainty principle===\n{{details|Gabor limit}}\nGenerally speaking, the more concentrated {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is, the more spread out its Fourier transform {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} must be. In particular, the scaling property of the Fourier transform may be seen as saying: if we squeeze a function in {{mvar|x}}, its Fourier transform stretches out in {{mvar|\u03be}}. It is not possible to arbitrarily concentrate both a function and its Fourier transform.\n\nThe trade-off between the compaction of a function and its Fourier transform can be formalized in the form of an [[uncertainty principle]] by viewing a function and its Fourier transform as [[conjugate variables]] with respect to the [[symplectic form]] on the [[time\u2013frequency representation|time\u2013frequency domain]]: from the point of view of the [[linear canonical transformation]], the Fourier transform is rotation by 90\u00b0 in the time\u2013frequency domain, and preserves the [[Symplectic vector space|symplectic form]].\n\nSuppose {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an integrable and [[square-integrable]] function.

The equality is attained for a Gaussian, as in the previous case.\n\n===Sine and cosine transforms===\n{{main|Sine and cosine transforms}}\n\nFourier's original formulation of the transform did not use complex numbers, but rather sines and cosines. Statisticians and others still use this form. An absolutely integrable function {{mvar|f}} for which Fourier inversion holds good can be expanded in terms of genuine frequencies (avoiding negative frequencies, which are sometimes considered hard to interpret physically<ref>{{harvnb|Chatfield|2004|p=113}}.</ref>) {{mvar|\u03bb}} by\n\n:<math>f(t) = \\int_0^\\infty \\bigl( a(\\lambda ) \\cos( 2\\pi \\lambda t) + b(\\lambda ) \\sin( 2\\pi \\lambda t)\\bigr) \\, d\\lambda.</math>\n\nThis is called an expansion as a trigonometric integral, or a Fourier integral expansion. The coefficient functions {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} can be found by using variants of the Fourier cosine transform and the Fourier sine transform (the normalisations are, again, not standardised):\n\n:<math> a (\\lambda) = 2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(t) \\cos(2\\pi\\lambda t) \\, dt</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> b (\\lambda) = 2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(t) \\sin(2\\pi\\lambda t) \\, dt. </math>\n\nOlder literature refers to the two transform functions, the Fourier cosine transform, {{mvar|a}}, and the Fourier sine transform, {{mvar|b}}.\n\nThe function {{mvar|f}} can be recovered from the sine and cosine transform using\n\n:<math> f(t) = 2\\int_0 ^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau) \\cos\\bigl( 2\\pi \\lambda(\\tau-t)\\bigr) \\, d\\tau \\, d\\lambda.</math>\n\ntogether with trigonometric identities.

The set {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} consists of the [[solid spherical harmonics]] of degree {{mvar|k}}. The solid spherical harmonics play a similar role in higher dimensions to the Hermite polynomials in dimension one. Specifically, if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03c0{{abs|''x''}}<sup>2</sup></sup>''P''(''x'')}} for some {{math|''P''(''x'')}} in {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, then {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'') {{=}} ''i''{{isup|\u2212''k''}} ''f''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}}. Let the set {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} be the closure in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} of linear combinations of functions of the form {{math|''f''&thinsp;({{abs|''x''}})''P''(''x'')}} where {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is in {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The space {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is then a direct sum of the spaces {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and the Fourier transform maps each space {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to itself and is possible to characterize the action of the Fourier transform on each space {{math|'''H'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" />\n\nLet {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''<sub>0</sub>({{abs|''x''}})''P''(''x'')}} (with {{math|''P''(''x'')}} in {{math|'''A'''<sub>''k''</sub>}}), then\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi)=F_0(|\\xi|)P(\\xi)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>F_0(r)=2\\pi i^{-k}r^{-\\frac{n+2k-2}{2}}\\int_0^\\infty f_0(s)J_\\frac{n+2k-2}{2}(2\\pi rs)s^\\frac{n+2k}{2}\\,ds.</math>\n\nHere {{math|''J''<sub>{{sfrac|''n'' + 2''k'' \u2212 2|2}}</sub>}} denotes the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind with order {{math|{{sfrac|''n'' + 2''k'' \u2212 2|2}}}}. When {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} this gives a useful formula for the Fourier transform of a radial function.<ref>{{harvnb|Grafakos|2004}}.</ref> This is essentially the [[Hankel transform]]. Moreover, there is a simple recursion relating the cases {{math|''n'' + 2}} and {{mvar|n}}<ref>{{harvnb|Grafakos|Teschl|2013}}.</ref> allowing to compute, e.g., the three-dimensional Fourier transform of a radial function from the one-dimensional one.\n\n===Restriction problems===\nIn higher dimensions it becomes interesting to study ''restriction problems'' for the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of an integrable function is continuous and the restriction of this function to any set is defined. But for a square-integrable function the Fourier transform could be a general ''class'' of square integrable functions. As such, the restriction of the Fourier transform of an {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} function cannot be defined on sets of measure 0. It is still an active area of study to understand restriction problems in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} for {{math|1 < ''p'' < 2}}. Surprisingly, it is possible in some cases to define the restriction of a Fourier transform to a set {{mvar|S}}, provided {{mvar|S}} has non-zero curvature. The case when {{mvar|S}} is the unit sphere in {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is of particular interest. In this case the Tomas\u2013[[Elias Stein|Stein]] restriction theorem states that the restriction of the Fourier transform to the unit sphere in {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a bounded operator on {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} provided {{math|1 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 {{sfrac|2''n'' + 2|''n'' + 3}}}}.\n\nOne notable difference between the Fourier transform in 1 dimension versus higher dimensions concerns the partial sum operator. Consider an increasing collection of measurable sets {{math|''E''<sub>''R''</sub>}} indexed by {{math|''R'' \u2208 (0,\u221e)}}: such as balls of radius {{mvar|R}} centered at the origin, or cubes of side {{math|2''R''}}. For a given integrable function {{mvar|f}}, consider the function {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} defined by:\n\n:<math>f_R(x) = \\int_{E_R}\\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi ix\\cdot\\xi}\\, d\\xi, \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n.</math>\n\nSuppose in addition that {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|1 < ''p'' < \u221e}}, if one takes {{math|''E<sub>R</sub>'' {{=}} (\u2212''R'', ''R'')}}, then {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} converges to {{mvar|f}} in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} as {{mvar|R}} tends to infinity, by the boundedness of the [[Hilbert transform]]. Naively one may hope the same holds true for {{math|''n'' > 1}}. In the case that {{mvar|E<sub>R</sub>}} is taken to be a cube with side length {{mvar|R}}, then convergence still holds. Another natural candidate is the Euclidean ball {{math|''E''<sub>''R''</sub> {{=}} {''\u03be'' : {{abs|''\u03be''}} < ''R''}|}}. In order for this partial sum operator to converge, it is necessary that the multiplier for the unit ball be bounded in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. For {{math|''n'' \u2265 2}} it is a celebrated theorem of [[Charles Fefferman]] that the multiplier for the unit ball is never bounded unless {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}.<ref name=\"Duoandikoetxea-2001\" /> In fact, when {{math|''p'' \u2260 2}}, this shows that not only may {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} fail to converge to {{mvar|f}} in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}, but for some functions {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, {{mvar|f<sub>R</sub>}} is not even an element of {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}.\n\n==Fourier transform on function spaces==\n\n===On {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} spaces===\n\n====On {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}}====\n\nThe definition of the Fourier transform by the integral formula\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)e^{-2\\pi i \\xi\\cdot x}\\,dx</math>\n\nis valid for Lebesgue integrable functions {{mvar|f}}; that is, {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}.\n\nThe Fourier transform {{math|{{mathcal|F}} : ''L''<sup>1</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>) \u2192 ''L''<sup>\u221e</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is a [[bounded operator]]. This follows from the observation that\n\n:<math>\\left\\vert\\hat{f}(\\xi)\\right\\vert \\leq \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\vert f(x)\\vert \\,dx,</math>\n\nwhich shows that its [[operator norm]] is bounded by 1. Indeed, it equals 1, which can be seen, for example, from the [[#rect|transform of the rect function]]. The image of {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} is a subset of the space {{math|''C''<sub>0</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} of continuous functions that tend to zero at infinity (the [[Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma]]), although it is not the entire space. Indeed, there is no simple characterization of the image.\n\n====On {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}====\n\nSince compactly supported smooth functions are integrable and dense in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, the [[Plancherel theorem]] allows us to extend the definition of the Fourier transform to general functions in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} by continuity arguments. The Fourier transform in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is no longer given by an ordinary Lebesgue integral, although it can be computed by an [[improper integral]], here meaning that for an {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} function {{mvar|f}},\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_{|x|\\le R} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x\\cdot\\xi}\\,dx</math>\n\nwhere the limit is taken in the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} sense. (More generally, you can take a sequence of functions that are in the intersection of {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} and {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} and that converges to {{mvar|f}} in the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}-norm, and define the Fourier transform of {{mvar|f}} as the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} -limit of the Fourier transforms of these functions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/math262/Lectures/Lecture03.pdf|title=Applied Fourier Analysis and Elements of Modern Signal Processing Lecture 3 |date= January 12, 2016|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>)\n\nMany of the properties of the Fourier transform in {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} carry over to {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}, by a suitable limiting argument.\n\nFurthermore, {{math|{{mathcal|F}} : ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>) \u2192 ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is a [[unitary operator]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=Thm. 2.3}}.</ref> For an operator to be unitary it is sufficient to show that it is bijective and preserves the inner product, so in this case these follow from the Fourier inversion theorem combined with the fact that for any {{math|''f'', ''g'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} we have\n\n: <math>\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)\\mathcal{F}g(x)\\,dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\mathcal{F}f(x)g(x)\\,dx. </math>\n\nIn particular, the image of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is itself under the Fourier transform.\n\n====On other {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}}====\n\nThe definition of the Fourier transform can be extended to functions in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} for {{math|1 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 2}} by decomposing such functions into a fat tail part in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} plus a fat body part in {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}}. In each of these spaces, the Fourier transform of a function in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} is in {{math|''L''{{isup|''q''}}('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, where {{math|''q'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|''p'' \u2212 1}}}} is the H\u00f6lder conjugate of {{mvar|p}} (by the [[Hausdorff\u2013Young inequality]]). However, except for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, the image is not easily characterized. Further extensions become more technical. The Fourier transform of functions in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} for the range {{math|2 < ''p'' < \u221e}} requires the study of distributions.<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" /> In fact, it can be shown that there are functions in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} with {{math|''p'' > 2}} so that the Fourier transform is not defined as a function.<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" />\n\n===Tempered distributions===\n{{Main|Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform}}\nOne might consider enlarging the domain of the Fourier transform from {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup> + ''L''<sup>2</sup>}} by considering [[generalized function]]s, or distributions. A distribution on {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a continuous linear functional on the space {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} of compactly supported smooth functions, equipped with a suitable topology. The strategy is then to consider the action of the Fourier transform on {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} and pass to distributions by duality. The obstruction to doing this is that the Fourier transform does not map {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} to {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. In fact the Fourier transform of an element in {{math|''C''<sub>c</sub>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} can not vanish on an open set; see the above discussion on the uncertainty principle. The right space here is the slightly larger space of [[Schwartz space|Schwartz functions]]. The Fourier transform is an automorphism on the Schwartz space, as a topological vector space, and thus induces an automorphism on its dual, the space of tempered distributions.<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" /> The tempered distributions include all the integrable functions mentioned above, as well as well-behaved functions of polynomial growth and distributions of compact support.\n\nFor the definition of the Fourier transform of a tempered distribution, let {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} be integrable functions, and let {{math|''f\u0302''}} and {{math|''\u011d''}} be their Fourier transforms respectively. Then the Fourier transform obeys the following multiplication formula,<ref name=\"Stein-Weiss-1971\" />\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\hat{f}(x)g(x)\\,dx=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}f(x)\\hat{g}(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nEvery integrable function {{mvar|f}} defines (induces) a distribution {{mvar|T<sub>f</sub>}} by the relation\n\n:<math>T_f(\\varphi)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}f(x)\\varphi(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nfor all Schwartz functions {{mvar|\u03c6}}. So it makes sense to define Fourier transform {{math|''T\u0302<sub>f</sub>''}} of {{math|''T<sub>f</sub>''}} by\n\n:<math>\\hat{T}_f (\\varphi)= T_f\\left(\\hat{\\varphi}\\right)</math>\n\nfor all Schwartz functions {{mvar|\u03c6}}. Extending this to all tempered distributions {{mvar|T}} gives the general definition of the Fourier transform.\n\nDistributions can be differentiated and the above-mentioned compatibility of the Fourier transform with differentiation and convolution remains true for tempered distributions.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform===\nThe Fourier transform of a finite Borel measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} on {{math|'''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is given by:<ref>{{harvnb|Pinsky|2002|p=256}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\hat\\mu(\\xi)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2\\pi i x \\cdot \\xi}\\,d\\mu.</math>\n\nThis transform continues to enjoy many of the properties of the Fourier transform of integrable functions. One notable difference is that the [[Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma]] fails for measures.<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" /> In the case that {{math|''d\u03bc'' {{=}} ''f''&thinsp;(''x'') ''dx''}}, then the formula above reduces to the usual definition for the Fourier transform of {{mvar|f}}. In the case that {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the probability distribution associated to a random variable {{mvar|X}}, the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform is closely related to the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]], but the typical conventions in probability theory take {{math|''e''<sup>''ix\u03be''</sup>}} instead of {{math|''e''<sup>\u22122\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup>}}.<ref name=\"Pinsky-2002\" /> In the case when the distribution has a [[probability density function]] this definition reduces to the Fourier transform applied to the probability density function, again with a different choice of constants.\n\nThe Fourier transform may be used to give a characterization of measures. [[Bochner's theorem]] characterizes which functions may arise as the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform of a positive measure on the circle.<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" />\n\nFurthermore, the [[Dirac delta function]], although not a function, is a finite [[Borel measure]]. Its Fourier transform is a constant function (whose specific value depends upon the form of the Fourier transform used).\n\n===Locally compact abelian groups===\n{{Main|Pontryagin duality}}\nThe Fourier transform may be generalized to any locally compact abelian group. A locally compact abelian group is an [[abelian group]] that is at the same time a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff topological space]] so that the group operation is continuous. If {{mvar|G}} is a locally compact abelian group, it has a translation invariant measure {{mvar|\u03bc}}, called [[Haar measure]]. For a locally compact abelian group {{mvar|G}}, the set of irreducible, i.e. one-dimensional, unitary representations are called its [[character group|characters]]. With its natural group structure and the topology of pointwise convergence, the set of characters {{mvar|\u011c}} is itself a locally compact abelian group, called the ''Pontryagin dual'' of {{mvar|G}}. For a function {{mvar|f}} in {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}}, its Fourier transform is defined by<ref name=\"Katznelson-1976\" />\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\xi)=\\int_G \\xi(x)f(x)\\,d\\mu\\qquad\\text{for any }\\xi\\in\\hat G.</math>\n\nThe Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma holds in this case; {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} is a function vanishing at infinity on {{mvar|\u011c}}.\n\nThe Fourier transform on {{mvar|T}}=R/Z is an example; here {{mvar|T}} is a locally compact abelian group, and the Haar measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} on {{mvar|T}} can be thought of as the Lebesgue measure on [0,1). Consider the representation of {{mvar|T}} on the complex plane {{mvar|C}} that is a 1-dimensional complex vector space. There are a group of representations (which are irreducible since {{mvar|C}} is 1-dim) <math>\\{e_{k}: T\\rightarrow GL_{1}(C)=C^{*}\\mid k\\in Z\\}</math> where <math>e_{k}(x)=e^{2\\pi ikx}</math> for <math>x\\in T</math>.\n\nThe character of such representation, that is the trace of <math>e_{k}(x)</math> for each <math>x\\in T</math> and <math>k\\in Z</math>, is <math>e^{2\\pi i kx}</math> itself. In the case of representation of finite group, the character table of the group {{mvar|G}} are rows of vectors such that each row is the character of one irreducible representation of {{mvar|G}}, and these vectors form a orthonormal basis of the space of class functions that map from {{mvar|G}} to {{mvar|C}} by Schur's lemma. Now the group {{mvar|T}} is no longer finite but still compact, and it preserves the orthonormality of character table. Each row of the table is the function <math>e_{k}(x)</math> of <math>x\\in T,</math> and the inner product between two class functions (all functions being class functions since {{mvar|T}} is abelian) {{mvar|f}},<math>g\\in L^{2}(T, d\\mu)</math> is defined as <math><f,g>=\\frac{1}{|T|}\\int_{[0,1)}f(y)\\overline{g}(y)d\\mu(y)</math> with the normalizing factor <math>|T|=1.</math> The sequence <math>\\{e_{k}\\mid k\\in Z\\}</math> is an orthonormal basis of the space of class functions <math>L^{2}(T,d\\mu).</math>\n\nFor any representation {{mvar|V}} of a finite group {{mvar|G}}, <math>\\chi_{v}</math> can be expressed as the span <math>\\sum_{i}<\\chi_{v},\\chi_{v_{i}}>\\chi_{v_{i}}</math>(<math>V_{i}</math> are the irreps of {{mvar|G}}), s.t <math><\\chi_{v},\\chi_{v_{i}}>=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}\\chi_{v}(g)\\overline{\\chi}_{v_{i}}(g)</math>. Similarly for <math>G=T</math> and <math>f\\in L^{2}(T,d\\mu)</math>, <math>f(x)=\\sum_{k\\in Z}\\hat{f}(k)e_{k}</math>. The Pontriagin dual <math>\\hat{T}</math> is <math>\\{e_{k}\\}(k\\in Z)</math> and for <math>f\\in L^{2}(T,d\\mu)</math>,  <math>\\hat{f}(k)=\\frac{1}{|T|}\\int_{[0,1)}f(y)e^{-2\\pi iky}dy</math> is its Fourier transform for <math>e_{k}\\in \\hat{T}</math>.\n\n===Gelfand transform===\n{{Main|Gelfand representation}}\nThe Fourier transform is also a special case of [[Gelfand transform]]. In this particular context, it is closely related to the Pontryagin duality map defined above.\n\nGiven an abelian [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] {{mvar|G}}, as before we consider space {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}}, defined using a Haar measure. With convolution as multiplication, {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}} is an abelian [[Banach algebra]]. It also has an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] * given by\n\n:<math>f^*(g) = \\overline{f\\left(g^{-1}\\right)}.</math>\n\nTaking the completion with respect to the largest possibly {{math|''C''*}}-norm gives its enveloping {{math|''C''*}}-algebra, called the group {{math|''C''*}}-algebra {{math|''C''*(''G'')}} of {{mvar|G}}. (Any {{math|''C''*}}-norm on {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}} is bounded by the {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} norm, therefore their supremum exists.)\n\nGiven any abelian {{math|''C''*}}-algebra {{mvar|A}}, the Gelfand transform gives an isomorphism between {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''C''<sub>0</sub>(''A''^)}}, where {{math|''A''^}} is the multiplicative linear functionals, i.e. one-dimensional representations, on {{mvar|A}} with the weak-* topology. The map is simply given by\n\n:<math>a \\mapsto \\bigl( \\varphi \\mapsto \\varphi(a) \\bigr)</math>\n\nIt turns out that the multiplicative linear functionals of {{math|''C''*(''G'')}}, after suitable identification, are exactly the characters of {{mvar|G}}, and the Gelfand transform, when restricted to the dense subset {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''G'')}} is the Fourier\u2013Pontryagin transform.\n\n===Compact non-abelian groups===\nThe Fourier transform can also be defined for functions on a non-abelian group, provided that the group is [[compact space|compact]]. Removing the assumption that the underlying group is abelian, irreducible unitary representations need not always be one-dimensional. This means the Fourier transform on a non-abelian group takes values as Hilbert space operators.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewitt|Ross|1970|loc=Chapter 8}}.</ref> The Fourier transform on compact groups is a major tool in [[representation theory]]<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|2001}}.</ref> and [[non-commutative harmonic analysis]].\n\nLet {{mvar|G}} be a compact [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]]. Let {{math|\u03a3}} denote the collection of all isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional irreducible [[unitary representation]]s, along with a definite choice of representation {{math|''U''{{isup|(''\u03c3'')}}}} on the [[Hilbert space]] {{math|''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} of finite dimension {{math|''d<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} for each {{math|''\u03c3'' \u2208 \u03a3}}. If {{mvar|\u03bc}} is a finite [[Borel measure]] on {{mvar|G}}, then the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the operator on {{math|''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} defined by\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\hat{\\mu}\\xi,\\eta\\right\\rangle_{H_\\sigma} = \\int_G \\left\\langle \\overline{U}^{(\\sigma)}_g\\xi,\\eta\\right\\rangle\\,d\\mu(g)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|{{overline|''U''}}{{isup|(''\u03c3'')}}}} is the complex-conjugate representation of {{math|''U''<sup>(''\u03c3'')</sup>}} acting on {{math|''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}}. If {{mvar|\u03bc}} is [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to the [[Haar measure|left-invariant probability measure]] {{mvar|\u03bb}} on {{mvar|G}}, [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem|represented]] as\n\n:<math>d\\mu = f \\, d\\lambda</math>\n\nfor some {{math|''f'' \u2208 [[Lp space|''L''<sup>1</sup>(''\u03bb'')]]}}, one identifies the Fourier transform of {{mvar|f}} with the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{mvar|\u03bc}}.\n\nThe mapping\n:<math>\\mu\\mapsto\\hat{\\mu}</math>\ndefines an isomorphism between the [[Banach space]] {{math|''M''(''G'')}} of finite Borel measures (see [[rca space]]) and a closed subspace of the Banach space {{math|'''C'''<sub>\u221e</sub>(\u03a3)}} consisting of all sequences {{math|''E'' {{=}} (''E<sub>\u03c3</sub>'')}} indexed by {{math|\u03a3}} of (bounded) linear operators {{math|''E<sub>\u03c3</sub>'' : ''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>'' \u2192 ''H<sub>\u03c3</sub>''}} for which the norm\n\n:<math>\\|E\\| = \\sup_{\\sigma\\in\\Sigma}\\left\\|E_\\sigma\\right\\|</math>\n\nis finite. The \"[[convolution theorem]]\" asserts that, furthermore, this isomorphism of Banach spaces is in fact an isometric isomorphism of [[C* algebra]]s into a subspace of {{math|'''C'''<sub>\u221e</sub>(\u03a3)}}. Multiplication on {{math|''M''(''G'')}} is given by [[convolution]] of measures and the involution * defined by\n\n:<math>f^*(g) = \\overline{f\\left(g^{-1}\\right)},</math>\n\nand {{math|'''C'''<sub>\u221e</sub>(\u03a3)}} has a natural {{math|''C''*}}-algebra structure as Hilbert space operators.\n\nThe [[Peter\u2013Weyl theorem]] holds, and a version of the Fourier inversion formula ([[Plancherel's theorem]]) follows: if {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>2</sup>(''G'')}}, then\n\n:<math>f(g) = \\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\Sigma} d_\\sigma \\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\hat{f}(\\sigma)U^{(\\sigma)}_g\\right)</math>\n\nwhere the summation is understood as convergent in the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} sense.\n\nThe generalization of the Fourier transform to the noncommutative situation has also in part contributed to the development of [[noncommutative geometry]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In this context, a categorical generalization of the Fourier transform to noncommutative groups is [[Tannaka\u2013Krein duality]], which replaces the group of characters with the category of representations. However, this loses the connection with harmonic functions.\n\n==Alternatives==\nIn [[signal processing]] terms, a function (of time) is a representation of a signal with perfect ''time resolution'', but no frequency information, while the Fourier transform has perfect ''frequency resolution'', but no time information: the magnitude of the Fourier transform at a point is how much frequency content there is, but location is only given by phase (argument of the Fourier transform at a point), and [[Standing wave|standing waves]] are not localized in time \u2013 a sine wave continues out to infinity, without decaying. This limits the usefulness of the Fourier transform for analyzing signals that are localized in time, notably [[transient (acoustics)|transients]], or any signal of finite extent.\n\nAs alternatives to the Fourier transform, in [[time-frequency analysis]], one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals in a form that has some time information and some frequency information \u2013 by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the [[short-time Fourier transform]] or [[fractional Fourier transform]], or other functions to represent signals, as in [[Wavelet transform|wavelet transforms]] and [[Chirplet transform|chirplet transforms]], with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the [[continuous wavelet transform]].<ref name=\"Boashash-2003\" />\n\n==Applications==\n{{see also|Spectral density#Applications}}\n\n[[File:Commutative diagram illustrating problem solving via the Fourier transform.svg|thumb|400px|Some problems, such as certain differential equations, become easier to solve when the Fourier transform is applied. In that case the solution to the original problem is recovered using the inverse Fourier transform.]]\n\n===Analysis of differential equations===\nPerhaps the most important use of the Fourier transformation is to solve [[partial differential equation]]s.\nMany of the equations of the mathematical physics of the nineteenth century can be treated this way. Fourier studied the heat equation, which in one dimension and in dimensionless units is\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2 y(x,t)}{ \\partial^2 x } =\\frac{\\partial y(x,t) }{ \\partial t}.</math>\n\nThe example we will give, a slightly more difficult one, is the wave equation in one dimension,\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2y(x,t)}{\\partial^2 x }=\\frac{\\partial^2y(x,t)}{\\partial^2t}.</math>\n\nAs usual, the problem is not to find a solution: there are infinitely many. The problem is that of the so-called \"boundary problem\": find a solution which satisfies the \"boundary conditions\"\n\n:<math>y(x,0) = f(x) , \\qquad \\frac{\\partial y(x,0) }{ \\partial t}= g(x).</math>\n\nHere, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are given functions. For the heat equation, only one boundary condition can be required (usually the first one). But for the wave equation, there are still infinitely many solutions {{mvar|y}} which satisfy the first boundary condition. But when one imposes both conditions, there is only one possible solution.\n\nIt is easier to find the Fourier transform {{mvar|\u0177}} of the solution than to find the solution directly. This is because the Fourier transformation takes differentiation into multiplication by the Fourier-dual variable, and so a partial differential equation applied to the original function is transformed into multiplication by polynomial functions of the dual variables applied to the transformed function. After {{mvar|\u0177}} is determined, we can apply the inverse Fourier transformation to find {{mvar|y}}.\n\nFourier's method is as follows. First, note that any function of the forms\n\n:<math> \\cos\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x\\pm t)\\bigr) \\mbox{ or } \\sin\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x \\pm t)\\bigr)</math>\n\nsatisfies the wave equation. These are called the elementary solutions.\n\nSecond, note that therefore any integral\n\n:<math>y(x,t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} a_+(\\xi)\\cos\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x +t)\\bigr) + a_-(\\xi)\\cos\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x -t)\\bigr) + b_+(\\xi)\\sin\\bigl(2\\pi\\xi(x +t)\\bigr) + b_-(\\xi)\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\xi(x -t)\\right) \\, d\\xi</math>\n\n(for arbitrary {{math|''a''<sub>+</sub>, ''a''<sub>\u2212</sub>, ''b''<sub>+</sub>, ''b''<sub>\u2212</sub>}}) satisfies the wave equation. (This integral is just a kind of continuous linear combination, and the equation is linear.)\n\nNow this resembles the formula for the Fourier synthesis of a function. In fact, this is the real inverse Fourier transform of {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} in the variable {{mvar|x}}.\n\nThe third step is to examine how to find the specific unknown coefficient functions {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} that will lead to {{mvar|y}} satisfying the boundary conditions. We are interested in the values of these solutions at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. So we will set {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. Assuming that the conditions needed for Fourier inversion are satisfied, we can then find the Fourier sine and cosine transforms (in the variable {{mvar|x}}) of both sides and obtain\n\n:<math> 2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty y(x,0) \\cos(2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = a_++a_-</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty y(x,0) \\sin(2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = b_++b_-.</math>\n\nSimilarly, taking the derivative of {{mvar|y}} with respect to {{mvar|t}} and then applying the Fourier sine and cosine transformations yields\n\n:<math> 2\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial y(u,0)}{\\partial t} \\sin (2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = (2\\pi\\xi)\\left(-a_++a_-\\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\partial y(u,0)}{\\partial t} \\cos (2\\pi\\xi x) \\, dx = (2\\pi\\xi)\\left(b_+-b_-\\right).</math>\n\nThese are four linear equations for the four unknowns {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}}, in terms of the Fourier sine and cosine transforms of the boundary conditions, which are easily solved by elementary algebra, provided that these transforms can be found.\n\nIn summary, we chose a set of elementary solutions, parametrised by {{mvar|\u03be}}, of which the general solution would be a (continuous) linear combination in the form of an integral over the parameter {{mvar|\u03be}}. But this integral was in the form of a Fourier integral. The next step was to express the boundary conditions in terms of these integrals, and set them equal to the given functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}. But these expressions also took the form of a Fourier integral because of the properties of the Fourier transform of a derivative. The last step was to exploit Fourier inversion by applying the Fourier transformation to both sides, thus obtaining expressions for the coefficient functions {{math|''a''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} in terms of the given boundary conditions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}.\n\nFrom a higher point of view, Fourier's procedure can be reformulated more conceptually. Since there are two variables, we will use the Fourier transformation in both {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|t}} rather than operate as Fourier did, who only transformed in the spatial variables. Note that {{mvar|\u0177}} must be considered in the sense of a distribution since {{math|''y''(''x'', ''t'')}} is not going to be {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}}: as a wave, it will persist through time and thus is not a transient phenomenon. But it will be bounded and so its Fourier transform can be defined as a distribution. The operational properties of the Fourier transformation that are relevant to this equation are that it takes differentiation in {{mvar|x}} to multiplication by {{math|2\u03c0''i\u03be''}} and differentiation with respect to {{mvar|t}} to multiplication by {{math|2\u03c0''if''}} where {{mvar|f}} is the frequency. Then the wave equation becomes an algebraic equation in {{mvar|\u0177}}:\n\n:<math>\\xi^2 \\hat y (\\xi, f) = f^2 \\hat y (\\xi, f).</math>\n\nThis is equivalent to requiring {{math|''\u0177''(''\u03be'', ''f''&thinsp;) {{=}} 0}} unless {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} \u00b1''f''}}. Right away, this explains why the choice of elementary solutions we made earlier worked so well: obviously {{math|''f\u0302'' {{=}} ''\u03b4''(''\u03be'' \u00b1 ''f''&thinsp;)}} will be solutions. Applying Fourier inversion to these delta functions, we obtain the elementary solutions we picked earlier. But from the higher point of view, one does not pick elementary solutions, but rather considers the space of all distributions which are supported on the (degenerate) conic {{math|''\u03be''{{isup|2}} \u2212 ''f''{{isup|2}} {{=}} 0}}.\n\nWe may as well consider the distributions supported on the conic that are given by distributions of one variable on the line {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} ''f''}} plus distributions on the line {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} \u2212''f''}} as follows: if {{mvar|\u03d5}} is any test function,\n\n:<math>\\iint \\hat y \\phi(\\xi,f) \\, d\\xi \\, df = \\int s_+ \\phi(\\xi,\\xi) \\, d\\xi + \\int s_- \\phi(\\xi,-\\xi) \\, d\\xi,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''s''<sub>+</sub>}}, and {{math|''s''<sub>\u2212</sub>}}, are distributions of one variable.\n\nThen Fourier inversion gives, for the boundary conditions, something very similar to what we had more concretely above (put {{math|''\u03d5''(''\u03be'', ''f''&thinsp;) {{=}} ''e''<sup>2\u03c0''i''(''x\u03be''+''tf''&thinsp;)</sup>}}, which is clearly of polynomial growth):\n\n:<math> y(x,0) = \\int\\bigl\\{s_+(\\xi) + s_-(\\xi)\\bigr\\} e^{2\\pi i\\xi x+0} \\, d\\xi </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial y(x,0)}{\\partial t} = \\int\\bigl\\{s_+(\\xi) - s_-(\\xi)\\bigr\\} 2\\pi i \\xi e^{2\\pi i\\xi x+0} \\, d\\xi.</math>\n\nNow, as before, applying the one-variable Fourier transformation in the variable {{mvar|x}} to these functions of {{mvar|x}} yields two equations in the two unknown distributions {{math|''s''<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} (which can be taken to be ordinary functions if the boundary conditions are {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} or {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}).\n\nFrom a calculational point of view, the drawback of course is that one must first calculate the Fourier transforms of the boundary conditions, then assemble the solution from these, and then calculate an inverse Fourier transform. Closed form formulas are rare, except when there is some geometric symmetry that can be exploited, and the numerical calculations are difficult because of the oscillatory nature of the integrals, which makes convergence slow and hard to estimate. For practical calculations, other methods are often used.\n\nThe twentieth century has seen the extension of these methods to all linear partial differential equations with polynomial coefficients, and by extending the notion of Fourier transformation to include Fourier integral operators, some non-linear equations as well.\n\n===Fourier transform spectroscopy===\n{{main|Fourier transform spectroscopy}}\nThe Fourier transform is also used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and in other kinds of [[spectroscopy]], e.g. infrared ([[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|FTIR]]). In NMR an exponentially shaped free induction decay (FID) signal is acquired in the time domain and Fourier-transformed to a Lorentzian line-shape in the frequency domain. The Fourier transform is also used in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[mass spectrometry]].\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n\nThe Fourier transform is useful in [[quantum mechanics]] in two different ways. To begin with, the basic conceptual structure of quantum mechanics postulates the existence of pairs of [[complementary variables]], connected by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. For example, in one dimension, the spatial variable {{mvar|q}} of, say, a particle, can only be measured by the quantum mechanical \"[[position operator]]\" at the cost of losing information about the momentum {{mvar|p}} of the particle. Therefore, the physical state of the particle can either be described by a function, called \"the wave function\", of {{mvar|q}} or by a function of {{mvar|p}} but not by a function of both variables. The variable {{mvar|p}} is called the conjugate variable to {{mvar|q}}. In classical mechanics, the physical state of a particle (existing in one dimension, for simplicity of exposition) would be given by assigning definite values to both {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} simultaneously. Thus, the set of all possible physical states is the two-dimensional real vector space with a {{mvar|p}}-axis and a {{mvar|q}}-axis called the [[phase space]].\n\nIn contrast, quantum mechanics chooses a polarisation of this space in the sense that it picks a subspace of one-half the dimension, for example, the {{mvar|q}}-axis alone, but instead of considering only points, takes the set of all complex-valued \"wave functions\" on this axis. Nevertheless, choosing the {{mvar|p}}-axis is an equally valid polarisation, yielding a different representation of the set of possible physical states of the particle which is related to the first representation by the Fourier transformation\n\n:<math>\\phi(p) = \\int \\psi (q) e^{2\\pi i \\frac{pq}{h}}\\, dq.</math>\n\nPhysically realisable states are {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}, and so by the Plancherel theorem, their Fourier transforms are also {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}.  (Note that since {{mvar|q}} is in units of distance and {{mvar|p}} is in units of momentum, the presence of Planck's constant in the exponent makes the exponent [[Nondimensionalization|dimensionless]], as it should be.)\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform can be used to pass from one way of representing the state of the particle, by a wave function of position, to another way of representing the state of the particle: by a wave function of momentum. Infinitely many different polarisations are possible, and all are equally valid. Being able to transform states from one representation to another is sometimes convenient.\n\nThe other use of the Fourier transform in both quantum mechanics and [[quantum field theory]] is to solve the applicable wave equation. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] for a time-varying wave function in one-dimension, not subject to external forces, is\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\psi(x,t) = i \\frac h{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(x,t).</math>\n\nThis is the same as the heat equation except for the presence of the imaginary unit {{mvar|i}}. Fourier methods can be used to solve this equation.\n\nIn the presence of a potential, given by the potential energy function {{math|''V''(''x'')}}, the equation becomes\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\psi(x,t) + V(x)\\psi(x,t) = i \\frac h{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(x,t).</math>\n\nThe \"elementary solutions\", as we referred to them above, are the so-called \"stationary states\" of the particle, and Fourier's algorithm, as described above, can still be used to solve the boundary value problem of the future evolution of {{mvar|\u03c8}} given its values for {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. Neither of these approaches is of much practical use in quantum mechanics. Boundary value problems and the time-evolution of the wave function is not of much practical interest: it is the stationary states that are most important.\n\nIn relativistic quantum mechanics, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation becomes a wave equation as was usual in classical physics, except that complex-valued waves are considered. A simple example, in the absence of interactions with other particles or fields, is the free one-dimensional Klein\u2013Gordon\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Fock equation, this time in dimensionless units,\n\n:<math>\\left (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} +1 \\right) \\psi(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi(x,t).</math>\n\nThis is, from the mathematical point of view, the same as the wave equation of classical physics solved above (but with a complex-valued wave, which makes no difference in the methods). This is of great use in quantum field theory: each separate Fourier component of a wave can be treated as a separate harmonic oscillator and then quantized, a procedure known as \"second quantization\". Fourier methods have been adapted to also deal with non-trivial interactions.\n\n===Signal processing===\nThe Fourier transform is used for the spectral analysis of time-series. The subject of statistical signal processing does not, however, usually apply the Fourier transformation to the signal itself. Even if a real signal is indeed transient, it has been found in practice advisable to model a signal by a function (or, alternatively, a stochastic process) which is stationary in the sense that its characteristic properties are constant over all time. The Fourier transform of such a function does not exist in the usual sense, and it has been found more useful for the analysis of signals to instead take the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function.\n\nThe autocorrelation function {{mvar|R}} of a function {{mvar|f}} is defined by\n\n:<math>R_f (\\tau) = \\lim_{T\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2T} \\int_{-T}^T f(t) f(t+\\tau) \\, dt. </math>\n\nThis function is a function of the time-lag {{mvar|\u03c4}} elapsing between the values of {{mvar|f}} to be correlated.\n\nFor most functions {{mvar|f}} that occur in practice, {{mvar|R}} is a bounded even function of the time-lag {{mvar|\u03c4}} and for typical noisy signals it turns out to be uniformly continuous with a maximum at {{math|''\u03c4'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe autocorrelation function, more properly called the autocovariance function unless it is normalized in some appropriate fashion, measures the strength of the correlation between the values of {{mvar|f}} separated by a time lag. This is a way of searching for the correlation of {{mvar|f}} with its own past. It is useful even for other statistical tasks besides the analysis of signals. For example, if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'')}} represents the temperature at time {{mvar|t}}, one expects a strong correlation with the temperature at a time lag of 24 hours.\n\nIt possesses a Fourier transform,\n\n:<math> P_f(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty R_f (\\tau) e^{-2\\pi i \\xi\\tau} \\, d\\tau. </math>\n\nThis Fourier transform is called the power spectral density function of {{mvar|f}}. (Unless all periodic components are first filtered out from {{mvar|f}}, this integral will diverge, but it is easy to filter out such periodicities.)\n\nThe power spectrum, as indicated by this density function {{mvar|P}}, measures the amount of variance contributed to the data by the frequency {{mvar|\u03be}}. In electrical signals, the variance is proportional to the average power (energy per unit time), and so the power spectrum describes how much the different frequencies contribute to the average power of the signal. This process is called the spectral analysis of time-series and is analogous to the usual analysis of variance of data that is not a time-series ([[ANOVA]]).\n\nKnowledge of which frequencies are \"important\" in this sense is crucial for the proper design of filters and for the proper evaluation of measuring apparatuses. It can also be useful for the scientific analysis of the phenomena responsible for producing the data.\n\nThe power spectrum of a signal can also be approximately measured directly by measuring the average power that remains in a signal after all the frequencies outside a narrow band have been filtered out.\n\nSpectral analysis is carried out for visual signals as well. The power spectrum ignores all phase relations, which is good enough for many purposes, but for video signals other types of spectral analysis must also be employed, still using the Fourier transform as a tool.\n\n==Other notations==\nOther common notations for {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} include:\n\n:<math>\\tilde{f}(\\xi),\\ \\tilde{f}(\\omega),\\ F(\\xi),\\ \\mathcal{F}\\left(f\\right)(\\xi),\\ \\left(\\mathcal{F}f\\right)(\\xi),\\ \\mathcal{F}(f),\\ \\mathcal F(\\omega),\\ F(\\omega),\\ \\mathcal F(j\\omega),\\ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\},\\ \\mathcal{F} \\bigl(f(t)\\bigr),\\ \\mathcal{F} \\bigl\\{f(t)\\bigr\\}.</math>\n\nDenoting the Fourier transform by a capital letter corresponding to the letter of function being transformed (such as {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and {{math|''F''(''\u03be'')}}) is especially common in the sciences and engineering. In electronics, omega ({{mvar|\u03c9}}) is often used instead of {{mvar|\u03be}} due to its interpretation as angular frequency, sometimes it is written as {{math|''F''(&thinsp;''j\u03c9'')}}, where {{mvar|j}} is the [[imaginary unit]], to indicate its relationship with the [[Laplace transform]], and sometimes it is written informally as {{math|''F''(2\u03c0''f''&thinsp;)}} in order to use ordinary frequency. In some contexts such as particle physics, the same symbol <math>f</math> may be used for both for a function as well as it Fourier transform, with the two only distinguished by their [[Argument of a function|argument]]: <math>f(k_1 + k_2)</math> would refer to the Fourier transform because of the momentum argument, while <math>f(x_0 + \\pi \\vec r)</math> would refer to the original function because of the positional argument. Although tildes may be used as in <math>\\tilde{f}</math> to indicate Fourier transforms, tildes may also be used to indicate a modification of a quantity with a more [[Lorentz invariant]] form, such as <math>\\tilde{dk} = \\frac{dk}{(2\\pi)^32\\omega}</math>, so care must be taken.\n\nThe interpretation of the complex function {{math|''f\u0302''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} may be aided by expressing it in [[polar coordinate]] form\n\n:<math>\\hat f(\\xi) = A(\\xi) e^{i\\varphi(\\xi)}</math>\n\nin terms of the two real functions {{math|''A''(''\u03be'')}} and {{math|''\u03c6''(''\u03be'')}} where:\n\n:<math>A(\\xi) = \\left|\\hat f(\\xi)\\right|,</math>\n\nis the [[amplitude]] and\n\n:<math>\\varphi (\\xi) = \\arg \\left( \\hat f(\\xi) \\right), </math>\n\nis the [[phase (waves)|phase]] (see [[Arg (mathematics)|arg function]]).\n\nThen the inverse transform can be written:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\int _{-\\infty}^\\infty A(\\xi)\\ e^{ i\\bigl(2\\pi \\xi x +\\varphi (\\xi)\\bigr)}\\,d\\xi,</math>\n\nwhich is a recombination of all the frequency components of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. Each component is a complex [[sinusoid]] of the form {{math|''e''<sup>2\u03c0''ix\u03be''</sup>}} whose amplitude is {{math|''A''(''\u03be'')}} and whose initial [[phase (waves)|phase angle]] (at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}) is {{math|''\u03c6''(''\u03be'')}}.\n\nThe Fourier transform may be thought of as a mapping on function spaces. This mapping is here denoted {{mathcal|F}} and {{math|{{mathcal|F}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} is used to denote the Fourier transform of the function {{mvar|f}}. This mapping is linear, which means that {{mathcal|F}} can also be seen as a linear transformation on the function space and implies that the standard notation in linear algebra of applying a linear transformation to a vector (here the function {{math|''f''&thinsp;}}) can be used to write {{math|{{mathcal|F}} ''f''}} instead of {{math|{{mathcal|F}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}}. Since the result of applying the Fourier transform is again a function, we can be interested in the value of this function evaluated at the value {{mvar|\u03be}} for its variable, and this is denoted either as {{math|{{mathcal|F}} ''f''&thinsp;(''\u03be'')}} or as {{math|(&thinsp;{{mathcal|F}} ''f''&thinsp;)(''\u03be'')}}. Notice that in the former case, it is implicitly understood that {{mathcal|F}} is applied first to {{mvar|f}} and then the resulting function is evaluated at {{mvar|\u03be}}, not the other way around.\n\nIn mathematics and various applied sciences, it is often necessary to distinguish between a function {{mvar|f}} and the value of {{mvar|f}} when its variable equals {{mvar|x}}, denoted {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. This means that a notation like {{math|{{mathcal|F}}(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;(''x''))}} formally can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of the values of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|x}}. Despite this flaw, the previous notation appears frequently, often when a particular function or a function of a particular variable is to be transformed. For example,\n\n:<math>\\mathcal F\\bigl( \\operatorname{rect}(x) \\bigr) = \\operatorname{sinc}(\\xi)</math>\n\nis sometimes used to express that the Fourier transform of a [[rectangular function]] is a [[sinc function]], or\n\n:<math>\\mathcal F\\bigl(f(x + x_0)\\bigr) = \\mathcal F\\bigl(f(x)\\bigr) e^{2\\pi i \\xi x_0}</math>\n\nis used to express the shift property of the Fourier transform.\n\nNotice, that the last example is only correct under the assumption that the transformed function is a function of {{mvar|x}}, not of {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}.\n\n==Other conventions==\nThe Fourier transform can also be written in terms of [[angular frequency]]:\n\n:<math>\\omega = 2\\pi \\xi,</math>\n\nwhose units are [[radian]]s per second.\n\nThe substitution {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''\u03c9''|2\u03c0}}}} into the formulas above produces this convention:\n\n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\omega) = \\int_{\\mathbb R^n} f(x) e^{-i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx.</math>\n\nUnder this convention, the inverse transform becomes:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^n} \\int_{\\mathbb R^n} \\hat{f}(\\omega)e^{i\\omega \\cdot x}\\, d\\omega.</math>\n\nUnlike the convention followed in this article, when the Fourier transform is defined this way, it is no longer a [[unitary transformation]] on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. There is also less symmetry between the formulas for the Fourier transform and its inverse.\n\nAnother convention is to split the factor of {{math|(2\u03c0)<sup>''n''</sup>}} evenly between the Fourier transform and its inverse, which leads to definitions:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}(\\omega) &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{- i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx, \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}(\\omega) e^{ i\\omega \\cdot x}\\, d\\omega.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nUnder this convention, the Fourier transform is again a unitary transformation on {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''\u211d'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. It also restores the symmetry between the Fourier transform and its inverse.\n\nVariations of all three conventions can be created by conjugating the complex-exponential [[integral kernel|kernel]] of both the forward and the reverse transform. The signs must be opposites. Other than that, the choice is (again) a matter of convention.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of popular forms of the Fourier transform, one-dimensional\n|-\n! ordinary frequency {{mvar|\u03be}} (Hz)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_1(\\xi)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\cdot e^{-2 \\pi i x\\cdot\\xi}\\, dx = \\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\cdot \\hat{f}_2(2 \\pi \\xi) = \\hat{f}_3(2 \\pi \\xi) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}_1(\\xi)\\cdot e^{2 \\pi i x\\cdot \\xi}\\, d\\xi \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | angular frequency {{mvar|\u03c9}} (rad/s)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_2(\\omega)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\cdot  e^{-i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\cdot \\hat{f}_1 \\! \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\cdot \\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}_2(\\omega)\\cdot e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! non-unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\cdot  e^{-i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\hat{f}_1 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = \\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\cdot \\hat{f}_2(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}_3(\\omega)\\cdot e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Generalization for {{math|''n''}}-dimensional functions\n|-\n! ordinary frequency {{mvar|\u03be}} (Hz)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_1(\\xi)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-2 \\pi i x\\cdot\\xi}\\, dx = (2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}\\hat{f}_2(2 \\pi \\xi) = \\hat{f}_3(2 \\pi \\xi) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}_1(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i x\\cdot \\xi}\\, d\\xi \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | angular frequency {{mvar|\u03c9}} (rad/s)\n! unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_2(\\omega)\\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\hat{f}_1 \\! \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}_2(\\omega)e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|-\n! non-unitary\n| <math>\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}_3(\\omega) \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-i\\omega\\cdot x}\\, dx = \\hat{f}_1 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}\\right) = (2 \\pi)^\\frac{n}{2} \\hat{f}_2(\\omega) \\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^n} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\hat{f}_3(\\omega) e^{i \\omega\\cdot x}\\, d\\omega \\end{align}</math>\n|}\n\nAs discussed above, the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of a random variable is the same as the [[Fourier transform#Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform|Fourier\u2013Stieltjes transform]] of its distribution measure, but in this context it is typical to take a different convention for the constants.

Unlike any of the conventions appearing above, this convention takes the opposite sign in the exponent.\n\n== Computation methods ==\n\nThe appropriate computation method largely depends how the original mathematical function is represented and the desired form of the output function.\n\nSince the fundamental definition of a Fourier transform is an integral, functions that can be expressed as [[closed-form expression]]s are commonly computed by working the integral analytically to yield a closed-form expression in the Fourier transform conjugate variable as the result. This is the method used to generate tables of Fourier transforms,<ref name=\"Zwillinger_2014\">{{harvnb|Gradshteyn|Ryzhik|Geronimus|Tseytlin|2015}}.</ref> including those found in the table below ([[Fourier transform#Tables of important Fourier transforms]]).\n\nMany computer algebra systems such as [[Matlab]] and [[Mathematica]] that are capable of [[symbolic integration]] are capable of computing Fourier transforms analytically. For example, to compute the Fourier transform of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''t'') {{=}} cos(6\u03c0''t'') ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03c0''t''<sup>2</sup></sup>}} one might enter the command {{code|integrate cos(6*pi*t) exp(\u2212pi*t^2) exp(-i*2*pi*f*t) from -inf to inf}} into [[Wolfram Alpha]].\n\n===Numerical integration of closed-form functions===\nIf the input function is in closed-form and the desired output function is a series of ordered pairs (for example a table of values from which a graph can be generated) over a specified domain, then the Fourier transform can be generated by [[numerical integration]] at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which a value of the output variable is desired.<ref>{{harvnb|Press|Flannery|Teukolsky|Vetterling|1992}}.</ref> Note that this method requires computing a separate numerical integration for each value of frequency for which a value of the Fourier transform is desired.<ref>{{harvnb|Bailey|Swarztrauber|1994}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lado|1971}}.</ref> The numerical integration approach works on a much broader class of functions than the analytic approach, because it yields results for functions that do not have closed form Fourier transform integrals.\n\n===Numerical integration of a series of ordered pairs===\nIf the input function is a series of ordered pairs (for example, a time series from measuring an output variable repeatedly over a time interval) then the output function must also be a series of ordered pairs (for example, a complex number vs. frequency over a specified domain of frequencies), unless certain assumptions and approximations are made allowing the output function to be approximated by a closed-form expression. In the general case where the available input series of ordered pairs are assumed be samples representing a continuous function over an interval (amplitude vs. time, for example), the series of ordered pairs representing the desired output function can be obtained by numerical integration of the input data over the available interval at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which the value of the Fourier transform is desired.<ref>{{harvnb|Simonen|Olkkonen|1985}}.</ref>\n\nExplicit numerical integration over the ordered pairs can yield the Fourier transform output value for any desired value of the conjugate Fourier transform variable (frequency, for example), so that a spectrum can be produced at any desired step size and over any desired variable range for accurate determination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases corresponding to isolated peaks. Unlike limitations in DFT and FFT methods, explicit numerical integration can have any desired step size and compute the Fourier transform over any desired range of the conjugate Fourier transform variable (for example, frequency).\n\n===Discrete Fourier transforms and fast Fourier transforms===\nIf the ordered pairs representing the original input function are equally spaced in their input variable (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform is known as a [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of step size equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled every 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1&nbsp;Hz frequency spacing.\n\n==Tables of important Fourier transforms==\nThe following tables record some closed-form Fourier transforms. For functions {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}, {{math|''g''(''x'')}} and {{math|''h''(''x'')}} denote their Fourier transforms by {{math|''f\u0302''}}, {{math|''\u011d''}}, and {{math|''\u0125''}} respectively. Only the three most common conventions are included. It may be useful to notice that entry 105 gives a relationship between the Fourier transform of a function and the original function, which can be seen as relating the Fourier transform and its inverse.\n\n===Functional relationships, one-dimensional===\nThe Fourier transforms in this table may be found in {{harvtxt|Erd\u00e9lyi|1954}} or {{harvtxt|Kammler|2000|loc=appendix}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !!

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense.

The Clark is known as the \"Baby Nobel\" in economics because around a third of the medalists have gone on to win the Nobel, the average age of whose laureates approaches 70 when they were awarded the prize. Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the ''[[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]]'' (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Nakahara Prize]]'' (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Gossen Prize]]'' (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the ''[[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]]'' (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the ''[[Assar Lindbeck Medal]]'' (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.
