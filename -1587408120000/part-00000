It was originally released as the B-side to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" in April 1972 and subsequently appeared on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. It was later issued as a single in 1976 to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]] \u2013 at [[Trident Studios]] in London towards the end of the album's sessions. It was originally offered to the English band [[Mott the Hoople]], who declined and recorded Bowie's \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" instead. It is a [[glam rock]] song that is influenced by [[Little Richard]] and [[the Velvet Underground]].

It was originally released as the B-side to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" in April 1972 and subsequently appeared on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. It was later issued as a single in 1976 to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]] \u2013 at [[Trident Studios]] in London towards the end of the album's sessions. It was originally offered to the English band [[Mott the Hoople]], who declined and recorded Bowie's \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" instead. It is a [[glam rock]] song that is influenced by [[Little Richard]] and [[the Velvet Underground]]. Lyrically, the song contains a reference to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and the famous lyric \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Suffragette City\" has received critical acclaim, with many praising the guitar work, the band's performance, false ending, famous lyric and the song's power. It has subsequently been called one of Bowie's greatest songs by multiple publications. It was performed frequently by Bowie throughout his concert tours. The song has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012 for its 40th anniversary; this remaster was later included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Suffragette City\" was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before recording it himself, Bowie offered it to the band [[Mott the Hoople]], who he greatly admired,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} if they would forgo their plan to break up.

The song features one of Bowie's earliest uses of the ARP synthesiser, which would later become the backbone of his [[Berlin Trilogy]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} The instrument was used to mimic a [[saxophone]], which underscores the guitar throughout. Bowie thought of the riff, Scott used the ARP located at Trident to find the right sound, and Ronson played the notes.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} The backing vocals move from the left channel in the first verse to the right in the second.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} According to biographer [[Peter Doggett]], while other rock songs such as [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Brown Sugar (Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" and [[the Kinks]]' \"[[All Day and All of the Night]]\" use a standard three-chord structure spaced \"two and three semitones apart\" (such as E-G-A or A-G-C), \"Suffragette City\" uses tighter two-semitone gaps (F-G-A), which \"leaves the ear to expect a softer A minor as the root of the song, only for a decisive A major chord to appear instead.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} He believes that this decision gives the track its \"unrelenting power\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} The track has [[acoustic guitar]] from Bowie, but is mostly buried in the mix under Ronson's electric guitar.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}} After a false ending, Bowie cries \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\" before the band gets back into the groove, finishing the track with Bowie shrieking \"Suffragette!\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}}\n\nAccording to Doggett, before \"Suffragette City\", the only popular song to contain \"suffragette\" in its title was the song \"[[Sister Suffragette]]\" from the 1964 film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''. He argues that the ''Mary Poppins'' song had more to do with women's liberation than \"Suffragette City\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}} The song contains the lyric \"Ah droogie, don't crash here\", a direct reference to the [[Anthony Burgess]] novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]] was a major influence on Ziggy Stardust's cultural grab-bag, dictating both costumes and pre-show music on tour.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} The song was written only a few months after the film's release in 1971.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=112}} The \"sexually charged\" famous hook \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\" previously appeared as the title of a song on jazz bassist [[Charles Mingus]]' 1961 album ''[[Oh Yeah (Charles Mingus album)|Oh Yeah]]'', as well as a 1967 song by the [[Small Faces]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}} Bowie also uses the \"hey man!\" backing vocals from [[the Velvet Underground]]'s 1968 song \"[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]]\",<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\" /> a line from the 1970 song \"[[I Found Out]]\" by [[John Lennon]], a [[Marc Bolan]]-esque boogie, \"some [[Flamin' Groovies]] speed, some [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] swagger,\" and a \"dose of [[hard rock]] theatrics\" to close.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Suffragette City\" was originally released as the B-side of \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199).<ref name=\"B-side\" /> It was subsequently released as the 10th and penultimate track on the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', between \"[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]\" and \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was later issued as a single on 9 July 1976 by RCA (as RCA 2726) to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of the ''[[Station to Station]]'' track \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"A-side\" /> The single failed to chart.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}}\n\nSince release, \"Suffragette City\" has received critical acclaim, with many praising the guitar work, the band's performance, false ending, famous lyric and the song's power.

{"title_page": "World economy", "text_new": "{{Other uses|World Economy (disambiguation)}}\n{{World economy}}\nThe '''world economy''' or '''global economy''' is the [[economy]] of all humans of the world, considered as the international exchange of goods and services  that is expressed in monetary units of account.<ref>\"World Economy.\" \u2013 Definition. American English Definition of with Pronunciation by Macmillan Dictionary. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Jan. 2015.</ref> In some contexts, the two terms are distinct \"international\" or \"global economy\" being measured separately and distinguished from [[country|national]] economies while the \"world economy\" is simply an aggregate of the separate countries' measurements. Beyond the minimum standard concerning value in production, use and exchange the definitions, representations, models and valuations of the world economy vary widely. It is inseparable from the geography and ecology of [[Earth]].\n \nIt is common to limit questions of the world economy exclusively to [[Economics|human economic activity]] and the world economy is typically judged in monetary terms, even in cases in which there is no efficient market to help valuate certain goods or services, or in cases in which a lack of independent research or government cooperation makes establishing figures difficult. Typical examples are [[illegal drug trade|illegal drugs]] and other [[underground economy|black market goods]], which by any standard are a part of the world economy, but for which there is by definition no legal market of any kind.\n \nHowever, even in cases in which there is a clear and efficient market to establish a monetary value, economists do not typically use the current or official [[exchange rate]] to translate the monetary units of this market into a single unit for the world economy since exchange rates typically do not closely reflect [[world]]wide value, for example in cases where the volume or price of transactions is closely regulated by the government.\n\nRather, market valuations in a local currency are typically translated to a single monetary unit using the idea of [[Purchasing power parity|purchasing power]]. This is the method used below, which is used for estimating worldwide economic activity in terms of [[purchasing power parity|real]] [[United States dollar]]s or [[euro]]s. However, the world economy can be evaluated and expressed in many more ways. It is unclear, for example, how many of the world's [[world population|7.62 billion people]] have most of their economic activity reflected in these valuations.\n \nAccording to Maddison, until the middle of 19th century, global output was dominated by China and India. Waves of [[Industrial Revolution]] in Western Europe and Northern America shifted the shares to the Western Hemisphere. As of 2017, the following 15 countries or regions have reached an economy of at least US$2 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] by GDP in nominal or PPP terms: [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx|title=Gross domestic product, current prices & Gross domestic product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) valuation of country GDP|work=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2015|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=October 2015|accessdate=2015-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011233209/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx|archive-date=2015-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\n===World economy by country groups===\n\nThe following two tables list the country groups with individual countries designated by the [[IMF]].<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/02/weodata/weoselagr.aspx] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010011138/https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/02/weodata/weoselagr.aspx |date=2018-10-10 }} IMF GDP 2018 Data (October 2018)</ref> Members of the [[G-20 major economies]] are in bold.\n\n{| style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  style=\"width:50%; \"| '''List of country groups by GDP (nominal) at peak level as of 2019 in millions US$'''<ref name=\"imf2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/weorept.aspx|title=Gross domestic product| publisher=IMF World Economic Outlook| date=October 2018| accessdate=7 May 2019}}</ref>\n|  style=\"width:50%; \"| '''List of country groups by GDP (PPP) at peak level as of 2019 in millions US$'''<ref name=\"imf2\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+\n|-\n!

American English Definition of with Pronunciation by Macmillan Dictionary. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Jan. 2015.</ref> In some contexts, the two terms are distinct \"international\" or \"global economy\" being measured separately and distinguished from [[country|national]] economies while the \"world economy\" is simply an aggregate of the separate countries' measurements. Beyond the minimum standard concerning value in production, use and exchange the definitions, representations, models and valuations of the world economy vary widely. It is inseparable from the geography and ecology of [[Earth]].\n \nIt is common to limit questions of the world economy exclusively to [[Economics|human economic activity]] and the world economy is typically judged in monetary terms, even in cases in which there is no efficient market to help valuate certain goods or services, or in cases in which a lack of independent research or government cooperation makes establishing figures difficult. Typical examples are [[illegal drug trade|illegal drugs]] and other [[underground economy|black market goods]], which by any standard are a part of the world economy, but for which there is by definition no legal market of any kind.\n \nHowever, even in cases in which there is a clear and efficient market to establish a monetary value, economists do not typically use the current or official [[exchange rate]] to translate the monetary units of this market into a single unit for the world economy since exchange rates typically do not closely reflect [[world]]wide value, for example in cases where the volume or price of transactions is closely regulated by the government.\n\nRather, market valuations in a local currency are typically translated to a single monetary unit using the idea of [[Purchasing power parity|purchasing power]]. This is the method used below, which is used for estimating worldwide economic activity in terms of [[purchasing power parity|real]] [[United States dollar]]s or [[euro]]s. However, the world economy can be evaluated and expressed in many more ways. It is unclear, for example, how many of the world's [[world population|7.62 billion people]] have most of their economic activity reflected in these valuations.\n \nAccording to Maddison, until the middle of 19th century, global output was dominated by China and India. Waves of [[Industrial Revolution]] in Western Europe and Northern America shifted the shares to the Western Hemisphere. As of 2017, the following 15 countries or regions have reached an economy of at least US$2 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] by GDP in nominal or PPP terms: [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx|title=Gross domestic product, current prices & Gross domestic product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) valuation of country GDP|work=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2015|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=October 2015|accessdate=2015-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011233209/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx|archive-date=2015-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\n===World economy by country groups===\n\nThe following two tables list the country groups with individual countries designated by the [[IMF]].<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/02/weodata/weoselagr.aspx] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010011138/https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/02/weodata/weoselagr.aspx |date=2018-10-10 }} IMF GDP 2018 Data (October 2018)</ref> Members of the [[G-20 major economies]] are in bold.\n\n{| style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  style=\"width:50%; \"| '''List of country groups by GDP (nominal) at peak level as of 2019 in millions US$'''<ref name=\"imf2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/weorept.aspx|title=Gross domestic product| publisher=IMF World Economic Outlook| date=October 2018| accessdate=7 May 2019}}</ref>\n|  style=\"width:50%; \"| '''List of country groups by GDP (PPP) at peak level as of 2019 in millions US$'''<ref name=\"imf2\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+\n|-\n!

Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].

You Pretty Things]]\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} He further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Pegg notes that Bowie reflects on his inability to achieve success up to that point, being taken down \"a million dead-end streets\" and every time he thought he'd made it \"it seemed the taste was not so sweet.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg identifies the line \"I turned myself to face me\" as mirroring Bowie's encounter with himself in ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} His identification of himself as the 'faker' gives him anxiety, believing that he is \"much too fast\" to be affected by how others' opinion of him. Pegg summarises the lyrics as Bowie \"holding a mirror to his face\" just as he's about to achieve stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"Oh!

and as a single on 7 January 1972. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989).

You Pretty Things]]\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} He further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Pegg notes that Bowie reflects on his inability to achieve success up to that point, being taken down \"a million dead-end streets\" and every time he thought he'd made it \"it seemed the taste was not so sweet.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg identifies the line \"I turned myself to face me\" as mirroring Bowie's encounter with himself in ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} His identification of himself as the 'faker' gives him anxiety, believing that he is \"much too fast\" to be affected by how others' opinion of him. Pegg summarises the lyrics as Bowie \"holding a mirror to his face\" just as he's about to achieve stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"Oh! You Pretty Things\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s contemporary review of ''Hunky Dory'' considered that \"Changes\" could be \"construed as a young man's attempt to reckon how he'll react when it's his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone review\">{{cite web |first=John |last=Mendelsohn |title=Hunky Dory |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=6 January 1972 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110180003/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Changes\" was released on 17 December 1971 as the opening track on Bowie's fourth studio album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Hunky Dory|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1971|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8244}}</ref> It was subsequently released as the first single of the album on 7 January 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2160) with fellow album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" as the B-side;<ref name=\"Single liner notes\" /> it was Bowie's first single released by RCA.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} In France, the B-side was \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", despite the label stating that it was \"Andy Warhol\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=238}} This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US chart debut.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=238}} Upon release, like the album, it flopped commercially, peaking at number 66 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts and failing to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Despite this, it became English disc jockey [[Tony Blackburn]]'s record of the week.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} It wasn't until the success of Bowie's following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) that recognition was brought upon ''Hunky Dory'' and \"Changes\", which according to Pegg quickly became a \"turntable favorite\" and \"embedded\" itself into the \"pop-culture psyche\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} Commentators have later argued that \"[[Oh!

The song is notable for juxtaposing an uplifting guitar and synthesizer-led instrumental track with Bowie\u2019s withdrawn lyrics. In keeping with the minimalist approach of ''Low'', Bowie and co-producer [[Tony Visconti]] originally recorded the track as an instrumental, bar the backing vocal (performed by Visconti\u2019s wife, [[Mary Hopkin]]). Bowie then recorded his vocal after the rest of the band had left the studio, before trimming verses off the lyrics and leaving a relatively lengthy instrumental intro on the finished song.\n\nSelected as the first single from the album, \"Sound and Vision\" was used by the [[BBC]] on trailers at the time. This provided considerable exposure, much needed as Bowie opted to do nothing to promote the single himself, and helped the song to No. 3. The song was also a top ten hit in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. However, it stalled at No. 87 in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5288b&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5288b.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5288b |title=Image : RPM Weekly \u2013 Library and Archives Canada |website=Bac-lac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref> and only managed No. 69 in the United States, where it signaled the end of Bowie's short commercial honeymoon until \"[[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|Let's Dance]]\" in 1983.\n\nThe first live performance of the song was at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl\u2019s Court]] during the [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] on 1 July 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidbowieworld.nl/mijn-bootlegs-2-2/tour-recordings/1978-the-isolar-ii-world-tour/attachment/david_bowie_isolar_in_the_court/|title=David Bowie 1978-07-01 London ,Earl\u2019s Court Arena \u2013 Isolar II In The Court \u2013 SQ 9 {{!}} www.DavidBowieWorld.nl|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> In 1990, it was a regular number for Bowie\u2019s greatest hits [[Sound+Vision Tour]].

The song is notable for juxtaposing an uplifting guitar and synthesizer-led instrumental track with Bowie\u2019s withdrawn lyrics. In keeping with the minimalist approach of ''Low'', Bowie and co-producer [[Tony Visconti]] originally recorded the track as an instrumental, bar the backing vocal (performed by Visconti\u2019s wife, [[Mary Hopkin]]). Bowie then recorded his vocal after the rest of the band had left the studio, before trimming verses off the lyrics and leaving a relatively lengthy instrumental intro on the finished song.\n\nSelected as the first single from the album, \"Sound and Vision\" was used by the [[BBC]] on trailers at the time. This provided considerable exposure, much needed as Bowie opted to do nothing to promote the single himself, and helped the song to No. 3. The song was also a top ten hit in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. However, it stalled at No. 87 in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5288b&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5288b.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5288b |title=Image : RPM Weekly \u2013 Library and Archives Canada |website=Bac-lac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref> and only managed No. 69 in the United States, where it signaled the end of Bowie's short commercial honeymoon until \"[[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|Let's Dance]]\" in 1983.\n\nThe first live performance of the song was at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl\u2019s Court]] during the [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] on 1 July 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidbowieworld.nl/mijn-bootlegs-2-2/tour-recordings/1978-the-isolar-ii-world-tour/attachment/david_bowie_isolar_in_the_court/|title=David Bowie 1978-07-01 London ,Earl\u2019s Court Arena \u2013 Isolar II In The Court \u2013 SQ 9 {{!}} www.DavidBowieWorld.nl|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> In 1990, it was a regular number for Bowie\u2019s greatest hits [[Sound+Vision Tour]].
