Sloan added that he was \u201cborrowing\u201d words from the American Psychological Association in answering. Sloan also told Solomon that his platform would not touch the issue of same-sex marriage, but that he would not have voted for Bill C-16, which added \u201cgender expression\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d to Canada\u2019s Human Rights Code and to the Criminal Code\u2019s hate crimes section.

He used to live with his grandparents until his human grandfather died, moving to reside in the human world instead despite his grandmother Tamako's protests. Due to his father Sabato's criminal activities, Rinne had his money stolen by him and out of poverty, lives in an abandoned club building of the school he attends. He performs the duties of a shinigami, but due to his human blood often requires extra tools to aid him, which are often quite expensive. The only costly shinigami item he owns is the famed {{nihongo|Haori of the Underworld|\u9ec4\u6cc9\u306e\u7fbd\u7e54|Yomi no Haori}}, a robe that allows Rinne to not be seen by ordinary living beings and, when worn by a ghost inside out, turns a ghost into a solid being. Rinne's name is taken from \"Rinne\", the cycle of resurrection present in Buddhism, and [[Six realms|Rokudo]], the six paths that comprise it.\n\n:Upon meeting Sakura, she becomes his first human friend and develops strong feelings for her as the story progresses. The story eventually becomes more focused on Rinne in the later parts of the story, whereas Sakura takes on a more passive role. He is often protective of her, and places her best interests above his own. Rinne dislikes Tsubasa due to his violent ways of exorcising ghosts and competition for Sakura's affection with him, is also often annoyed with Ageha as she constantly tries to win his affection using various methods of trickery and manipulation, and especially hates his father whose greed and dishonesty goes against everything Rinne believes in. He resembles Sabato greatly apart from a slight difference in hair colour.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sakura Mamiya|\u771f\u5bae \u685c|Mamiya Sakura}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mariya Ise]]}} (commercial),<ref name=\"2009 commercial\"/> [[Marina Inoue]] (anime)<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n:Sakura Mamiya is the narrator and [[heroine]]<ref name=natalie/> of the story, a first-year high school student characterized by her signature twin braids. Unlike normal humans, she has [[extrasensory perception]], which was caused from a time where she was spirited away to the ghost world as a little girl, although she came back with the help of a Shinigami named Tamako. She is known for being very calm, quiet, and not expressive of her emotions. As the story progresses, it is hinted that Sakura develops feelings for Rinne, but doesn't show it. Even though she is usually calm and collected, Sakura does have a jealous side that rarely makes an appearance. She is completely unaware of Tsubasa and Rinne's affections towards her and just focuses on helping when she can or doing what is right. \n\n;{{nihongo|Rokumon|\u516d\u6587|Rokumon}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]}} (commercial),<ref name=\"2009 commercial\"/> [[Hitomi Nabatame]] (anime)<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n:Rokumon is a black cat by contract. These cats form contracts with shinigami, aiding them in their job, eliminating evil spirits, but also bringing curses, threats, and ill omens. His appearance is that of a little black cat with a human face, changing into a demonic giant cat face to scare off humans. He can also transform into a cute faced kitten, and often does so in order to get food. He comes to the living world appearing as a demon cat, who scares Rinne and Sakura's classmates. He claims to have been sent by Tamako to form a contract with Rinne, to which the boy refuses, having no resources to support the helper. He then appears to Sakura and reveals to her the true reason of Rinne's shinigami duties, while Rinne finds a letter, discovering the truth about him: Tamako fired him and he came looking for Rinne's support. Eventually, the two form a contract, on the grounds that Rokumon covers his own living expenses.

She becomes upset when Rinne or other characters referred to as \"grandmother\", instead insisting on being called \"young lady\". Fifty years before, she came to claim the soul of a young man in agony, with whom she quickly fell in love. She made a deal with the death priest who married them, promising to do ten times the usual shinigami chores in exchange for extending his life fifty years. Should she fail, her descendants would take on her burden. Ten years ago, she saved Sakura from a Damashigami who brought her to the otherworld, but accepted to buy her a candy before sending her back to the living world, which caused her to become able to see ghosts. After her husband's time came to go to the Wheel of Reincarnation, she lost her right to live in the living world, and her grandson refused to live with her.

While Rinne was living with his grandparents, Sabato would often sneak into his son's room to steal money from the boy's piggybank, and take out large debts in his son's name by using forged stamps or other methods. Sabato is the president of the Damashigami Company, an illegal business committed to stealing the souls of people who have not ended their lifespan. Rinne finds this practice of his father's disgusting, and wants to bring down his father's company. In addition to his habit of playing the spendthrift with other people's money, Sabato also has a great love of women. He has dozens of different women interested in him, yet he holds a special place in his heart for Ageha's sister, who works as his secretary. Sabato uses dirty tricks in attempts to force Rinne to take over the Damashigami Company so that he can one day retire.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mrs. Mamiya|\u5bae\u524d|}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Fumi Hirano]]}}\n:Mrs. Mamiya is Sakura's mother, a cheerful woman, known to get carried away when cooking and makes/buys too much food.

Like Sakura, he can also see ghosts, but often brutally attacks them with \"sacred ashes\" instead of trying to put them to rest, which can serve to turn them into evil spirits. He initially met Sakura when they were in younger and he began to harbor feelings for her after he realized that she can see ghosts as well. Since his transfer into Sakura's high school, he has tried countless times for Sakura to return his affection and is jealous of the time she and Rinne have spent together, and thus begins joining them on their ghost exploits. Since joining them, he has realized that not all ghosts are evil and has been more lenient towards some. He tends to jump to conclusions, especially when something concerns Rinne and Sakura's relationship. It is hinted that he is Christian.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ayame Sakaki|\u698a \u3042\u3084\u3081|Sakaki Ayame}}\n:Ayame Sakaki is a seemingly meek girl who works at a local shrine.

But he moved away because of his fathers\u2019 job, before she was able to, and a powerful vengeful spirit emerged from her, beyond her own control. Upon encountering Tsubasa again, Ayame rekindles her former interest in him, and Tsubasa accepts to date her to calm her vengeful spirit and make it come back to her body. Her spirit would however go on the loose again many times since she still doesn't have full control of it and she and Tsubasa don't meet very often, and she hopes for another date with Tsubasa, but since he still remains fixed on Sakura, he avoids being alone with her, by having Rinne and Sakura along.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hitomi Annette Anematsuri|\u59c9\u796d\u30fb\u30a2\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u77b3|Anematsuri Anetto Hitomi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]]}}\n: Hitomi Annette Anematsuri is a homeroom assistant schoolteacher in possession of the Peep Ball, a special shinigami tool that can let her peek into peoples' past or future. As it is a valuable lost Shinigami tool, it would be targeted by many, including Sabato, Kain and Masato, but she is not bent on handing it over, and her constant accurate predictions and Rinne's help allows her to always keep it. Annette is descended from a witch of Medieval France, and her French grandmother met a Japanese tourist who would become her grandfather, and they moved to Japan. Her grandmother and mother tend to be absent at home, always going to the hot springs, and upon returning home, her grandmother would hit her granddaughter in the head whenever she does something wrong.\n\n== Non-humans ==\n;{{nihongo|Masato|\u9b54\u72ed\u4eba|Masato}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]}}<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n:Masato is a wealthy devil that wants to seek revenge against Rinne. He hates him because during his time at Demon Elementary School, he was given a homework assignment to retrieve a soul and bring it to Hell: a rabbit that was soon going to die from loneliness. Just as he was about to take the still living rabbit's soul, Rinne fed the animal, causing its spirit to return, and ruining Masato's assignment. Enraged, the devil attempted to attack the shinigami with a pitchfork, but Rinne smashed him over the head with a large crucifix, thus beginning their long-running rivalry. Masato often resorts to using his vast fortune as an advantage over the impoverished Rinne, but despite his wealth, his astuteness seems to be a bit lacking. He is a poor speller, often miswriting kanji, and his carefully laid traps are childish and easy to see through. Due to these weaknesses, his plans usually backfire on him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ageha|\u9cf3|Ageha}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Murakawa]]}}<ref name=\"cast2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-16/rumiko-takahashi-rin-ne-anime-casts-rie-murakawa-soma-saito/.89326|title=Rumiko Takahashi's Rin-ne Anime Casts Rie Murakawa, Soma Saito|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n:Ageha is a young shinigami of a wealthy and respected family. She meets Rinne while investigating the Damashigami company, and unexpectedly, begins to have feelings for him after spending some time with him, and much to her disappointment, finds out that her sister willingly joined the Damashigami company for she fell in love with Rinne's father. She would keep trying to win Rinne\u2019s affection many times in various ways, and still hunt Damashigamis although her attention for Rinne became her top priority. She is often shown to be jealous of Sakura, because she believes Sakura and Rinne have feelings for each other, though Sakura is initially jealous of her when she believes that Ageha and Rinne are dating. Ageha and Renge also have disputes, back in grade school Ageha's overzealousness and stupidity often caused problems for pragmatic Renge. She hates it when her sister's betrayal is brought up, shown when she first meets Kain who insults her, and she meets Renge again who brings it up. She has a black cat named Oboro.\n\n;{{nihongo|Bijin|\u7f8e\u4eba|Bijin}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Izumi Kitta]]}}\n:Bijin is Ageha's older sister and secretary of the Damashigami Company. A year before the series starts, she worked as a shinigami like her younger sister, vowing to bring down the Damashigami Company. Then, she disappears and sends her sister a postcard, saying that she now has a boyfriend, Sabato Rokudo. Even though he is a ladies' man, she seems to be his favorite. After Ageha uncovers her work as a Damashigami, their relationship becomes more strained because Bijin decides to stay at Sabato's side while leaving Ageha feeling hurt and betrayed by her sister.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kain|\u67b6\u5370|Kain}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[S\u014dma Sait\u014d]]}}<ref name=\"cast2\"/>\n:Kain is a shirushigami, an accountant in the afterlife. His main responsibility is to keep track of the lifespan of humans on Earth. When Kain was a boy, his mother found herself courted by Sabato Rokudo, Rinne's father, who constantly borrowed money from her, thereby leaving her and her son to live on the verge of bankruptcy. Kain's mother naively believes Sabato to be a good man, but her money has provided the financial backing for his illegal business. Kain doesn't want anyone finding out about his family's connection to the crime group. Because no part of his job requires him to take part in field work of any kind, he is forced to work in secrecy, covertly hunting damashigamis in hopes of destroying the Damashigami Company. Because Sabato habitually uses the name-seal, or hanko, of his son to sign loan contracts, Kain is the main creditor of Rinne and develops a grudge against him. At his first appearance, the shirushigami shows little regard for justice when he attempts to seize Rinne's life-flame to cover Sabato's debts. Furthermore, he shows no remorse when an innocent human bystander like Sakura gets caught up in their battle, even though saying he would get punished for an innocent's death. Although he considers Rinne as guilty as his father, he would sometimes cooperate with Rinne for different reasons including arresting Sabato. He always cared for Renge, however, and even stated that he wished for Renge to follow his dream of getting a better life, e.g. going to the Shinigami Elite High School. He doesn't know that she works as a Damashigami and Renge tries her hardest to keep it a secret.

At his first appearance, he paired with Rinne who is supposed to serve as a mentor during their training. He even lives with Rinne for the assignment. However due to Rinne's poverty, he looks down on him, complaining all the while and ignoring Rinne's advice. He is a bit of a glory hound and overestimates his abilities, despite being very inexperienced and even behind his classmates in his achievements. Thus, he takes on too big a task and causes more problems for spirits and his mentor than he actually solves. Furthermore, he is shown to be easily bored and cheeky, e.g. painting his black cat. Later, he meets Ichigo and falls in love with her, unaware that she is the reincarnation of Rinne's mother. He has a black cat named Kurosu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Refuto|\u96f6\u4e0d\u514e|Refuto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]]}}\n:Refuto is the fourth generation master of the Crescent Moon Shop (\u4e09\u65e5\u6708\u5802 Mikazukido), which has been in business for 4000 years in scythe sharpening, and the youngest twin of Raito.

She and Refuto would still try to come up with ways to make their business thrive, and would still make contact with Rinne to either sell him or ask him to try new products. Though she means well, she is shrewd, going as far as tricking and forcing Rinne to do something for their profit; and seizing any profitable opportunity.\n\n;{{nihongo|Renge Shima|\u56db\u9b54\u3000\u308c\u3093\u3052|Shima Renge}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shizuka Ishigami]]}}\n:Renge Shima is a new transfer student at Rinne's school, but she is also a Damashigami. When she is introduced, she attempts to steal the souls of boys at their school by using a Marilyn Monroe spirit. She captures Sakura and over a cup of tea tells her that she didn't have female friends because of her seductive ways. While walking to the admission exam of the Shinigami Elite High School, she was knocked into the Sanzu river by Sabato while running from a restaurant without paying. Because of that, she missed the entrance exam and as compromise got into the Damashigami High School for Girls, which is why she holds a grudge against her boss. Still, it doesn't stop her from working for him to earn more money due to her poverty. Renge hates Ageha for the problems the airhead had caused her back in grade school and isn't above using whatever she can to get revenge on her. She also has a considerable, but one-sided crush on Kain that dates back to her middle school years. On his graduation day, she tried to give him a love letter that wished him good luck at the Life Count Administration Bureau. However, she was unable to because of a swarm of girls who also wanted to give him gifts. Renge fears of what would happen if Kain knew she is a Damashigami and does her best to keep it a secret, even going so far as to hit Kain on the back of his head to keep him from hearing Sabato casually greet her as an accomplice or working with Rinne to keep her secret. However, Kain heard a rumor that because of Renge had missed her entrance exam and she was unable to make it up but he chose not to believe it. Even so, Kain seems content to keep things as they are between them. She causes problems for Rinne and his friends but mainly for Rinne who is now her next-door neighbor in the abandoned club house.

Now, he attends Shinigami Elite High School (the school that Kain and Renge longed to). When Rinne and him met again at the elementary school reunion, he resented Rinne strongly because he believed Rinne almost drowned him in a river on a field trip. When it turns out Rinne only saved him from humiliation, Matsugo's attitude makes a U-turn, declaring that he loves Rinne. Furthermore, he denies he is \"that way\" but Tsubasa and Sakura do not quite believe him. Like Ageha, he goes to great lengths to spend time with his friend, much to Rinne's annoyance, even using similar methods like the female shinigami, and due to their similar crush on Rinne, the two don't get along very well.

Even though Ageha and Oboro grew-up together, neither of them can stand each other. Ageha treated him poorly as a child which sparked his long standing grudge against her. Oboro mistakenly thought he could take revenge against his employer, but Ageha still retains her signed contract that ensures he cannot stop serving as her retainer. Ageha does not like Oboro any more than he likes her, but she chooses to keep him out of spite.

Rinne dislikes Tsubasa due to his violent ways of exorcising ghosts and competition for Sakura's affection with him, is also often annoyed with Ageha as she constantly tries to win his affection using various methods of trickery and manipulation, and especially hates his father whose greed and dishonesty goes against everything Rinne believes in.

Sabato is the president of the Damashigami Company, an illegal business committed to stealing the souls of people who have not ended their lifespan. Rinne finds this practice of his father's disgusting, and wants to bring down his father's company. In addition to his habit of playing the spendthrift with other people's money, Sabato also has a great love of women. He has dozens of different women interested in him, yet he holds a special place in his heart for Ageha's sister, who works as his secretary. Sabato uses dirty tricks in attempts to force Rinne to take over the Damashigami Company so that he can one day retire.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mrs. Mamiya|\u5bae\u524d|}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Fumi Hirano]]}}\n:Mrs. Mamiya is Sakura's mother, a cheerful woman, known to get carried away when cooking and makes/buys too much food. She always stays at home as a housewife while her husband works at a bank, and she\u2019s unaware of her daughter\u2019s ability to see ghosts. She was a student of Sankai High School like her daughter, and a member of the Broadcasting club with an old friend named Otobe who had a crush on her.\n\n;{{nihongo|Otome Rokud\u014d|\u516d\u9053 \u4e59\u5973|Rokud\u014d Otome}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]}}\n: Otome Rokud\u014d is a high-ranking shinigami who is Rinne's mother. She had been missing for many years because she was accidentally pushed into the Wheel of Reincarnation when she tried to get rid of something, and reincarnated, first into a fish, then a canary, then anteater before becoming an elementary school girl named Ichigo.\n\n== Humans ==\n;{{nihongo|Miho|\u30df\u30db|Miho}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sora Tokui]]}}\n:Miho is a classmate and friend of Sakura and Rika, and also the student council secretary. She has great interest in scary stories, though she\u2019s a scaredy cat like Rika.\n\n;{{nihongo|Rika|\u30ea\u30ab|Rika}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]}}\n:Rika is Sakura and Miho's superstitious friend. At some occasions, she finds herself mixed up in a haunting through no fault of her own. Her first brush with the occult comes when she inherited a haunted phone number that has been floating around for many years. Her last name is revealed in the anime to be Momoi (\u6843\u4e95).\n\n;{{nihongo|Tsubasa Jumonji|\u5341\u6587\u5b57 \u7ffc|J\u016bmonji Tsubasa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]}}<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n:Tsubasa Jumonji comes from a family of exorcists. Like Sakura, he can also see ghosts, but often brutally attacks them with \"sacred ashes\" instead of trying to put them to rest, which can serve to turn them into evil spirits. He initially met Sakura when they were in younger and he began to harbor feelings for her after he realized that she can see ghosts as well. Since his transfer into Sakura's high school, he has tried countless times for Sakura to return his affection and is jealous of the time she and Rinne have spent together, and thus begins joining them on their ghost exploits. Since joining them, he has realized that not all ghosts are evil and has been more lenient towards some. He tends to jump to conclusions, especially when something concerns Rinne and Sakura's relationship. It is hinted that he is Christian.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ayame Sakaki|\u698a \u3042\u3084\u3081|Sakaki Ayame}}\n:Ayame Sakaki is a seemingly meek girl who works at a local shrine. When she was in middle school, Ayame took interest in Tsubasa when he got transferred, as they are on the same business, and hoped to get to know him. But he moved away because of his fathers\u2019 job, before she was able to, and a powerful vengeful spirit emerged from her, beyond her own control. Upon encountering Tsubasa again, Ayame rekindles her former interest in him, and Tsubasa accepts to date her to calm her vengeful spirit and make it come back to her body. Her spirit would however go on the loose again many times since she still doesn't have full control of it and she and Tsubasa don't meet very often, and she hopes for another date with Tsubasa, but since he still remains fixed on Sakura, he avoids being alone with her, by having Rinne and Sakura along.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hitomi Annette Anematsuri|\u59c9\u796d\u30fb\u30a2\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u77b3|Anematsuri Anetto Hitomi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]]}}\n: Hitomi Annette Anematsuri is a homeroom assistant schoolteacher in possession of the Peep Ball, a special shinigami tool that can let her peek into peoples' past or future. As it is a valuable lost Shinigami tool, it would be targeted by many, including Sabato, Kain and Masato, but she is not bent on handing it over, and her constant accurate predictions and Rinne's help allows her to always keep it. Annette is descended from a witch of Medieval France, and her French grandmother met a Japanese tourist who would become her grandfather, and they moved to Japan. Her grandmother and mother tend to be absent at home, always going to the hot springs, and upon returning home, her grandmother would hit her granddaughter in the head whenever she does something wrong.\n\n== Non-humans ==\n;{{nihongo|Masato|\u9b54\u72ed\u4eba|Masato}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]}}<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n:Masato is a wealthy devil that wants to seek revenge against Rinne. He hates him because during his time at Demon Elementary School, he was given a homework assignment to retrieve a soul and bring it to Hell: a rabbit that was soon going to die from loneliness. Just as he was about to take the still living rabbit's soul, Rinne fed the animal, causing its spirit to return, and ruining Masato's assignment. Enraged, the devil attempted to attack the shinigami with a pitchfork, but Rinne smashed him over the head with a large crucifix, thus beginning their long-running rivalry. Masato often resorts to using his vast fortune as an advantage over the impoverished Rinne, but despite his wealth, his astuteness seems to be a bit lacking. He is a poor speller, often miswriting kanji, and his carefully laid traps are childish and easy to see through. Due to these weaknesses, his plans usually backfire on him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ageha|\u9cf3|Ageha}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Murakawa]]}}<ref name=\"cast2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-16/rumiko-takahashi-rin-ne-anime-casts-rie-murakawa-soma-saito/.89326|title=Rumiko Takahashi's Rin-ne Anime Casts Rie Murakawa, Soma Saito|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n:Ageha is a young shinigami of a wealthy and respected family. She meets Rinne while investigating the Damashigami company, and unexpectedly, begins to have feelings for him after spending some time with him, and much to her disappointment, finds out that her sister willingly joined the Damashigami company for she fell in love with Rinne's father. She would keep trying to win Rinne\u2019s affection many times in various ways, and still hunt Damashigamis although her attention for Rinne became her top priority. She is often shown to be jealous of Sakura, because she believes Sakura and Rinne have feelings for each other, though Sakura is initially jealous of her when she believes that Ageha and Rinne are dating. Ageha and Renge also have disputes, back in grade school Ageha's overzealousness and stupidity often caused problems for pragmatic Renge. She hates it when her sister's betrayal is brought up, shown when she first meets Kain who insults her, and she meets Renge again who brings it up. She has a black cat named Oboro.\n\n;{{nihongo|Bijin|\u7f8e\u4eba|Bijin}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Izumi Kitta]]}}\n:Bijin is Ageha's older sister and secretary of the Damashigami Company. A year before the series starts, she worked as a shinigami like her younger sister, vowing to bring down the Damashigami Company. Then, she disappears and sends her sister a postcard, saying that she now has a boyfriend, Sabato Rokudo. Even though he is a ladies' man, she seems to be his favorite. After Ageha uncovers her work as a Damashigami, their relationship becomes more strained because Bijin decides to stay at Sabato's side while leaving Ageha feeling hurt and betrayed by her sister.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kain|\u67b6\u5370|Kain}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[S\u014dma Sait\u014d]]}}<ref name=\"cast2\"/>\n:Kain is a shirushigami, an accountant in the afterlife. His main responsibility is to keep track of the lifespan of humans on Earth. When Kain was a boy, his mother found herself courted by Sabato Rokudo, Rinne's father, who constantly borrowed money from her, thereby leaving her and her son to live on the verge of bankruptcy. Kain's mother naively believes Sabato to be a good man, but her money has provided the financial backing for his illegal business. Kain doesn't want anyone finding out about his family's connection to the crime group. Because no part of his job requires him to take part in field work of any kind, he is forced to work in secrecy, covertly hunting damashigamis in hopes of destroying the Damashigami Company. Because Sabato habitually uses the name-seal, or hanko, of his son to sign loan contracts, Kain is the main creditor of Rinne and develops a grudge against him. At his first appearance, the shirushigami shows little regard for justice when he attempts to seize Rinne's life-flame to cover Sabato's debts. Furthermore, he shows no remorse when an innocent human bystander like Sakura gets caught up in their battle, even though saying he would get punished for an innocent's death. Although he considers Rinne as guilty as his father, he would sometimes cooperate with Rinne for different reasons including arresting Sabato. He always cared for Renge, however, and even stated that he wished for Renge to follow his dream of getting a better life, e.g. going to the Shinigami Elite High School. He doesn't know that she works as a Damashigami and Renge tries her hardest to keep it a secret. He has a black cat named Suzu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shoma|\u7fd4\u771f|Sh\u014dma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016bko Sanpei]]}}\n:Shoma is a shinigami grade schooler from a wealthy family. At his first appearance, he paired with Rinne who is supposed to serve as a mentor during their training. He even lives with Rinne for the assignment. However due to Rinne's poverty, he looks down on him, complaining all the while and ignoring Rinne's advice. He is a bit of a glory hound and overestimates his abilities, despite being very inexperienced and even behind his classmates in his achievements. Thus, he takes on too big a task and causes more problems for spirits and his mentor than he actually solves. Furthermore, he is shown to be easily bored and cheeky, e.g. painting his black cat. Later, he meets Ichigo and falls in love with her, unaware that she is the reincarnation of Rinne's mother. He has a black cat named Kurosu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Refuto|\u96f6\u4e0d\u514e|Refuto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]]}}\n:Refuto is the fourth generation master of the Crescent Moon Shop (\u4e09\u65e5\u6708\u5802 Mikazukido), which has been in business for 4000 years in scythe sharpening, and the youngest twin of Raito. Because of his inexperience and bad mouth, the shop has fallen on hard times, both he and his twin sister are desperate for customers, and rely on Rinne's help, but their new products mostly end discontinued and their business sometimes end in suspension.\n\n;{{nihongo|Raito|\u6765\u514e|Raito}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shizuka It\u014d]]}}\n:Raito is the business manager of the Crescent Moon Shop, and the eldest twin of Refuto. She lured Rinne to the store and convinced him to let her brother sharp his Scythe in hope of increasing their reputation and keeping their business going. She and Refuto would still try to come up with ways to make their business thrive, and would still make contact with Rinne to either sell him or ask him to try new products. Though she means well, she is shrewd, going as far as tricking and forcing Rinne to do something for their profit; and seizing any profitable opportunity.\n\n;{{nihongo|Renge Shima|\u56db\u9b54\u3000\u308c\u3093\u3052|Shima Renge}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shizuka Ishigami]]}}\n:Renge Shima is a new transfer student at Rinne's school, but she is also a Damashigami. When she is introduced, she attempts to steal the souls of boys at their school by using a Marilyn Monroe spirit. She captures Sakura and over a cup of tea tells her that she didn't have female friends because of her seductive ways. While walking to the admission exam of the Shinigami Elite High School, she was knocked into the Sanzu river by Sabato while running from a restaurant without paying. Because of that, she missed the entrance exam and as compromise got into the Damashigami High School for Girls, which is why she holds a grudge against her boss. Still, it doesn't stop her from working for him to earn more money due to her poverty. Renge hates Ageha for the problems the airhead had caused her back in grade school and isn't above using whatever she can to get revenge on her. She also has a considerable, but one-sided crush on Kain that dates back to her middle school years. On his graduation day, she tried to give him a love letter that wished him good luck at the Life Count Administration Bureau. However, she was unable to because of a swarm of girls who also wanted to give him gifts. Renge fears of what would happen if Kain knew she is a Damashigami and does her best to keep it a secret, even going so far as to hit Kain on the back of his head to keep him from hearing Sabato casually greet her as an accomplice or working with Rinne to keep her secret. However, Kain heard a rumor that because of Renge had missed her entrance exam and she was unable to make it up but he chose not to believe it. Even so, Kain seems content to keep things as they are between them. She causes problems for Rinne and his friends but mainly for Rinne who is now her next-door neighbor in the abandoned club house. She has an elderly black cat named Tama.\n\n;{{nihongo|Matsugo|\u6cab\u609f|Matsugo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Taishi Murata]]}}<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n:Matsugo is a former elementary school classmate of Rinne's from a wealthy family. Now, he attends Shinigami Elite High School (the school that Kain and Renge longed to). When Rinne and him met again at the elementary school reunion, he resented Rinne strongly because he believed Rinne almost drowned him in a river on a field trip. When it turns out Rinne only saved him from humiliation, Matsugo's attitude makes a U-turn, declaring that he loves Rinne. Furthermore, he denies he is \"that way\" but Tsubasa and Sakura do not quite believe him. Like Ageha, he goes to great lengths to spend time with his friend, much to Rinne's annoyance, even using similar methods like the female shinigami, and due to their similar crush on Rinne, the two don't get along very well. His black cat is called Kuromitsu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Anju|\u674f\u73e0|Anju}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]}}\n:Anju is Matsugo's classmate and attends the Shinigami Elite High School.

She does not have a black cat.\n\n== Black cats ==\n;{{nihongo|Oboro|\u6727|Oboro}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]]}}<ref name=\"cast3\"/>\n:Oboro is Ageha's black cat by contract. Oboro's family had served Ageha's family for many years and he is continuing that tradition, much to his own chagrin. During their first mission together the two started to argue and Ageha buried him under a boulder where he remained trapped for a year before being able to dig his way out. Even though Ageha and Oboro grew-up together, neither of them can stand each other. Ageha treated him poorly as a child which sparked his long standing grudge against her. Oboro mistakenly thought he could take revenge against his employer, but Ageha still retains her signed contract that ensures he cannot stop serving as her retainer. Ageha does not like Oboro any more than he likes her, but she chooses to keep him out of spite. In the course of the story, they start to get along better, while never ceasing in their fights.\n\n;{{nihongo|Suzu|\u9234|Suzu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Suzuko Mimori]]}}<ref name=\"cast3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-29/rumiko-takahashi-2nd-rin-ne-anime-series-adds-new-cast/.99238|title=Rumiko Takahashi's 2nd RIN-NE Anime Series Adds New Cast|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref>\n:Suzu is Kain's black cat. One day while in town, Kain came across her, holding a sign that she was up for adoption for a free price. Due to his family's financial status, Kain took her in. Suzu is very loyal to her master despite having a surly attitude towards others. She looks down on Rinne and Rokumon for being poor, despite hers and Kain's own impoverished state. Still, she is hinted to develop a friendship of sorts with Oboro and Rokumon. Her personality is fairly easy-going though somewhat excitable due to her young age. Additionally, she is never full as she is shown to eat a lot on various occasions. Suzu is doted on by Kain's mother.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kurosu|\u9ed2\u6d32|Kurosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]]}}\n:Kurosu is Shouma's black cat who works strictly from nine to five. He stated he couldn't stand working any longer than that because he doesn't like children. While on the job, he is patient with his master and even does most of the work for him. He is of a high rank, capable of using illusory cat magic. He thinks of Rokumon as a promising black cat, e.g. complimenting him on Rokumon's test.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tama|\u30bf\u30de|Tama}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Reiko Suzuki]]}}\n:Tama is Renge's black cat.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kuromitsu|\u9ed2\u871c|Kuromitsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]]}}\n:Kuromitsu is Matsugo's black cat.

In November 2018, BHGE completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 101.2 million shares of BHGE Class A common stock. BHGE also repurchased 65.0 million BHGE LLC units from GE. As a result, our economic interest in BHGE reduced from 62.5% to 50.4% and we recognized a loss of $2,169 million ($1,696 million after tax), which decreased the Other Capital component of shareowners' equity. Sale of Class A common stock resulted in an increase in noncontrolling interests of $4,214 million. Any reduction in our ownership interest below 50% will result in us losing control of BHGE.

In November 2018, BHGE completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 101.2 million shares of BHGE Class A common stock. BHGE also repurchased 65.0 million BHGE LLC units from GE. As a result, our economic interest in BHGE reduced from 62.5% to 50.4% and we recognized a loss of $2,169 million ($1,696 million after tax), which decreased the Other Capital component of shareowners' equity. Sale of Class A common stock resulted in an increase in noncontrolling interests of $4,214 million. Any reduction in our ownership interest below 50% will result in us losing control of BHGE. At that point, we would deconsolidate our Oil & Gas segment, recognize any remaining interest at fair value and recognize any difference between carrying value and fair value of our interest in earnings.

There is a 2,500 square-mile methane plume hovering over the Four Corners area of the western US.

This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country.\"<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/ U.S. METHANE 'HOT SPOT' BIGGER THAN EXPECTED] NASA, 9 Oct. 2014.</ref>\n\nOther concerns are related to emissions from the hydraulic fracturing chemicals and equipment such as [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) and [[ozone]].  In 2008, ozone concentrations in [[ambient air]] near drilling sites in [[Sublette County, Wyoming]] were frequently above the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) of 75&nbsp;ppb<ref name=tribOzoneWyoming/> and have been recorded as high as 125&nbsp;ppb.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In [[DISH, Texas]], elevated levels of [[disulfide]]s, [[benzene]], [[xylene]]s and [[naphthalene]] have been detected in the air, emitted from compressor stations.<ref name=\"DISH TX SciAm\"/>  In [[Garfield County, Colorado]], an area with a high concentration of drilling rigs, VOC emissions increased 30% between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"HeatOnGas\"/>\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] analyzed the emissions produced from the hydraulic fracturing equipment at the [[Marcellus Shale]] and [[Eagle Ford Shale]] plays, and concluded that hydraulic pumps accounted for about 83% of the total emissions in the hydraulic fracturing fleet. [[NOx]] emission ranged between 3,600\u20135,600&nbsp;lb/job, [[hydrocarbon|HC]] 232\u2013289&nbsp;lb/job, [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] 859\u20131416&nbsp;lb/job, and [[Particulate matter|PM]] 184\u2013310&nbsp;lb/job. If the fuel efficiencies of the hydraulic fracturing pumps are improved, the emissions can be reduced.<ref name=\"Air Emissions UMICH\"/>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the EPA issued cost-effective regulations, required by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], which include the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>  The final rules are expected to yield a nearly 95% reduction in VOC emissions from more than 11,000&nbsp;new hydraulically fractured gas wells each year. This reduction would be accomplished primarily through capturing natural gas that escapes into the air, and making it available for sale. The rules would also reduce air toxins, which are known or suspected of causing cancer and other serious health effects, and emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>\n\nA study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in April 2014 \"identified a significant regional flux of methane over a large area of shale gas wells in southwestern Pennsylvania in the [[Marcellus formation]] and further identified several pads with high methane emissions.

Trihalomethanes, undesirable byproducts of the chlorination process, form when the chlorine combines with dissolved organic matter in the source water, to form the trihalomethane chloroform. Bromine can substitute for some chlorine, forming brominated trihalomethanes. Because bromine has a higher atomic weight than chlorine, the partial conversion to brominated trihalomethanes increases the concentration by weight of total trihalomethanes.<ref name=\"IPR bromide\" /><ref name=\"sun lowry 2013\" /><ref>Paul Handke, [http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/Wastewater%20Management/WastewaterPortalFiles/MarcellusShaleWastewaterPartnership/dbp_mon_report__dbp_correlation.pdf Trihalomethane speciation and the relationship to elevated total dissolved solid concentrations], [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]].</ref>\n\n===Radioactivity===\n{{see also|Radionuclides associated with hydraulic fracturing}}\n\nRadioactivity associated with hydraulically fractured wells comes from two sources: [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] and [[radioactive tracer]]s introduced into the wells.

There is a 2,500 square-mile methane plume hovering over the Four Corners area of the western US. The magnitude of the plume was such that NASA researcher Christian Frankenberg reported to the press that, \"We couldn\u2019t be sure that the signal was real.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/12/30/2500-square-mile-methane-plume-silently-hovering-over-western-us | title=A 2,500 Square-Mile Methane Plume is Silently Hovering over Western US}}</ref> According to NASA: \"The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country.\"<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/ U.S. METHANE 'HOT SPOT' BIGGER THAN EXPECTED] NASA, 9 Oct. 2014.</ref>\n\nOther concerns are related to emissions from the hydraulic fracturing chemicals and equipment such as [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) and [[ozone]].  In 2008, ozone concentrations in [[ambient air]] near drilling sites in [[Sublette County, Wyoming]] were frequently above the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) of 75&nbsp;ppb<ref name=tribOzoneWyoming/> and have been recorded as high as 125&nbsp;ppb.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In [[DISH, Texas]], elevated levels of [[disulfide]]s, [[benzene]], [[xylene]]s and [[naphthalene]] have been detected in the air, emitted from compressor stations.<ref name=\"DISH TX SciAm\"/>  In [[Garfield County, Colorado]], an area with a high concentration of drilling rigs, VOC emissions increased 30% between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"HeatOnGas\"/>\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] analyzed the emissions produced from the hydraulic fracturing equipment at the [[Marcellus Shale]] and [[Eagle Ford Shale]] plays, and concluded that hydraulic pumps accounted for about 83% of the total emissions in the hydraulic fracturing fleet. [[NOx]] emission ranged between 3,600\u20135,600&nbsp;lb/job, [[hydrocarbon|HC]] 232\u2013289&nbsp;lb/job, [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] 859\u20131416&nbsp;lb/job, and [[Particulate matter|PM]] 184\u2013310&nbsp;lb/job. If the fuel efficiencies of the hydraulic fracturing pumps are improved, the emissions can be reduced.<ref name=\"Air Emissions UMICH\"/>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the EPA issued cost-effective regulations, required by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], which include the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>  The final rules are expected to yield a nearly 95% reduction in VOC emissions from more than 11,000&nbsp;new hydraulically fractured gas wells each year. This reduction would be accomplished primarily through capturing natural gas that escapes into the air, and making it available for sale. The rules would also reduce air toxins, which are known or suspected of causing cancer and other serious health effects, and emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>\n\nA study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in April 2014 \"identified a significant regional flux of methane over a large area of shale gas wells in southwestern Pennsylvania in the [[Marcellus formation]] and further identified several pads with high methane emissions.

A consequence of this exemption is that drilling companies are not required to disclose the chemicals that make up the fracturing fluids, making testing for these chemicals in ground water more difficult.|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-21\">{{cite web |url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |last=Mall |first=Amy |work=Switchboard: NRDC Staff Blog |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |title=Incidents where hydraulic fracturing is a suspected cause of drinking water contamination |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222025433/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |archive-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-36\">{{cite web |url= http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories/10132/3830 |title= How is hydraulic fracturing related to earthquakes and tremors? |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |accessdate= 4 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141019024105/http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories%2F10132%2F3830 |archive-date= 19 October 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-37\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/news-events/seismologists-link-ohio-earthquakes-waste-disposal-wells |title=Ohio Quakes Probably Triggered by Waste Disposal Well, Say Seismologists |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=[[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bateman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/06/fracking-in-pennsylvania-201006 |title=A Colossal Fracking Mess |author=Christopher Bateman |date=21 June 2010 |publisher=VanityFair.com |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 10.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-10/pennsylvania-fracking-foes-fault-epa-over-tainted-water-response.html |title=Pennsylvania Fracking Foes Fault EPA Over Tainted Water Response |author=Jim Snyder |author2=Mark Drajem |date=10 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 11.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-11/fracking-s-political-support-unshaken-by-doctors-call-for-ban.html |title=Fracking Political Support Unshaken by Doctors' Call for Ban |author=Mark Drajem |date=11 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BusinessIn10092013\" >{{cite news |url =http://www.businessinsider.com/fracking-leaving-radioactive-pollution-in-pa-2013-10|title=Duke Study: Fracking Is Leaving Radioactive Pollution In Pennsylvania Rivers|work= Business Insider | first =Harrison |last=Jacobs |date=9 October 2013 |publisher= [[Business Insider]] | accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BW 19.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/like-fracking-youll-love-super-fracking-01192012.html |title=Like Fracking?

{"title_page": "Case method", "text_new": "{{cleanup|reason=It's more of a bunch of lists than a descriptive article|date=January 2017}}\nThe '''case method''' is a [[Teaching method|teaching approach]] that uses decision-forcing cases to put students in the role of people who were faced with difficult decisions at some point in the past. It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the [[casebook method]] of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question.  Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise, describe, and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065459/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n== Comparison with the casebook method of teaching law ==\nThe case method evolved from the [[casebook method]], a mode of teaching based on [[Socratic method|Socratic principles]] pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.\n\n== Decision-forcing cases ==\n\nA decision-forcing case is a kind of [[Decision Game | decision game]].  Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \"protagonist\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem.  However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events.\n\nA decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study.  That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past.  However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \"interrupted narrative.\"  This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision.  In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. <ref>[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/degree-programs/teaching/Contributed-Case-Packet.pdf]</ref>\n\n== Criticisms of decision-forcing cases ==\nIn recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bridgman|first1=Todd|title=Beyond the Manager's Moral Dilemma: Rethinking the 'Ideal Type' Business Ethics Case|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2010|volume=94|page=311\u2013322|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3}}</ref> It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. It has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the \u2018shoes\u2019 of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Todd|last2=Cummings|first2=Stephen|last3=McLaughlin|first3=Colm|date=2016-12-01|title=Restating the Case: How Revisiting the Development of the Case Method Can Help Us Think Differently About the Future of the Business School|url=http://amle.aom.org/content/15/4/724|journal=Academy of Management Learning & Education|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=724\u2013741|doi=10.5465/amle.2015.0291|issn=1537-260X}}</ref>\n\n== Role play ==\n\nEvery decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve.  Thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play.\n\nSome case teachers, such as those of the Marine Corps University, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case.  (A student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\")  Other case teachers, such as those at the Harvard Business School, place less emphasis on role play, asking students \"what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hbs.edu/teaching/case-method-in-practice/leading-in-the-classroom/openings.html | title=Openings - Christensen Center for Teaching and Learning - Harvard Business School}}</ref>\n\n== Historical solution ==\n\nAfter discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case.  Also known as \"the rest of the story\", \"the epilogue\", or (particularly at Harvard University) \"the 'B' case\", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist.\n\nWhatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the \"right answer.\"  Rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions.\n\nSome case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students.  One reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case.  Another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. \"Analytic and problem-solving learning,\" writes Kirsten Lundgren of Columbia University, \"can be all the more powerful when the 'what happened' is left unanswered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009025732/https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid=3 |archivedate=2014-10-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Complex cases ==\n\nA classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time.  There are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems.\n\n== Decision-forcing staff rides ==\n\nA decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a \"decision-forcing staff ride.\"  Also known as an \"on-site decision-forcing case\", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as \"[[staff ride |staff rides]]\": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the United States Army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (Stabs Reisen, literally \"staff journeys\") introduced by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] in 1801 and made famous by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder | the elder Hellmuth von Moltke]] in the middle years of the nineteenth century.\n\nTo avoid confusion between \"decision-forcing staff rides\" and staff rides of other sorts, the Case Method Project at the [[Marine Corps University]] in Quantico, Virginia, has adopted the term \"Russell Ride\" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts.  The term is an homage to Major General [[John Henry Russell Jr.]],USMC, the 16th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://onsitetoughcase.blogspot.com/2015/11/decision-forcing-staff-ride.html | title=The Decision-Forcing Staff Ride}}</ref>\n\n== Sandwich metaphors ==\n\nDecision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches.  In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve.\n\nA decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \"triple-decker case.\"  (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an [[Open sandwich|\"open-face\"]] or [[Open sandwich|\"sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-sandwich-metaphor.html | title=The Sandwich Simile}}</ref>  \n\nA decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions is sometimes called a [[White Castle (restaurant)|\"White Castle\"]] or [[Slider (sandwich)|\"slider\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/white-castle-cases.html | title=The White Castle DFC}}</ref>\n\n== Case materials ==\n\nCase materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs.\n\nCase materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting.  Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called \"the B-case\", \"the rest of the story\", or \"the reveal.\")  Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting.  (These are often referred to as \"handouts.\") <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101448/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCase materials may be either \"refined\" or \"raw.\" Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/curriculum/raw-case-approach | title=The 'Raw' Case Approach| date=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n== Published case materials ==\n\nA number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials.  These organizations include:\n\n* Globalens at the [[University of Michigan]]\n* [[Harvard Business School]]\n* [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]\n* [[Nagoya University of Commerce & Business]]\n* [[Darden School]] at the [[University of Virginia]]\n* [[Asian Institute of Management]]\n* [[Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad]]\n* Asian Case Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]]\n\n==The narrative fallacy==\n\nThe presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem.  This can lead to \"the narrative fallacy\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story.  This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \"parse the case materials.\"  That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-01-23/the-case-against-case-studies | title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?}}</ref>\n\nTechniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials;  awareness of tropes and clich\u00e9s; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \"distractors\" - information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case.\n\n==Purpose of the case method==\n\nThe case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. In the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right.  By exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters.  By placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures.  By providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue.  By providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement.  By asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession.<ref>[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/loader.php?type=d&id=1246140]</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the case method (\"Because Wisdom Can't Be Told\"), Charles I. Gragg of the Harvard Business School argued that \"the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement.\"  <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BUSINESS304/Because+wisdom+can't+be+told+-+1940 | title=The University of Auckland Login Service}}</ref>\n\n==Incompatible objectives==\n\nWhile the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement.  These incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to:\n\n* provide an example to be emulated \n* paint a particular person as a hero or a villain \n* encourage (or discourage) a particular type of behavior \n* illustrate a pre-existing theory \n\nThomas W. Shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that \"Cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. The instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think\u2014they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. With this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs.\" <ref>[http://www.ni-u.edu/ni_press/pdf/Experiences_to_Go.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Disclaimers==\n\nCase materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and \"best practices\" fallacies.  Here are some examples of such disclaimers:\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em\">This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation.</div>\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em\">This decision-forcing case is an exercise designed to foster empathy, creativity, a bias for action, and other martial virtues.  As such, it makes no argument for the effectiveness of any particular course of action, technique, procedure, or convention. </div>''\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em>This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation. Its purpose is to put the student in the shoes of the decision-maker in order to gain a fuller understanding of the situations and the decisions made.</div>''\n\n== Use of the case method in professional schools ==\n\nThe case method is used in a variety of professional schools.

It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the [[casebook method]] of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question.  Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065459/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n== Comparison with the casebook method of teaching law ==\nThe case method evolved from the [[casebook method]], a mode of teaching based on [[Socratic method|Socratic principles]] pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.\n\n== Decision-forcing cases ==\n\nA decision-forcing case is a kind of [[Decision Game | decision game]].  Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \"protagonist\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem.  However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events.\n\nA decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study.  That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past.  However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \"interrupted narrative.\"  This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision.  In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. <ref>[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/degree-programs/teaching/Contributed-Case-Packet.pdf]</ref>\n\n== Criticisms of decision-forcing cases ==\nIn recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bridgman|first1=Todd|title=Beyond the Manager's Moral Dilemma: Rethinking the 'Ideal Type' Business Ethics Case|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2010|volume=94|page=311\u2013322|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3}}</ref> It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives.

The term is an homage to Major General [[John Henry Russell Jr.]],USMC, the 16th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://onsitetoughcase.blogspot.com/2015/11/decision-forcing-staff-ride.html | title=The Decision-Forcing Staff Ride}}</ref>\n\n== Sandwich metaphors ==\n\nDecision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches.  In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve.\n\nA decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \"triple-decker case.\"  (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an [[Open sandwich|\"open-face\"]] or [[Open sandwich|\"sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-sandwich-metaphor.html | title=The Sandwich Simile}}</ref>  \n\nA decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions is sometimes called a [[White Castle (restaurant)|\"White Castle\"]] or [[Slider (sandwich)|\"slider\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/white-castle-cases.html | title=The White Castle DFC}}</ref>\n\n== Case materials ==\n\nCase materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs.\n\nCase materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting.  Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called \"the B-case\", \"the rest of the story\", or \"the reveal.\")  Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting.  (These are often referred to as \"handouts.\") <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101448/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCase materials may be either \"refined\" or \"raw.\" Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/curriculum/raw-case-approach | title=The 'Raw' Case Approach| date=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n== Published case materials ==\n\nA number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials.  These organizations include:\n\n* Globalens at the [[University of Michigan]]\n* [[Harvard Business School]]\n* [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]\n* [[Nagoya University of Commerce & Business]]\n* [[Darden School]] at the [[University of Virginia]]\n* [[Asian Institute of Management]]\n* [[Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad]]\n* Asian Case Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]]\n\n==The narrative fallacy==\n\nThe presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem.  This can lead to \"the narrative fallacy\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story.  This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \"parse the case materials.\"  That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-01-23/the-case-against-case-studies | title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?}}</ref>\n\nTechniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials;  awareness of tropes and clich\u00e9s; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \"distractors\" - information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case.\n\n==Purpose of the case method==\n\nThe case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. In the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right.  By exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters.  By placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures.  By providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue.  By providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement.  By asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession.<ref>[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/loader.php?type=d&id=1246140]</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the case method (\"Because Wisdom Can't Be Told\"), Charles I. Gragg of the Harvard Business School argued that \"the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement.\"  <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BUSINESS304/Because+wisdom+can't+be+told+-+1940 | title=The University of Auckland Login Service}}</ref>\n\n==Incompatible objectives==\n\nWhile the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement.  These incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to:\n\n* provide an example to be emulated \n* paint a particular person as a hero or a villain \n* encourage (or discourage) a particular type of behavior \n* illustrate a pre-existing theory \n\nThomas W. Shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that \"Cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. The instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think\u2014they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. With this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs.\" <ref>[http://www.ni-u.edu/ni_press/pdf/Experiences_to_Go.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Disclaimers==\n\nCase materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and \"best practices\" fallacies.  Here are some examples of such disclaimers:\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em\">This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation.</div>\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em\">This decision-forcing case is an exercise designed to foster empathy, creativity, a bias for action, and other martial virtues.  As such, it makes no argument for the effectiveness of any particular course of action, technique, procedure, or convention. </div>''\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em>This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation. Its purpose is to put the student in the shoes of the decision-maker in order to gain a fuller understanding of the situations and the decisions made.</div>''\n\n== Use of the case method in professional schools ==\n\nThe case method is used in a variety of professional schools.
