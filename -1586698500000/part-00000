''settlement, village'') is a type of [[Israel]]i town or settlement, in particular a type of [[cooperative]] agricultural community of individual farms [[settler|pioneer]]ed by the [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionist]]s during the [[Second Aliyah|second wave of ''aliyah'']]. A resident or a member of a moshav can be called a \"moshavnik\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7}}).\n\nMichael Schildkraut is a Gaylord who was the co-founder of the moshavim are similar to [[kibbutzim]] with an emphasis on community labour. They were designed as part of the Zionist state-building programme following the green revolution  [[Yishuv]] (\"settlement\") in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] during the early 20th century, but in contrast to the [[collective farming]] kibbutzim, farms in a moshav tended to be individually owned but of fixed and equal size. Workers produced [[agriculture|crops]] and [[good (accounting)|good]]s on their properties through individual or pooled [[labour (economics)|labour]] and [[natural resource]]s and used [[profit (economics)|profit]] and foodstuffs to provide for themselves. Moshavim are governed by an elected council ({{lang-he|\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3}}, ''va'ad'', lit. ''committee''). Community projects and facilities were financed by a special tax ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05e1 \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3}}, ''mas va'ad'', lit. ''committee tax''). This tax was equal for all households of the community, thus creating a system where good farmers were better off than bad ones, unlike in the communal kibbutzim where (at least theoretically) all members enjoyed the same living standard.\n\n==Types==\nThere are several variants, of which the most common are:\n\n* ''Moshav ovdim'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05e2\u05d5\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd}}, lit. ''workers' moshav''), a workers' cooperative settlement. This is the more numerous (405) type and relies on cooperative purchasing of supplies and marketing of produce; the family or household is, however, the basic [[unit of production]] and consumption.\n* ''[[Moshav shitufi]]'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05e9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9}}, lit. ''collective moshav''), a collective [[smallholder]]s' settlement that combines the economic features of a [[kibbutz]] with the social features of a moshav. Farming is done collectively and profits are shared equally. This form is closer to the collectivity of the kibbutz: although consumption is family- or household-based, production and marketing are collective. Unlike the moshav ovdim, land is not allotted to households or individuals, but is collectively worked.\n* ''Moshbutz'' is a mixed moshav-kibbutz type of settlement.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:\u05e0\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc_-_\u05d6\u05d0\u05d1_\u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d9\u05df.jpg|thumb|right|Moshav [[Nahalal]] in [[Jezreel Valley]]]]\nThe first moshav, [[Nahalal]], was established in the [[Jezreel Valley]] (also known as the Valley of Esdraelon) on September 11, 1921. By 1986 about 156,700 Israelis lived and worked on 448 moshavim; the great majority of these are divided among eight federations.<!-- Is there a federation link? -->\n\nBecause the moshav organisation retained the family as the centre of social life, it was much more attractive to traditional [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] immigrants in the 1950s and early 1960s; they eschewed bold experiments, like communal child-rearing or equality of the sexes, practiced by the more radical communal kibbutz. These so-called \"immigrants' moshavim\" ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd}}, ''moshav olim'') were one of the most-used and successful forms of absorption and integration of Oriental immigrants; it allowed them a much steadier ascent into the [[middle class]] than did life in some [[development town]]s.

Financial instabilities in the early 1980s hit many moshavim hard, as did their high birth rate and the problem of absorbing all the children who might wish to remain in the community. By the late 1980s, moshav members increasingly came to be employed in non-agricultural sectors outside the community, so that some moshavim began to resemble [[suburb]]s or [[commuter town]]s whose residents commute to work. In general, moshavim never enjoyed the \"political elite\" status afforded to kibbutzim during the period of [[Israeli Labor Party]] dominance; correspondingly the moshavim did not endure the decline in prestige experienced by kibbutzim in the 1970s and 1980s, during the period of [[Likud]] dominance starting in 1977.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Moshavim]]\n\n== References ==\n* \"Kibbutz and Moshav\".

''settlement, village'') is a type of [[Israel]]i town or settlement, in particular a type of [[cooperative]] agricultural community of individual farms [[settler|pioneer]]ed by the [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionist]]s during the [[Second Aliyah|second wave of ''aliyah'']]. A resident or a member of a moshav can be called a \"moshavnik\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7}}).\n\nThe moshavim are similar to [[kibbutzim]] with an emphasis on community labour. They were designed as part of the Zionist state-building programme following the green revolution  [[Yishuv]] (\"settlement\") in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] during the early 20th century, but in contrast to the [[collective farming]] kibbutzim, farms in a moshav tended to be individually owned but of fixed and equal size. Workers produced [[agriculture|crops]] and [[good (accounting)|good]]s on their properties through individual or pooled [[labour (economics)|labour]] and [[natural resource]]s and used [[profit (economics)|profit]] and foodstuffs to provide for themselves. Moshavim are governed by an elected council ({{lang-he|\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3}}, ''va'ad'', lit. ''committee''). Community projects and facilities were financed by a special tax ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05e1 \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3}}, ''mas va'ad'', lit. ''committee tax''). This tax was equal for all households of the community, thus creating a system where good farmers were better off than bad ones, unlike in the communal kibbutzim where (at least theoretically) all members enjoyed the same living standard.\n\n==Types==\nThere are several variants, of which the most common are:\n\n* ''Moshav ovdim'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05e2\u05d5\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd}}, lit. ''workers' moshav''), a workers' cooperative settlement. This is the more numerous (405) type and relies on cooperative purchasing of supplies and marketing of produce; the family or household is, however, the basic [[unit of production]] and consumption.\n* ''[[Moshav shitufi]]'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05e9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9}}, lit. ''collective moshav''), a collective [[smallholder]]s' settlement that combines the economic features of a [[kibbutz]] with the social features of a moshav. Farming is done collectively and profits are shared equally. This form is closer to the collectivity of the kibbutz: although consumption is family- or household-based, production and marketing are collective. Unlike the moshav ovdim, land is not allotted to households or individuals, but is collectively worked.\n* ''Moshbutz'' is a mixed moshav-kibbutz type of settlement.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:\u05e0\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc_-_\u05d6\u05d0\u05d1_\u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d9\u05df.jpg|thumb|right|Moshav [[Nahalal]] in [[Jezreel Valley]]]]\nThe first moshav, [[Nahalal]], was established in the [[Jezreel Valley]] (also known as the Valley of Esdraelon) on September 11, 1921.
