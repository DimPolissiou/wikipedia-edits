Development of SCR technology continued in Japan and the US in the early 1960s with research focusing on less expensive and more durable catalyst agents.

Thermal durability is particularly important for automotive SCR applications that incorporate the use of a [[diesel particulate filter]] with forced regeneration.

The honeycomb form usually is an [[extrusion|extruded]] ceramic applied [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneously]] throughout the ceramic carrier or coated on the substrate. Like the various types of catalysts, their configuration also has advantages and disadvantages. Plate-type catalysts have lower [[pressure drop]]s and are less susceptible to plugging and fouling than the honeycomb types, but plate configurations are much larger and more expensive. Honeycomb configurations are smaller than plate types, but have higher pressure drops and plug much more easily.  A third type is corrugated, comprising only about 10% of the market in power plant applications.<ref name=babcock/>\n\n==Reductants==\nSeveral reductants are currently used in SCR applications including [[anhydrous ammonia]], [[Ammonium hydroxide|aqueous ammonia]] or [[urea]]. All those three reductants are widely available in large quantities.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia can be stored as a liquid at approximately 10 bar pressure in steel tanks. It is classified as an inhalation hazard, but it can be safely stored and handled if well-developed codes and standards are followed. Its advantage is that it needs no further conversion to operate within an SCR. It is typically favoured by large industrial SCR operators. Aqueous ammonia must be vaporized in order to be used, but it is substantially safer to store and transport than anhydrous ammonia. Urea is the safest to store, but requires conversion to ammonia through thermal decomposition in order to be used as an effective reductant.<ref name=babcock/>\n\n==Limitations==\nSCR systems are sensitive to contamination and plugging resulting from normal operation or abnormal events.  Many SCRs are given a finite life due to known amounts of contaminants in the untreated gas.  The large majority of catalyst on the market is of porous construction.  A clay planting pot is a good example of what SCR catalyst feels like.  This porosity is what gives the catalyst the high surface area essential for reduction of NOx.  However, the pores are easily plugged by a variety of compounds present in combustion/fuel gas.  Some examples of plugging contaminates are: fine particulate, ammonia sulfur compounds, [[ammonium bisulfate]] (ABS) and silicon compounds.  Many of these contaminants can be removed while the unit is on line, for example by [[Furnace#Sootblower|sootblowers]].  The unit can also be cleaned during a turnaround or by raising the exhaust temperature. Of more concern to SCR performance is poisons, which will destroy the chemistry of the catalyst and render the SCR ineffective at NOx reduction or cause unwanted oxidation of ammonia (forming more NOx).  Some of these poisons include: halogens, alkaline metals, arsenic, phosphorus, antimony, chrome, copper.\n\nMost SCRs require tuning to properly perform.  Part of tuning involves ensuring a proper distribution of ammonia in the gas stream and uniform gas velocity through the catalyst.  Without tuning, SCRs can exhibit inefficient NOx reduction along with excessive ammonia slip due to not utilizing the catalyst surface area effectively.  Another facet of tuning involves determining the proper ammonia flow for all process conditions. Ammonia flow is in general controlled based on NOx measurements taken from the gas stream or preexisting performance curves from an engine manufacturer (in the case of gas turbines and reciprocating engines).  Typically, all future operating conditions must be known beforehand to properly design and tune an SCR system.\n\nAmmonia slip is an industry term for ammonia passing through the SCR un-reacted.  This occurs when ammonia is over-injected into gas stream, temperatures are too low for ammonia to react, or catalyst has degraded (see above).\n\nTemperature is one of the largest limitations of SCR. Gas turbines, cars, and diesel engines all have a period during a start-up where exhaust temperatures are too cool for NOx reduction to occur.\n\n==Power plants==\nIn [[Fossil fuel power plant|power station]]s, the same basic technology is employed for removal of {{chem|NO|''x''}} from the flue gas of [[boiler]]s used in [[power generation]] and industry. In general, the SCR unit is located between the [[furnace]] [[economizer]] and the air heater, and the ammonia is injected into the catalyst chamber through an ammonia injection grid.  As in other SCR applications, the temperature of operation is critical.  Ammonia slip is also an issue with SCR technology used in power plants.\n\nOther issues that must be considered in using SCR for {{chem|NO|''x''}} control in power plants are the formation of [[ammonium sulfate]] and ammonium bisulfate due to the sulfur content of the fuel as well as the undesirable catalyst-caused formation of {{chem|SO|3}} from the {{chem|SO|2}} and {{chem|link=Oxygen|O|2}} in the flue gas.\n\nA further operational difficulty in [[coal]]-fired boilers is the binding of the catalyst by [[fly ash]] from the fuel [[combustion]].  This requires the usage of sootblowers, [[sonic horn]]s, and careful design of the ductwork and catalyst materials to avoid plugging by the fly ash. SCR catalysts have a typical operational lifetime of about 16,000-40,000 hours in coal-fired power plants, depending on the flue gas composition, and up to 80,000 hours in cleaner gas-fired power plants.\n\n==SCR and EPA 2010==\n[[File:Hino Standardized SCR Unit.jpg|thumb|[[Hino Motors|Hino truck]] and its Standardized SCR Unit which combines SCR with Diesel Particulate Active Reduction (DPR).

Each is designed around similar requirements:\n# Fine filtration\n# Minimum [[pressure drop]]\n# Low cost\n# Mass production suitability\n# Product durability\n\n===Cordierite wall flow filters===\nThe most common filter is made of [[cordierite]] (a ceramic material that is also used as catalytic converter supports (cores)). Cordierite filters provide excellent filtration efficiency, are relatively inexpensive, and have thermal properties that make packaging them for installation in the vehicle simple. The major drawback is that cordierite has a relatively low [[melting point]] (about 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C) and cordierite substrates have been known to melt during filter regeneration. This is mostly an issue if the filter has become loaded more heavily than usual, and is more of an issue with passive systems than with active systems, unless there is a system break down.<ref name=ax/><ref>[http://www.corning.com/environmentaltechnologies/technical_resources/technical_papers/Filters_Substrates.aspx \"Technical Papers\" (2013) Corning Environmental Technologies]</ref>\n\nCordierite filter cores look like catalytic converter cores that have had alternate channels plugged - the plugs force the exhaust gas flow through the wall and the particulate collects on the inlet face.<ref>[http://www.dieselemissiontechnologies.com/det/New%20Temples/Cordierite.html \"Cordierite\" (2009) Diesel Emission Technologies Inc.]</ref>\n\n===Silicon carbide wall flow filters===\nThe second most popular filter material is [[silicon carbide]], or [[SiC]]. It has a higher (2700&nbsp;\u00b0C) melting point than cordierite, however, it is not as stable thermally, making packaging an issue. Small SiC cores are made of single pieces, while larger cores are made in segments, which are separated by a special cement so that heat expansion of the core will be taken up by the cement, and not the package. SiC cores are usually more expensive than cordierite cores, however they are manufactured in similar sizes, and one can often be used to replace the other.\nSilicon carbide filter cores also look like catalytic converter cores that have had alternate channels plugged - again the plugs force the exhaust gas flow through the wall and the particulate collects on the inlet face.<ref name=ax/><ref name=sil>[http://www.dieselemissiontechnologies.com/det/New%20Temples/SiC.html \"Silicon Carbide (SiC)\" (2009) Diesel Emission Technologies Inc.]</ref>\n\nThe characteristics of the wall flow  diesel Particulate filter substrate are as follows: \nbroad band filtration (the diameters of the filtered particles are 0.2\u2013150 \u03bcm); \nhigh filtration efficiency (can be up to 95%); \nhigh refractory; \nhigh mechanical properties.\nhigh boiling point.<ref name=sil/>\n\n===Ceramic fiber filters===\nFibrous ceramic filters are made from several different types of ceramic fibers that are mixed together to form a porous media. This media can be formed into almost any shape and can be customized to suit various applications. The porosity can be controlled in order to produce high flow, lower efficiency or high efficiency lower volume filtration. Fibrous filters have an advantage over wall flow design of producing lower back pressure.\nCeramic wall-flow filters remove carbon particulates almost completely, including fine particulates less than 100 nanometers (nm) diameter with an efficiency of greater than 95% in mass and greater than 99% in number of particles over a wide range of engine operating conditions. Since the continuous flow of soot into the filter would eventually block it, it is necessary to 'regenerate' the filtration properties of the filter by burning-off the collected particulate on a regular basis. Soot particulates burn-off forms water and CO<sub>2</sub> in small quantity amounting to less than 0.05% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the engine.<ref name=ax>[http://www.axces.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=317:dpf-info&catid=140&Itemid=589 Emission Technology: DPF - Diesel Particulate Filters, Axces.eu]</ref>\n\n===Metal fiber flow-through filters===\nSome cores are made from metal fibers \u2013 generally the fibers are \"woven\" into a monolith. Such cores have the advantage that an electrical current can be passed through the monolith to heat the core for regeneration purposes, allowing the filter to regenerate at low exhaust temperatures and/or low exhaust flow rates. Metal fiber cores tend to be more expensive than cordierite or silicon carbide cores, and generally not interchangeable with them because of the electrical requirement.<ref name=ax/><ref>[http://www.dieselemissiontechnologies.com/det/New%20Temples/MetalFiberMeshFilters.html \"Metal Fiber & Mesh Filters\" (2009) Diesel Emission Technologies]</ref>\n\n===Paper===\nDisposable paper cores are used in certain specialty applications, without a regeneration strategy. [[Coal mine]]s are common users \u2013 the exhaust gas is usually first passed through a water trap to cool it, and then through the filter.<ref>[http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/8585/cdc_8585_DS1.pdf \"Best Practices For Underground Diesel Emissions\" - CDC Stacks]</ref> Paper filters are also used when a diesel machine must be used indoors for short periods of time, such as on a forklift being used to install equipment inside a store.<ref name=ax/><ref>[https://www.dieselnet.com/tginfo/abstracts.html Technology Guide, DieselNet]</ref>\n\n===Partial filters===\nThere are a variety of devices that produce over 50% particulate matter filtration, but less than 85%. Partial filters come in a variety of materials. The only commonality between them is that they produce more back pressure than a catalytic converter, and less than a diesel particulate filter. Partial filter technology is popular for retrofit.<ref>[http://www.emitec.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Bibliothek/Vortraege/2006-01-0213_FINAL.pdf Jacobs ''et al.'' (2005) \"Development of Partial Filter Technology for HDD Retrofit\", SAE International]</ref>\n\n==Maintenance==\nFilters require more maintenance than catalytic converters. Ash, a byproduct of oil consumption from normal engine operation, builds up in the filter as it cannot be converted into a gas and pass through the walls of the filter. This increases the pressure before the filter. Warnings are given to the driver before filter restriction causes an issue with drive-ability or damage to the engine or filter develop. Regular filter maintenance is a necessity.<ref name=hdt/>\n\nDPF filters go through a regeneration process which removes this soot and lowers the filter pressure. There are three types of regeneration: passive, active, and forced. Passive regeneration takes place normally while driving, when engine load and vehicle drive-cycle create temperatures that are high enough to regenerate the soot buildup on the DPF walls. Active regeneration happens while the vehicle is in use, when low engine load and lower exhaust gas temperatures inhibit the naturally occurring passive regeneration. Sensors upstream and downstream of the DPF (or a differential pressure sensor) provide readings that initiate a metered addition of fuel into the exhaust stream. There are two methods to inject fuel, either downstream injection directly into the exhaust stream, downstream of the turbo, or fuel injection into the engine cylinders on the exhaust stroke. This fuel and exhaust gas mixture passes through the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) creating temperatures high enough to burn off the accumulated soot. Once the pressure drop across the DPF lowers to a calculated value, the process ends, until the soot accumulation builds up again. This works well for vehicles that drive longer distances with few stops compared to those that perform short trips with many starts and stops. If the filter develops too much pressure then the last type of regeneration must be used - a forced regeneration. This can be accomplished in two ways. The Vehicle operator can initiate the regeneration via a dashboard mounted switch. Various signal interlocks, such as park brake applied, transmission in neutral, engine coolant temperature, and an absence of engine related fault codes are required (vary by OEM and application) for this process to initiate. When the soot accumulation reaches a level that is potentially damaging to the engine or the exhaust system, the solution involves a garage using a computer program to run a regeneration of the DPF manually.\n\n==Safety==\nIn 2011, Ford recalled 37,400 F-Series trucks with diesel engines after fuel and oil leaks caused fires in the diesel particulate filters of the trucks.

This is done either passively (from the engine's exhaust heat in normal operation or by adding a catalyst to the filter) or actively introducing very high heat into the exhaust system. On-board active filter management can use a variety of strategies:<ref name=barone/>\n# Engine management to increase exhaust temperature through late fuel injection or injection during the exhaust stroke\n# Use of a fuel borne catalyst to reduce soot burn-out temperature\n# A fuel burner after the turbo to increase the exhaust temperature\n# A catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature, with after injection (HC-Doser)\n# Resistive heating coils to increase the exhaust temperature\n# [[Microwave energy]] to increase the particulate temperature\n\nAll on-board active systems use extra fuel, whether through burning to heat the DPF, or providing extra power to the DPF's electrical system, although the use of a fuel borne catalyst reduces the energy required very significantly. Typically a computer monitors one or more sensors that measure back pressure and/or temperature, and based on pre-programmed set points the computer makes decisions on when to activate the regeneration cycle. The additional fuel can be supplied by a [[metering pump]]. Running the cycle too often while keeping the back pressure in the exhaust system low will result in high fuel consumption.  Not running the regeneration cycle soon enough increases the risk of engine damage and/or uncontrolled regeneration ([[thermal runaway]]) and possible DPF failure.\n\nDiesel particulate matter burns when temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius are attained. This temperature can be reduced to somewhere in the range of 350 to 450 degrees Celsius by use of a fuel borne catalyst. The actual temperature of soot burn-out will depend on the chemistry employed. The start of combustion causes a further increase in temperature. In some cases, in the absence of a fuel borne catalyst, the combustion of the particulate matter can raise temperatures above the structural integrity threshold of the filter material, which can cause catastrophic failure of the substrate. Various strategies have been developed to limit this possibility. Note that unlike a spark-ignited engine, which typically has less than 0.5% oxygen in the exhaust gas stream before the emission control device(s), diesel engines have a very high ratio of oxygen available. While the amount of available oxygen makes fast regeneration of a filter possible, it also contributes to runaway regeneration problems.\n\nSome applications use off-board regeneration. Off-board regeneration requires operator intervention (i.e. the machine is either plugged into a wall/floor mounted regeneration station, or the filter is removed from the machine and placed in the regeneration station). Off-board regeneration is not suitable for on-road vehicles, except in situations where the vehicles are parked in a central depot when not in use. Off-board regeneration is mainly used in industrial and mining applications. Coal mines (with the attendant explosion risk from coal damp) use off-board regeneration if non-disposable filters are installed, with the regeneration stations sited in an area where non-permissible machinery is allowed.\n\nMany [[forklift]]s may also use off-board regeneration \u2013 typically mining machinery and other machinery that spend their operational lives in one location, which makes having a stationary regeneration station practical. In situations where the filter is physically removed from the machine for regeneration there is also the advantage of being able to inspect the filter core on a daily basis (DPF cores for non-road applications are typically sized to be usable for one shift - so regeneration is a daily occurrence).<ref>[http://www.deep.org/reports/stobiedpf.pdf Bruce R.

Each is designed around similar requirements:\n# Fine filtration\n# Minimum [[pressure drop]]\n# Low cost\n# Mass production suitability\n# Product durability\n\n===Cordierite wall flow filters===\nThe most common filter is made of [[cordierite]] (a ceramic material that is also used as catalytic converter supports (cores)). Cordierite filters provide excellent filtration efficiency, are relatively inexpensive, and have thermal properties that make packaging them for installation in the vehicle simple. The major drawback is that cordierite has a relatively low [[melting point]] (about 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C) and cordierite substrates have been known to melt during filter regeneration. This is mostly an issue if the filter has become loaded more heavily than usual, and is more of an issue with passive systems than with active systems, unless there is a system break down.<ref name=ax/><ref>[http://www.corning.com/environmentaltechnologies/technical_resources/technical_papers/Filters_Substrates.aspx \"Technical Papers\" (2013) Corning Environmental Technologies]</ref>\n\nCordierite filter cores look like catalytic converter cores that have had alternate channels plugged - the plugs force the exhaust gas flow through the wall and the particulate collects on the inlet face.<ref>[http://www.dieselemissiontechnologies.com/det/New%20Temples/Cordierite.html \"Cordierite\" (2009) Diesel Emission Technologies Inc.]</ref>\n\n===Silicon carbide wall flow filters===\nThe second most popular filter material is [[silicon carbide]], or [[SiC]]. It has a higher (2700&nbsp;\u00b0C) melting point than cordierite, however, it is not as stable thermally, making packaging an issue. Small SiC cores are made of single pieces, while larger cores are made in segments, which are separated by a special cement so that heat expansion of the core will be taken up by the cement, and not the package. SiC cores are usually more expensive than cordierite cores, however they are manufactured in similar sizes, and one can often be used to replace the other.\nSilicon carbide filter cores also look like catalytic converter cores that have had alternate channels plugged - again the plugs force the exhaust gas flow through the wall and the particulate collects on the inlet face.<ref name=ax/><ref name=sil>[http://www.dieselemissiontechnologies.com/det/New%20Temples/SiC.html \"Silicon Carbide (SiC)\" (2009) Diesel Emission Technologies Inc.]</ref>\n\nThe characteristics of the wall flow  diesel Particulate filter substrate are as follows: \nbroad band filtration (the diameters of the filtered particles are 0.2\u2013150 \u03bcm); \nhigh filtration efficiency (can be up to 95%); \nhigh refractory; \nhigh mechanical properties.\nhigh boiling point.<ref name=sil/>\n\n===Ceramic fiber filters===\nFibrous ceramic filters are made from several different types of ceramic fibers that are mixed together to form a porous media. This media can be formed into almost any shape and can be customized to suit various applications. The porosity can be controlled in order to produce high flow, lower efficiency or high efficiency lower volume filtration. Fibrous filters have an advantage over wall flow design of producing lower back pressure.\nCeramic wall-flow filters remove carbon particulates almost completely, including fine particulates less than 100 nanometers (nm) diameter with an efficiency of greater than 95% in mass and greater than 99% in number of particles over a wide range of engine operating conditions. Since the continuous flow of soot into the filter would eventually block it, it is necessary to 'regenerate' the filtration properties of the filter by burning-off the collected particulate on a regular basis. Soot particulates burn-off forms water and CO<sub>2</sub> in small quantity amounting to less than 0.05% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the engine.<ref name=ax>[http://www.axces.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=317:dpf-info&catid=140&Itemid=589 Emission Technology: DPF - Diesel Particulate Filters, Axces.eu]</ref>\n\n===Metal fiber flow-through filters===\nSome cores are made from metal fibers \u2013 generally the fibers are \"woven\" into a monolith. Such cores have the advantage that an electrical current can be passed through the monolith to heat the core for regeneration purposes, allowing the filter to regenerate at low exhaust temperatures and/or low exhaust flow rates. Metal fiber cores tend to be more expensive than cordierite or silicon carbide cores, and generally not interchangeable with them because of the electrical requirement.<ref name=ax/><ref>[http://www.dieselemissiontechnologies.com/det/New%20Temples/MetalFiberMeshFilters.html \"Metal Fiber & Mesh Filters\" (2009) Diesel Emission Technologies]</ref>\n\n===Paper===\nDisposable paper cores are used in certain specialty applications, without a regeneration strategy. [[Coal mine]]s are common users \u2013 the exhaust gas is usually first passed through a water trap to cool it, and then through the filter.<ref>[http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/8585/cdc_8585_DS1.pdf \"Best Practices For Underground Diesel Emissions\" - CDC Stacks]</ref> Paper filters are also used when a diesel machine must be used indoors for short periods of time, such as on a forklift being used to install equipment inside a store.<ref name=ax/><ref>[https://www.dieselnet.com/tginfo/abstracts.html Technology Guide, DieselNet]</ref>\n\n===Partial filters===\nThere are a variety of devices that produce over 50% particulate matter filtration, but less than 85%. Partial filters come in a variety of materials. The only commonality between them is that they produce more back pressure than a catalytic converter, and less than a diesel particulate filter. Partial filter technology is popular for retrofit.<ref>[http://www.emitec.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Bibliothek/Vortraege/2006-01-0213_FINAL.pdf Jacobs ''et al.'' (2005) \"Development of Partial Filter Technology for HDD Retrofit\", SAE International]</ref>\n\n==Maintenance==\nFilters require more maintenance than catalytic converters. Ash, a byproduct of oil consumption from normal engine operation, builds up in the filter as it cannot be converted into a gas and pass through the walls of the filter. This increases the pressure before the filter. Warnings are given to the driver before filter restriction causes an issue with drive-ability or damage to the engine or filter develop. Regular filter maintenance is a necessity.<ref name=hdt/>\n\nDPF filters go through a regeneration process which removes this soot and lowers the filter pressure. There are three types of regeneration: passive, active, and forced. Passive regeneration takes place normally while driving, when engine load and vehicle drive-cycle create temperatures that are high enough to regenerate the soot buildup on the DPF walls. Active regeneration happens while the vehicle is in use, when low engine load and lower exhaust gas temperatures inhibit the naturally occurring passive regeneration. Sensors upstream and downstream of the DPF (or a differential pressure sensor) provide readings that initiate a metered addition of fuel into the exhaust stream. There are two methods to inject fuel, either downstream injection directly into the exhaust stream, downstream of the turbo, or fuel injection into the engine cylinders on the exhaust stroke. This fuel and exhaust gas mixture passes through the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) creating temperatures high enough to burn off the accumulated soot. Once the pressure drop across the DPF lowers to a calculated value, the process ends, until the soot accumulation builds up again. This works well for vehicles that drive longer distances with few stops compared to those that perform short trips with many starts and stops. If the filter develops too much pressure then the last type of regeneration must be used - a forced regeneration. This can be accomplished in two ways. The Vehicle operator can initiate the regeneration via a dashboard mounted switch. Various signal interlocks, such as park brake applied, transmission in neutral, engine coolant temperature, and an absence of engine related fault codes are required (vary by OEM and application) for this process to initiate. When the soot accumulation reaches a level that is potentially damaging to the engine or the exhaust system, the solution involves a garage using a computer program to run a regeneration of the DPF manually.\n\n==Safety==\nIn 2011, Ford recalled 37,400 F-Series trucks with diesel engines after fuel and oil leaks caused fires in the diesel particulate filters of the trucks. No injuries occurred before the recall, though one grass fire was started.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17725959 \"Ford recalls F-150s over tailpipe fire fear\" (March 21, 2007) NBC News]</ref> A similar recall was issued for 2005-2007 Jaguar S-Type and XJ diesels, where large amounts of soot became trapped in the DPF. In affected vehicles, smoke and fire emanated from the vehicle underside, accompanied by flames from the rear of the exhaust. The heat from the fire could cause heating through the transmission tunnel to the interior, melting interior components and potentially causing interior fires.<ref>[http://www.caradvice.com.au/1872/jaguar-s-type-xj-diesel-particulate-filter-recall/ \"Jaguar S Type XJ diesel particulate filter recall\" (22 Mar 2007)  CarAdvice]</ref>\n\n==Regeneration==\n[[Image:Dosierpumpe.png|thumb|Metering pump for Diesel or additive injection, 3 L/h at 5 bar]]\n[[Image:Diesel particulate filter.png|thumb|Diagram of the regeneration]]\n[[File:Hino Standardized SCR Unit.jpg|thumb|[[Hino Motors|Hino truck]] and its [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) next to the DPF with regeneration process by the late fuel injection to control exhaust temperature to burn off soot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hino Standardized SCR Unit|url=http://www.hinoscr.com/scrtechnology/story_6.php?PHPSESSID=da323bebe58c10762bbb47df09a4bd91|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140805130141/http://www.hinoscr.com/scrtechnology/story_6.php?PHPSESSID=da323bebe58c10762bbb47df09a4bd91|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2014|publisher=Hino Motors|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The DPR Future|url=http://www.hino.com/download/86/file/Hino_DPR.pdf|publisher=Hino Motors|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>]]\nRegeneration is the process of burning off (oxidizing) the accumulated soot from the filter. This is done either passively (from the engine's exhaust heat in normal operation or by adding a catalyst to the filter) or actively introducing very high heat into the exhaust system. On-board active filter management can use a variety of strategies:<ref name=barone/>\n# Engine management to increase exhaust temperature through late fuel injection or injection during the exhaust stroke\n# Use of a fuel borne catalyst to reduce soot burn-out temperature\n# A fuel burner after the turbo to increase the exhaust temperature\n# A catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature, with after injection (HC-Doser)\n# Resistive heating coils to increase the exhaust temperature\n# [[Microwave energy]] to increase the particulate temperature\n\nAll on-board active systems use extra fuel, whether through burning to heat the DPF, or providing extra power to the DPF's electrical system, although the use of a fuel borne catalyst reduces the energy required very significantly. Typically a computer monitors one or more sensors that measure back pressure and/or temperature, and based on pre-programmed set points the computer makes decisions on when to activate the regeneration cycle. The additional fuel can be supplied by a [[metering pump]]. Running the cycle too often while keeping the back pressure in the exhaust system low will result in high fuel consumption.  Not running the regeneration cycle soon enough increases the risk of engine damage and/or uncontrolled regeneration ([[thermal runaway]]) and possible DPF failure.\n\nDiesel particulate matter burns when temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius are attained. This temperature can be reduced to somewhere in the range of 350 to 450 degrees Celsius by use of a fuel borne catalyst. The actual temperature of soot burn-out will depend on the chemistry employed. The start of combustion causes a further increase in temperature. In some cases, in the absence of a fuel borne catalyst, the combustion of the particulate matter can raise temperatures above the structural integrity threshold of the filter material, which can cause catastrophic failure of the substrate. Various strategies have been developed to limit this possibility. Note that unlike a spark-ignited engine, which typically has less than 0.5% oxygen in the exhaust gas stream before the emission control device(s), diesel engines have a very high ratio of oxygen available. While the amount of available oxygen makes fast regeneration of a filter possible, it also contributes to runaway regeneration problems.\n\nSome applications use off-board regeneration. Off-board regeneration requires operator intervention (i.e. the machine is either plugged into a wall/floor mounted regeneration station, or the filter is removed from the machine and placed in the regeneration station). Off-board regeneration is not suitable for on-road vehicles, except in situations where the vehicles are parked in a central depot when not in use. Off-board regeneration is mainly used in industrial and mining applications. Coal mines (with the attendant explosion risk from coal damp) use off-board regeneration if non-disposable filters are installed, with the regeneration stations sited in an area where non-permissible machinery is allowed.\n\nMany [[forklift]]s may also use off-board regeneration \u2013 typically mining machinery and other machinery that spend their operational lives in one location, which makes having a stationary regeneration station practical. In situations where the filter is physically removed from the machine for regeneration there is also the advantage of being able to inspect the filter core on a daily basis (DPF cores for non-road applications are typically sized to be usable for one shift - so regeneration is a daily occurrence).<ref>[http://www.deep.org/reports/stobiedpf.pdf Bruce R.

In the original Japanese version, Tohru Naruse goes by his nickname Naruchiyo and is often associated with a monkey, serving as a mascot to the team. Nate is a perennial bench-warmer. Lacking in both coolness and talent, he is the most unlikely basketball player. But through persistence and support from his friends, Nate slowly teaches himself the art of basketball. In the process, he slowly builds up his confidence and begins to realize his dream of success on the high school basketball court. He also develops feelings for Mizzy Kusuda, an ex-classmate, but later falls for another girl named Tomomi Koizumi. His signature move in basketball is known as the airwalk. Nate incorporated many flashy moves into his game, such as his signature airwalk, evolved lay-up (double-clutch) miracle J, and his invincible lay-ups. Every single one of these skills are pulled off subconsciously, indicating a preternatural natural talent for the sport.\n** Thompson states that Nate is \"a lovable, sincere little guy\".<ref name=Thompson/>\n*'''Mizzy Kusuda''' ({{nihongo|'''Mizuki Kusuda'''|\u6960\u7530 \u307f\u305a\u304d|''Kusuda Mizuki''}} Japanese version) -  Mizuki is Nate's ex-classmate and close friend when he was in the primary school. She helps Nate succeed, teaching him the down and dirty side to street ball: no rules, no fouls, and no crying, she teaches him how to win. Eventually, she revealed to Shurman that she was in love with him ever since she first met him under his street name, which was Shoe. Her love was not returned, however, with Shurman saying that Shoe was gone.\n*'''Kyle \"Oz\" Ozman''' ({{nihongo|'''K\u014dsuke Ozaki'''|\u5c3e\u5d0e \u6d69\u4ecb|''Ozaki K\u014dsuke''}} Japanese version) - Kyle is a tough kid, high school drop-out with an axe to grind with everyone. But often his bark is worse than his bite. He and Nate are the only two players in the history of street hoops to ever score on the powerhouse team, 3-Slam. When they get together with Mizzy, Team Scratch is born. Oz is a hoodlum from the streets. He hangs with a rough crowd, and he brings the same attitude to the courts. Nate, his own teammate, is even scared of him. Throughout the series, Kyle has a crush on Mizzy, which eventually develops into love. He is also not very good when it comes to girls.\n*{{nihongo|'''Masahiro Sawamura'''|\u6fa4\u6751 \u6b63\u535a|''Sawamura Masahiro''}} - He is also a member of Scratch. He is Naruse's best friend. Sawamura plays street basketball to earn money as he lives by himself. He likes money very much and as a result turns towards gambling. His affinity to risk explains his constant attempts to sink only the three-point shots. He stole a score from Three Men by his tricks. He is the best three-point shooter and called a \"Miracle Shooter\". He is not good in stamina, but he is very good at tricks. His famous nickname is Fox (Kitsune) Guy, as he is really tricky and loves gambling. He is a clever guy too. His only weaknesses are money and ghosts.

In the original Japanese version, Tohru Naruse goes by his nickname Naruchiyo and is often associated with a monkey, serving as a mascot to the team. Nate is a perennial bench-warmer. Lacking in both coolness and talent, he is the most unlikely basketball player. But through persistence and support from his friends, Nate slowly teaches himself the art of basketball. In the process, he slowly builds up his confidence and begins to realize his dream of success on the high school basketball court. He also develops feelings for Mizzy Kusuda, an ex-classmate, but later falls for another girl named Tomomi Koizumi. His signature move in basketball is known as the airwalk. Nate incorporated many flashy moves into his game, such as his signature airwalk, evolved lay-up (double-clutch) miracle J, and his invincible lay-ups. Every single one of these skills are pulled off subconsciously, indicating a preternatural natural talent for the sport.\n** Thompson states that Nate is \"a lovable, sincere little guy\".<ref name=Thompson/>\n*'''Mizzy Kusuda''' ({{nihongo|'''Mizuki Kusuda'''|\u6960\u7530 \u307f\u305a\u304d|''Kusuda Mizuki''}} Japanese version) -  Mizuki is Nate's ex-classmate and close friend when he was in the primary school. She helps Nate succeed, teaching him the down and dirty side to street ball: no rules, no fouls, and no crying, she teaches him how to win. Eventually, she revealed to Shurman that she was in love with him ever since she first met him under his street name, which was Shoe. Her love was not returned, however, with Shurman saying that Shoe was gone.\n*'''Kyle \"Oz\" Ozman''' ({{nihongo|'''K\u014dsuke Ozaki'''|\u5c3e\u5d0e \u6d69\u4ecb|''Ozaki K\u014dsuke''}} Japanese version) - Kyle is a tough kid, high school drop-out with an axe to grind with everyone. But often his bark is worse than his bite. He and Nate are the only two players in the history of street hoops to ever score on the powerhouse team, 3-Slam. When they get together with Mizzy, Team Scratch is born. Oz is a hoodlum from the streets. He hangs with a rough crowd, and he brings the same attitude to the courts. Nate, his own teammate, is even scared of him. Throughout the series, Kyle has a crush on Mizzy, which eventually develops into love. He is also not very good when it comes to girls.\n*{{nihongo|'''Masahiro Sawamura'''|\u6fa4\u6751 \u6b63\u535a|''Sawamura Masahiro''}} - He is also a member of Scratch. He is Naruse's best friend. Sawamura plays street basketball to earn money as he lives by himself. He likes money very much and as a result turns towards gambling. His affinity to risk explains his constant attempts to sink only the three-point shots. He stole a score from Three Men by his tricks. He is the best three-point shooter and called a \"Miracle Shooter\". He is not good in stamina, but he is very good at tricks. His famous nickname is Fox (Kitsune) Guy, as he is really tricky and loves gambling. He is a clever guy too. His only weaknesses are money and ghosts. In a flashback, it is revealed that Sawamura's father abandoned him and he was soon picked up by a Yakuza member named Fujita. Fujita taught him how to fight, including the ways of the streets. After Fujita was shot by one of his own, he was captured and confined, leaving Sawamura to live on his own.\n* '''Shurman Shuji''' ({{nihongo|'''Sh\u016bji Sakurai'''|\u685c\u4e95 \u4fee\u53f8|''Sakurai Sh\u016bji''}}) - Shurman is considered to be a \"big brother\" in the Johnan team.
