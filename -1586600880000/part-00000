[[IMAX#Technical aspects|IMAX cameras and film stock]] are rarely used for mainstream films; the cameras are heavy and the [[film stock]] is expensive. However, since 2002, some [[feature film]]s shot with digital cameras or on regular [[35mm movie film|35mm]] film stock have undergone IMAX Digital Media Remastering (DMR) processing for showing both in [[70 mm film|70mm]] IMAX theatres and in Digital IMAX theatres.\n\nSeveral animated titles (''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', ''[[The Lion King (1994 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Falling in Love Again (2003 film)|Falling in Love Again]]'', ''[[CyberWorld]], [[Fly Me to the Moon (film)|Fly Me to the Moon 3D]]'', and ''[[Santa vs. the Snowman 3D]]'') were released in 70mm IMAX prints; however, they were not subject to DMR processing.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMAX and IMAX DMR films|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/process/imax/imax_dmr.htm|accessdate=2011-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102093213/http://www.in70mm.com/library/process/imax/imax_dmr.htm|archive-date=2011-01-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSome titles such as ''[[Skyfall]]'', ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'', and ''[[1917 (2019 film)|1917]]''  have been displayed on IMAX screens but were not subject to DMR processing as [[Roger Deakins]], the cinematographer on all three films, did his own custom transfers on all three films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerdeakins.com/film-talk/blade-runner-2049-2d-or-3d/|title=Blade Runner 2049: 2D or 3D? \u2013 Film Talk \u2013 Roger A.

First, the FSB was placed under direct control of the President by a decree issued on 17 May 2000.<ref name=\"schneider\"/> The internal structure of the agency was reformed by a decree signed on 17 June 2000. In the resulting structure, the FSB was to have a director, a first deputy director and nine other deputy directors, including one possible state secretary and the chiefs of six departments: Economic Security Department, Counterintelligence Department, Organizational and Personnel Service, Department of activity provision, Department for Analysis, Forecasting and Strategic Planning, Department for Protection of the Constitutional System and the Fight against Terrorism.\n\nIn 2003, the agency's responsibilities were considerably widened. The [[Border Guard Service of Russia]], with its staff of 210,000, was integrated to the FSB via a decree was signed on 11 March 2003. The merger was completed by 1 July 2003. In addition, The Federal Agency of Government Communication and Information (FAPSI) was abolished, and the FSB was granted a major part of its functions, while other parts went to the [[Ministry of Defense (Russia)|Ministry of Defense]].<ref name=\"schneider\"/> Among the reasons for this strengthening of the FSB were the enhanced need for security after increased terror attacks against Russian civilians starting with the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]]; the need to end the permanent infighting between the FSB, FAPSI and the Border Guards due to their overlapping functions; and the need for more efficient response to migration, drug trafficking and illegal arms trading. It has also been pointed out that the FSB was the only power base of the new president, and the restructuring therefore strengthened Putin's position (see [[Political groups under Vladimir Putin's presidency]]).<ref name=\"schneider\"/>\n\nOn 28 June 2004 in a speech to high-ranking FSB officers, Putin emphasized three major tasks of the agency: neutralizing foreign espionage, safeguarding economic and financial security of the country and combating organized crime.<ref name=\"schneider\"/> In September 2006, the FSB was shaken by a major reshuffle, which, combined with some earlier reassignments (most remarkably, those of FSB Deputy Directors [[Yury Zaostrovtsev]] and Vladimir Anisimov in 2004 and 2005, respectively), were widely believed to be linked to the [[Three Whales Corruption Scandal]] that had slowly unfolded since 2000.

However, their performance was criticised due to the high number of hostage casualties. In 2006, the FSB scored a major success in its counter-terrorist efforts when it successfully killed [[Shamil Basayev]], the mastermind behind the Beslan tragedy and several other high-profile terrorist acts. According to the FSB, the operation was planned over six months and made possible due to the FSB's increased activities in foreign countries that were supplying arms to the terrorists. Basayev was tracked via the surveillance of this arms trafficking.

The ancient ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' mention yoga postures, [[asana]]s, only briefly, as [[meditation seat]]s. Medieval [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]] made use of a small number of asanas alongside other techniques such as [[pranayama]], [[shatkarma]]s, and [[mudra]]s, but it was despised and almost extinct by the start of the 20th century. At that time, the revival of postural yoga was at first driven by [[Indian nationalism]]. Advocates such as [[Yogendra]] and [[Kuvalayananda]] made yoga acceptable in the 1920s, treating it as a medical subject. From the 1930s, the \"father of modern yoga\" [[Krishnamacharya]] developed a vigorous postural yoga, influenced by gymnastics, with transitions ([[vinyasa]]s) that allowed one pose to flow into the next. \n\nKrishnamacharya's pupils [[K. Pattabhi Jois]] and [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] brought yoga to the West and developed it further, founding their own schools and [[Yoga teacher training|training yoga teachers]]. Once in the West, yoga quickly became mixed with other activities, becoming less spiritual and more energetic as well as commercial. \n\nWesternized postural yoga returned to India to rejoin the many forms already in the country, transformed by the [[pizza effect]] on its round trip. Western yoga tourists, attracted initially by [[The Beatles in India|The Beatles' 1968 visit to India]], came to study yoga in centres such as [[Rishikesh]] and [[Mysore]]. From 2015, India, led by Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], held an annual [[International Day of Yoga]], the [[Armed Forces of India|armed forces]] and [[Civil Services of India|civil service]] being joined in mass demonstrations by members of the public.\n\n==Ancient origins==\n[[File:Patanjali Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Patanjali|Pata\u00f1jali]] seated in a [[meditation seat|meditation asana]], [[Siddhasana]]]]\n{{main|Yoga}}\n\n[[Yoga]]'s ancient [[Yoga (philosophy)|spiritual and philosophical goal]] was to unite the human spirit with the [[\u012b\u015bvara|Divine]].<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams, Monier]], \"Yoga\", ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.</ref> It was largely a [[meditation]]al practice; classical yoga such as is described in the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', written around the second century, mentions yoga postures, [[asana]]s, only as [[meditation seat]]s, stating simply that the posture should be easy and comfortable.<ref>\u0100ra\u1e47ya, Harihar\u0101nanda (1983), ''Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali'', [[State University of New York Press]], {{ISBN|978-0873957281}}, page 228 with footnotes</ref> The branch of yoga that makes use of physical postures is [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]].

That changed when [[Yogendra]] (from 1918) and [[Kuvalayananda]] (from 1924) began to teach yoga as a means of attaining physical wellbeing, and to study its medical effects. They accordingly emphasised the physical practices of Ha\u1e6dha yoga, the asanas and yoga breathing ([[pranayama]]), at the expense of its more esoteric practices such as purifications ([[shatkarma]]s), the mudras intended to manipulate the vital forces, and indeed any mention of the subtle body or liberation.{{sfn|Goldberg|2016|pp=16-43, 88-141}}{{sfn|Alter|2004|pp=73-108}} They were soon followed by [[Krishnamacharya]] at the Mysore Palace; he experimented with many new yoga asanas and transitions ([[vinyasa]]s) between them, creating a dynamic style of postural yoga.{{sfn|Goldberg|2016|pp=208-248}} Krishnamacharya observed and adjusted each pupil in an individualised approach to teaching, which later became known as [[viniyoga]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ruiz |first=Fernando Pag\u00e9s |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/465 |title=Krishnamacharya's Legacy |journal=YogaJournal |issue=May/June 2001 |date=May 2001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Mohan |first=A.

The ancient ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' mention yoga postures, [[asana]]s, only briefly, as [[meditation seat]]s. Medieval [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]] made use of a small number of asanas alongside other techniques such as [[pranayama]], [[shatkarma]]s, and [[mudra]]s, but it was despised and almost extinct by the start of the 20th century. At that time, the revival of postural yoga was at first driven by [[Indian nationalism]]. Advocates such as [[Yogendra]] and [[Kuvalayananda]] made yoga acceptable in the 1920s, treating it as a medical subject. From the 1930s, the \"father of modern yoga\" [[Krishnamacharya]] developed a vigorous postural yoga, influenced by gymnastics, with transitions ([[vinyasa]]s) that allowed one pose to flow into the next. \n\nKrishnamacharya's pupils [[K. Pattabhi Jois]] and [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] brought yoga to the West and developed it further, founding their own schools and [[Yoga teacher training|training yoga teachers]]. Once in the West, yoga quickly became mixed with other activities, becoming less spiritual and more energetic as well as commercial. \n\nWesternized postural yoga returned to India to rejoin the many forms already in the country, transformed by the [[pizza effect]] on its round trip. Western yoga tourists, attracted initially by [[The Beatles in India|The Beatles' 1968 visit to India]], came to study yoga in centres such as [[Rishikesh]] and [[Mysore]]. From 2015, India, led by Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], held an annual [[International Day of Yoga]], the [[Armed Forces of India|armed forces]] and [[Civil Services of India|civil service]] being joined in mass demonstrations by members of the public.\n\n==Ancient origins==\n[[File:Patanjali Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Patanjali|Pata\u00f1jali]] seated in a [[meditation seat|meditation asana]], [[Siddhasana]]]]\n{{main|Yoga}}\n\n[[Yoga]]'s ancient [[Yoga (philosophy)|spiritual and philosophical goal]] was to unite the human spirit with the [[\u012b\u015bvara|Divine]].<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams, Monier]], \"Yoga\", ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.</ref> It was largely a [[meditation]]al practice; classical yoga such as is described in the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', written around the second century, mentions yoga postures, [[asana]]s, only as [[meditation seat]]s, stating simply that the posture should be easy and comfortable.<ref>\u0100ra\u1e47ya, Harihar\u0101nanda (1983), ''Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali'', [[State University of New York Press]], {{ISBN|978-0873957281}}, page 228 with footnotes</ref> The branch of yoga that makes use of physical postures is [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]].

Madonna made music videos a marketing tool and was among the first to make them an artform. Many of her songs topped charts around the world, such as: \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\", \"[[La Isla Bonita]]\" and \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\". After the [[Like a Prayer (album)|''Like a Prayer'' album]] in 1989, Madonna was named artist of the decade by a number of magazines and awards.  \"I thought the eighties was fabulous,\" she said, \"and I'm sure [[Boy George]] would agree with me.\"<ref>{{cite journal|first= Danny |last= Eccleston |title= Sexy Mother |magazine= [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date= March 1998 |page= 90|url = http://imagem-madonna.blogspot.com/2018/02/sexy-mother-q-magazine-1998.html|via = Imagem-Madonna}}</ref>\n\n[[Whitney Houston]] was one of the best selling female artists of the decade in the US, behind [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].

She also became the first and only artist to earn seven consecutive number-one songs on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\n[[Paula Abdul]] hit it big in 1988. With her debut album ''[[Forever Your Girl]]'', she was the first female to have four number one singles from a debut album (only [[The Jackson 5]] had done the same with their debut). She had five top ten hits from the album.\n\nBy 1980, the [[disco]] genre, largely dependent on [[orchestra]]s, was replaced by a lighter [[synthpop]] production, which subsequently fuelled dance music.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, [[teen pop]] experienced its first wave, with bands and artists including [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]], [[Debbie Gibson]], [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]], [[New Edition]], [[Stacey Q]], [[The Bangles]], [[New Kids on the Block]], Madonna, George Michael, [[Laura Branigan]], [[Boy George]] and others becoming teen idols.\n\nProminent American [[urban pop]] acts of the 1980s include [[Tina Turner]], [[Lionel Richie]], Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston and [[Diana Ross]]. African American artists like [[Lionel Richie]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] became some of the decade's biggest stars. Their hit albums included ''[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]'', ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'', and ''[[Sign \"O\" the Times]]'' by Prince and ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', and ''[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]'' by Richie.\n\nPrince was the decade's most prolific artist, not just by virtue of being the top charting artist in the US and worldwide. He was responsible for artists such as [[Vanity 6]], for whom he wrote the dance chart topping \"Nasty Girl\"; [[Morris Day]] and the Time, for whom he wrote the top 20 \"Jungle Love\"; [[Sheila E.]], for whom he wrote the top ten song \"[[The Glamorous Life]]\" and number 11 \"[[A Love Bizarre]]\"; and [[Wendy & Lisa]] and [[Apollonia 6]]. He wrote \"[[I Feel for You]]\" for [[Chaka Khan]], which won him a Grammy for best R&B song; \"[[Sugar Walls]]\" for [[Sheena Easton]]; and as well as doing a duet with \"[[U Got the Look|U Got The Look\"]], he wrote \"[[Manic Monday]]\", a number two pop hit for the Bangles. Artists that covered his music included [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], who brought his version of the song \"[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]\" into the top 40 for the second time in the decade. [[Melissa Morgan]] brought her cover of \"[[Do Me, Baby]]\" to the top of the R&B charts in 1986. Other notable artists that covered Prince during the 1980s were [[The Pointer Sisters]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]].<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/15-great-prince-songs-that-were-hits-for-other-artists-20160421.</ref> He also won an Academy Award for the song \"[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]\".

Prince had four number one singles and 14 top ten hits on the Hot 100 Chart.\n\nLionel Richie teamed with [[Diana Ross]] to record one of the decade's biggest hits [[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]], which top the Billboard charts for nine weeks. Other songs by Richie, such as [[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]] and [[Hello]] also top the charts, he would have a total of five number one hits, and 13 top ten singles. [[Diana Ross]] brought [[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]] to the top spot in 1980, she would have two number one singles, and eight top ten hits in the decade. [[Tina Turner]] would top the charts with \"What's Love Got to Do With It\", she scored a total of six top ten singles. [[Donna Summer]]'s [[She Works Hard for the Money]] was a continuation of the feminist movement started in the 70s, and a rally cry for those who worked hard and wanted to be treated fairly. She would have five top ten singles in the decade.\n\n[[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''Born In the USA'', [[AC/DC]]'s ''Back in Black'', [[Def Leppard]]'s ''Hysteria'', and [[Bon Jovi]]'s ''Slippery When Wet'' were some of the decade's biggest-selling albums on the Billboard Top 200 chart.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s American pop singer [[Cyndi Lauper]] was considered{{By whom}} the \"Voice of the [[MTV]] Generation of '80s\" and so different visual style that made the world for teens. Her first two albums ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' (1986) were critically and commercially successful, spawning the hits, \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\", \"[[She Bop]]\", \"[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]\", \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".\n\nSeveral British artists made the successful transition to pop during the 1980s and saw great commercial success, such as [[David Bowie]], [[Phil Collins]], [[John Lennon]], [[Billy Ocean]], [[Sheena Easton]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Many British pop bands also dominated the American charts in the early 1980s. Many of them became popular due to their constant exposure on [[MTV]], these bands included [[The Human League]], [[Culture Club]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Wham!]]. Between the four, they have had 9 U.S. number ones with hits like \"[[Don't You Want Me]]\", \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\", \"[[The Reflex]]\" and \"[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]\" In the later part of the decade [[Rick Astley]], [[George Michael]] as a solo artist, [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], and [[Fine Young Cannibals]] all found chart success.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, Australian artists like [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Men at Work]], [[Air Supply]] and [[AC/DC]] all had chart success, later in the decade [[INXS]] scored hits. [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s hit [[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]] would top the Hot 100 for 10 weeks and be the decade's biggest hit in the US; she would have six top ten singles during the 80s.\n\nAmerican artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Kool & the Gang]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[John Mellencamp]], then known as John Cougar, ruled the charts throughout the decade in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/list/abyss89/who-ruled-the-80s_the-200-biggest-artists-of-the-decade-in-the-usa/|title=Who ruled the 80's:The 200 biggest artists of the decade in the USA|website=RateYourMusic}}</ref> Prince, Madonna, Jackson, Joel and Springsteen along with [[U2]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Police]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Eurythmics]] achieved tremendous success worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://tsort.info/music/faq_decade_artists.htm|title = Who were the most successful artists of each decade?|website = Tsort|first = Steve|last = Harwin|date = 13 September 2019}}</ref>  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== {{anchor|North American rock}} Rock ===\nIn the 1980s, rock music was more precisely defined and split up into multiple subgenres.\n\n==== Hard rock and heavy/glam metal ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n[[Image:Metallica live London 2003-12-19 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Metallica]] in concert, 2003]]\nBeginning in 1983 and peaking in success in 1986-1990, the decade saw the resurgence of [[hard rock]] music and the emergence of its [[glam metal]] subgenre. Bands such as [[AC/DC]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Ratt (band)|Ratt]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Dokken]], [[Whitesnake]], and [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] were among the most popular acts of the decade. The 1980s saw the emergence of wildly popular hard rock band [[Guns N' Roses]] and the successful comebacks of [[Aerosmith]] and [[Alice Cooper]] in the late 1980s. The success of hard rock act [[Van Halen]] spanned throughout the entire decade, first with singer [[David Lee Roth]] and later with [[Sammy Hagar]]. Queen, which had expanded its music to experimental and crossover genres in the early 1980s, returned to guitar-driven hard rock with ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' in 1989. Additionally, a few women managed to achieve stardom in the 1980s hard rock scene: [[Pat Benatar]] and Ann and Nancy Wilson of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], who had been around since the mid 1970s, are prime examples of female success in hard rock, and so are both ex-[[The Runaways|Runaways]] [[Joan Jett]] and [[Lita Ford]].\n\nThe [[arena rock]] trend of the 1970s continued in the 1980s with bands like [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[Aerosmith]].\n\nTraditionally associated (and often confused) with hard rock, heavy metal was also extremely popular throughout the decade, with [[Ozzy Osbourne]] achieving success during his solo career; bands like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]] were also widely popular British acts. [[Speed metal]] pioneer [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] maintained its popularity through the releases of several albums.\n[[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more extreme, aggressive Metal subgenres: [[thrash metal]] broke his arm into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Megadeth]]. By the late 1980s, [[Metallica]] would achieve mainstream success and would become one of the best selling music artists of all time. Other styles like [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] would remain a [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena.\n\nThe decade also saw the emergence of a string of guitar virtuosi: [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Jason Becker]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] achieved international recognition for their skills. While considerably less numerous, [[bass guitar]] virtuosi also gained momentum in the 1980s: [[Geddy Lee]] (of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] [[Billy Sheehan]] (of [[David Lee Roth]] and [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]] fame), [[Cliff Burton]] (of [[Metallica]]) and alternative/funk metal bassist [[Les Claypool]] (of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] fame) became famous during that period. Iron Maiden founder and bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] has also been praised numerous times for his galloping style of bass playing.\n\nBoth hard rock and heavy metal were extremely popular live genres and bands toured extensively around the globe.\n\n==== Alternative rock ====\n[[File:R.E.M., Belgium, 1985.jpg|thumb|right|230px|One of the first alternative rock bands, [[R.E.M.]] relied on [[campus radio|college radio]] airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream.]]\n\nBy 1984, a majority of groups signed to [[independent record labels]] were mining from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper rational post-punk years.<ref>Reynolds, p. 392-93.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, alternative rock was mainly an underground phenomena. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily relegated to [[independent record labels]], [[fanzines]] and [[college radio]] stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. \"[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/|pure_url=yes}} American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk]\".

R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/> Alternative and [[indie pop]] movements sprang up in other parts of the world, from the [[Paisley Underground]] of Los Angeles ([[The Bangles]], [[Rain Parade]]) to Scotland ([[Aztec Camera]], [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]), Australia ([[The Church (band)|The Church]], [[The Triffids]]), and New Zealand's [[Dunedin sound]] ([[The Clean]], [[The Chills]]).\n\nAmerican indie record labels [[SST Records]], [[Twin/Tone Records]], [[Touch and Go Records]], and [[Dischord Records]] presided over the shift from the [[hardcore punk]] that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.<ref>Reynolds, p. 390</ref> [[Music of Minnesota|Minnesota]] bands [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] and [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/>\n\nBy the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop ([[They Might Be Giants]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]), to [[noise rock]] ([[Big Black]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]]) to [[industrial rock]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Nine Inch Nails]]) and to early [[Grunge]] ([[Mudhoney]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]).

Rock and even [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Peter Case]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Paul Westerberg]] transitioned to careers as solo singers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with [[Suzanne Vega]] whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[k.d. lang]] and [[Tori Amos]], who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market.\n\n==== Other trends ====\nVarious older rock bands made a comeback. Bands originating from the early to mid-1960s such as [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Kinks]] had hits with \"[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]\", \"[[Come Dancing (song)|Come Dancing]]\" and \"Do It Again\". Bands with popularity in the mid-1970s such as the [[Steve Miller Band]] and [[Steely Dan]] also had hits with \"[[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band song)|Abracadabra]]\" and \"[[Hey Nineteen]]\". Singer and songwriter [[Bruce Springsteen]] released his blockbuster album ''[[Born In The USA]]'', which produced a record-tying 7 hit singles. [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[George Thorogood]] sparked a revival of [[Atomic blues]] and [[Blues rock]]. Massively successful hard rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] disbanded after drummer [[John Bonham]]'s 1980 death, while contemporaries [[AC/DC]] continued to have success after the death of former frontman [[Bon Scott]]. [[Country rock]] saw a decline after [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s 1977 plane crash and the 1980 disbanding of the genre's most successful band, [[Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]. [[The Grateful Dead]] had their biggest hit in band history with \"[[Touch of Grey]]\". [[The Who]] managed to provide the hit songs \"[[You Better You Bet]]\" and \"[[Eminence Front]]\" before burning out after the death of their drummer [[Keith Moon]].\n\n[[Hardcore punk]] flourished throughout the early to mid-1980s, with bands leading the genre such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], and [[Dead Kennedys]] amongst others. It began to wane in the latter half of the decade, with the [[New York hardcore|New York hardcore scene]] dominating the genre. However, it experience a jumpstart in the late 1980s with emerging bands such as [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]] and [[Green Day]] that would define not just the so-called \"East Bay\" sound, but impact the next decade's punk and alternative sound. Some of which is still around today.\n\nThe 1980s proved a difficult time for many 1960s-70s veterans, many of them unable or unwilling to adapt to current trends. Music icons such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], and [[The Rolling Stones]] released albums that were often poor quality and critically panned as they attempted to grapple with the changing times. MTV in particular was a problem for many artists, as it put a premium on youthfulness, good looks, and showmanship. Artists who became strongly associated with disco music also fell from grace and were often banned from radio play.\n\n=== Contemporary R&B ===\n{{See also|Contemporary R&B}}\nContemporary R&B originated in the 1980s, when musicians started adding [[disco]]-like beats, high-tech production, and elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] to [[rhythm and blues]], making it more danceable and modern.<ref name=\"Rhythms and Rhymes\">{{Citation | last = Gazzah | first = Miriam | title = Rhythms and Rhymes of Life: music and Identification Processes of Dutch-Moroccan Youth | publisher = Amsterdam University Press | year = 2008 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-90-8964-062-8}}</ref> The top mainstream [[R&B]] artists of 1980s included [[Michael Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], [[James Ingram]], [[The S.O.S.

Such music was originally born of and popularized via regional [[nightclub]] scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in [[discoth\u00e8ques]] as well as the [[rave]] scene.\n\n[[House music]] is a style of [[electronic dance music]] which originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Fikentscher\">{{citation|title=Youth\u2019s sonic forces: The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon|last=Fikentscher|first=Kai|journal=[[UNESCO Courier]]|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=July\u2013August 2000|page=45}}</ref> House music was strongly influenced by elements of [[soul music|soul]]- and [[funk]]-infused varieties of [[disco]]. Club play from pioneering DJs like [[Ron Hardy]] and [[Lil Louis]], local dance music record shops, and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station [[WVAZ|WBMX-FM]] helped popularize house music in Chicago and among visiting DJs & producers from [[Detroit]]. Trax Records and DJ International Records, local labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music outside of Chicago. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop & dance music worldwide during the 1990s.\n\nIt has been widely cited that the initial blueprint for [[techno]] was developed during the mid-1980s in Detroit, [[Michigan]], by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Kevin Saunderson]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]] (the so-called \"Belleville Three\"), and [[Eddie Fowlkes]], all of whom attended school together at [[Belleville High School (Belleville, Michigan)|Belleville High]], near Detroit.<ref>Brewster 2006:340\u2013359</ref><ref>Cosgrove 1988a.</ref><ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN>Sicko 1999</ref><ref>Reynolds 1999:12\u201340</ref> Though initially conceived as party music that was played on daily mixed radio programs and played at parties given by cliquish, Detroit high school clubs, it has grown to be a global phenomenon.\n\n=== Country music ===\n[[Image:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Kenny Rogers]], 2004]]\nAs the 1980s dawned, [[country pop|pop-influenced country music]] was the dominant style, through such acts as [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[T.G. Sheppard]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Anne Murray]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. The 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', a romantic comedy starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Debra Winger]], spawned a successful soundtrack album featuring pop-styled country songs, including \"[[Lookin' for Love]]\" by [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]], \"[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]\" by the [[Charlie Daniels Band]], \"[[Could I Have This Dance]]\" by Murray and \"[[Love the World Away]]\" by Rogers. The songs, and the movie itself, resulted in an early 1980s boom in pop-styled country music, and the era is sometimes known as the \"Urban Cowboy Movement\".\n\nBy the mid-1980s, country music audiences were beginning to tire of country pop. Although some pop-country artists continued to record and release successful songs and albums, the genre in general was beginning to suffer. By 1985, a ''New York Times'' article declared country music \"dead\". However, by this time, several newcomers were working behind the scenes to reverse this perception.\n\nThe year 1986 brought forth several new artists who performed in traditional country styles, such as honky-tonk. This sparked the \"new traditionalist\" movement, or return to traditional country music. The most successful of these artists included [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Ricky Van Shelton]] and [[Holly Dunn]]. Also, artists like [[Kathy Mattea]] and [[Keith Whitley]], both of whom had been performing for a few years prior, had their first major hits during 1986; Mattea was more folk-styled, while Whitley was pure honky-tonk. But the new traditionalist movement had already taken hold as early as 1981, when newcomers such as [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[George Strait]] had their first big hits. [[Reba McEntire]] had her first big hit in 1980 followed by 15 other number one hit singles during the decade. In addition, songwriter\u2013guitarist and [[Chet Atkins]] prodigy [[Steve Wariner]] also emerged as a popular act starting in the early 1980s. Another boom period for newcomers with new traditionalist styles was 1989, when artists such as [[Clint Black]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[Lorrie Morgan]] and [[Travis Tritt]] had their first big hits. It was Whitley who was seen as being one of the torchbearers of the new traditionalist movement, thanks to his pure honky-tonk style in the vein of Lefty Frizzell and others, and his star power was set to rise into the 1990s; however, Whitley was a known heavy drinker, and it was alcohol poisoning that ended his life in May 1989, just weeks after a song about triumph over personal demons -- \"[[I'm No Stranger to the Rain]]\"\u2014became a huge country hit. In keeping with the neotraditonalist movement, [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Emmylou Harris]] teamed up to release 1987's Platinum selling ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album.  Composed mostly of traditional songs set to acoustic arrangements, the album won a Grammy in 1988 for best country collaboration.\n\nVocal duos were also popular because of their harmonies, most notably [[The Bellamy Brothers]] and [[The Judds]]. Several of the Bellamy Brothers' songs included double-entendre' laden [[hook (rhetoric)|hooks]], on songs such as \"Do You Love as Good As You Look\". The Judds, a mother-and-daughter duo, combined elements of contemporary pop and traditional country music on songs such as \"Why Not Me\" and \"[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)]]\".\n\nCountry music groups and bands continued to rise in popularity during the 1980s. The most successful of the lot was [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], a [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]]-based band that blended traditional and pop country sounds with [[southern rock]]. Their concerts regularly sold out, while their single releases regularly reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles|Hot Country Songs]] chart. In 1989, Alabama was named the Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. By the end of the 1980s, the group had sold more than 24 million albums in the United States.\n\nRanking just behind Alabama in popularity, as far as groups were concerned, were [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] and [[The Statler Brothers]], both four-part harmony groups with gospel and country-pop stylings. The popularity of those three groups sparked a boom in new groups and bands, and by the end of the 1980s, fans were listening to such acts as [[Restless Heart]] and [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], the latter which previously enjoyed success with the pop hit \"[[Kiss You All Over]]\".\n\nDespite the prevailing pop country sound, enduring acts from the 1970s and earlier continued to enjoy great success with fans. [[George Jones]], one of the longest-running acts of the time, recorded several successful singles, including the critically acclaimed \"[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]]\". [[Conway Twitty]] continued to have a series of No. 1 hits, with 1986's \"Desperado Love\" becoming his 40th chart-topper on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart, a record that stood for nearly 20 years. The movie ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' profiled the life of [[Loretta Lynn]] (with [[Sissy Spacek]] in the lead role), while [[Willie Nelson]] also had a series of acting credits. [[Dolly Parton]] had much success in the 1980s, with several leading movie roles, two No. 1 albums and 13 number one hits, and having many successful tours; she also teamed up with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1987 for the multi-plaitnum ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album. Others who had been around for a while and continued to have great success were [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\nIn addition to newcomer Whitley, top [[classic country]] and influential performers who died during the decade included [[Red Sovine]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[Merle Travis]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Wynn Stewart]] and [[Tex Williams]]. Although not directly associated with country music, [[Roy Orbison]], a favorite of many country music fans and whose styles wound up being influential with many newcomers, died in 1988.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Music of the United Kingdom (1980s)||Neue Deutsche Welle}}\n\n=== {{anchor|European rock}} Rock ===\n\n==== Post-punk ====\n\nSome of the most successful [[post-punk]] bands at the beginning of the decade, such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[The Psychedelic Furs]], also continued their success during the 1980s.

Even though The Police had their roots in post punk, their eventual success (four consecutive UK number one studio albums) and mega-stardom came from being able to pack the biggest stadium rock venues such as [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], the [[Oakland Coliseum]] and the [[Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3|Maracan\u00e3]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Aside from U2, they are the only other band with post punk origins to go on and achieve the kind of global success they did.

The sounds of synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s as well as replacing disco in dance clubs in Europe.\n\nOther successful synthpop artists of this era included [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]], [[Soft Cell]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Gary Numan]], [[The Human League]], [[Thomas Dolby]], [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]], [[Art of Noise]], [[Heaven 17]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]], [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[Thompson Twins]], [[Visage (band)|Visage]], [[Ultravox]], [[Kajagoogoo]], [[Eurythmics]], [[a-ha]], [[Telex (band)|Telex]], [[Real Life (band)|Real Life]], [[Erasure]], [[Camouflage (band)|Camouflage]], [[London Boys]], [[Modern Talking]], [[Bananarama]], [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Latin America ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Pop ===\nThe 1980s gave rise to the teenage groups [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Timbiriche]], and [[Los Chicos]], as well as emerging teenage stars such as [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandra \u00c1valos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enelbrasero.com/2014/11/04/alejandra-avalos-es-madrina-de-lujo-en-la-plaza-de-las-estrellas-fotos/|title=Alejandra \u00c1valos es madrina delujo en plaza de las estrellas|website=enelbrasero.com|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref> By 1988, however, the aforementioned Luis Miguel would transform into an adult superstar at age 18 with the hit ''La Incondicional'' (1989). Not too far behind was former Los Chicos' member [[Chayanne]] as he became a leading pop star by the end of the decade, with his 1987 hit ''Fiesta en America''. As young stars begin to rise in Latin music, veterans such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9]], [[Juan Gabriel]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez El Puma]] continue their dominance in Latin music. 1985 saw the worldwide breakthrough success of \"[[Conga (song)|Conga]]\" by [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Miami Sound Machine]]. Argentine-Venezuelan singer [[Ricardo Montaner]] joins those veterans with his 1988 hit ''Tan Enamorado''. After the slow decline of [[Fania All-Stars]], the new romantic genre of ''salsa romantica'' would rise beginning in 1984. Younger salseros such as [[Frankie Ruiz]], [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]], and [[Eddie Santiago]] would take advantage of this new genre rising salsa to new heights. [[Tejano Music]] starts to give little rise after [[Mazz]] crosses over to Mexico after their albums [[Una Noche Juntos]] and No Te Olvidare win Grammys.\n\nIn 1989, [[Juan Luis Guerra]] scores a major [[Merengue music|Merengue]] hit with ''Ojala que llueva cafe''.\n\n=== {{anchor|Latin American rock}} Rock ===\nThe [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol]] movement began around the 1980s. Until the mid-80s the rock scene of most Spanish American countries were not connected, and it was rare for a rock band to gain acclaim and popularity outside its home country.\n\nArgentina, which had the largest national rock scene and music industry, became the birthplace of several influential rock acts. [[Soda Stereo]] from [[Buenos Aires]] is often acclaimed as the most influential rock band of the 80s alongside the solo careers of [[Charly Garc\u00eda]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] and the new star [[Fito P\u00e1ez]] from [[Rosario]]. Soda Stereo was among the first bands to successfully tour across most of Latin America. Argentina developed also during the 80s a ska rock and punk rock scene. The punk movement, that was pioneered by [[Los Violadores]], led to the rise of the [[Buenos Aires Hardcore]] around 1990.\n\nIn Chile, that was ruled by a [[military dictatorship]] all over the 80s, [[Nueva canci\u00f3n]] protest songs from the 60s and 70s maintained their popularity despite severe censorship. The progressive/folk rock band [[Los Jaivas]] made a Latin American trademark album with [[Alturas de Macchu Picchu]] [sic] based on [[Pablo Neruda]]'s homonymous poem. The rock band [[Los Prisioneros]] were successful in combining the protest song atmosphere of the 80s with newer trends in rock including punk, ska, new wave and techno. In late 1980s new bands such as [[Los Tres]] and [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]] would start to set the trends for the next decade.\n\nIn Brazil, even though the 1960s witnessed the phenomenon of [[Jovem Guarda]] and the 1970s saw the appearance of many prolific artists, like [[Raul Seixas]], and bands like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Brazilian rock]]'s explosion began in 1981 with the first expressions of the ''Brazilian new wave'', later renamed the ''New Jovem Guarda'' by the media.\nThe alterations of the English new wave movement, with its surprising variety of styles, arrived in Brazil through groups and personalities such as [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Camisa de V\u00eanus]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], {{ill|Ritchie (musician)|lt=Ritchie|pt|Ritchie}}, [[Lulu Santos]], [[R\u00e1dio T\u00e1xi]], [[Marina Lima]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[RPM (Brazilian band)|RPM]], Graffiti, [[Ultraje a Rigor]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Ira!]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Capital Inicial]], [[Nenhum de N\u00f3s]], [[Biquini Cavad\u00e3o]], [[Lob\u00e3o]] & Os Ronaldos, [[L\u00e9o Jaime]], and inumerous others.\nIn January 1985, the [[Rock in Rio]] festival took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which brought together over one million people to the [[City of Rock|Cidade do Rock]] during the 10 days of the event, and is to this day the country's biggest and most influential festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voltosegunda.com/site/10-maiores-festivais-de-musica-do-mundo/|title=10 maiores festivais de m\u00fasica do mundo|website=Volto Segunda|language=pt|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> It represents a milestone in [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], as in that same year the country saw the end of the [[Brazilian military government|dictatorship]],<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\">{{cite web|url=http://musicapave.com/artigos/rockologia-rock-in-rio-e-o-fim-da-ditadura-militar/|title=Rockologia: Rock in Rio e o fim da Ditadura Militar|last=Pinheiro|first=Matheus|website=M\u00fasica Pav\u00ea|language=pt|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/112926|title=Rock in Rio: No dia que cai Ditadura, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho faz show hist\u00f3rico|website=Sidney Rezende|language=pt|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> and it is also responsible for establishing Brazil as a venue for international artists - as, so far, foreign attractions had been rarities.<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://super.abril.com.br/cultura/rock-in-rio-todo-mundo-junto/|title=Rock in Rio: Todo mundo junto!|website=[[Superinteressante]]|language=pt|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Mexico, the Rock music scene at the time first saw heavy lack of opportunity as musical acts could not make a solid living from playing alone. Other key factors were that of economic and political instability. Many consider this decade as the [[La D\u00e9cada Perdida|lost decade]]. The government would not allow racy themed content on television and on the airwaves, music festivals were not allowed. The music that dominated Mexico and much of Latin America during this era were mostly teen flavored acts like [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Timbiriche]], [[Flans]] and others. \n\nRock acts could not land any recording deal because record label executives were much more interested in selling listeners a colorful, hip and trendy image to the general public ranging from youngsters to middle aged adults. \n\nWith the strong impact of Argentine and [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a|Spanish rock bands]] by the mid-1980s, the local scene would begin to develop acts that would generate an identity of its own. Among these were bands like [[El Tri]], [[Maldita Vecindad]], Los Amantes de Lola and [[Caifanes]].\n\n=== Salsa ===\nThe [[salsa music]] had developed in the 1960s and '70s by Puerto Rican and [[Cuba]]n immigrants to the [[New York City]] area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The salsa music became together with [[cumbia]] the two most popular dance music but did not penetrate other countries outside the Caribbean as cumbia did.\n\nThe 1980s was a time of diversification, as popular salsa evolved into sweet and smooth [[salsa romantica]], with lyrics dwelling on love and romance, and its more explicit cousin, [[salsa erotica]]. Salsa romantica can be traced back to ''Noches Calientes'', a 1984 album by singer [[Jos\u00e9 Alberto]] with producer Louie Ramirez. A wave of romantica singers, found wide audience among Latinos in both New York and Puerto Rico.<ref>Manuel, ''Popular Music of the Non-Western World'', pg. 49</ref> The 1980s also saw salsa expand to Mexico, [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], Europe and Japan, and diversify into many new styles.\n\nIn the 1980s some performers experimented with combining elements of salsa with [[hip hop music]], while the producer and pianist [[Sergio George]] helped to revive salsa's commercial success. He created a sound based on prominent trombones and rootsy, mambo-inspired style. He worked with the [[Japanese salsa]] band [[Orquesta de la Luz]], and developed a studio orchestra that included [[Tito Nieves]], Celia Cruz, Jos\u00e9 Alberto, [[La India]], [[Tito Puente]] and [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]]. The Colombian singer Joe Arroyo first rose to fame in the 1970s, but became a renowned exponent of [[Colombian salsa]] in the 1980s. Arroyo worked for many years with the Colombian arranger [[Fruko y sus Tesos|Fruko and his band Los Tesos]].<ref>Steward, pgs. 493\u2013497</ref>\n\n=== Merengue ===\n[[Merengue music]] would hit its golden years during the 1980s starting in the late 70s with acts such as [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], and [[Fernando Villalona]]. Their orchestras would also churn future solo acts such as [[Eddy Herrera]] and [[Rubby Perez]]. By the end of the decade, La Coco Band would reinvent merengue with a more comedic style.\n\n== Australia and New Zealand ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Hutchence-INXS.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Michael Hutchence]] singing during an [[INXS]] concert, early 1980s]]\nAustralian rock band [[INXS]] achieved international success during the decade with a series of hit recordings, including the albums ''[[Listen Like Thieves]]'' (1985), ''[[Kick (INXS album)|Kick]]'' (1987), and the singles \"[[Original Sin (INXS song)|Original Sin]]\" (1984), \"[[Need You Tonight]]\" (1987), \"[[Devil Inside (INXS song)|Devil Inside]]\" (1988) and \"[[New Sensation]]\" (1987).<ref name=\"Kent\">{{cite book |title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970&ndash;1992]] |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink= David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], Sydney |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6 }} Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.</ref><ref name=\"AusCharts\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |title=INXS discography |publisher=Australian Charts Portal |accessdate=2008-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302214619/http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |archivedate=2014-03-02 }}</ref><ref name=AMGSingles>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4555/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=INXS > Charts & Awards > Billboard singles|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref><ref name=BBalbums>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=inxs|chart=all}} |title=Artist Chart History - INXS - Albums|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Kylie Minogue]] first single, \"[[The Loco-Motion|Locomotion]]\" became a huge hit in Minogue's native Australia, spending seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart. The single eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the decade. Throughout Europe and Asia the song also performed well on the music charts, reaching number one in [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], and [[South Africa]]. The Australian rock band [[Men at Work]] achieved success in 1981 with the single \"[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]\" topping Australian charts for two consecutive weeks.\n\nIn 1980, [[New Zealand]] rock band [[Split Enz]] released their album ''[[True Colours (Split Enz album)|True Colours]]'', which became an international success.  Their single \"[[I Got You (Split Enz song)|I Got You]]\", which was praised for its \"Beatle-esque\" chorus, reached the top ten in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], reached number twelve in the [[United Kingdom]], and even charted the [[United States]]. [[Split Enz]] also received significant exposure in the [[United States]] upon the release of [[MTV]], which featured several [[Split Enz]] videos in the early days of its broadcast.  However, after several line-up changes, which included the departure of prominent member [[Tim Finn]], the band broke up in 1984 (another prominent [[New Zealand]]/[[Australian]] band, [[Mi-Sex]], known for its hit single \"[[Computer Games (song)|Computer Games]]\", disbanded the same year). [[Neil Finn]], the younger brother of [[Tim Finn]] who had become Split Enz's de facto frontman after his departure in 1983, went on to form [[Crowded House]] in [[New Zealand]] in 1985.  In 1986 [[Crowded House]] released their hugely successful self-titled debut album, which went to number one in [[Australia]] and number three in [[New Zealand]], as well as reaching the top ten in [[Canada]] and top twenty in the [[United States]].  It spawned the song \"[[Don't Dream It's Over]]\", which hit number one in [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], number two in the [[United States]] and number eight in [[Australia]], and has since become a pop/rock anthem in [[Australasia]].  Crowded House's follow up album ''[[Temple of Low Men]]'', released in 1988, did not achieve the same success as their debut, but was still popular in the band's homelands of [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]...\n\nBack at home, [[New Zealand]] continued to have a small and vibrant music scene, and the eighties saw the formation of many new bands, including [[The Swingers]], [[Coconut Rough]], [[The Crocodiles]] and Peking Man.  Many of these bands were short-lived and did not see much success outside of New Zealand and Australia.\n\n== Asia ==\n{{main|J-pop|Indian pop|C-pop|K-pop}}\n{{see also|Synthpop|Electro (music)|House music|Techno}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn [[Japan]], bands such as [[Shonen Knife]], [[Boredoms]], [[The Star Club]], [[X Japan]], [[Dead End (band)|Dead End]] and [[The Stalin]] began in the Japanese rock bands and [[Visual kei]] emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[X Japan]], [[Buck Tick]] and [[D'erlanger]]. Japanese noise rock emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[Melt-Banana]], [[Zeni Geva]] and [[Guitar Wolf]] in the Japanese's indies scene. \n\n[[City pop]], an adult-oriented genre with western influences of [[disco]], [[funk]], [[soft rock]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] also became popular with the Japanese tech boom. Popular artists in the genre were [[Anri]] and [[Tatsuro Yamashita]]. Most songs were about love or living in the city. The genre was barely known outside of Japan. However, city pop has been getting increasingly popular in the west with Internet-born [[microgenre]] [[vaporwave]]. On May 3, 2019, [[Light in the Attic Records|Light in the Attic]], an independent record label, released Pacific Breeze: Japanese City Pop, AOR, and Boogie 1976-1986. It was a compilation album that showcased what city pop is and its style.\n\n[[Japanese hardcore]] emerged with bands such as [[The Star Club]] and [[GISM]] and [[Japanese idol]] group Onyanko Club began as Idol group in the teen fans and youth fans.\n\nIn addition,  Hong Kong saw a rapid growth in pop music, both in terms of variety and popularity. Big stars such as [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Anita Mui]], [[Danny Chan]], [[Alan Tam]] and [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]] were icons of the decade. The 1980s is still regarded as the most successful period in Hong Kong music history.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1980s|Music}}\n*[[1970s in music]]\n*[[1990s in music]]\n*[[1960s in music]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Hill, Dave (1986).

Madonna made music videos a marketing tool and was among the first to make them an artform. Many of her songs topped charts around the world, such as: \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\", \"[[La Isla Bonita]]\" and \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\". After the [[Like a Prayer (album)|''Like a Prayer'' album]] in 1989, Madonna was named artist of the decade by a number of magazines and awards.  \"I thought the eighties was fabulous,\" she said, \"and I'm sure [[Boy George]] would agree with me.\"<ref>{{cite journal|first= Danny |last= Eccleston |title= Sexy Mother |magazine= [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date= March 1998 |page= 90|url = http://imagem-madonna.blogspot.com/2018/02/sexy-mother-q-magazine-1998.html|via = Imagem-Madonna}}</ref>\n\n[[Whitney Houston]] was one of the best selling female artists of the decade in the US, behind [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].

She also became the first and only artist to earn seven consecutive number-one songs on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\n[[Paula Abdul]] hit it big in 1988. With her debut album ''[[Forever Your Girl]]'', she was the first female to have four number one singles from a debut album (only [[The Jackson 5]] had done the same with their debut). She had five top ten hits from the album.\n\nBy 1980, the [[disco]] genre, largely dependent on [[orchestra]]s, was replaced by a lighter [[synthpop]] production, which subsequently fuelled dance music.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, [[teen pop]] experienced its first wave, with bands and artists including [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]], [[Debbie Gibson]], [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]], [[New Edition]], [[Stacey Q]], [[The Bangles]], [[New Kids on the Block]], Madonna, George Michael, [[Laura Branigan]], [[Boy George]] and others becoming teen idols.\n\nProminent American [[urban pop]] acts of the 1980s include [[Tina Turner]], [[Lionel Richie]], Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston and [[Diana Ross]]. African American artists like [[Lionel Richie]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] became some of the decade's biggest stars. Their hit albums included ''[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]'', ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'', and ''[[Sign \"O\" the Times]]'' by Prince and ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', and ''[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]'' by Richie.\n\nPrince was the decade's most prolific artist, not just by virtue of being the top charting artist in the US and worldwide. He was responsible for artists such as [[Vanity 6]], for whom he wrote the dance chart topping \"Nasty Girl\"; [[Morris Day]] and the Time, for whom he wrote the top 20 \"Jungle Love\"; [[Sheila E.]], for whom he wrote the top ten song \"[[The Glamorous Life]]\" and number 11 \"[[A Love Bizarre]]\"; and [[Wendy & Lisa]] and [[Apollonia 6]]. He wrote \"[[I Feel for You]]\" for [[Chaka Khan]], which won him a Grammy for best R&B song; \"[[Sugar Walls]]\" for [[Sheena Easton]]; and as well as doing a duet with \"[[U Got the Look|U Got The Look\"]], he wrote \"[[Manic Monday]]\", a number two pop hit for the Bangles. Artists that covered his music included [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], who brought his version of the song \"[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]\" into the top 40 for the second time in the decade. [[Melissa Morgan]] brought her cover of \"[[Do Me, Baby]]\" to the top of the R&B charts in 1986. Other notable artists that covered Prince during the 1980s were [[The Pointer Sisters]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]].<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/15-great-prince-songs-that-were-hits-for-other-artists-20160421.</ref> He also won an Academy Award for the song \"[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]\".

Prince had four number one singles and 14 top ten hits on the Hot 100 Chart.\n\nLionel Richie teamed with [[Diana Ross]] to record one of the decade's biggest hits [[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]], which top the Billboard charts for nine weeks. Other songs by Richie, such as [[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]] and [[Hello]] also top the charts, he would have a total of five number one hits, and 13 top ten singles. [[Diana Ross]] brought [[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]] to the top spot in 1980, she would have two number one singles, and eight top ten hits in the decade. [[Tina Turner]] would top the charts with \"What's Love Got to Do With It\", she scored a total of six top ten singles. [[Donna Summer]]'s [[She Works Hard for the Money]] was a continuation of the feminist movement started in the 70s, and a rally cry for those who worked hard and wanted to be treated fairly. She would have five top ten singles in the decade.\n\n[[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''Born In the USA'', [[AC/DC]]'s ''Back in Black'', [[Def Leppard]]'s ''Hysteria'', and [[Bon Jovi]]'s ''Slippery When Wet'' were some of the decade's biggest-selling albums on the Billboard Top 200 chart.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s American pop singer [[Cyndi Lauper]] was considered{{By whom|date=November 2017}} the \"Voice of the [[MTV]] Generation of '80s\" and so different visual style that made the world for teens. Her first two albums ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' (1986) were critically and commercially successful, spawning the hits, \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\", \"[[She Bop]]\", \"[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]\", \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".\n\nSeveral British artists made the successful transition to pop during the 1980s and saw great commercial success, such as [[David Bowie]], [[Phil Collins]], [[John Lennon]], [[Billy Ocean]], [[Sheena Easton]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Many British pop bands also dominated the American charts in the early 1980s. Many of them became popular due to their constant exposure on [[MTV]], these bands included [[The Human League]], [[Culture Club]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Wham!]]. Between the four, they have had 9 U.S. number ones with hits like \"[[Don't You Want Me]]\", \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\", \"[[The Reflex]]\" and \"[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]\" In the later part of the decade [[Rick Astley]], [[George Michael]] as a solo artist, [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], and [[Fine Young Cannibals]] all found chart success.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, Australian artists like [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Men at Work]], [[Air Supply]] and [[AC/DC]] all had chart success, later in the decade [[INXS]] scored hits. [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s hit [[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]] would top the Hot 100 for 10 weeks and be the decade's biggest hit in the US; she would have six top ten singles during the 80s.\n\nAmerican artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Kool & the Gang]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[John Mellencamp]], then known as John Cougar, ruled the charts throughout the decade in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/list/abyss89/who-ruled-the-80s_the-200-biggest-artists-of-the-decade-in-the-usa/|title=Who ruled the 80's:The 200 biggest artists of the decade in the USA|website=RateYourMusic}}</ref> Prince, Madonna, Jackson, Joel and Springsteen along with [[U2]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Police]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Eurythmics]] achieved tremendous success worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://tsort.info/music/faq_decade_artists.htm|title = Who were the most successful artists of each decade?|website = Tsort|first = Steve|last = Harwin|date = 13 September 2019}}</ref>  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== {{anchor|North American rock}} Rock ===\nIn the 1980s, rock music was more precisely defined and split up into multiple subgenres.\n\n==== Hard rock and heavy/glam metal ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n[[Image:Metallica live London 2003-12-19 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Metallica]] in concert, 2003]]\nBeginning in 1983 and peaking in success in 1986-1990, the decade saw the resurgence of [[hard rock]] music and the emergence of its [[glam metal]] subgenre. Bands such as [[AC/DC]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Ratt (band)|Ratt]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Dokken]], [[Whitesnake]], and [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] were among the most popular acts of the decade. The 1980s saw the emergence of wildly popular hard rock band [[Guns N' Roses]] and the successful comebacks of [[Aerosmith]] and [[Alice Cooper]] in the late 1980s. The success of hard rock act [[Van Halen]] spanned throughout the entire decade, first with singer [[David Lee Roth]] and later with [[Sammy Hagar]]. Queen, which had expanded its music to experimental and crossover genres in the early 1980s, returned to guitar-driven hard rock with ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' in 1989. Additionally, a few women managed to achieve stardom in the 1980s hard rock scene: [[Pat Benatar]] and Ann and Nancy Wilson of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], who had been around since the mid 1970s, are prime examples of female success in hard rock, and so are both ex-[[The Runaways|Runaways]] [[Joan Jett]] and [[Lita Ford]].\n\nThe [[arena rock]] trend of the 1970s continued in the 1980s with bands like [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[Aerosmith]].\n\nTraditionally associated (and often confused) with hard rock, heavy metal was also extremely popular throughout the decade, with [[Ozzy Osbourne]] achieving success during his solo career; bands like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]] were also widely popular British acts. [[Speed metal]] pioneer [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] maintained its popularity through the releases of several albums.\n[[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more extreme, aggressive Metal subgenres: [[thrash metal]] broke his arm into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Megadeth]]. By the late 1980s, [[Metallica]] would achieve mainstream success and would become one of the best selling music artists of all time. Other styles like [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] would remain a [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena.\n\nThe decade also saw the emergence of a string of guitar virtuosi: [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Jason Becker]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] achieved international recognition for their skills. While considerably less numerous, [[bass guitar]] virtuosi also gained momentum in the 1980s: [[Geddy Lee]] (of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] [[Billy Sheehan]] (of [[David Lee Roth]] and [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]] fame), [[Cliff Burton]] (of [[Metallica]]) and alternative/funk metal bassist [[Les Claypool]] (of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] fame) became famous during that period. Iron Maiden founder and bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] has also been praised numerous times for his galloping style of bass playing.\n\nBoth hard rock and heavy metal were extremely popular live genres and bands toured extensively around the globe.\n\n==== Alternative rock ====\n[[File:R.E.M., Belgium, 1985.jpg|thumb|right|230px|One of the first alternative rock bands, [[R.E.M.]] relied on [[campus radio|college radio]] airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream.]]\n\nBy 1984, a majority of groups signed to [[independent record labels]] were mining from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper rational post-punk years.<ref>Reynolds, p. 392-93.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, alternative rock was mainly an underground phenomena. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily relegated to [[independent record labels]], [[fanzines]] and [[college radio]] stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. \"[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/|pure_url=yes}} American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk]\".

R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/> Alternative and [[indie pop]] movements sprang up in other parts of the world, from the [[Paisley Underground]] of Los Angeles ([[The Bangles]], [[Rain Parade]]) to Scotland ([[Aztec Camera]], [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]), Australia ([[The Church (band)|The Church]], [[The Triffids]]), and New Zealand's [[Dunedin sound]] ([[The Clean]], [[The Chills]]).\n\nAmerican indie record labels [[SST Records]], [[Twin/Tone Records]], [[Touch and Go Records]], and [[Dischord Records]] presided over the shift from the [[hardcore punk]] that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.<ref>Reynolds, p. 390</ref> [[Music of Minnesota|Minnesota]] bands [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] and [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/>\n\nBy the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop ([[They Might Be Giants]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]), to [[noise rock]] ([[Big Black]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]]) to [[industrial rock]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Nine Inch Nails]]) and to early [[Grunge]] ([[Mudhoney]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of [[Boston (band)|Boston]]'s the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Los Angeles]]' [[Jane's Addiction]].<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/>\n\nAmerican [[alternative rock]] bands of the 1980s included [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Dinosaur Jr.]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], and [[Sonic Youth]] which were popular long before the [[Grunge]] movement of the early 1990s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0719-38, Bruce Springsteen, Konzert in der DDR.jpg|150px|thumb|right|upright|[[Bruce Springsteen]], 1988]]\n[[File:Tracy Chapman 3.jpg|150px|thumb|left|upright|[[Tracy Chapman]], 2009]]\nNew singers and songwriters included [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Mark Heard]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Suzanne Vega]], [[Cheryl Wheeler]] and [[Warren Zevon]]. Rock and even [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Peter Case]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Paul Westerberg]] transitioned to careers as solo singers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with [[Suzanne Vega]] whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[k.d. lang]] and [[Tori Amos]], who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market.\n\n==== Other trends ====\nVarious older rock bands made a comeback. Bands originating from the early to mid-1960s such as [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Kinks]] had hits with \"[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]\", \"[[Come Dancing (song)|Come Dancing]]\" and \"Do It Again\". Bands with popularity in the mid-1970s such as the [[Steve Miller Band]] and [[Steely Dan]] also had hits with \"[[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band song)|Abracadabra]]\" and \"[[Hey Nineteen]]\". Singer and songwriter [[Bruce Springsteen]] released his blockbuster album ''[[Born In The USA]]'', which produced a record-tying 7 hit singles. [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[George Thorogood]] sparked a revival of [[Atomic blues]] and [[Blues rock]]. Massively successful hard rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] disbanded after drummer [[John Bonham]]'s 1980 death, while contemporaries [[AC/DC]] continued to have success after the death of former frontman [[Bon Scott]]. [[Country rock]] saw a decline after [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s 1977 plane crash and the 1980 disbanding of the genre's most successful band, [[Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]. [[The Grateful Dead]] had their biggest hit in band history with \"[[Touch of Grey]]\". [[The Who]] managed to provide the hit songs \"[[You Better You Bet]]\" and \"[[Eminence Front]]\" before burning out after the death of their drummer [[Keith Moon]].\n\n[[Hardcore punk]] flourished throughout the early to mid-1980s, with bands leading the genre such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], and [[Dead Kennedys]] amongst others. It began to wane in the latter half of the decade, with the [[New York hardcore|New York hardcore scene]] dominating the genre. However, it experience a jumpstart in the late 1980s with emerging bands such as [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]] and [[Green Day]] that would define not just the so-called \"East Bay\" sound, but impact the next decade's punk and alternative sound. Some of which is still around today.\n\nThe 1980s proved a difficult time for many 1960s-70s veterans, many of them unable or unwilling to adapt to current trends. Music icons such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], and [[The Rolling Stones]] released albums that were often poor quality and critically panned as they attempted to grapple with the changing times. MTV in particular was a problem for many artists, as it put a premium on youthfulness, good looks, and showmanship. Artists who became strongly associated with disco music also fell from grace and were often banned from radio play.\n\n=== Contemporary R&B ===\n{{See also|Contemporary R&B}}\nContemporary R&B originated in the 1980s, when musicians started adding [[disco]]-like beats, high-tech production, and elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] to [[rhythm and blues]], making it more danceable and modern.<ref name=\"Rhythms and Rhymes\">{{Citation | last = Gazzah | first = Miriam | title = Rhythms and Rhymes of Life: music and Identification Processes of Dutch-Moroccan Youth | publisher = Amsterdam University Press | year = 2008 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-90-8964-062-8}}</ref> The top mainstream [[R&B]] artists of 1980s included [[Michael Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], [[James Ingram]], [[The S.O.S.

Such music was originally born of and popularized via regional [[nightclub]] scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in [[discoth\u00e8ques]] as well as the [[rave]] scene.\n\n[[House music]] is a style of [[electronic dance music]] which originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Fikentscher\">{{citation|title=Youth\u2019s sonic forces: The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon|last=Fikentscher|first=Kai|journal=[[UNESCO Courier]]|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=July\u2013August 2000|page=45}}</ref> House music was strongly influenced by elements of [[soul music|soul]]- and [[funk]]-infused varieties of [[disco]]. Club play from pioneering DJs like [[Ron Hardy]] and [[Lil Louis]], local dance music record shops, and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station [[WVAZ|WBMX-FM]] helped popularize house music in Chicago and among visiting DJs & producers from [[Detroit]]. Trax Records and DJ International Records, local labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music outside of Chicago. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop & dance music worldwide during the 1990s.\n\nIt has been widely cited that the initial blueprint for [[techno]] was developed during the mid-1980s in Detroit, [[Michigan]], by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Kevin Saunderson]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]] (the so-called \"Belleville Three\"), and [[Eddie Fowlkes]], all of whom attended school together at [[Belleville High School (Belleville, Michigan)|Belleville High]], near Detroit.<ref>Brewster 2006:340\u2013359</ref><ref>Cosgrove 1988a.</ref><ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN>Sicko 1999</ref><ref>Reynolds 1999:12\u201340</ref> Though initially conceived as party music that was played on daily mixed radio programs and played at parties given by cliquish, Detroit high school clubs, it has grown to be a global phenomenon.\n\n=== Country music ===\n[[Image:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Kenny Rogers]], 2004]]\nAs the 1980s dawned, [[country pop|pop-influenced country music]] was the dominant style, through such acts as [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[T.G. Sheppard]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Anne Murray]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. The 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', a romantic comedy starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Debra Winger]], spawned a successful soundtrack album featuring pop-styled country songs, including \"[[Lookin' for Love]]\" by [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]], \"[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]\" by the [[Charlie Daniels Band]], \"[[Could I Have This Dance]]\" by Murray and \"[[Love the World Away]]\" by Rogers. The songs, and the movie itself, resulted in an early 1980s boom in pop-styled country music, and the era is sometimes known as the \"Urban Cowboy Movement\".\n\nBy the mid-1980s, country music audiences were beginning to tire of country pop. Although some pop-country artists continued to record and release successful songs and albums, the genre in general was beginning to suffer. By 1985, a ''New York Times'' article declared country music \"dead\". However, by this time, several newcomers were working behind the scenes to reverse this perception.\n\nThe year 1986 brought forth several new artists who performed in traditional country styles, such as honky-tonk. This sparked the \"new traditionalist\" movement, or return to traditional country music. The most successful of these artists included [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Ricky Van Shelton]] and [[Holly Dunn]]. Also, artists like [[Kathy Mattea]] and [[Keith Whitley]], both of whom had been performing for a few years prior, had their first major hits during 1986; Mattea was more folk-styled, while Whitley was pure honky-tonk. But the new traditionalist movement had already taken hold as early as 1981, when newcomers such as [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[George Strait]] had their first big hits. [[Reba McEntire]] had her first big hit in 1980 followed by 15 other number one hit singles during the decade. In addition, songwriter\u2013guitarist and [[Chet Atkins]] prodigy [[Steve Wariner]] also emerged as a popular act starting in the early 1980s. Another boom period for newcomers with new traditionalist styles was 1989, when artists such as [[Clint Black]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[Lorrie Morgan]] and [[Travis Tritt]] had their first big hits. It was Whitley who was seen as being one of the torchbearers of the new traditionalist movement, thanks to his pure honky-tonk style in the vein of Lefty Frizzell and others, and his star power was set to rise into the 1990s; however, Whitley was a known heavy drinker, and it was alcohol poisoning that ended his life in May 1989, just weeks after a song about triumph over personal demons -- \"[[I'm No Stranger to the Rain]]\"\u2014became a huge country hit. In keeping with the neotraditonalist movement, [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Emmylou Harris]] teamed up to release 1987's Platinum selling ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album.  Composed mostly of traditional songs set to acoustic arrangements, the album won a Grammy in 1988 for best country collaboration.\n\nVocal duos were also popular because of their harmonies, most notably [[The Bellamy Brothers]] and [[The Judds]]. Several of the Bellamy Brothers' songs included double-entendre' laden [[hook (rhetoric)|hooks]], on songs such as \"Do You Love as Good As You Look\". The Judds, a mother-and-daughter duo, combined elements of contemporary pop and traditional country music on songs such as \"Why Not Me\" and \"[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)]]\".\n\nCountry music groups and bands continued to rise in popularity during the 1980s. The most successful of the lot was [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], a [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]]-based band that blended traditional and pop country sounds with [[southern rock]]. Their concerts regularly sold out, while their single releases regularly reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles|Hot Country Songs]] chart. In 1989, Alabama was named the Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. By the end of the 1980s, the group had sold more than 24 million albums in the United States.\n\nRanking just behind Alabama in popularity, as far as groups were concerned, were [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] and [[The Statler Brothers]], both four-part harmony groups with gospel and country-pop stylings. The popularity of those three groups sparked a boom in new groups and bands, and by the end of the 1980s, fans were listening to such acts as [[Restless Heart]] and [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], the latter which previously enjoyed success with the pop hit \"[[Kiss You All Over]]\".\n\nDespite the prevailing pop country sound, enduring acts from the 1970s and earlier continued to enjoy great success with fans. [[George Jones]], one of the longest-running acts of the time, recorded several successful singles, including the critically acclaimed \"[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]]\". [[Conway Twitty]] continued to have a series of No. 1 hits, with 1986's \"Desperado Love\" becoming his 40th chart-topper on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart, a record that stood for nearly 20 years. The movie ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' profiled the life of [[Loretta Lynn]] (with [[Sissy Spacek]] in the lead role), while [[Willie Nelson]] also had a series of acting credits. [[Dolly Parton]] had much success in the 1980s, with several leading movie roles, two No. 1 albums and 13 number one hits, and having many successful tours; she also teamed up with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1987 for the multi-plaitnum ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album. Others who had been around for a while and continued to have great success were [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\nIn addition to newcomer Whitley, top [[classic country]] and influential performers who died during the decade included [[Red Sovine]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[Merle Travis]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Wynn Stewart]] and [[Tex Williams]]. Although not directly associated with country music, [[Roy Orbison]], a favorite of many country music fans and whose styles wound up being influential with many newcomers, died in 1988.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Music of the United Kingdom (1980s)||Neue Deutsche Welle}}\n\n=== {{anchor|European rock}} Rock ===\n\n==== Post-punk ====\n\nSome of the most successful [[post-punk]] bands at the beginning of the decade, such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[The Psychedelic Furs]], also continued their success during the 1980s.

Even though The Police had their roots in post punk, their eventual success (four consecutive UK number one studio albums) and mega-stardom came from being able to pack the biggest stadium rock venues such as [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], the [[Oakland Coliseum]] and the [[Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3|Maracan\u00e3]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Aside from U2, they are the only other band with post punk origins to go on and achieve the kind of global success they did.

The sounds of synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s as well as replacing disco in dance clubs in Europe.\n\nOther successful synthpop artists of this era included [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]], [[Soft Cell]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Gary Numan]], [[The Human League]], [[Thomas Dolby]], [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]], [[Art of Noise]], [[Heaven 17]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]], [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[Thompson Twins]], [[Visage (band)|Visage]], [[Ultravox]], [[Kajagoogoo]], [[Eurythmics]], [[a-ha]], [[Telex (band)|Telex]], [[Real Life (band)|Real Life]], [[Erasure]], [[Camouflage (band)|Camouflage]], [[London Boys]], [[Modern Talking]], [[Bananarama]], [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Latin America ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Pop ===\nThe 1980s gave rise to the teenage groups [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Timbiriche]], and [[Los Chicos]], as well as emerging teenage stars such as [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandra \u00c1valos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enelbrasero.com/2014/11/04/alejandra-avalos-es-madrina-de-lujo-en-la-plaza-de-las-estrellas-fotos/|title=Alejandra \u00c1valos es madrina delujo en plaza de las estrellas|website=enelbrasero.com|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref> By 1988, however, the aforementioned Luis Miguel would transform into an adult superstar at age 18 with the hit ''La Incondicional'' (1989). Not too far behind was former Los Chicos' member [[Chayanne]] as he became a leading pop star by the end of the decade, with his 1987 hit ''Fiesta en America''. As young stars begin to rise in Latin music, veterans such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9]], [[Juan Gabriel]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez El Puma]] continue their dominance in Latin music. 1985 saw the worldwide breakthrough success of \"[[Conga (song)|Conga]]\" by [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Miami Sound Machine]]. Argentine-Venezuelan singer [[Ricardo Montaner]] joins those veterans with his 1988 hit ''Tan Enamorado''. After the slow decline of [[Fania All-Stars]], the new romantic genre of ''salsa romantica'' would rise beginning in 1984. Younger salseros such as [[Frankie Ruiz]], [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]], and [[Eddie Santiago]] would take advantage of this new genre rising salsa to new heights. [[Tejano Music]] starts to give little rise after [[Mazz]] crosses over to Mexico after their albums [[Una Noche Juntos]] and No Te Olvidare win Grammys.\n\nIn 1989, [[Juan Luis Guerra]] scores a major [[Merengue music|Merengue]] hit with ''Ojala que llueva cafe''.\n\n=== {{anchor|Latin American rock}} Rock ===\nThe [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol]] movement began around the 1980s. Until the mid-80s the rock scene of most Spanish American countries were not connected, and it was rare for a rock band to gain acclaim and popularity outside its home country.\n\nArgentina, which had the largest national rock scene and music industry, became the birthplace of several influential rock acts. [[Soda Stereo]] from [[Buenos Aires]] is often acclaimed as the most influential rock band of the 80s alongside the solo careers of [[Charly Garc\u00eda]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] and the new star [[Fito P\u00e1ez]] from [[Rosario]]. Soda Stereo was among the first bands to successfully tour across most of Latin America. Argentina developed also during the 80s a ska rock and punk rock scene. The punk movement, that was pioneered by [[Los Violadores]], led to the rise of the [[Buenos Aires Hardcore]] around 1990.\n\nIn Chile, that was ruled by a [[military dictatorship]] all over the 80s, [[Nueva canci\u00f3n]] protest songs from the 60s and 70s maintained their popularity despite severe censorship. The progressive/folk rock band [[Los Jaivas]] made a Latin American trademark album with [[Alturas de Macchu Picchu]] [sic] based on [[Pablo Neruda]]'s homonymous poem. The rock band [[Los Prisioneros]] were successful in combining the protest song atmosphere of the 80s with newer trends in rock including punk, ska, new wave and techno. In late 1980s new bands such as [[Los Tres]] and [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]] would start to set the trends for the next decade.\n\nIn Brazil, even though the 1960s witnessed the phenomenon of [[Jovem Guarda]] and the 1970s saw the appearance of many prolific artists, like [[Raul Seixas]], and bands like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Brazilian rock]]'s explosion began in 1981 with the first expressions of the ''Brazilian new wave'', later renamed the ''New Jovem Guarda'' by the media.\nThe alterations of the English new wave movement, with its surprising variety of styles, arrived in Brazil through groups and personalities such as [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Camisa de V\u00eanus]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], {{ill|Ritchie (musician)|lt=Ritchie|pt|Ritchie}}, [[Lulu Santos]], [[R\u00e1dio T\u00e1xi]], [[Marina Lima]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[RPM (Brazilian band)|RPM]], Graffiti, [[Ultraje a Rigor]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Ira!]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Capital Inicial]], [[Nenhum de N\u00f3s]], [[Biquini Cavad\u00e3o]], [[Lob\u00e3o]] & Os Ronaldos, [[L\u00e9o Jaime]], and inumerous others.\nIn January 1985, the [[Rock in Rio]] festival took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which brought together over one million people to the [[City of Rock|Cidade do Rock]] during the 10 days of the event, and is to this day the country's biggest and most influential festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voltosegunda.com/site/10-maiores-festivais-de-musica-do-mundo/|title=10 maiores festivais de m\u00fasica do mundo|website=Volto Segunda|language=pt|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> It represents a milestone in [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], as in that same year the country saw the end of the [[Brazilian military government|dictatorship]],<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\">{{cite web|url=http://musicapave.com/artigos/rockologia-rock-in-rio-e-o-fim-da-ditadura-militar/|title=Rockologia: Rock in Rio e o fim da Ditadura Militar|last=Pinheiro|first=Matheus|website=M\u00fasica Pav\u00ea|language=pt|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/112926|title=Rock in Rio: No dia que cai Ditadura, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho faz show hist\u00f3rico|website=Sidney Rezende|language=pt|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> and it is also responsible for establishing Brazil as a venue for international artists - as, so far, foreign attractions had been rarities.<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://super.abril.com.br/cultura/rock-in-rio-todo-mundo-junto/|title=Rock in Rio: Todo mundo junto!|website=[[Superinteressante]]|language=pt|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Mexico, the Rock music scene at the time first saw heavy lack of opportunity as musical acts could not make a solid living from playing alone. Other key factors were that of economic and political instability. Many consider this decade as the [[La D\u00e9cada Perdida|lost decade]]. The government would not allow racy themed content on television and on the airwaves, music festivals were not allowed. The music that dominated Mexico and much of Latin America during this era were mostly teen flavored acts like [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Timbiriche]], [[Flans]] and others. \n\nRock acts could not land any recording deal because record label executives were much more interested in selling listeners a colorful, hip and trendy image to the general public ranging from youngsters to middle aged adults. \n\nWith the strong impact of Argentine and [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a|Spanish rock bands]] by the mid-1980s, the local scene would begin to develop acts that would generate an identity of its own. Among these were bands like [[El Tri]], [[Maldita Vecindad]], Los Amantes de Lola and [[Caifanes]].\n\n=== Salsa ===\nThe [[salsa music]] had developed in the 1960s and '70s by Puerto Rican and [[Cuba]]n immigrants to the [[New York City]] area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The salsa music became together with [[cumbia]] the two most popular dance music but did not penetrate other countries outside the Caribbean as cumbia did.\n\nThe 1980s was a time of diversification, as popular salsa evolved into sweet and smooth [[salsa romantica]], with lyrics dwelling on love and romance, and its more explicit cousin, [[salsa erotica]]. Salsa romantica can be traced back to ''Noches Calientes'', a 1984 album by singer [[Jos\u00e9 Alberto]] with producer Louie Ramirez. A wave of romantica singers, found wide audience among Latinos in both New York and Puerto Rico.<ref>Manuel, ''Popular Music of the Non-Western World'', pg. 49</ref> The 1980s also saw salsa expand to Mexico, [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], Europe and Japan, and diversify into many new styles.\n\nIn the 1980s some performers experimented with combining elements of salsa with [[hip hop music]], while the producer and pianist [[Sergio George]] helped to revive salsa's commercial success. He created a sound based on prominent trombones and rootsy, mambo-inspired style. He worked with the [[Japanese salsa]] band [[Orquesta de la Luz]], and developed a studio orchestra that included [[Tito Nieves]], Celia Cruz, Jos\u00e9 Alberto, [[La India]], [[Tito Puente]] and [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]]. The Colombian singer Joe Arroyo first rose to fame in the 1970s, but became a renowned exponent of [[Colombian salsa]] in the 1980s. Arroyo worked for many years with the Colombian arranger [[Fruko y sus Tesos|Fruko and his band Los Tesos]].<ref>Steward, pgs. 493\u2013497</ref>\n\n=== Merengue ===\n[[Merengue music]] would hit its golden years during the 1980s starting in the late 70s with acts such as [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], and [[Fernando Villalona]]. Their orchestras would also churn future solo acts such as [[Eddy Herrera]] and [[Rubby Perez]]. By the end of the decade, La Coco Band would reinvent merengue with a more comedic style.\n\n== Australia and New Zealand ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Hutchence-INXS.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Michael Hutchence]] singing during an [[INXS]] concert, early 1980s]]\nAustralian rock band [[INXS]] achieved international success during the decade with a series of hit recordings, including the albums ''[[Listen Like Thieves]]'' (1985), ''[[Kick (INXS album)|Kick]]'' (1987), and the singles \"[[Original Sin (INXS song)|Original Sin]]\" (1984), \"[[Need You Tonight]]\" (1987), \"[[Devil Inside (INXS song)|Devil Inside]]\" (1988) and \"[[New Sensation]]\" (1987).<ref name=\"Kent\">{{cite book |title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970&ndash;1992]] |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink= David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], Sydney |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6 }} Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.</ref><ref name=\"AusCharts\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |title=INXS discography |publisher=Australian Charts Portal |accessdate=2008-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302214619/http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |archivedate=2014-03-02 }}</ref><ref name=AMGSingles>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4555/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=INXS > Charts & Awards > Billboard singles|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref><ref name=BBalbums>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=inxs|chart=all}} |title=Artist Chart History - INXS - Albums|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Kylie Minogue]] first single, \"[[The Loco-Motion|Locomotion]]\" became a huge hit in Minogue's native Australia, spending seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart. The single eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the decade. Throughout Europe and Asia the song also performed well on the music charts, reaching number one in [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], and [[South Africa]]. The Australian rock band [[Men at Work]] achieved success in 1981 with the single \"[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]\" topping Australian charts for two consecutive weeks.\n\nIn 1980, [[New Zealand]] rock band [[Split Enz]] released their album ''[[True Colours (Split Enz album)|True Colours]]'', which became an international success.  Their single \"[[I Got You (Split Enz song)|I Got You]]\", which was praised for its \"Beatle-esque\" chorus, reached the top ten in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], reached number twelve in the [[United Kingdom]], and even charted the [[United States]]. [[Split Enz]] also received significant exposure in the [[United States]] upon the release of [[MTV]], which featured several [[Split Enz]] videos in the early days of its broadcast.  However, after several line-up changes, which included the departure of prominent member [[Tim Finn]], the band broke up in 1984 (another prominent [[New Zealand]]/[[Australian]] band, [[Mi-Sex]], known for its hit single \"[[Computer Games (song)|Computer Games]]\", disbanded the same year). [[Neil Finn]], the younger brother of [[Tim Finn]] who had become Split Enz's de facto frontman after his departure in 1983, went on to form [[Crowded House]] in [[New Zealand]] in 1985.  In 1986 [[Crowded House]] released their hugely successful self-titled debut album, which went to number one in [[Australia]] and number three in [[New Zealand]], as well as reaching the top ten in [[Canada]] and top twenty in the [[United States]].  It spawned the song \"[[Don't Dream It's Over]]\", which hit number one in [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], number two in the [[United States]] and number eight in [[Australia]], and has since become a pop/rock anthem in [[Australasia]].  Crowded House's follow up album ''[[Temple of Low Men]]'', released in 1988, did not achieve the same success as their debut, but was still popular in the band's homelands of [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]...\n\nBack at home, [[New Zealand]] continued to have a small and vibrant music scene, and the eighties saw the formation of many new bands, including [[The Swingers]], [[Coconut Rough]], [[The Crocodiles]] and Peking Man.  Many of these bands were short-lived and did not see much success outside of New Zealand and Australia.\n\n== Asia ==\n{{main|J-pop|Indian pop|C-pop|K-pop}}\n{{see also|Synthpop|Electro (music)|House music|Techno}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn [[Japan]], bands such as [[Shonen Knife]], [[Boredoms]], [[The Star Club]], [[X Japan]], [[Dead End (band)|Dead End]] and [[The Stalin]] began in the Japanese rock bands and [[Visual kei]] emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[X Japan]], [[Buck Tick]] and [[D'erlanger]]. Japanese noise rock emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[Melt-Banana]], [[Zeni Geva]] and [[Guitar Wolf]] in the Japanese's indies scene. \n\n[[City pop]], an adult-oriented genre with western influences of [[disco]], [[funk]], [[soft rock]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] also became popular with the Japanese tech boom. Popular artists in the genre were [[Anri]] and [[Tatsuro Yamashita]]. Most songs were about love or living in the city. The genre was barely known outside of Japan. However, city pop has been getting increasingly popular in the west with Internet-born [[microgenre]] [[vaporwave]]. On May 3, 2019, [[Light in the Attic Records|Light in the Attic]], an independent record label, released Pacific Breeze: Japanese City Pop, AOR, and Boogie 1976-1986. It was a compilation album that showcased what city pop is and its style.\n\n[[Japanese hardcore]] emerged with bands such as [[The Star Club]] and [[GISM]] and [[Japanese idol]] group Onyanko Club began as Idol group in the teen fans and youth fans.\n\nIn addition,  Hong Kong saw a rapid growth in pop music, both in terms of variety and popularity. Big stars such as [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Anita Mui]], [[Danny Chan]], [[Alan Tam]] and [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]] were icons of the decade. The 1980s is still regarded as the most successful period in Hong Kong music history.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1980s|Music}}\n*[[1970s in music]]\n*[[1990s in music]]\n*[[1960s in music]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Hill, Dave (1986).

As there is no standard size for a football pitch some of the goals listed benefit from being played on smaller pitches that require the ball to travel a shorter distance before reaching the goal. Furthermore, many of the records listed come from English language publications and reflect a bias towards English football within the sources.\n\nUnder [[Laws of the Game (association football)|The Laws of the Game]], specifically [[The Start and Restart of Play (association football)|Law 8]], goals may be scored directly from the [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-off]].

The records concerning the fastest goals are disputed for a number of reasons. Ray Spiller of the [[Association of Football Statisticians]] has argued that as there is no official system for recognizing the timing of goals there are always going to be disputes concerning these records.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/footballs-fastest-goal-claimed-1524713.html|title=Football's fastest goal claimed|author=GUY HODGSON AND LIZ SEARL|date=23 October 2011|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, many of the goals listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as being among the fasted were not filmed preventing the precise timing of goals from being assessed.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The status of [[Nawaf Al Abed]]'s goal which is  credited as being scored after two seconds is also disputed given that the match was later declared void due to ineligible players, when several players over the age of 23 were found to have played in the age restricted game.\n\n[[Marc Burrows]]' goal has also been considered the fastest ever but it was scored in an amateur reserve game. As there is no standard size for a football pitch some of the goals listed benefit from being played on smaller pitches that require the ball to travel a shorter distance before reaching the goal. Furthermore, many of the records listed come from English language publications and reflect a bias towards English football within the sources.\n\nUnder [[Laws of the Game (association football)|The Laws of the Game]], specifically [[The Start and Restart of Play (association football)|Law 8]], goals may be scored directly from the [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-off]].

Though the group never reached a decision on the killing, one of the prisoners decided it was time to take action. According to the prosecution, Officer Robert Vallandingham, who had been taken hostage, was handcuffed and strangled with a dumbbell from the prison weight room. However, testimony by Dr. Richard Fardal, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] Deputy [[Coroner]], disputed the claim that Officer Vallandingham was killed by a weight, saying that there was \"no injury to the voice box or the trachea\" and that \"Mr. Vallandingham died solely and exclusively as a result of ligature strangulation.\" Testimonies vary as to which prisoner was responsible for his murder.<ref name=\"Pfeifer\">[[Paul Pfeifer|Pfeifer, Paul]].
