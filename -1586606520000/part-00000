ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the [[foreign minister]]s of five countries: \n[[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and [[Thailand]], signed the [[ASEAN Declaration]]. As set out in the Declaration, the aims and purposes of ASEAN are to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, to promote regional peace, collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest, to provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities, to collaborate for better utilization of agriculture and industry to raise the living standards of the people, to promote [[Southeast Asian studies]] and to maintain close, beneficial co-operation with existing international organisations with similar aims and purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|title=The Asean Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) Bangkok, 8 August 1967|publisher=ASEAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211121705/http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|archivedate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/asean/about-asean/overview|title=Overview|website=asean.org|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of ASEAN was motivated by a common fear of [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author1=Bernard Eccleston |author2=Michael Dawson |author3=Deborah J.

The region's dynamic economic growth during the 1970s strengthened the organization, enabling ASEAN to adopt a unified response to [[Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia|Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia]] in 1979. ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia|Treaty of Amity and Cooperation]], and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the [[Cold War]] allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.<ref>Moon, C.

Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasize non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination.

Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.{{efn|name=fn1|''ASEAN Financial Integration: The Long Road to Bank Consolidation'' and ''The Philippines' Banking System: The Good, the Bad and the Ambivalent''.}} The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/sp-cites-moves-by-philippine-banks/|title=S&P cites moves by Philippine banks|author=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration \u2013 playing defence and strengthening their domestic networks\".<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\"/>\n\n====Financial integration roadmap====\nThe roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realisation of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalisation, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalisation would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn regards to a common currency, ASEAN leaders agreed in November 1999 to create the establishment of currency swaps and repurchase agreements as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, ASEAN finance ministers agreed to plan for closer cooperation through the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI).<ref>Financial Integration and Common Currency Area in ASEAN</ref> The CMI has two components, an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA), and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the ASEAN Plus Three. The ASA preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis and was originally established by the monetary authorities of the five founding member states to help meet temporary liquidity problems. The ASA now includes all ten member states with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among the ASEAN Plus Three has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for member states with balance-of-payments difficulties. In 2009, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) were concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralzation</ref> The CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 and took effect on 20 March 2014 while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. The CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement governed by a single contractual agreement. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse economies and to support the CMIM decision-making process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The amendments would allow access for the ASEAN Plus Three and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an IMF program from 20%\u201330%, and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.<ref>The Amended Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) Comes Into Effect Today, 17 July 2014 Media Releases</ref>\n\nDuring peacetime, the AMRO would conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and prepare quarterly-consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. In a time of crisis, the AMRO would prepare recommendations on any swap request based on macroeconomic analysis of a member state and monitor the use and impact of funds once an application is approved.

It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders.\n\nHowever, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Towards ASEAN Financial Integration</ref> Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.<ref>Cost and Benefits for A Common Currency in ASEAN</ref>\n\n===Free trade===\nFree trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs.

ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the [[foreign minister]]s of five countries: \n[[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and [[Thailand]], signed the [[ASEAN Declaration]]. As set out in the Declaration, the aims and purposes of ASEAN are to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, to promote regional peace, collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest, to provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities, to collaborate for better utilization of agriculture and industry to raise the living standards of the people, to promote [[Southeast Asian studies]] and to maintain close, beneficial co-operation with existing international organisations with similar aims and purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|title=The Asean Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) Bangkok, 8 August 1967|publisher=ASEAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211121705/http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|archivedate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/asean/about-asean/overview|title=Overview|website=asean.org|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of ASEAN was motivated by a common fear of [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author1=Bernard Eccleston |author2=Michael Dawson |author3=Deborah J.

The region's dynamic economic growth during the 1970s strengthened the organization, enabling ASEAN to adopt a unified response to [[Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia|Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia]] in 1979. ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia|Treaty of Amity and Cooperation]], and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the [[Cold War]] allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.<ref>Moon, C.

Masilamani and Peterson summarize it as \"a working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilize compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritizes a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems. Quiet diplomacy allows ASEAN leaders to communicate without bringing the discussions into the public view.

Decision-making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members may not have a common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasize non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination.

The Vision was adopted at the 27th Summit on November 2015 in Kuala Lumpur. The ASEAN community would revise and renew its vision every ten years to provide a framework for continuous development and further integration. The terms in the Vision are divided into four subcategories, namely APSC, AEC, ASCC, and Moving Forward. APSC issues are covered under articles 7 and 8. The former generally states the overall aspiration of the community aiming for a united, inclusive and resilient community. It also puts human and environmental security as crucial points. Deepening engagement with both internal and external parties are also stressed to contribute to international peace, security and stability.<ref>{{cite web|title=ASEAN COMMUNITY VISION 2025|url=http://www.asean.org/storage/images/2015/November/aec-page/ASEAN-Community-Vision-2025.pdf}}</ref> The \"Moving Forward\" subcategory implies the acknowledgement of weaknesses of the institution's capacity to process and coordinate ASEAN work.

Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.{{efn|name=fn1|''ASEAN Financial Integration: The Long Road to Bank Consolidation'' and ''The Philippines' Banking System: The Good, the Bad and the Ambivalent''.}} The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/sp-cites-moves-by-philippine-banks/|title=S&P cites moves by Philippine banks|author=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration \u2013 playing defence and strengthening their domestic networks\".<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\"/>\n\n====Financial integration roadmap====\nThe roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realisation of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalisation, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalisation would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn regards to a common currency, ASEAN leaders agreed in November 1999 to create the establishment of currency swaps and repurchase agreements as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, ASEAN finance ministers agreed to plan for closer cooperation through the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI).<ref>Financial Integration and Common Currency Area in ASEAN</ref> The CMI has two components, an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA), and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the ASEAN Plus Three. The ASA preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis and was originally established by the monetary authorities of the five founding member states to help meet temporary liquidity problems. The ASA now includes all ten member states with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among the ASEAN Plus Three has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for member states with balance-of-payments difficulties. In 2009, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) were concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralzation</ref> The CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 and took effect on 20 March 2014 while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. The CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement governed by a single contractual agreement. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse economies and to support the CMIM decision-making process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The amendments would allow access for the ASEAN Plus Three and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an IMF program from 20%\u201330%, and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.<ref>The Amended Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) Comes Into Effect Today, 17 July 2014 Media Releases</ref>\n\nDuring peacetime, the AMRO would conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and prepare quarterly-consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. In a time of crisis, the AMRO would prepare recommendations on any swap request based on macroeconomic analysis of a member state and monitor the use and impact of funds once an application is approved. AMRO was officially incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in Singapore on 20 April 2011. Governance of AMRO is being exercised by the Executive Committee (EC) and its operational direction by the Advisory Panel (AP). AMRO is currently headed by Dr Yoichi Nemoto of Japan, who is serving his second two-year term until 26 May 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Food security====\nMember states recognise the importance of strengthening [[food security]] to maintain stability and prosperity in the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Security |url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |website=World Health Organisation |accessdate=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917112705/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |archivedate=17 September 2015 |df= }}</ref> As ASEAN moves towards AEC and beyond, food security would be an integral part of the community-building agenda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Desker|first1=Barry|last2=Caballero-Anthony|first2=Mely|last3=Teng|first3=Paul|title=Thought/Issues Paper on ASEAN Food Security: Towards a more Comprehensive Framework|date=Oct 2013|publisher=Nanyang Technological University|location=Singapore |url=http://www.eria.org/ERIA-DP-2013-20.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> Strengthened food security is even more relevant in light of potentially severe risks from climate change with agriculture and fisheries being the most affected industries.<ref>Overland, Indra et al.

[[Trade facilitation]] measures and the harmonisation/equivalency of food regulation and control standards would reduce the cost of trade in food products.

It delivers a challenge to construct dynamic institutions and foster sufficient amount of social capital. The underlying assumption is that the creation of a regional identity is of special interest to ASEAN and the intent of the 2020 Vision policy document was to reassert the belief in a regional framework designed as an action plan related to human development and civic empowerment.

It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders.\n\nHowever, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Towards ASEAN Financial Integration</ref> Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.<ref>Cost and Benefits for A Common Currency in ASEAN</ref>\n\n===Free trade===\nFree trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs.

It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study it, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.<ref>{{cite news|title=New ASEAN community offers export opportunities|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/253874/new-asean-community-offers-export-opportunities.html|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=Vietnam News|date=19 April 2014}}</ref> The [[Asian Development Bank]] also has doubts about Cambodia's ability to meet the AEC deadline.

As the ice melted, [[Lake Stowe]] was formed. When the ice melted completely, the water from the lake ran out through the [[Lamoille River]] valley.\n\nThis area was long occupied by the Algonquian-speaking indigenous [[Abenaki]] people and their ancestors. During French colonization of what is now Canada, fur traders began to trade with the Abenaki. There were also French who settled here, coming down from the settlements in Quebec, and named the Lamoille River. The French later enlisted the Abenaki as allies in the frontier raiding and wars with English colonists in the lower New England colonies. For decades there was no border and peoples passed freely through this area.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War and Vermont's admission as a separate state, the county was settled in the 19th century by American migrants from other parts of New England and French-Canadian immigrants from across the border. Some developed small farms. Some came to work in the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain, which operated into the 20th century. Some gradually moved to other counties where there were cotton mills, weaving cotton from the South both before and after the Civil War. In the United States, many of the French immigrants were forced to accept anglicization of their names, such as New City for Villeneuve, or Senton for St. Onge. Some of their descendants have reclaimed their family's original names.\n\n==20th century to present==\nMining continued through the 20th century. By the late 20th century, environmental hazards were better understood, but many of the miners contracted [[asbestosis]] and other diseases of the lungs from their work.\n\nIn 1972, the Lamoille Community College was the fifth of the several community colleges that became part of the Vermont State Colleges system. At the time, they were renamed as Community College of Vermont.\n\nIn 2008, the state notified residents of Belvidere, Eden, Hyde Park, Johnson, Waterville and eight towns in the adjacent counties of Orleans and Franklin, that a review of health records from 1995 to 2006 had revealed that residents within {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} of the former asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain had higher than normal rates of contracting [[asbestosis]]. The state and federal government continued to study this problem.<ref>{{cite book| author = Rathke, Lisa |title = Neighbors worry about mine's impact on health | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = December 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009 the Vermont Department of health released a revised study which found that all of deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by individual occupational exposure. The report concluded that people living near the mines had no more increased risk of asbestos-related illness than people living anywhere else in Vermont.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthvermont.gov/health-environment/asbestos-lead-buildings/asbestos|title=Overview: Asbestos in Buildings|date=2016-07-18|work=Vermont Department of Health|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the county appeared to have disproportionate power in the legislature with the House Speaker, [[Shap Smith]], from Morrisville, [[Floyd Nease (politician)|Floyd Nease]], house majority leader, Senator [[Susan Bartlett]], from Hyde Park, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, and Richard Westman, chair of the House Transportation Committee and the sole Republican.<ref>{{cite book | author = Remsen, Nancy |title = Quartet hold power positions in 2009 Legislature | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = January 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|464|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|459|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_50.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> It is the second-smallest county in Vermont by area, as well as one of only two Vermont counties that does not share a border with another state or with Quebec.\n\nLamoille County is the only county in Vermont that does not have at least one of Vermont's five U.S. Routes passing through it, although all ten of the Lamoille County towns are served by Vermont state routes.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans County]] \u2014 northeast\n* [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia County]] \u2014 east\n* [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]] \u2014 south\n* [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]] \u2014 west\n* [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]] \u2014 northwest\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 10475\n|1850= 10872\n|1860= 12311\n|1870= 12448\n|1880= 12684\n|1890= 12831\n|1900= 12289\n|1910= 12585\n|1920= 11858\n|1930= 10947\n|1940= 11028\n|1950= 11388\n|1960= 11027\n|1970= 13309\n|1980= 16767\n|1990= 19735\n|2000= 23233\n|2010= 24475\n|estyear=2019\n|estimate=25362\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/vt190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|editor-last=Forstall|editor-first=Richard L.|date=March 27, 1995|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

As the ice melted, [[Lake Stowe]] was formed. When the ice melted completely, the water from the lake ran out through the [[Lamoille River]] valley.\n\nThis area was long occupied by the Algonquian-speaking indigenous [[Abenaki]] people and their ancestors. During French colonization of what is now Canada, fur traders began to trade with the Abenaki. There were also French who settled here, coming down from the settlements in Quebec, and named the Lamoille River. The French later enlisted the Abenaki as allies in the frontier raiding and wars with English colonists in the lower New England colonies. For decades there was no border and peoples passed freely through this area.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War and Vermont's admission as a separate state, the county was settled in the 19th century by American migrants from other parts of New England and French-Canadian immigrants from across the border. Some developed small farms. Some came to work in the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain, which operated into the 20th century. Some gradually moved to other counties where there were cotton mills, weaving cotton from the South both before and after the Civil War. In the United States, many of the French immigrants were forced to accept anglicization of their names, such as New City for Villeneuve, or Senton for St. Onge. Some of their descendants have reclaimed their family's original names.\n\n==20th century to present==\nMining continued through the 20th century. By the late 20th century, environmental hazards were better understood, but many of the miners contracted [[asbestosis]] and other diseases of the lungs from their work.\n\nIn 1972, the Lamoille Community College was the fifth of the several community colleges that became part of the Vermont State Colleges system.

As elsewhere in northern Brittany, the tidal range is among the highest in the world.  Until the seventeenth century it was possible to reach the island at low tide on foot from Saint Malo.\n\nThe island's beach is popular in summer with visitors arriving by yacht or motorboat and there are infrequent excursions from St-Malo, although landing is not possible except at high tide.

The [[Operation Overlord|Normandy campaign]] in the summer of 1944 saw the German-Italian garrison heavily bombarded by land artillery, naval artillery, and air strikes.

In fact the island has always been part of France since the union with Britanny, and was inhabited or used by Breton inhabitants until the end of World War 2 where it was highly bombarded before being liberated along with the rest of Saint-Malo and Britanny. It is a plain part of [[Saint-Malo]], and reachable by pedestrian from the beach. The prohibited zone has created a natural area under protection and only the beach in the allowed zone can be visited. Talossa claims that barbed-wire fence and warning notices are creating a border when it fact it only constitutes a personal protection for safety, and for the local ecosystem (notably sea birds, and maritime plants) that has developed locally since the island is no longer inhabitable. Due to the protection, no economic development and establishment of residence is possible, and the island is also a property of the state, and visited regularly by scientists, French rescuers, so it was never left abandoned by France, even during WW2 when it was occupied by the German army. The island is also fully within the territorial waters of France and the small maritime area (possibly uncovered at low tide by a sand bank) between the island and the continent is part of the interior waters of France. The coasts of the island is also open to pedestrian fishing.\n\nAfter demining operations, the management of the island was transferred from the French ministry of Defense to the ''Conservatoire du littoral'' (an official French public operator) in October 2017, in order to further expand its natural protection and manage the historic and archaeology sites left on the island, including the ruins of chapels and burial sites.\n\n==See also==\n*[[C\u00e9zembre Point]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080812021807/http://www.carphaz.com/Album_Cezembre/ More information on the island of C\u00e9zembre] {{in lang|fr}}\n* [https://archive.is/20130213133651/http://patrimoine.region-bretagne.fr/main.xsp?execute=show_document&id=MERIMEEIA35032908 Page on C\u00e9zembre from the Regional Council of Brittany] {{in lang|fr}}\n* [http://www.kingdomoftalossa.com The official website of Talossa]\n* [http://espresso.repubblica.it/visioni/cultura/2014/09/04/news/cezembre-isola-fortezza-1.178702 Article about C\u00e9zembre by Italian magazine \"L'Espresso\"]\n* [http://www.battlefieldsww2.com/coastal-gun-battery-cezembre.html The German bunkers built on C\u00e9zembre]\n\n{{coord|48|40|36|N|2|4|17|W|type:isle_region:FR|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cezembre}}\n[[Category:Saint-Malo Islands]]\n[[Category:Uninhabited islands of France]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in France]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:C\u00e9zembre.JPG|right|300px|thumb|C\u00e9zembre, seen from the Sillon beach, Saint-Malo]]\n'''C\u00e9zembre''' is an island in [[Brittany]], in the [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] ''[[D\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[France]], near [[Saint-Malo]].

The coasts of the island is also open to pedestrian fishing.\n\nAfter demining operations, the management of the island was transferred from the French ministry of Defense to the ''Conservatoire du littoral'' (an official French public operator) in October 2017, in order to further expand its natural protection and manage the historic and archaeology sites left on the island, including the ruins of chapels and burrial sites.\n\n==See also==\n*[[C\u00e9zembre Point]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080812021807/http://www.carphaz.com/Album_Cezembre/ More information on the island of C\u00e9zembre] {{in lang|fr}}\n* [https://archive.is/20130213133651/http://patrimoine.region-bretagne.fr/main.xsp?execute=show_document&id=MERIMEEIA35032908 Page on C\u00e9zembre from the Regional Council of Brittany] {{in lang|fr}}\n* [http://www.kingdomoftalossa.com The official website of Talossa]\n* [http://espresso.repubblica.it/visioni/cultura/2014/09/04/news/cezembre-isola-fortezza-1.178702 Article about C\u00e9zembre by Italian magazine \"L'Espresso\"]\n* [http://www.battlefieldsww2.com/coastal-gun-battery-cezembre.html The German bunkers built on C\u00e9zembre]\n\n{{coord|48|40|36|N|2|4|17|W|type:isle_region:FR|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cezembre}}\n[[Category:Saint-Malo Islands]]\n[[Category:Uninhabited islands of France]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in France]]\n", "name_user": "Woodlot", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9zembre"}

with the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in the 1970s, the last as captain. He represented for the [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian national side]] on thirty-five occasions, seven times as captain. He had a long coaching career at the first grade level, taking Manly to premiership victory in 1987 and 1996. He coached the Australian national team to thirty-nine Tests and [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] games. He was a [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales State]] selector and a national selector. He is currently a radio commentator with [[2GB]]. In 1985 he was selected as one of the initial four post-war \"[[The Immortals (rugby league)|Immortals]]\" of the Australian game and in 2008 he was named in Australia's team of the century.\n\n==Background==\nFulton was born in [[Stockton Heath]], [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire, England]] and moved to Australia with his family when he was four years old.\n\n==Playing career==\nAt seventeen years of age Fulton made his senior football d\u00e9but in the [[Illawarra Rugby League]] with [[Western Suburbs Red Devils|Western Suburbs]] in 1965 and went on to represent for Country Seconds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Manly-Warringah===\nFulton was signed to Sydney's [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] by club secretary [[Ken Arthurson]] after being spotted by John Hobbs (Manly talent scout) and started his [[NSWRFL]] first grade career in 1966 aged eighteen.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} As a {{rlp|ce}} or {{rlp|fe}} Fulton made an immediate impact. He earned State representative honours in 1967 and the following year became the youngest ever captain in [[Grand Final]] history when he led Manly in the 1968 decider against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Souths]].\n\nFulton made 219 appearances for the [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]] club between 1966 and 1976. He scored 520 points (129 [[Try (rugby)|tries]], 10 [[Field goal (rugby)|goals]] and 56 field goals) \u2013 the club's record try tally until [[Steve Menzies]] went one better in 2006. Fulton won premierships with Manly in [[NSWRFL season 1972|1972]] (also the League's top try-scorer this season), [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]] and [[NSWRFL season 1976|1976]]. In the 1973 bloodbath against [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]] he single-handedly took control of the game scoring two tries to take the side to victory.\n\nAt the end of the 1976 season Fulton caused a sensation in Sydney rugby league circles when he left Manly and signed a 3-year deal with the [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] club. He left Manly holding the club record for most tries.<ref name=\"Club records\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seaeagles.com.au/club-records|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818114958/http://www.seaeagles.com.au/club-records|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 August 2012|title=Club records|publisher=seaeagles.com.au|date=18 August 2012|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Warrington===\nFollowing the [[1969 NSWRFL season]], Fulton accepted an offer to play a season with his 'home town' club [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] in the [[1969\u201370 Northern Rugby Football League season|1969\u201370 English season]]. Fulton played 16 games for Warrington, scoring 16 tries and kicking 1 field goal before returning to Australia and Manly for the [[1970 NSWRFL season|1970 season]].\n\n===Eastern Suburbs===\nFulton played 56 matches for the Eastern Suburbs club, mainly at {{rlp|fe}}. In his first season there Fulton was a member of the side that won the pre-season cup and was the club's leading try scorer. In 1978 he was a member of the Easts side that defeated  [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the  mid-week cup final. In 1979, Fulton was appointed captain-coach at the Roosters. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A chronic knee injury saw him retire after just eight games that year.\n\n===Representative career===\nFulton made his international d\u00e9but for [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] in the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup|1968]] [[Rugby League World Cup]] and played in the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].

Thereafter for the next eleven seasons he was a consistent national representative.\n\nHe toured New Zealand in 1971, was on the [[1973 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1973]] and [[1978 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1978]] [[Kangaroo Tour]]s, played in home [[Rugby League Ashes|Ashes]] series against Great Britain in 1970 and 1974 and the home series against New Zealand in 1972 and 1978. He participated in Australian squads at four World cups \u2013 1968, [[1970 Rugby League World Cup|1970]] (including Australia's 12\u20137 [[1970 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] win over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]]), [[1972 Rugby League World Cup|1972]] (including Australia's 10\u2013all draw Great Britain in the [[1972 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] in [[Lyon]], [[France]], though the Lions would win the tournament as they had finished on top of the ladder) and [[1975 Rugby League World Cup|1975]] (won by Australia). He was named as the World Cup Man of the Series in 1970. The same knee injury that would eventually force his retirement as a player in 1979 would keep him from Australia's winning [[1977 Rugby League World Cup]] squad.\n\nHe was honoured with the Australian captaincy in the 2nd and 3rd Tests of the 1978 series against New Zealand and in all five Tests of the [[1978 Kangaroo Tour]], though that included the 2\u20130 series loss to France at the end of the tour, the last time Australia would lose a series or tournament until the [[2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations]]. Fulton captained his country to a total of 4 wins and 3 losses.\n\nOn both of his Kangaroo Tours Fulton was the leading try scorer \u2013 with 20 tries from 5 Tests and 9 tour matches in 1973 and 9 tries from 5 Tests and 10 tour matches in 1978.\n\nAll told he appeared in 16 representative matches for [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]]. He represented Australia in 20 Test matches, 15 World Cup matches and 22 minor internationals whilst on tour.\n\n==Post playing==\n\n===Coaching career===\nAfter retiring as a player at Easts, Fulton became coach of the Roosters. His was one of the few clubs opposed to the [[rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] concept when it first began and he called it the \"non-event of the century\".<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Gallaway\n| first = Jack\n| authorlink =\n| coauthors =\n| title = Origin: Rugby League's greatest contest 1980\u20132002\n| publisher = [[University of Queensland]] Press\n| year = 2003\n| location = Australia\n| pages = xi\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=3nDbsx3Hk7QC&printsec=frontcover\n| doi =\n| id =\n| isbn = 978-0-7022-3383-8}}</ref> At the end of his first season as coach he took Easts to the [[1980 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1980 Grand Final]] where they were beaten by [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]].

In [[1987 NSWRL season|1987]] he guided the [[Paul Vautin]] captained Sea Eagles side to a premiership victory over the [[Canberra Raiders]] in the last Grand Final played at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], becoming in the process the first person at Manly to win premierships both as captain and as coach. Following the grand final victory he travelled with Manly to England for the [[1987 World Club Challenge]] against their champions, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], though the Sea Eagles were beaten in a tryless game 8-2.\n\nFrom 1989 Fulton took on the job as coach of the [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian national side]].

On each occasion the Australians were taken to a deciding Test.\n\nIn [[1993 NSWRL season|1993]] Fulton returned to Manly as coach and he guided the club the three successive Grand Finals from [[1995 ARL season|1995]]. Fulton won his second and last premiership as a coach in [[1996 ARL season#Grand Final|1996]] when in their 50th season the Sea Eagles defeated St George 20\u20138 in a win at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n===Super League war===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2016}}\nAs national coach during the [[Super League war]] Fulton played a prime role along with NSW State coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] in signing players to stabilise the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] competition. Fulton was a longstanding and loyal friend of [[Kerry Packer]] who wholeheartedly backed the ARL and his own commercial interests and rights to broadcast the traditional game.\n\n===Selector===\nSince 1999, Fulton has been a selector of the [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] and Australian sides.<ref>{{cite news|author=Roy Masters|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Blues' retro logic ideal challenge for Gaz|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/blues-retro-logic-ideal-challenge-for-gaz/2006/07/04/1151778938936.html|accessdate=5 May 2009|date=5 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Commentator===\nFrom 1997, Fulton has been a member of the [[Continuous Call Team]] first on radio [[2UE]], and later on Radio [[2GB]] currently with [[Ray Hadley]], [[Erin Molan]], [[Darryl Brohman]], [[Mark Levy]], [[David Morrow (sportscaster)|David Morrow]] and [[Mark Riddell]] .\n\n===National Service===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}\nFulton was conscripted into the Army in 1968 and allotted to artillery.

He earned State representative honours in 1967 and the following year became the youngest ever captain in [[Grand Final]] history when he led Manly in the 1968 decider against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Souths]].\n\nFulton made 219 appearances for the [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]] club between 1966 and 1976. He scored 520 points (129 [[Try (rugby)|tries]], 10 [[Field goal (rugby)|goals]] and 56 field goals) \u2013 the club's record try tally until [[Steve Menzies]] went one better in 2006. Fulton won premierships with Manly in [[NSWRFL season 1972|1972]] (also the League's top try-scorer this season), [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]] and [[NSWRFL season 1976|1976]]. In the 1973 bloodbath against [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]] he single-handedly took control of the game scoring two tries to take the side to victory.\n\nAt the end of the 1976 season Fulton caused a sensation in Sydney rugby league circles when he left Manly and signed a 3-year deal with the [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] club.

Fulton played 16 games for Warrington, scoring 16 tries and kicking 1 field goal before returning to Australia and Manly for the [[1970 NSWRFL season|1970 season]].\n\n===Eastern Suburbs===\nFulton played 56 matches for the Eastern Suburbs club, mainly at {{rlp|fe}}. In his first season there Fulton was a member of the side that won the pre-season cup and was the club's leading try scorer. In 1978 he was a member of the Easts side that defeated  [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the  mid-week cup final. In 1979, Fulton was appointed captain-coach at the Roosters. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A chronic knee injury saw him retire after just eight games that year.\n\n===Representative career===\nFulton made his international d\u00e9but for [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] in the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup|1968]] [[Rugby League World Cup]] and played in the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].

He participated in Australian squads at four World cups \u2013 1968, [[1970 Rugby League World Cup|1970]] (including Australia's 12\u20137 [[1970 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] win over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]]), [[1972 Rugby League World Cup|1972]] (including Australia's 10\u2013all draw Great Britain in the [[1972 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] in [[Lyon]], [[France]], though the Lions would win the tournament as they had finished on top of the ladder) and [[1975 Rugby League World Cup|1975]] (won by Australia). He was named as the World Cup Man of the Series in 1970. The same knee injury that would eventually force his retirement as a player in 1979 would keep him from Australia's winning [[1977 Rugby League World Cup]] squad.\n\nHe was honoured with the Australian captaincy in the 2nd and 3rd Tests of the 1978 series against New Zealand and in all five Tests of the [[1978 Kangaroo Tour]], though that included the 2\u20130 series loss to France at the end of the tour, the last time Australia would lose a series or tournament until the [[2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations]]. Fulton captained his country to a total of 4 wins and 3 losses.\n\nOn both of his Kangaroo Tours Fulton was the leading try scorer \u2013 with 20 tries from 5 Tests and 9 tour matches in 1973 and 9 tries from 5 Tests and 10 tour matches in 1978.\n\nAll told he appeared in 16 representative matches for [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]].
