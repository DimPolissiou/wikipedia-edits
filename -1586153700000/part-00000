Michael Franzese did not intend to participate in organized crime; he enrolled in a [[pre-med]] program at [[Hofstra University]], but dropped out to make money for his family after his father was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery in 1967. Franzese helped implement a scheme to defraud the federal government out of gasoline taxes in the early 1980s.\n\nBy the age of 35, in 1986, ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' listed Franzese as number 18 on its list of the \"Fifty Most Wealthy and Powerful Mafia Bosses\". Franzese had claimed that at the height of his career, he was making up to $8 million per week. In 1986, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison on conspiracy charges, released in 1989, rearrested in 1991 for a parole violation, ultimately being released in 1994. While in prison, he became a [[born-again Christian]], and in 1995, he retired to California with his wife and children. Franzese has publicly denounced the life of organized crime and became a [[motivational speaker]] and a writer.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nFranzese was born on May 27, 1951, in the [[Brooklyn]] borough of New York City, to [[John \"Sonny\" Franzese]], a [[Colombo crime family]] [[underboss]], and Cristina Capobianco-Franzese, although it is not entirely certain that Sonny is Michael's biological father.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nysun.com/new-york/godfather-betrayed-by-his-namesake-part-ii/54689/|title=A Godfather Betrayed by His Namesake, Part II|publisher=nysun.com|date=May 17, 2007}}</ref> He later moved to [[Long Island]], which would become home to his countless number of operations.

In the late 1970s, the family moved to the Bay Area.\n\nSon of the late civil rights activist Angel Manuel Alderete,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/novato-ca/angel-alderete-7554571|title=Angel Manuel Alderete Obituary - Novato, CA|website=Dignity Memorial|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref> he was exposed to [[jazz]] music on a weekly basis by his father, who often played it around the Alderete household. Juan decided to pick up the bass after he and his friends decided to start a band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/juan_alderete_our_band_on_tour_is_myself_lisa_and_the_ipad_thats_our_drummer.html}}</ref> Other early influences included his brother's [[progressive rock]] albums, which included bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[King Crimson]], etc. He started learning the basics of the bass guitar when he was 16, and was influenced by such players as [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Geddy Lee]], and [[Stanley Clarke]]. Some of his other influences include Jamaladeen Tacuma and John Entwistle, the bass player for the Who. His fascination with the bass guitar revolved around it being a somewhat \"underappreciated\" instrument at the time.\n\nAlderete enrolled in [[Musicians Institute]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] (Los Angeles, CA).  He enjoyed his time in the school, explaining that he was able to learn techniques and styles that he had never even considered prior to his enrollment. Alderete and fellow student [[Paul Gilbert]] started their musical relationship during an audition that Alderete held to find a drummer. Alderete showed up at the audition, bringing a Musician's Institute student and drum-playing friend named Bill Lescohier.  Although Lescohier was turned down for the part, Gilbert was impressed with Alderete's bass playing; the two quickly sought to form a [[speed metal]] band that would incorporate Gilbert's advanced [[neoclassical metal]] guitar technique with Alderete's solid bass lines.  To complete the band, [[Harry Gschoesser]] joined to fill the drummer position, and [[Jeff Martin (American musician)|Jeff Martin]] became the vocalist; the group named themselves [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] (a title that Lescohier had suggested).  With this lineup, the band released their debut album, ''Street Lethal'', in 1986. Alderete has been recording with Racer X ever since (note: there was a ten-year hiatus starting from 1989), and their latest album was released in 2002, titled ''Getting Heavier''.

la Pe\u00f1a''' (born September 5, 1963) is an American musician, best known as the longtime bassist of [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] and [[the Mars Volta]].\n\n==Biography==\nAlderete was born in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, CA]] the fourth of five children.  In the late 1970s, the family moved to the Bay Area.\n\nSon of the late civil rights activist Angel Manuel Alderete,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/novato-ca/angel-alderete-7554571|title=Angel Manuel Alderete Obituary - Novato, CA|website=Dignity Memorial|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref> he was exposed to [[jazz]] music on a weekly basis by his father, who often played it around the Alderete household. Juan decided to pick up the bass after he and his friends decided to start a band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/juan_alderete_our_band_on_tour_is_myself_lisa_and_the_ipad_thats_our_drummer.html}}</ref> Other early influences included his brother's [[progressive rock]] albums, which included bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[King Crimson]], etc. He started learning the basics of the bass guitar when he was 16, and was influenced by such players as [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Geddy Lee]], and [[Stanley Clarke]]. Some of his other influences include Jamaladeen Tacuma and John Entwistle, the bass player for the Who. His fascination with the bass guitar revolved around it being a somewhat \"underappreciated\" instrument at the time.\n\nAlderete enrolled in [[Musicians Institute]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] (Los Angeles, CA).  He enjoyed his time in the school, explaining that he was able to learn techniques and styles that he had never even considered prior to his enrollment. Alderete and fellow student [[Paul Gilbert]] started their musical relationship during an audition that Alderete held to find a drummer. Alderete showed up at the audition, bringing a Musician's Institute student and drum-playing friend named Bill Lescohier.  Although Lescohier was turned down for the part, Gilbert was impressed with Alderete's bass playing; the two quickly sought to form a [[speed metal]] band that would incorporate Gilbert's advanced [[neoclassical metal]] guitar technique with Alderete's solid bass lines.  To complete the band, [[Harry Gschoesser]] joined to fill the drummer position, and [[Jeff Martin (American musician)|Jeff Martin]] became the vocalist; the group named themselves [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] (a title that Lescohier had suggested).  With this lineup, the band released their debut album, ''Street Lethal'', in 1986. Alderete has been recording with Racer X ever since (note: there was a ten-year hiatus starting from 1989), and their latest album was released in 2002, titled ''Getting Heavier''. Alderete is credited as John Alderete on all Racer X albums.\n\nHowever, four years after the creation of the band, Gilbert left Racer X to form the band [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]].  The remaining members of Racer X decided to stay active in music, although they went their separate ways.  For the next ten years, Alderete would be involved in several different bands (including The Scream, DC-10, [[Big Sir (band)|Big Sir]], and Distortion Felix) as well as becoming an instructor at Musicians Institute.  Not long after, he released his first instructional video on bass techniques and [[Modulation (music)|modulation]].\n\nAlthough ''Extreme Volume II: Live'' was released in 1992, Racer X was not actually reunited.

He decides to follow his impulse and imagination and hitches a ride on a riverboat queen, bidding farewell to the city. Only when the boat pulls out does he see the \"good side of the city\"\u2014which, for him, is one in the distance, far removed from his life. Down by the river and on the boat, the singer finds protection from \"the man\" and salvation from his working-class pains in the nurturing spirit and generosity of simple people who \"are happy to give\" even \"if you have no money.\" The river in Fogerty and traditionally in literature and song is a place holding biblical and epical implications. ...

After the lyrics are first sung softly by the Turners, the song is then turned into a [[funk rock]] vamp with Tina and the Ikettes delivering gospel-influenced vocals.\n\nThe single peaked at No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart on March 27, 1971, two years after the original by Creedence Clearwater Revival was at its peak.

In 1988, a live version was included on the album ''[[Tina Live in Europe]]''. Tina later re-recorded the song in the studio for the biopic's 1993 soundtrack album [[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|of the same name]]. This track was released as a promotional single issued to radio stations and DJs. Tina's solo performance was later included on her 2004 greatest hits album ''[[All the Best (Tina Turner album)|All the Best]]''. After a contestant's take on the song on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2010, it entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 62 and fell to No. 121 the next week; it also entered the [[Scottish Singles and Albums Chart|Scottish Singles Chart]] at No. 40.

Only when the boat pulls out does he see the \"good side of the city\"\u2014which, for him, is one in the distance, far removed from his life. Down by the river and on the boat, the singer finds protection from \"the man\" and salvation from his working-class pains in the nurturing spirit and generosity of simple people who \"are happy to give\" even \"if you have no money.\" The river in Fogerty and traditionally in literature and song is a place holding biblical and epical implications. ...

Burke recalls: \"We went to [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio|Muscle Shoals]] and recorded Proud Mary, which they didn't like at all. They thought it was stupid to record a song Proud Mary, which was already on the charts. I was explaining to them that it was a very big record, but it's a very white record, a pop record. We will redo the record, open up the doors for it to get on the r&b charts and make the black stations to play the record ... It was a Solomon Burke record made in Muscle Shoals. We proved that we can make a hit record without [[Jerry Wexler]] eating sandwiches with us. This record was a hit without anybody's help. Proud Mary was only promoted by Tamiko Jones and myself.\" According to Mark Denning, \"While that may have seemed like a bald-faced bid for pop radio play, in Burke's hands the song became a bracing tale of life in the [[Deep South]] as African-Americans searched for liberation aboard the ship that carried them as slaves and put them to undignified labor serving wealthy whites.\"<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/artist/the-soul-clan/chart-history/418664#/album/solomon-burke/proud-mary/26666/review The Soul Clan Album & Song Chart History].

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
