Its main editorial focus was on life in [[Paris]] for both residents and visitors. Launched on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid, ''Passion'' eventually evolved into a glossy 140-page magazine.\n\n''Passion'' was conceived as a forum for the written word and to showcase the visual side of Paris. It regularly published excellent photography and benefited from the pool of creative illustrators in Paris. The magazine\u2019s use of strong eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity.\n\n==History==\nLaunched in November 1981, Paris Passion was an English-language [[magazine]] in France that existed until early 1991. Its main [[editorial]] focus was on life in Paris for both residents and visitors. Also known as ''Passion'', it featured an eclectic mix of feature [[journalism]], interviews with leading figures in Paris, city consumer advice, coverage of French [[arts]], [[culture]], [[politics]], [[design]], [[architecture]], [[food]] and [[fashion]] and was also a regular showcase for excellent [[photography]].  For many years, ''Passion'' also had a detachable events-listings section, published short fiction by Paris-based writers, a French-language section, and a separate fashion supplement called ''Accent''.\n[[Image:Paris Passion-Issue 1.jpg|thumbnail|First Issue, November 1981]]\nDespite good distribution and a relatively high profile in Paris, ''Passion'' was more a critical success than a financial one. Its financial struggle undermined the magazine's full editorial potential. ''Passion'' began on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid and eventually evolved into a full-fledged glossy 140-page magazine. Over its nine-plus years, ''Passion'' published 78 issues.\n\nAt its peak, the circulation reached 50,000 copies, with almost a quarter of that distributed outside France. It was sold and displayed prominently in news kiosks and bookstores in Paris and even had street hawkers selling it in certain parts of the city. It was available in international newsstands in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[London]], and [[Amsterdam]] and had subscribers in many countries.\n\nIn addition to its practical information and extensive arts and [[entertainment]] coverage, ''Passion'' became popular also for its often irreverent and humorous (but not mocking) take on the [[French people|French]] and the challenges and idiosyncrasies of Paris life.\n\nIt did not shy away from serious issues. It tackled everything from the political intrigues at Paris City Hall to [[urban planning]] fiascoes to [[anti-Semitism]] in France to drug-related social problems in Paris to the plight of North African immigrants in France and a variety of environmental concerns.\n\n''Passion'' can be seen as part of the time-honored tradition of expatriate English-language publishing in Paris that dates back to the early 20th century. Over the years, there have been numerous, mostly literary, publications published in English in the French capital, most of them short-lived.\n\n''Passion'' was founded by expatriate Canadian journalist Robert Sarner. He moved to Paris in 1979 from [[Toronto]] where he had begun his career in journalism a few years earlier. Before starting ''Passion'', Sarner took part in the Paris-based 'Journalists In Europe' fellowship program. His partners in the magazine were Michael Budman and Don Green, both originally from [[Detroit]] and the co-founders of Roots Canada Ltd. (a successful apparel company and lifestyle brand). Sarner was the Editor-in-Chief and Publisher, while Budman and Green were the Executive Publishers. Sarner had first met Budman and Green in Canada a few years earlier when he approached them for investment in a city magazine that he had hoped to launch in Toronto.\n\nIn 1988, the London-based city magazine ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' purchased the majority of ''Paris Passion''. ''Time Out'''s owner Tony Elliott became the co-publisher with Robert Sarner who also remained the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nUnder the new ownership, ''Passion'' adopted a more conventional physical format, expanded its staff and moved into new, better-equipped headquarters. Two and a half years later, following a difference of opinion over the direction of the magazine, Elliott squeezed out Sarner in mid-1990. Elliott then brought in staff from London, redesigned the magazine, and changed the editorial style from American to British. But the business faltered further and ''Time Out'' ended up closing the magazine in 1991.\n\nIn the 1990s, ''Time Out'' used the ''Paris Passion'' name in conjunction with some of the annual Paris guides it published during that period.\n\n==Editorial content==\n''Paris Passion'' was conceived as both a forum for the written word and a showcase of the visual side of the [[city]]. One of its main objectives was to engage both the minds and the eyes of readers. To that end, the magazine drew on a wealth of freelance talent based in Paris that shared the editorial aims of its editors. Despite limited financial means, ''Passion'' featured well-established [[journalists]], [[photographers]] and [[illustrators]] while also developing many younger writers who had rarely been published before.\n\n===Writers===\nAs a magazine based in, and focused on, Paris, ''Passion'' attracted a wide range of talented expatriate writers and journalists eager to have their work published in English in a creative magazine circulated both in France and abroad.  Some were longtime Paris residents, others were more recent arrivals. Most of the writers came from English-speaking counties, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India; others were French, (especially during the period when each issue of ''Passion'' published several pages in French). Collectively, they wrote many [[Article (publishing)|articles]], [[columns]], reviews and short stories that in one way or another related to Paris.\n\nThe following are some of the writers who contributed to ''Passion'' (listed in alphabetical order): [[Kathy Acker]], [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]], Chris Boicos, Clement Barclay.

Its visual presentation, most of which focused on Paris, was an important part of its appeal.\n\n===Photography===\nStarting with its first issue, ''Paris Passion'' always showed an appreciation for good photography, devoting generous space to photo essays, portfolios and [[portraits]] of Parisians. Photography was an intrinsic part of the magazine and helped shaped its identity. It was a natural development given the large number of talented photographers and leading photo agencies and galleries in Paris.\n\nOn a regular basis, ''Passion'' showcased the work of some of the world's leading photographers working in Paris. In the process, the magazine earned an enviable reputation for the quality of images featured in its pages.\n\nThe following are some of the photographers who worked with ''Passion'' and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): Jim Allen, Arnaud Bauman, [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], Clement Barclay, Chalkie Davies, Francois Dischinger, Barry Dunne, Christophe Galatry, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], Frank Horvat, Benjamin Kanarek, [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], Xavier Lambours, Antoine LeGrand, Elizabeth Lennard, Erica Lennard, Jonathan Lennard, Berangere Lomont, Wily Maywald, Doug Metzler, Jacques Mitelman, [[Jean-Baptiste Mondino]], [[Helmut Newton]], Scott Osman, Andre Ostier, Ian Patrick, Alain Potignon, Ray Reynolds, [[Bettina Rheims]], David Rochline, [[David Seidner]], Jean-Loup Sieff, Alice Springs, Lawrence Sudre, Keichi Tahara, Patrick Trautwein, [[Peter Turnley]], [[Ellen von Unwerth]], Javier Vallhonrat, Claus Wickrath, Patrick Wilen, Michael Williams, Rafael Winer.\n\n===Illustration===\nAs part of its design, ''Paris Passion'' also benefited from the enormous pool of gifted illustrators in Paris. It commissioned many French and expatriate illustrators to create images to enhance editorial content in the magazine.\n\nThe following are some of the illustrators who worked with ''Passion'' and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): [[:fr:Fran\u00e7ois Avril (illustrateur)|Fran\u00e7ois Avril]], Jean-Paul Buquet, Helene Cote, Milo Daax, Jean-Philippe Delhomme, Bil Donovan, Blair Drawson, David Dudu Geva, Diana Huff, Myles Hyman, [[Antonio Lopez (illustrator)|Antonio Lopez]], [[Patricia Marx]], Tina Mercier, Philippe Petit-Roulet, Patricia Reznikav, Michael Roberts, Hippolyte Romain, Laurie Rosenwald, Tignous, Solweig Vonkleist.\n\n===Art direction===\nAmong the graphic artists and art directors who worked with ''Passion'' and contributed to the look of the magazine were Layne Jackson, Nancy Dorking, Judith Christ, Scott Minick, Tony Judge and R\u00e9my Magron.\n\n==The Front Covers==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"255px\">\nFile:Issue 61.jpg|Issue 61, May 1989\nFile:Issue 56.jpg|Issue 56, Summer 1988\nFile:Issue 36.jpg|Issue 36, November 1984 \nFile:Issue 27.jpg|Issue 27, October 1983\nFile:Issue 24, May 1983.jpg|Issue 24, May 1983\nFile:Issue 16, Summer 1982.jpg|Issue 16, Summer 1982\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Street hawker in Paris.jpg|thumb|<center>Street vendor proposing Paris Passion in the Caf\u00e9 Costes in Paris</center>]]\nLike the rest of the magazine, ''Paris Passion'''s front covers evolved considerably from the time of its first issue in 1981 until the last in 1991. The changes included going from black-and-white images to those in full color; from newsprint to glossy stock; from celebrity portraits to more conceptual illustrations; and different logos and varying approaches to the use of text.\n\nDuring the life of ''Passion'', its use of strong, eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity. ''Passion'' favored simple, clean, bold, colorful images to grab the attention of readers. It stemmed, in part, from the fact that as a magazine relying mainly on newsstands for its distribution, it had to stand out from other publications in order to establish and promote itself, especially in the absence of any marketing budget.\n\nIn Paris, in addition to its presence on newsstands and in kiosks, ''Passion'' also had a network of \"street hawkers\" who sold the magazine. They circulated in places where potential readers would congregate, from hip cafes and restaurants to major cultural events, fashion shows and tourist attractions where hawkers would hold up the latest issue for all to see, and hopefully buy. The cover played a critical role in determining the perception and sales of the magazine.\n\nIn the pursuit of effective images for its covers, ''Passion'' drew from the presence of many excellent photographers and illustrators in Paris (see text above). They liked seeing their work showcased on the covers of ''Passion'', thanks to its large size, its relatively unobtrusive cover text and good visibility in Paris kiosks and in international bookstores and newsstands in major cities outside France.\n\n==References==\n*[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WE&s_site=kansas&p_multi=WE&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADB43D4F1E45D8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM MAGAZINE PARIS PASSION DECIDES TO STOP PUBLISHING]\n*[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Time-Out-Group-Ltd-Company-History.html Time Out Company History]\n*[http://robertsarner.com/paris_passion.html A selection of ''Paris Passion'' covers]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paris Passion Magazine}}\n[[Category:1991 disestablishments in France]]\n[[Category:1981 establishments in France]]\n[[Category:Defunct magazines of France]]\n[[Category:French magazines]]\n[[Category:English-language magazines]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 1981]]\n[[Category:Magazines disestablished in 1991]]\n[[Category:Magazines published in Paris]]\n[[Category:Canadian local interest magazines]]\n[[Category:City guides]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox newspaper\n|name=Paris Passion\n|image=Paris Passion magazine Logo.JPG\n|image_size=200px\n|type=City Magazine\n|format=[[Magazine]]\n|foundation=1981\n|ceased publication=1991\n|owners=\n|price=\n|publisher=Robert Sarner, Michael Budman, Don Green, Tony Elliott\n|editor=Robert Sarner\n|political=\n|headquarters= [[Paris]], France\n|ISSN = \t0293-0781}}\n\n'''''Paris Passion''''', also known as ''Passion'', was an English-language city magazine in France that existed from 1981 to 1991.

Also known as ''Passion'', it featured an eclectic mix of feature [[journalism]], interviews with leading figures in Paris, city consumer advice, coverage of French [[arts]], [[culture]], [[politics]], [[design]], [[architecture]], [[food]] and [[fashion]] and was also a regular showcase for excellent [[photography]].  For many years, ''Passion'' also had a detachable events-listings section, published short fiction by Paris-based writers, a French-language section, and a separate fashion supplement called ''Accent''.\n[[Image:Paris Passion-Issue 1.jpg|thumbnail|First Issue, November 1981]]\nDespite good distribution and a relatively high profile in Paris, ''Passion'' was more a critical success than a financial one. Its financial struggle undermined the magazine's full editorial potential.

He was one of the most important producers-directors of the German silent cinema. Zelnik achieved success through period operetta films in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|Bock|Bergfelder|2009|pp=548\u2013549}}\n\n==Biography==\nFriedrich Zelnik was born into a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in Czernowitz, today in [[Ukraine]], at the time the capital of the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] in the Austrian part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]. After studying in [[Vienna]], Friedrich Zelnik worked as an actor in theaters in [[N\u00fcrnberg]], [[Theater Aachen|Aachen]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Prague]] and finally [[Berlin]] - in the theaters Theater an der K\u00f6nigsgr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe, Berliner Theater, and Kom\u00f6dienhaus.\n\nIn 1914 Friedrich Zelnik began acting in films, and after 1915 producing and directing movies while still appearing in roles as an actor in other director'films. In 1918 he married a young Polish ballet dancer turned film actress named [[Lya Mara]] and promoted her to stardom by producing and directing movies for her. In 1920 he established a film production firm Zelnik-Mara-Film GmbH.\n\nPopular, operetta style costume films like ''[[The Blue Danube (1926 film)|The Blue Danube]]'', ''[[The Bohemian Dancer (1926 film)|The Bohemian Dancer]]'', ''[[Dancing Vienna]]'', ''[[Mariett Dances Today]]'' brought [[Lya Mara]] and Zelnik enormous success in Germany and beyond. Several of his collaborators, such as cameraman [[Frederik Fuglsang]] and production designer [[Andr\u00e9 Andrejew]] are perceived today as important artists of the German silent cinema.\n\nUpon the introduction of [[sound film]], Friedrich Zelnik became the first director in Europe to [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|postsynchronize]] a movie, ''[[Der rote Kreis (1929 film)|The Crimson Circle]]'' (1929), using the [[Lee DeForest|DeForest]] [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process. In 1930, Zelnik traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] and upon his return to Germany, directed his first full sound film, a new version of his silent success ''[[The Bohemian Dancer (1926 film)|The Bohemian Dancer]]''.\n\nAfter [[Hitler]] took power in 1933, Zelnik and [[Lya Mara]] left Germany for [[London]]. In the following years, Zelnik continued to direct and produce movies in Great Britain and The Netherlands. He also legally changed his name to '''Frederic Zelnik''' and took British citizenship.\n\nZelnik died in 1950 in London.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n===Director===\n* ''[[His Majesty the

He was one of the most important producers-directors of the German silent cinema. Zelnik achieved success through period operetta films in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|Bock|Bergfelder|2009|pp=548\u2013549}}\n\n==Biography==\nFriedrich Zelnik was born into a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in Czernowitz, today in [[Ukraine]], at the time the capital of the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] in the Austrian part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]. After studying in [[Vienna]], Friedrich Zelnik worked as an actor in theaters in [[N\u00fcrnberg]], [[Theater Aachen|Aachen]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Prague]] and finally [[Berlin]] - in the theaters Theater an der K\u00f6nigsgr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe, Berliner Theater, and Kom\u00f6dienhaus.\n\nIn 1914 Friedrich Zelnik began acting in films, and after 1915 producing and directing movies while still appearing in roles as an actor in other director'films. In 1918 he married a young Polish ballet dancer turned film actress named [[Lya Mara]] and promoted her to stardom by producing and directing movies for her. In 1920 he established a film production firm Zelnik-Mara-Film GmbH.\n\nPopular, operetta style costume films like ''[[The Blue Danube (1926 film)|The Blue Danube]]'', ''[[The Bohemian Dancer (1926 film)|The Bohemian Dancer]]'', ''[[Dancing Vienna]]'', ''[[Mariett Dances Today]]'' brought [[Lya Mara]] and Zelnik enormous success in Germany and beyond. Several of his collaborators, such as cameraman [[Frederik Fuglsang]] and production designer [[Andr\u00e9 Andrejew]] are perceived today as important artists of the German silent cinema.\n\nUpon the introduction of [[sound film]], Friedrich Zelnik became the first director in Europe to [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|postsynchronize]] a movie, ''[[Der rote Kreis (1929 film)|The Crimson Circle]]'' (1929), using the [[Lee DeForest|DeForest]] [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process. In 1930, Zelnik traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] and upon his return to Germany, directed his first full sound film, a new version of his silent success ''[[The Bohemian Dancer (1926 film)|The Bohemian Dancer]]''.\n\nAfter [[Hitler]] took power in 1933, Zelnik and [[Lya Mara]] left Germany for [[London]]. In the following years, Zelnik continued to direct and produce movies in Great Britain and The Netherlands. He also legally changed his name to '''Frederic Zelnik''' and took British citizenship.\n\nZelnik died in 1950 in London.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n===Director===\n* ''[[His Majesty the Hypochondriac]]'' (1918)\n* ''[[Charlotte Corday (film)|Charlotte Corday]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[The Heiress of the Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Anna Karenina (1920 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[Kri-Kri, the Duchess of Tarabac]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[Fanny Elssler (1920 film)|Fanny Elssler]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[Count Varenne's Lover]]'' (1921)\n* ''[[The Girl from Piccadilly]]'' (1921)\n* ''[[Trix, the Romance of a Millionairess]]'' (1921)\n* ''[[Miss Beryll]]'' (1921)\n* ''[[Memoirs of a Film Actress]]'' (1921)\n* ''[[Count Festenberg]]'' (1922)\n* ''[[Napoleon's Daughter]]'' (1922)\n* ''[[The Mistress of the King]]'' (1922)\n* ''[[Insulted and Humiliated]]'' (1922)\n* ''[[Yvette, the Fashion Princesss]]'' (1922)\n* ''[[The Marriage of Princess Demidoff]]'' (1922)\n* ''[[Tania, the Woman in Chains]]'' (1922)\n* ''[[Lyda Ssanin]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[Resurrection (1923 film)|Resurrection]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[The Men of Sybill]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[Irene of Gold]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[The Girl from Hell]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[Daisy (1923 film)|Daisy]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[The Girl from Capri]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[The Sailor Perugino]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[Marionettes of the Princess]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[The Mistress of Monbijou]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[Nelly, the Bride Without a Husband]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[By Order of Pompadour]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[Athletes (film)|Athletes]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[Letters Which Never Reached Him]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[Women You Rarely Greet]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[The Venus of Montmartre]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[The Bohemian Dancer (1926 film)|The Bohemian Dancer]]'' (1926)\n* ''[[The Mill at Sanssouci]]'' (1926)\n* ''[[The Violet Eater]]'' (1926)\n* ''[[The Blue Danube (1926 film)|The Blue Danube]]'' (1926)\n* ''[[Fadette]]'' (1926)\n* ''[[The Weavers (1927 film)|The Weavers]]'' (1927)\n* ''[[Dancing Vienna]]'' (1927)\n* ''[[The Gypsy Baron (1927 film)|The Gypsy Baron]]'' (1927)\n* ''[[Mariett Dances Today]]'' (1928)\n* ''[[Mary Lou (1928 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1928)\n* ''[[My Heart is a Jazz Band]]'' (1929)\n* ''[[The Crimson Circle (1929 film)|The Crimson Circle]]'' (1929)\n* ''[[The Forester's Daughter (1931 film)|The Forester's Daughter]]'' (1931)\n* ''[[Everyone Asks for Erika]]'' (1932)\n* ''[[The Dancer of Sanssouci]]'' (1932)\n* ''[[Happy (1933 film)|Happy]]'' (1933)\n* ''[[The Emperor's Waltz (1933 film)|The Emperor's Waltz]]'' (1933)\n* ''[[Southern Roses]]'' (1936)\n* ''[[The Lilac Domino (film)|The Lilac Domino]]'' (1937)\n* ''[[Daddy Long Legs (1938 film)|Daddy Long Legs]]'' (1938)\n* ''[[Tomorrow It Will Be Better]]'' (1939)\n* ''[[I Killed the Count]]'' (1939)\n\n===Producer===\n* ''[[The Lost Paradise (1917 film)|The Lost Paradise]]'' (1917)\n* ''[[The Serenyi]]'' (1918)\n* ''[[The Peruvian]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[The Yellow Diplomat]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[The Princess of the Nile]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[The Law of the Desert]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[The Convict of Cayenne]]'' (1921)\n* ''[[The Buried Self]]'' (1921)\n* ''[[The Bank Crash of Unter den Linden]]'' (1926)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book | editor-first1 = Hans-Michael | editor-last1 = Bock | editor-link1 = Hans-Michael Bock | editor-first2 = Tim | editor-last2 = Bergfelder | title = The Concise Cinegraph: Encyclopaedia of German Cinema | publisher = Berghahn Books | year = 2009 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-57181-655-9 |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb name|0954673}}\n\n{{Frederic Zelnik}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zelnik, Friedrich}}\n[[Category:1885 births]]\n[[Category:1950 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Chernivtsi]]\n[[Category:People from the Duchy of Bukovina]]\n[[Category:Bukovina Jews]]\n[[Category:German people of Austrian-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:German people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Silent film directors]]\n[[Category:German film directors]]\n[[Category:German male film actors]]\n[[Category:German male silent film actors]]\n[[Category:20th-century German male actors]]\n[[Category:German-language film directors]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed a typo.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Zelnik"}
