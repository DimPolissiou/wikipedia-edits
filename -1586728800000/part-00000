Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918\u20131942) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref> a job he disliked.<ref name=Dornan1 />\n\nUnhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure \u2013 walking through western Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref name = Dornan1 /> In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.<ref name=Dornan1 /> They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury.<ref name = Dornan1 /> As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist.

The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.<ref name=Dornan2/>\n\nKingsbury, along with the rest of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940.

Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918\u20131942) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref> a job he disliked.<ref name=Dornan1 />\n\nUnhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure \u2013 walking through western Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref name = Dornan1 /> In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.<ref name=Dornan1 /> They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury.<ref name = Dornan1 /> As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 29 May 1940.<ref name=WW2Roll>{{citation|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&veteranId=431320|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n===Middle East===\nKingsbury was originally assigned to the [[2/2nd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/2nd Pioneer Battalion]], but requested a transfer to the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]] to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted on the same day at a different recruitment centre.<ref name=adb /><ref name=Dornan2>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=19\u201326}}</ref> The pair undertook basic training at [[Puckapunyal]], where they were assigned to the same [[Section (military unit)|section]] (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training.<ref name=Dornan2/> After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.<ref name=Dornan2/>\n\nKingsbury, along with the rest of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940.

While hunting with William, Caleb asks if Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach [[Heaven]]. William encourages Caleb to not raise the question and later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup and suspects her to be responsible for Samuel's abduction. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family.\n\nEarly the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check a trap in the forest and forces him to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. In the woods, the two spot a hare, which sends their horse into a panic and their dog Fowler promptly chases. Caleb pursues, while the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. Deep in the woods, he comes across a hovel, where a beautiful young woman emerges and seduces him.  Once Caleb is close enough, however, the woman's arm becomes old and decrepit and grabs Caleb. William finds Thomasin and takes her home where Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods before William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's cup. Katherine does not allow Thomasin the chance to explain that she was there to help keep watch over Caleb.\n\nLater that evening, Caleb has found his way home and Thomasin discovers him outdoors in the rain, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. When he awakens the next day, Caleb expels a bloody apple from his mouth; Katherine believes it to be [[Christian views on witchcraft|witchcraft]]. Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies, though Katherine believes Caleb to have been under some sort of spell. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, Thomasin reveals to the parents that the twins have had conversations with Black Phillip, the family's [[British primitive goat|billy goat]]. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. Thomasin overhears William break down and confess to God that he has been [[pride]]ful and made his family leave their old village out of stubbornness rather than sincere religious devotion. Later in the night, the three children are woken by the sounds of rustling in the goat house and discover an old woman drinking milk from the goats. Meanwhile, inside the house, Katherine awakens to a vision of Caleb holding Samuel. After a brief discussion, Caleb offers Samuel to Katherine so she may breast feed the baby but the baby is shown to be in fact a crow that is pecking away at her breast.\n\nThe next day William awakens and walks outside to find the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. An unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and accusing her of trying to seduce William and Caleb, attacks Thomasin, who kills her mother with a cleaver in self-defense.\n\nAlone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds by asking if Thomasin would like to \"live deliciously\" and materializes into a [[Satan|tall, devilishly handsome, black-clad man]]. Black Phillip orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears before her.

One day, Thomasin is playing [[peekaboo]] with Samuel when the baby abruptly disappears and it is soon revealed that a [[Witchcraft|witch]] has stolen the [[infant baptism|unbaptized]] Samuel, killing him and using his remains to make a [[flying ointment]].<ref name=\"ATWMWTFME\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/02/23/the_witch_director_robert_eggers_on_the_real_history_behind_the_movie_s.html |title=All The Witch's Most WTF Moments, Explained: A Spoiler-Filled Interview With the Director |last1=Wickman |first1=Forrest |last2=Eggers |first2=Robert |date=February 23, 2016 |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKatherine, devastated by Samuel's disappearance, spends her days crying and praying. While hunting with William, Caleb asks if Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach [[Heaven]]. William encourages Caleb to not raise the question and later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup and suspects her to be responsible for Samuel's abduction. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family.\n\nEarly the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check a trap in the forest and forces him to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. In the woods, the two spot a hare, which sends their horse into a panic and their dog Fowler promptly chases. Caleb pursues, while the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. Deep in the woods, he comes across a hovel, where a beautiful young woman emerges and seduces him.  Once Caleb is close enough, however, the woman's arm becomes old and decrepit and grabs Caleb. William finds Thomasin and takes her home where Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods before William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's cup. Katherine does not allow Thomasin the chance to explain that she was there to help keep watch over Caleb.\n\nLater that evening, Caleb has found his way home and Thomasin discovers him outdoors in the rain, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. When he awakens the next day, Caleb expels a bloody apple from his mouth; Katherine believes it to be [[Christian views on witchcraft|witchcraft]]. Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies, though Katherine believes Caleb to have been under some sort of spell. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, Thomasin reveals to the parents that the twins have had conversations with Black Phillip, the family's [[British primitive goat|billy goat]]. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. Thomasin overhears William break down and confess to God that he has been [[pride]]ful and made his family leave their old village out of stubbornness rather than sincere religious devotion. Later in the night, the three children are woken by the sounds of rustling in the goat house and discover an old woman drinking milk from the goats. Meanwhile, inside the house, Katherine awakens to a vision of Caleb holding Samuel. After a brief discussion, Caleb offers Samuel to Katherine so she may breast feed the baby but the baby is shown to be in fact a crow that is pecking away at her breast.\n\nThe next day William awakens and walks outside to find the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. An unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and accusing her of trying to seduce William and Caleb, attacks Thomasin, who kills her mother with a cleaver in self-defense.\n\nAlone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds by asking if Thomasin would like to \"live deliciously\" and materializes into a [[Satan|tall, devilishly handsome, black-clad man]]. Black Phillip orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears before her. Thomasin follows Black Phillip into the forest, where she joins a [[coven]] of witches holding a [[Witches' Sabbath]] around a bonfire. The coven begins to levitate and a laughing Thomasin joins them, ascending above the trees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Thomasin\n* [[Ralph Ineson]] as William\n* [[Kate Dickie]] as Katherine\n* Harvey Scrimshaw as Caleb\n* Ellie Grainger as Mercy\n* Lucas Dawson as Jonas\n* [[Julian Richings]] as The Governor\n* Bathsheba Garnett as Witch\n* [[Sarah Stephens]] as Young Witch\n* Charlie as Black Phillip (goat form)<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/black-phillip-real-story-behind-871974 |title=Black Phillip: The Real Story Behind the Breakout Goat From 'The Witch' |date=March 2, 2016 |last=Abramovitch |first=Seth |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref>\n* Wahab Chaudhry as Black Phillip (voice, human form)\n* Axtun Henry Dube and Athan Conrad Dube as Samuel\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nEggers, who was born in New Hampshire, was inspired to write the film by his childhood fascination with [[witchcraft|witches]] and frequent visits to the [[Plimoth Plantation]] as a schoolboy.

Learning that Nili is a virgin, Momo brags to his friends that he will seduce, then dump her, much to Benzi's dismay. However, Benzi is too dependent on his friends and too reluctant to ruin their friendship to warn Nili of Momo's intentions, and must watch as Momo and Nili begin dating. Momo finally takes Nili's virginity, leaving her pregnant. Benzi rushes in to emotionally console Nili and helps her to get an abortion, hoping that she will grow to love him for his support, only to be crushed when Nili and Momo reconcile and resume dating.\n\nThe film contains the memorable{{by whom|date=August 2018}} scene with an older [[Aliyah|olah]] named Stella ([[Ophelia Shtruhl]]) enticing the three boys into having sex with her, earning the nickname \"Stella HaMegameret\" (\"A-cumming Stella\") after she screams \"I'm a-cumming!

For instance, some spellings seen as \"American\" today were once commonly used in Britain and some spellings seen as \"British\" were once commonly used in the United States. A \"British standard\" began to emerge following the 1755 publication of [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'', and an \"American standard\" started following the work of [[Noah Webster]] and in particular his ''[[Webster's Dictionary|An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'', first published in 1828.<ref name=\"Micklethwait2005\">{{cite book|author=David Micklethwait|title=Noah Webster and the American Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIRCsrMwhroC&pg=PA137|date=1 January 2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2157-2|pages=137}}</ref>\n\nWebster's efforts at [[spelling reform]] were somewhat effective in his native country, resulting in certain well-known patterns of spelling differences between the American and British [[varieties of English]]. However, [[English-language spelling reform]] has rarely been adopted otherwise, and so modern [[English orthography]] varies somewhat between countries and is far from [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] in any country.\n\n== Historical origins ==\n{{Multiple image\n| width = 120\n| image1 = Webster Orthography 1828 (4-14).jpg\n| image2 = Webster Orthography 1828 (15).jpg\n| footer = Extract from the Orthography section of the first edition (1828) of [[Noah Webster|Webster]]'s \"[[Webster's Dictionary|ADEL]]\", which popularized the \"American standard\" spellings of ''-er''&nbsp;(6); ''-or''&nbsp;(7); the dropped ''-e''&nbsp;(8); ''-or''&nbsp;(10); ''-se''&nbsp;(11); and the doubling of consonants with a suffix (15).\n}}\n[[File:British spellings in NEJM 1814.jpg|left|thumb|An 1814 American medical text showing British English spellings that were still in use (\"tumours\", \"colour\", \"centres\", etc.).]]\n\nIn the early 18th century, [[English spelling]] was inconsistent. These differences became noticeable after the publishing of influential [[Dictionary|dictionaries]]. Today's [[British English]] spellings mostly follow Johnson's ''A Dictionary of the English Language'' (1755), while many [[American English]] spellings follow Webster's ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'' (\"ADEL\", \"Webster's Dictionary\", 1828).<ref>{{cite book |last=Scragg |first=Donald |title=A history of English spelling |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester, England |year=1974 |pages=82\u201383 |quote=Johnson's dictionary became the accepted standard for private spelling&nbsp;... of a literate Englishman&nbsp;... during the nineteenth century&nbsp;...

In ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2008), John Algeo notes: \"it is often assumed that characteristically American spellings were invented by Noah Webster. He was very influential in popularizing certain spellings in America, but he did not originate them. Rather&nbsp;[\u2026] he chose already existing options such as ''center, color'' and ''check'' for the simplicity, analogy or etymology\".<ref>Algeo, John, \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language\" in ''A Companion to the American Revolution'', John Wiley & Sons: 2008, p. 599.</ref> [[William Shakespeare]]'s first folios, for example, used spellings like ''center'' and ''color'' as much as ''centre'' and ''colour''.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=-or&allowed_in_frame=0 ''-or''].

In Britain, the influence of those who preferred the [[Norman language|Norman]] (or [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]]) spellings of words proved to be decisive. Later spelling adjustments in the United Kingdom had little effect on today's American spellings and vice versa.\n\nFor the most part, the spelling systems of most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] and [[Ireland]] closely resemble the British system. In [[Canada]], the spelling system can be said to follow both British and American forms,<ref name=\"Clark, 2009\">Clark, 2009.</ref> and Canadians are somewhat more tolerant of foreign spellings when compared with other English-speaking nationalities.<ref>Chambers, 1998.</ref> [[Australian spelling]] has also strayed slightly from British spelling, with some American spellings incorporated as standard.<ref name=\"Fourth Edition 2005\">''The Macquarie Dictionary'', Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.</ref> [[New Zealand English|New Zealand spelling]] is almost identical to British spelling, except in the word ''fiord'' (instead of ''fjord''). There is also an increasing use of [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s in words that originated in [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and an unambiguous preference for ''-ise'' endings (see below).\n\n==Latin-derived spellings (often through Romance)==\n\n==={{Anchor|our_or}}''-our'', ''-or''===\nMost words ending in an unstressed ''-our'' in British English (e.g., {{lang|en-GB|''[[wikt:colour|colour]]'', ''[[wikt:flavour|flavour]]'', ''[[wikt:behaviour|behaviour]],'' ''[[wikt:harbour|harbour]]'', ''[[wikt:honour|honour]]'', ''[[wikt:humour|humour]]'', ''[[wikt:labour|labour]]'', ''[[wikt:neighbour|neighbour]]'', ''[[wikt:rumour|rumour]]'', ''[[wikt:splendour|splendour]]''|italic=unset}}) end in ''-or'' in American English ({{lang|en-US|''[[wikt:color|color]]'', ''[[wikt:flavor|flavor]]'', ''[[wikt:behavior|behavior]]'', ''[[wikt:harbor|harbor]]'', ''[[wikt:honor|honor]]'', ''[[wikt:humor|humor]]'', ''[[wikt:labor|labor]]'', ''[[wikt:neighbor|neighbor]]'', ''[[wikt:rumor|rumor]]'',  ''[[wikt:splendor|splendor]]''|italic=unset}}).

Many words of the ''-our/or'' group do not have a Latin counterpart that ends in ''-or''; for example, ''armo(u)r'', ''behavio(u)r'', ''harbo(u)r'', ''neighbo(u)r''; also ''[[Pergola|arbo(u)r]]'', meaning \"shelter\", though senses \"tree\" and \"tool\" are always ''[[wikt:arbor|arbor]]'', a [[false cognate]] of the other word. Some 16th- and early 17th-century British scholars indeed insisted that ''-or'' be used for words from Latin (e.g., ''{{lang|en-US|color}}'')<ref name=\"SOED_1987\"/> and ''-our'' for French loans; but in many cases the etymology was not clear, and therefore some scholars advocated ''-or'' only and others ''-our'' only.<ref name=\"Peters, p. 397\">Peters, p. 397.</ref>\n\nWebster's 1828 dictionary had only ''-or'' and is given much of the credit for the adoption of this form in the United States. By contrast, Johnson's 1755 (pre-U.S. independence and establishment) dictionary used ''-our'' for all words still so spelled in Britain (like ''colour''), but also for words where the ''u'' has since been dropped: ''ambassadour'', ''emperour'', ''governour'', ''perturbatour'', ''inferiour'', ''superiour''; ''errour'', ''horrour'', ''mirrour'', ''tenour'', ''terrour'', ''tremour''. Johnson, unlike Webster, was not an advocate of spelling reform, but chose the spelling best derived, as he saw it, from among the variations in his sources. He preferred French over Latin spellings because, as he put it, \"the French generally supplied us\".<ref>Johnson 1755\u2014preface</ref> English speakers who moved to America took these preferences with them, and [[H.

''{{lang|en-US|Honor}}'' and ''{{lang|en-GB|honour}}'' were equally frequent in Britain until the 17th century;<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, ''honour, honor''.</ref> ''honor'' still is, in the UK, the usual spelling as a person's name and appears in ''[[Honor Oak]]'', a district of [[London]].\n\n====Derivatives and inflected forms====\nIn derivatives and inflected forms of the ''-our/or'' words, British usage depends on the nature of the suffix used. The ''u'' is kept before English suffixes that are freely attachable to English words (for example in {{lang|en-GB|''[[wikt:neighbourhood|neighbourhood]]'', ''[[wikt:humourless|humourless]]'', and ''[[wikt:savoury|savoury]]''|italic=unset}}) and suffixes of Greek or Latin origin that have been adopted into English (for example in {{lang|en-GB|''[[wikt:favourite|favourite]]'', ''[[wikt:honourable|honourable]]'', and ''[[wikt:behaviourism|behaviourism]]''|italic=unset}}). However, before Latin suffixes that are not freely attachable to English words, the ''u'':\n* may be dropped, for example in ''[[wikt:honorary|honorary]]'', ''[[wikt:honorific|honorific]]'', ''[[wikt:humorist|humorist]]'', ''[[wikt:vigorous|vigorous]]'', ''[[wikt:humorous|humorous]]'', ''[[wikt:laborious|laborious]]'', and ''[[wikt:invigorate|invigorate]]'';\n* may be either dropped or kept, for example in ''colo(u)ration'' and ''colo(u)rize ''or'' colourise''; or\n* may be kept, for example in ''{{lang|en-GB|[[wikt:colourist|colourist]]}}''.<ref name=\"Webster's Third, p. 24a\"/>\n\nIn American usage, derivatives and inflected forms are built by simply adding the suffix in all cases (for example, ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:favorite|favorite]]}}'', ''{{lang|en-US|[[savouriness|savory]]}}'' etc.) since the ''u'' is absent to begin with.\n\n====Exceptions====\nAmerican usage, in most cases, keeps the ''u'' in the word ''[[wikt:glamour|glamour]]'', which comes from [[Scots language|Scots]], not Latin or French. ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:glamor|Glamor]]}}'' is sometimes used in imitation of the spelling reform of other ''-our'' words to ''-or''. Nevertheless, the adjective ''[[wikt:glamorous|glamorous]]'' often drops the first \"u\". ''{{lang|en-GB|[[wikt:saviour|Saviour]]}}'' is a somewhat common variant of ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:savior|savior]]}}'' in the US. The British spelling is very common for ''{{lang|en-GB|honour}}'' (and ''{{lang|en-GB|favour}}'') in the formal language of [[wedding invitation]]s in the US.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Letitia Baldrige's Complete Guide to the New Manners for the '90s: A Complete Guide to Etiquette |first=Letitia |last=Baldrige |authorlink=Letitia Baldrige |year=1990 |publisher=Rawson |isbn=0-89256-320-6 |page=214}}</ref> The name of the {{lang|en-GB|[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']]|italic=unset}} has a ''u'' in it as the [[spacecraft]] was named after [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]'s ship, {{lang|en-GB|[[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']]|italic=unset}}. The special car on [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Coast Starlight]]'' train is known as the [[Pacific Parlour]] car, not ''Pacific Parlor''. [[Proper name]]s such as ''[[Pearl Harbor]]'' or ''[[Sydney Harbour]]'' are usually spelled according to their native-variety spelling vocabulary.\n\nThe name of the herb ''[[Satureja|savory]]'' is thus spelled everywhere, although the related adjective ''savo(u)ry'', like ''savo(u)r'', has a ''u'' in the UK. ''Honor'' (the name) and ''arbor'' (the tool) have ''-or'' in Britain, as mentioned above, as does the word ''pallor''. As a general noun, ''[[rigour]]'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259r}} has a ''u'' in the UK; the medical term ''[[rigor (medicine)|rigor]]'' (sometimes {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|a\u026a|\u0261|\u0259r}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rigor|title=rigor - definition of rigor in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=}}</ref> does not, such as in ''rigor mortis'', which is Latin. Derivations of ''rigour''/''rigor'' such as ''rigorous'', however, are typically spelled without a ''u'' even in the UK. Words with the ending ''-irior'', ''-erior'' or similar are spelled thus everywhere.\n\nThe word [[armour]] was once somewhat common in American usage but has disappeared except in some brand names such as [[Under Armour]].\n\nThe cardinal numbers ''[[wikt:four|four]]'' and ''[[wikt:fourteen|fourteen]]'', when written as words, are always spelled with a ''u'', as are the ordinal numbers ''[[wikt:fourth|fourth]]'' and ''[[wikt:fourteenth|fourteenth]]''. ''[[wikt:forty|Forty]]'' and ''[[wikt:fortieth|fortieth]]'', however, are always spelled without a ''u''.\n\n====Commonwealth usage====\nCommonwealth countries normally follow British usage. [[Canadian English]] most commonly uses the ''-our'' ending and ''-our-'' in derivatives and inflected forms. However, owing to the close historic, economic, and cultural relationship with the United States, ''-or'' endings are also sometimes used. Throughout the late 19th and early to mid-20th century, most Canadian newspapers chose to use the American usage of ''-or'' endings, originally to save time and money in the era of manual [[movable type]].<ref name=OC31Mar1990>{{cite news |title=Practical concerns spelled the end for -our |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=31 March 1990 |page=B3 |first=William |last=MacPherson }}</ref> However, in the 1990s, the majority of Canadian newspapers officially updated their spelling policies to the British usage of ''-our''. This coincided with a renewed interest in Canadian English, and the release of the updated Gage Canadian Dictionary in 1997 and the first Oxford Canadian Dictionary in 1998. Historically, most libraries and educational institutions in Canada have supported the use of the Oxford English Dictionary rather than the American Webster's Dictionary. Today, the use of a distinctive set of Canadian English spellings is viewed by many Canadians as one of the cultural uniquenesses of Canada (especially when compared to the United States).\n\nIn Australia, ''-or'' endings enjoyed some use throughout the 19th century and in the early 20th century. Like Canada, though, most major Australian newspapers have switched from \"''-or''\" endings to \"''-our''\" endings. The \"''-our''\" spelling is taught in schools nationwide as part of the Australian curriculum. The most notable countrywide use of the ''-or'' ending is for the {{lang|en-US|[[Australian Labor Party]]}}, which was originally called \"the Australian Labour Party\" (name adopted in 1908), but was frequently referred to as both \"Labour\" and \"Labor\". The \"Labor\" was adopted from 1912 onward due to the influence of the {{lang|en-US|[[American labor movement]]}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Labor: History|url=http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/labor-history/|work=ALP.org.au|access-date=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617043320/http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/labor-history/|archive-date=17 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[King O'Malley]]. Aside from that, ''-our'' is now almost universal in Australia. [[New Zealand English]], while sharing some words and syntax with [[Australian English]], follows British usage.\n\n==={{Anchor|re_er|er re|-re -er|-er -re}}''-re'', ''-er''===\nIn British English, some words from French, Latin or Greek end with a consonant followed by an unstressed ''-re'' (pronounced {{IPA|/\u0259(r)/}}).

Following this, ''-re'' became the most common usage in Britain. In America, following the publication of [[Webster's dictionary]] in the early 19th century, American English started exclusively using ''-er''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, some words have been changed from ''-re'' to ''-er'' in both varieties. These include ''[[wikt:chapter|chapter]]'', ''[[wikt:December|December]]'', ''[[wikt:disaster|disaster]]'', ''[[wikt:enter|enter]]'', ''[[wikt:filter|filter]]'', ''[[wikt:letter|letter]]'', ''[[wikt:member|member]]'', ''[[wikt:minister|minister]]'', ''[[wikt:monster|monster]]'', ''[[wikt:November|November]]'', ''[[wikt:number|number]]'', ''[[wikt:October|October]]'', ''[[wikt:offer|offer]]'', ''[[wikt:oyster|oyster]]'', ''[[wikt:powder|powder]]'', ''[[wikt:proper|proper]]'', ''[[wikt:September|September]]'', ''[[wikt:sober|sober]]'' and ''[[wikt:tender|tender]]''. Words using the ''\"-meter\"'' suffix (from Ancient Greek -[[wikt:\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]] ''m\u00e9tron'', via French ''[[wikt:-m\u00e8tre|-m\u00e8tre]]'') normally had the ''-re'' spelling from earliest use in English but were superseded by ''-er''. Examples include ''[[wikt:thermometer|thermometer]]'' and ''[[wikt:barometer|barometer]]''.\n\nThe ''e'' preceding the ''r'' is kept in American inflected forms of nouns and verbs, for example, {{lang|en-US|''fibers'', ''reconnoitered'', ''centering''|italic=unset}}, which are {{lang|en-GB|''fibres'', ''reconnoitred'', and ''centring''|italic=unset}} respectively in British English. ''{{lang|en-GB|Centring}}'' is an interesting example, since, according to the ''OED'', it is a ''\"word ... of 3 syllables (in careful pronunciation)\"''<ref>(Oxford English Dictionary: Second edition).</ref> (i.e., {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025bnt\u0259r\u026a\u014b/}}), yet there is no vowel in the spelling corresponding to the second syllable ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}). The OED third edition (revised entry of June 2016) allows either two or three syllables.  The three-syllable version is listed as only the American pronunciation of ''centering'' on the [[OED|Oxford Dictionaries Online]] website. The ''e'' is dropped for other derivations, for example, ''central'', ''fibrous'', ''spectral''. However, the existence of related words without ''e'' before the ''r'' is not proof for the existence of an ''-re'' British spelling: for example, ''entry'' and ''entrance'' come from ''enter'', which has not been spelled ''entre'' for centuries.<ref>From the ''OED'' cites, Chaucer used both forms, but the last usages of the \"re\" form were in the early 18th century. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'': 1989 edition.</ref>\n\nThe difference relates only to root words; ''-er'' rather than ''-re'' is universal as a suffix for agentive (''reader'', ''winner'', ''user'') and comparative (''louder'', ''nicer'') forms. One outcome is the British distinction of ''[[wikt:meter|meter]]'' for a [[measuring instrument]] from ''{{lang|en-GB|metre}}'' for [[Metre|the unit of length]]. However, while \"{{lang|en-GB|[[Metre (poetry)|poetic metre]]}}\" is often ''-re'', [[Iambic pentameter|pentameter]], [[hexameter]] etc. are always ''-er''.<ref>Except in a 1579 usage (Oxford English Dictionary: 1989 edition).</ref>\n\n====Exceptions====\nMany other words have ''-er'' in British English. These include Germanic words; such as ''anger'', ''mother'', ''timber'' and ''water'' and Romance words ''danger'', ''quarter'' and ''river''.\n\nThe ending ''-cre'', as in ''[[acre]]'',<ref name=\"acre/louvre\">Although ''acre'' was spelled ''\u00e6cer'' in Old English and ''aker'' in [[Middle English]], the ''acre'' spelling of [[Middle French]] was introduced in the 15th century. Similarly, ''loover'' was respelled in the 17th century by influence of the unrelated [[Louvre]]. (See ''OED'', s.v. ''acre'' and ''louvre'')</ref> ''[[wikt:lucre|lucre]]'', ''[[wikt:massacre|massacre]]'', and ''[[wikt:mediocre|mediocre]]'', is used in both British and American English to show that the ''c'' is pronounced {{IPA|/k/}} rather than {{IPA|/s/}}. The spellings ''ogre'' and ''euchre'' are also the same in both British and American English.\n\n{{Anchor|Theatre}} ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:theater|Theater]]}}'' is the prevailing American spelling used to refer to both the dramatic arts and buildings where stage performances and screenings of films take place (i.e., \"{{lang|en-US|movie theaters}}\"); for example, a national newspaper such as ''The New York Times'' would use ''{{lang|en-US|theater}}'' in its entertainment section.

For example, the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] has a \"Department of ''Theatre'' and Drama\", which offers courses that lead to the \"Bachelor of Arts in ''Theatre''\", and whose professed aim is \"to prepare our graduate students for successful 21st Century careers in the ''theatre'' both as practitioners and scholars\".<ref>https://theatre.wisc.edu/</ref>\n\nSome placenames in the United States use ''[[wikt:centre|Centre]]'' in their names. Examples include the [[Stonebriar Centre]] mall, the cities of [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] and [[Centreville, Illinois|Centreville]], [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]] and [[Centre College]]. Sometimes, these places were named before spelling changes but more often the spelling merely serves as an affectation.\n\nFor British ''{{lang|en-GB|accoutre}}'', the American practice varies: the ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' prefers the ''-re'' spelling,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=accouter |title=accoutre |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> but ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' prefers the ''-er'' spelling.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/A0044600.html accouter]</ref>\n\nMore recent French loanwords keep the ''-re'' spelling in American English. These are not exceptions when a French-style pronunciation is used ({{IPA|/r\u0259/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u0259(r)/}}), as with ''[[double entendre]]'', ''[[wikt:genre|genre]]'' and ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]''. However, the unstressed {{IPA|/\u0259(r)/}} pronunciation of an ''-er'' ending is used more (or less) often with some words, including ''[[wikt:cadre|cadre]]'', ''[[wikt:macabre|macabre]]'', ''[[ma\u00eetre d']]'', [[wikt:Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], ''[[wikt:piastre|piastre]]'', and ''[[wikt:timbre|timbre]]''.\n\n====Commonwealth usage====\nThe ''-re'' endings are mostly standard throughout the Commonwealth. The ''-er'' spellings are recognized as minor variants in Canada, partly due to American influence, and are sometimes used in proper names (such as Toronto's controversially named [[Centerpoint Mall (Toronto)|Centerpoint Mall]]).<ref>Peters, p&nbsp;461.</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|ce_se}}''-ce'', ''-se''===\nFor ''[[wiktionary:advice|advice]]''/''[[wiktionary:advise|advise]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:device|device]]''/''[[wiktionary:devise|devise]]'', American English and British English both keep the noun\u2013verb distinction both graphically and phonetically (where the pronunciation is -{{IPA|/s/}} for the noun and -{{IPA|/z/}} for the verb). For ''[[wiktionary:licence|licence]]/[[wiktionary:license|license]]'' or ''[[wiktionary:practice|practice]]/[[wiktionary:practise|practise]]'', British English also keeps the noun\u2013verb distinction graphically (although phonetically the two words in each pair are [[homophone]]s with -{{IPA|/s/}} pronunciation). On the other hand, American English uses ''[[wiktionary:license|license]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:practice|practice]]'' for both nouns and verbs (with -{{IPA|/s/}} pronunciation in both cases too).\n\nAmerican English has kept the Anglo-French spelling for ''[[wiktionary:defense|defense]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:offense|offense]]'', which are ''[[wiktionary:defence|defence]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:offence|offence]]'' in British English.

The ''-ue'' is absent worldwide in related words like ''analogy'', ''analogous'', and ''analogist''.\n\nBoth British and American English use the spelling ''-gue'' with a silent ''-ue'' for certain words that are not part of the ''-ogue'' set, such as ''tongue'' (cf. [[:wikt:tong|tong]]), ''plague'', ''vague'', and ''league.'' In addition, when the ''-ue'' is not silent, as in the words ''argue,'' ''ague'' and ''segue,'' all varieties of English use ''-gue.''\n\n====Commonwealth usage====\nIn Canada, ''e'' is usually preferred over ''oe'' and often over ''ae'',{{Citation needed|date=September 2009|reason=I absolutely disagree...I rarely see anyone up here not preferring ae to e.}} but ''oe'' and ''ae'' are sometimes found in the academic and scientific writing as well as government publications (for example the fee schedule of the [[Ontario Health Insurance Plan]]). In Australia, ''encyclopedia'' and ''medieval'' are spelled with ''e'' rather than ''ae'', as with American usage, and the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' also notes a growing tendency towards replacing ''ae'' and ''oe'' with ''e'' worldwide.<ref name=\"Fourth Edition 2005\"/> Elsewhere, the British usage prevails, but the spellings with just ''e'' are increasingly used.<ref>Peters, p. 20, p. 389.</ref> ''Manoeuvre'' is the only spelling in Australia, and the most common one in Canada, where ''maneuver'' and ''manoeuver'' are also sometimes found.<ref>Peters, p. 338.</ref>\n\n==Doubled consonants==\nThe plural of the noun ''bus'' is usually  ''buses'', with ''busses'' a minor American variant.<ref name=\"bus_cald\"/> Conversely, inflections of the verb ''bus'' usually double the ''s'' in British (''busses, bussed, bussing'') but not American (''buses, bused, busing'').<ref name=\"bus_cald\">{{cite web |title=bus |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bus?q=bus_1 |website=Cambridge English Dictionary |accessdate=19 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Doubled in British English===\nThe final consonant of an English word is sometimes doubled in both American and British spelling when adding a suffix beginning with a vowel, for example ''strip/stripped'', which prevents confusion with ''stripe/striped'' and shows the difference in pronunciation (see [[Digraph (orthography)#Double letters|digraph]]). Generally, this happens only when the word's final syllable is stressed and when it also ends with a lone vowel followed by a lone consonant. In British English, however, a final ''-l'' is often doubled even when the final syllable is unstressed.<ref name=\"Peters, p. 309\">Peters, p. 309.</ref> This exception is no longer usual in American English, seemingly because of [[Noah Webster]].<ref>Cf. Oxford English Dictionary, ''traveller, traveler''.</ref> The ''-ll-'' spellings are nevertheless still deemed acceptable variants by both Merriam-Webster Collegiate and American Heritage dictionaries.\n* The British English doubling is used for all inflections (''-ed'', ''-ing'', ''-er'', ''-est'') and for the noun suffixes ''-er'' and ''-or''. Therefore, British English usage is ''cancelled'', ''counsellor'', ''cruellest'', ''labelled'', ''modelling'', ''quarrelled'', ''signalling'', ''traveller'', and ''travelling''. Americans typically use ''canceled'', ''counselor'', ''cruelest'', ''labeled'', ''modeling'', ''quarreled'', ''signaling'', ''traveler'', and ''traveling''. However, for certain words such as ''cancelled'', the ''-ll-'' spelling is very common in American English as well.\n** The word ''parallel'' keeps a single ''-l-'' in British English, as in American English (''paralleling'', ''unparalleled''), to avoid the unappealing cluster ''-llell-''.\n** Words with two vowels before a final ''l'' are also spelled with ''-ll-'' in British English before a suffix when the first vowel either acts as a consonant (''equalling'' and ''initialled''; in the United States, ''equaling'' or ''initialed''), or belongs to a separate syllable (British ''fu\u2022el\u2022ling'' and ''di\u2022alled''; American ''fu\u2022el\u2022ing'' and ''di\u2022aled'').\n*** British ''woollen'' is a further exception due to the double vowel (American: ''woolen''). Also, ''wooly'' is accepted in American English, though ''woolly'' prevails in both systems.<ref>Peters, p. 581</ref>\n*** The verb ''surveil'', a [[back-formation]] from ''surveillance'', always makes ''surveilling'', ''surveilled''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/surveil|title=Surveil|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=3 January 2018}}; {{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/surveil|title=British & World English > surveil|work=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n* Endings ''-ize''/''-ise'', ''-ism'', ''-ist'', ''-ish'' usually do not double the ''l'' in British English; for example, ''normalise'', ''dualism'', ''novelist'', and ''devilish''.\n** Exceptions: ''tranquillise''; ''duellist'', ''medallist'', ''panellist'', and sometimes ''triallist'' in British English.\n* For ''-ous'', British English has a single ''l'' in ''scandalous'' and ''perilous'', but the \"ll\" in ''marvellous'' and ''libellous''.\n* For ''-ee'', British English has ''libellee''.\n* For ''-age'', British English has ''[[pupillage]]'' but ''vassalage''.\n* American English sometimes has an unstressed ''-ll-'', as in the UK, in some words where the root has ''-l''. These are cases where the change happens in the source language, which was often Latin. (Examples: ''bimetallism'', ''cancellation'', ''chancellor'', ''crystallize'', ''excellent'', ''tonsillitis'', and ''raillery''.)\n* All forms of English have ''compelled'', ''excelling'', ''propelled'', ''rebelling'' (notice the stress difference); ''revealing'', ''fooling'' (note the double vowel before the l); and ''hurling'' (consonant before the ''l'').\n* Canadian and Australian English mostly follow British usage.<ref name=\"Peters, p. 309\"/>\n\nAmong consonants other than ''l'', practice varies for some words, such as where the final syllable has [[secondary stress]] or an unreduced vowel. In the United States, the spellings ''kidnaped'' and ''worshiped'', which were introduced by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in the 1920s,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/news/media/chicago2.php |title=Errant Spelling: Moves for simplification turn Inglish into another langwaj |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=8 June 1997 |pages=Section 3A page 14 |accessdate=17 March 2007 |first=Eric |last=Zorn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703161726/http://www.spellingsociety.org/news/media/chicago2.php |archive-date=3 July 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> are common, but ''kidnapped'' and ''worshipped'' prevail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kidnapped|title=Definition of KIDNAPPED|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/worshipped|title=Definition of WORSHIPPED|publisher=}}</ref> ''Kidnapped'' and ''worshipped'' are the only standard British spellings. However, ''focused'' is the predominant spelling in both British and American English, ''focussed'' being just a minor variant in British English.<ref>https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/focused</ref>\n\nMiscellaneous:\n* British ''calliper'' or ''caliper''; American ''caliper''.\n* British ''jewellery''; American ''jewelry''. The word originates from the Old French word ''jouel''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lazarosoho.com/Jewelry-vs-Jewellery_b_54.html | title=Jewelry vs. Jewellery | publisher=Lazaro Soho | accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> (whose contemporary French equivalent is ''joyau'', with the same meaning). The standard pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|u\u02d0|\u0259|l|r|i}}<ref>''Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?dict=CALD&key=42648&ph=on jewellery UK, American jewelry]</ref> does not reflect this difference, but the non-standard pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|u\u02d0|l|\u0259r|i}} (which exists in New Zealand and Britain, hence the Cockney rhyming slang word ''tomfoolery'' {{IPAc-en|t|\u0252|m|\u02c8|f|u\u02d0|l|\u0259r|i}}) does. According to Fowler, ''jewelry'' used to be the \"rhetorical and poetic\" spelling in the UK, and was still used by ''[[The Times]]'' into the mid-20th century. Canada has both, but ''jewellery'' is more often used. Likewise, the Commonwealth (including Canada) has ''jeweller'' and the US has ''jeweler'' for a jewel(le)ry seller.\n\n===Doubled in American English===\nConversely, there are words where British writers prefer a single ''l'' and Americans a double ''l''. In American usage, the spelling of words is usually not changed when they form the main part (not prefix or suffix) of other words, especially in newly formed words and in words whose main part is in common use. Words with this spelling difference include\n''wil(l)ful'', ''skil(l)ful'', ''thral(l)dom'', ''appal(l)'', ''fulfil(l)'', ''fulfil(l)ment'', ''enrol(l)ment'', ''instal(l)ment''. These words have monosyllabic cognates always written with ''-ll'': ''will'', ''skill'', ''thrall'', ''pall'', ''fill'', ''roll'', ''stall''. Cases where a single ''l'' nevertheless occurs in both American and British English include ''null''\u2192''annul'', ''annulment''; ''till''\u2192''until'' (although some prefer ''til'' to reflect the single ''l'' in ''until'', sometimes using an apostrophe ('''til''); this should be considered a [[hypercorrection]] as ''till'' predates the use of ''until''); and others where the connection is not clear or the monosyllabic cognate is not in common use in American English (e.g., ''null'' is used mainly as a technical term in law, mathematics, and computer science).\n\nIn the UK, a single ''l'' is generally preferred in ''distil(l)'', ''instil(l)'', ''enrol(l)'', and ''enthral(l)ment'', and ''enthral(l)'', although ''ll'' was formerly used;<ref>''OED'' Second Edition</ref> these are always spelled with ''ll'' in American usage. The former British spellings ''instal'', ''fulness'', and ''dulness'' are now quite rare.<ref>Peters, p. 283</ref> The Scottish ''[[tolbooth]]'' is cognate with ''[[Tollbooth (disambiguation)|tollbooth]]'', but it has a distinct meaning.\n\nIn both American and British usages, words normally spelled ''-ll'' usually drop the second ''l'' when used as prefixes or suffixes, for example ''full''\u2192''useful'', ''handful''; ''all''\u2192''almighty'', ''altogether''; ''well''\u2192''welfare'', ''welcome''; ''chill''\u2192''chilblain''.\n\nBoth the British ''fulfil'' and the American ''fulfill'' never use ''-ll-'' in the middle (i.e., *''fullfill'' and *''fullfil'' are incorrect).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/fulfil?showCookiePolicy=true |title=fulfil |work=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{OED|fulfil}}</ref>\n\nJohnson wavered on this issue. His dictionary of 1755 [[Lemmatization|lemmatizes]] ''distil'' and ''instill'', ''downhil'' and ''uphill''.<ref>Peters, p. 501.</ref>\n\n==Dropped \"e\"==\nBritish English sometimes keeps a silent \"e\" when adding suffixes where American English does not. Generally speaking, British English drops it in only some cases in which it is needed to show pronunciation whereas American English only uses it where needed.\n* British prefers ''ageing'',<ref>Peters, p. 22.</ref> American usually ''aging'' (compare ''raging'', ''ageism''). For the noun or verb \"route\", British English often uses ''routeing'',<ref>Peters, p. 480. Also [[National Routeing Guide]]</ref> but in America ''routing'' is used. The military term ''rout'' forms ''routing'' everywhere. However, all of these words form \"router\", whether used in the context of carpentry, data communications, or the military. (e.g., \"Attacus was the router of the Huns at ....\")\n\nBoth forms of English keep the silent \"e\" in the words ''dyeing'', ''singeing'', and ''swingeing''<ref>In American English, ''swingeing'' is sometimes spelled ''swinging'' [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/swingeing?r=66 see American Heritage Dictionary entry], and the reader has to discern from the context which word and pronunciation is meant.</ref> (in the sense of ''dye'', ''singe'', and ''swinge''), to distinguish from ''dying'', ''singing'', ''swinging'' (in the sense of ''die'', ''sing'', and ''swing''). In contrast, the verb ''bathe'' and the British verb ''bath'' both form ''bathing''. Both forms of English vary for ''tinge'' and ''twinge''; both prefer ''cringing'', ''hinging'', ''lunging'', ''syringing''.\n* Before ''-able'', British English prefers ''likeable'', ''liveable'', ''rateable'', ''saleable'', ''sizeable'', ''unshakeable'',<ref name=\"British National Corpus\">[[British National Corpus]]</ref> where American practice prefers to drop the \"-e\"; <!-- borderline: ''tradeable'', ''smokeable'', ''driveable'', ''shareable'' --> but both British and American English prefer ''breathable'', ''curable'', ''datable'', ''lovable'', ''movable'', ''notable'', ''provable'', ''quotable'', ''scalable'', ''solvable'', ''usable'',<ref name=\"British National Corpus\"/> and those where the root is polysyllabic, like ''believable'' or ''decidable''. Both systems keep the silent \"e\" when it is needed to preserve a soft \"c\", \"ch\", or \"g\", such as in ''traceable'', ''cacheable'', ''changeable''; both usually keep the \"e\" after \"-dge\", as in ''knowledgeable'', ''unbridgeable'', and ''unabridgeable'' (\"These rights are unabridgeable\").\n* Both ''abridgment'' and the more regular ''abridgement'' are current in the US, only the latter in the UK.<ref>Peters, p. 7</ref> Likewise for the word ''lodg(e)ment''. Both ''judgment'' and ''judgement'' are in use interchangeably everywhere, although the former prevails in the US and the latter prevails in the UK<ref>Peters, p. 303.</ref> except in the practice of law, where ''judgment'' is standard. This also holds for ''abridgment'' and ''acknowledgment''. Both systems prefer ''[[wiktionary:fledgling|fledgling]]'' to ''fledgeling'', but ''[[ridgeling]]'' to ''ridgling''. Both ''acknowledgment'', ''acknowledgement'', ''abridgment'' and ''abridgement'' are used in Australia; the shorter forms are endorsed by the Australian Capital Territory Government.<ref name=\"Fourth Edition 2005\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pco.act.gov.au/library/Spelling.pdf |title=Spelling, Abbreviations and Symbols Guide |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref> Apart from when the \"e\" is dropped and in the word ''gaol'' and some pronunciations of ''margarine'', \"g\" can only be soft when followed by an \"e\", \"i\", or \"y\".\n*The word \"blue\" always drops the \"e\" when forming \"bluish\" or \"bluing\".\n\n==<span id=\"Hard and soft \"c\"\"></span>Hard and soft \"c\"==\nA \"c\" is generally soft when followed by an \"e\", \"i\", or \"y\". One word with a pronunciation that is an exception in British English, \"sceptic\", is spelled \"skeptic\" in American English. See [[#Miscellaneous_spelling_differences|''Miscellaneous spelling differences'']] below.\n\n==Past tense differences==\n:''This is a particular case of [[#Different spellings for different pronunciations]].''\nIn the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, it is more common to end some past tense verbs with a \"t\" as in ''[[:wikt:learnt|learnt]]'' or ''[[:wikt:dreamt|dreamt]]'' rather than ''learned'' or ''dreamed''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/spanish/specials/1125_questions/page6.shtml |title=BBC Mundo &#124; Questions about English |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> However, such spellings are also found in American English.\n\nSeveral verbs have different past tenses or past participles in American and British English:\n*The past tense of the verb \"to dive\" is most commonly found as \"dived\" in British, Australian, and New Zealand English. \"Dove\" is usually used in its place in American English. Both terms are understood in Canada, and may be found either in minority use or in regional dialect in America.\n*The past participle and past tense of the verb \"to get\" is \"got\" in British and New Zealand English but \"gotten\" in American and Canadian, and occasionally in Australian English, though \"got\" is widely used as a past tense. Both terms are understood, and may be found either in minority use or in regional dialect. The main exception is in the phrase \"ill-gotten\", which is widely used in British, Australian and New Zealand English. This does not affect \"forget\" and \"beget\", whose past participles are \"forgotten\" and \"begotten\" in all varieties.\n\n==Different spellings for different meanings==\n* '''''dependant'' or ''dependent''''' (noun): British dictionaries distinguish between ''dependent'' (adjective) and ''dependant'' (noun). In the US, ''dependent'' is usual for both noun and adjective, regardless of ''dependant'' also being an acceptable variant for the noun form in the US.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dependant Merriam-Webster Online].

Many (though not all) British writers maintain this distinction; the ''OED'', in their entry dating from 1900, lists ''inquiry'' and ''enquiry'' as equal alternatives, in that order (with the addition of \"public inquiry\" in a 1993 addition). Some British dictionaries, such as ''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?title=21st&query=inquiry |title=Chambers &#124; Free English Dictionary |publisher=Chambersharrap.co.uk |accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref> present the two spellings as interchangeable variants in the general sense, but prefer ''inquiry'' for the \"formal inquest\" sense. In the US, only ''inquiry'' is commonly used; the title of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', as a proper name, is an exception. In Australia, ''inquiry'' and ''enquiry'' are often interchangeable.<ref>See ''Macquarie Dictionary'' (5th ed.)'s explanation under ''-in<sup>2</sup>''.  The dictionary also lists 'inquiry' as the primary spelling, with 'enquiry' being a cross-reference to the former (denoting lower prevalence in Australian English).

The distinction is only about a century old.<ref>Peters, p. 285</ref> In American usage, ''insure'' may also be used in the former sense, but ''ensure'' may not be used in the latter sense. According to Merriam-Webster's usage notes, ''ensure'' and ''insure'' \"are interchangeable in many contexts where they indicate the making certain or [making] inevitable of an outcome, but ''ensure'' may imply a virtual guarantee 'the government has ''ensured'' the safety of the refugees', while ''insure'' sometimes stresses the taking of necessary measures beforehand 'careful planning should ''insure'' the success of the party'.\"<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ensure Merriam-Webster Online].

''Program'' first appeared in Scotland in 1633 (earlier than ''programme'' in England in 1671) and is the only spelling found in the US. The ''OED'' entry, updated in 2007, says that ''program'' conforms to the usual representation of the Greek as in ''anagram'', ''diagram'', ''telegram'' etc. In British English, ''program'' is the common spelling for computer programs<!-- towards the end of the 20th century, but ''programme'' is now frequent in this sense and increasingly used by newspapers and magazines.

However, some Canadian government documents nevertheless use ''programme'' for all meanings of the word&nbsp;\u2013 and also to match the spelling of the French equivalent.<ref name=\"Peters, p. 443\"/>\n* ''''' tonne'' or ''ton''''': In the UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, the spelling ''[[tonne]]'' refers to the metric unit (1,000&nbsp;kilograms), which is the nomenclature used in [[SI units]], whereas in the US the same unit is called a ''metric ton''. The unqualified ''[[ton]]'' usually refers to the [[long ton]] ({{convert|2240|lb|kg|0|disp=or}}) in the UK and to the [[short ton]] ({{convert|2000|lb|kg|0|disp=or}}) in the US (but note that the tonne and long ton differ by only 1.6%, and are roughly interchangeable when accuracy is not critical; ton and tonne are usually pronounced the same in speech).\n\n* '''''[[metre#Spelling|meter/metre]]''''': In British English there is a distinction between ''[[metre]]'' as a unit of length, and a ''meter'' in the sense of an ammeter or a water meter, whereas the standard American spelling for both is \"meter\".<ref>The Metric Conversion Act of 1985 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the [[International System of Units|SI]] for use in the US The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326162948/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}).

British usage, at one stage in the recent past, preferred single quotation marks for ordinary use, but double quotation marks are again now increasingly common; American usage has always preferred double quotation marks, as have Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand English. It is the practice to alternate the type of quotation marks used where there is a quotation within a quotation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trask|first=Larry|title=Quotation Marks and Direct Quotations|url=http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/department/docs/punctuation/node30.html|work=Guide to Punctuation|publisher=University of Sussex|accessdate=9 December 2010|year=1997| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101215000125/http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/department/docs/punctuation/node30.html| archivedate= 15 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe convention used to be, and in American English still is, to put full stops (periods) and commas inside the quotation marks, irrespective of the sense. British English has moved away from this style while American English has kept it. British style now prefers to punctuate according to the sense, in which punctuation marks only appear inside quotation marks if they were there in the original. Formal British English practice requires a full stop to be put inside the quotation marks if the quoted item is a full sentence that ends where the main sentence ends, but it is common to see the stop outside the ending quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=Michael|title=Punctuation and Quotation Marks|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pun1.htm|work=World Wide Words |accessdate=9 December 2010|year=2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202134153/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pun1.htm| archivedate= 2 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{cols|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Australian English]]\n* [[Canadian English]]\n* [[English language in England]]\n* [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n* [[English orthography]]\n* [[Hong Kong English]]\n* [[Hiberno-English]]\n* [[Indian English]]\n* [[Malaysian English]]\n* [[Manx English]]\n* [[New Zealand English]]\n* [[Philippine English]]\n* [[Scottish English]]\n* [[Singaporean English]]\n* [[South African English]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Chambers, J.K.

For instance, some spellings seen as \"American\" today were once commonly used in Britain and some spellings seen as \"British\" were once commonly used in the United States. A \"British standard\" began to emerge following the 1755 publication of [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'', and an \"American standard\" started following the work of [[Noah Webster]] and in particular his ''[[Webster's Dictionary|An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'', first published in 1828.<ref name=\"Micklethwait2005\">{{cite book|author=David Micklethwait|title=Noah Webster and the American Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIRCsrMwhroC&pg=PA137|date=1 January 2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2157-2|pages=137}}</ref>\n\nWebster's efforts at [[spelling reform]] were somewhat effective in his native country, resulting in certain well-known patterns of spelling differences between the American and British [[varieties of English]]. However, [[English-language spelling reform]] has rarely been adopted otherwise, and so modern [[English orthography]] varies somewhat between countries and is far from [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] in any country.\n\n== Historical origins ==\n{{Multiple image\n| width = 120\n| image1 = Webster Orthography 1828 (4-14).jpg\n| image2 = Webster Orthography 1828 (15).jpg\n| footer = Extract from the Orthography section of the first edition (1828) of [[Noah Webster|Webster]]'s \"[[Webster's Dictionary|ADEL]]\", which popularized the \"American standard\" spellings of ''-er''&nbsp;(6); ''-or''&nbsp;(7); the dropped ''-e''&nbsp;(8); ''-or''&nbsp;(10); ''-se''&nbsp;(11); and the doubling of consonants with a suffix (15).\n}}\n[[File:British spellings in NEJM 1814.jpg|left|thumb|An 1814 American medical text showing British English spellings that were still in use (\"tumours\", \"colour\", \"centres\", etc.).]]\n\nIn the early 18th century, [[English spelling]] was inconsistent. These differences became noticeable after the publishing of influential [[Dictionary|dictionaries]]. Today's [[British English]] spellings mostly follow Johnson's ''A Dictionary of the English Language'' (1755), while many [[American English]] spellings follow Webster's ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'' (\"ADEL\", \"Webster's Dictionary\", 1828).<ref>{{cite book |last=Scragg |first=Donald |title=A history of English spelling |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester, England |year=1974 |pages=82\u201383 |quote=Johnson's dictionary became the accepted standard for private spelling&nbsp;... of a literate Englishman&nbsp;... during the nineteenth century&nbsp;...

In ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2008), John Algeo notes: \"it is often assumed that characteristically American spellings were invented by Noah Webster. He was very influential in popularizing certain spellings in America, but he did not originate them. Rather&nbsp;[\u2026] he chose already existing options such as ''center, color'' and ''check'' for the simplicity, analogy or etymology\".<ref>Algeo, John, \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language\" in ''A Companion to the American Revolution'', John Wiley & Sons: 2008, p. 599.</ref> [[William Shakespeare]]'s first folios, for example, used spellings like ''center'' and ''color'' as much as ''centre'' and ''colour''.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=-or&allowed_in_frame=0 ''-or''].

In Britain, the influence of those who preferred the [[Norman language|Norman]] (or [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]]) spellings of words proved to be decisive. Later spelling adjustments in the United Kingdom had little effect on today's American spellings and vice versa.\n\nFor the most part, the spelling systems of most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] and [[Ireland]] closely resemble the British system. In [[Canada]], the spelling system can be said to follow both British and American forms,<ref name=\"Clark, 2009\">Clark, 2009.</ref> and Canadians are somewhat more tolerant of foreign spellings when compared with other English-speaking nationalities.<ref>Chambers, 1998.</ref> [[Australian spelling]] has also strayed slightly from British spelling, with some American spellings incorporated as standard.<ref name=\"Fourth Edition 2005\">''The Macquarie Dictionary'', Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.</ref> [[New Zealand English|New Zealand spelling]] is almost identical to British spelling, except in the word ''fiord'' (instead of ''fjord''). There is also an increasing use of [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s in words that originated in [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and an unambiguous preference for ''-ise'' endings (see below).\n\n==Latin-derived spellings (often through Romance)==\n\n==={{Anchor|our_or}}''-our'', ''-or''===\nMost words ending in an unstressed ''-our'' in British English (e.g., {{lang|en-GB|''[[wikt:colour|colour]]'', ''[[wikt:flavour|flavour]]'', ''[[wikt:behaviour|behaviour]],'' ''[[wikt:harbour|harbour]]'', ''[[wikt:honour|honour]]'', ''[[wikt:humour|humour]]'', ''[[wikt:labour|labour]]'', ''[[wikt:neighbour|neighbour]]'', ''[[wikt:rumour|rumour]]'', ''[[wikt:splendour|splendour]]''|italic=unset}}) end in ''-or'' in American English ({{lang|en-US|''[[wikt:color|color]]'', ''[[wikt:flavor|flavor]]'', ''[[wikt:behavior|behavior]]'', ''[[wikt:harbor|harbor]]'', ''[[wikt:honor|honor]]'', ''[[wikt:humor|humor]]'', ''[[wikt:labor|labor]]'', ''[[wikt:neighbor|neighbor]]'', ''[[wikt:rumor|rumor]]'',  ''[[wikt:splendor|splendor]]''|italic=unset}}). Wherever the vowel is [[Reduced vowels in English|unreduced in pronunciation]], e.g., ''[[wikt:contour|contour]]'', ''[[wikt:velour|velour]]'', ''[[wikt:paramour|paramour]]'' and ''[[wikt:troubadour|troubadour]]'' the spelling is consistent everywhere.\n\nMost words of this kind came from Latin, where the ending was spelled ''-or''. They were first adopted into English from early [[Old French]], and the ending was spelled ''-our'', ''-or'' or ''-ur''.<ref name=\"Webster's Third, p. 24a\">Webster's Third, p. 24a.</ref> After the [[Norman conquest of England]], the ending became ''-our'' to match the later Old French spelling.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, ''colour, color''.</ref> The ''-our'' ending was not only used in new English borrowings, but was also applied to the earlier borrowings that had used ''-or''.<ref name=\"Webster's Third, p. 24a\"/> However, ''-or'' was still sometimes found,<ref name=\"SOED_1987\">{{Cite book|editor=Onions, CT |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |origyear=1933 |edition=Third Edition (1933) with corrections (1975) |year=1987 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-861126-9 |page=370}}<!--|accessdate=9 April 2008 --></ref> and the first three folios of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays used both spellings before they were standardised to ''-our'' in the Fourth Folio of 1685.<ref name=\"auto\"/> After the [[Renaissance]], new borrowings from Latin were taken up with their original ''-or'' ending and many words once ending in ''-our'' (for example, ''chancellour'' and ''governour'') went back to ''-or''. Many words of the ''-our/or'' group do not have a Latin counterpart that ends in ''-or''; for example, ''armo(u)r'', ''behavio(u)r'', ''harbo(u)r'', ''neighbo(u)r''; also ''[[Pergola|arbo(u)r]]'', meaning \"shelter\", though senses \"tree\" and \"tool\" are always ''[[wikt:arbor|arbor]]'', a [[false cognate]] of the other word. Some 16th- and early 17th-century British scholars indeed insisted that ''-or'' be used for words from Latin (e.g., ''{{lang|en-US|color}}'')<ref name=\"SOED_1987\"/> and ''-our'' for French loans; but in many cases the etymology was not clear, and therefore some scholars advocated ''-or'' only and others ''-our'' only.<ref name=\"Peters, p. 397\">Peters, p. 397.</ref>\n\nWebster's 1828 dictionary had only ''-or'' and is given much of the credit for the adoption of this form in the United States. By contrast, Johnson's 1755 (pre-U.S. independence and establishment) dictionary used ''-our'' for all words still so spelled in Britain (like ''colour''), but also for words where the ''u'' has since been dropped: ''ambassadour'', ''emperour'', ''governour'', ''perturbatour'', ''inferiour'', ''superiour''; ''errour'', ''horrour'', ''mirrour'', ''tenour'', ''terrour'', ''tremour''. Johnson, unlike Webster, was not an advocate of spelling reform, but chose the spelling best derived, as he saw it, from among the variations in his sources. He preferred French over Latin spellings because, as he put it, \"the French generally supplied us\".<ref>Johnson 1755\u2014preface</ref> English speakers who moved to America took these preferences with them, and [[H. L. Mencken]] notes that \"''{{lang|en-US|honor}}'' appears in the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], but it seems to have been put there rather by accident than by design. In [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]'s original draft it is spelled \"honour\".<ref>{{Cite book |last= Mencken |first= H L |authorlink= H. L.

''{{lang|en-US|Honor}}'' and ''{{lang|en-GB|honour}}'' were equally frequent in Britain until the 17th century;<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, ''honour, honor''.</ref> ''honor'' still is, in the UK, the usual spelling as a person's name and appears in ''[[Honor Oak]]'', a district of [[London]].\n\n====Derivatives and inflected forms====\nIn derivatives and inflected forms of the ''-our/or'' words, British usage depends on the nature of the suffix used. The ''u'' is kept before English suffixes that are freely attachable to English words (for example in {{lang|en-GB|''[[wikt:neighbourhood|neighbourhood]]'', ''[[wikt:humourless|humourless]]'', and ''[[wikt:savoury|savoury]]''|italic=unset}}) and suffixes of Greek or Latin origin that have been adopted into English (for example in {{lang|en-GB|''[[wikt:favourite|favourite]]'', ''[[wikt:honourable|honourable]]'', and ''[[wikt:behaviourism|behaviourism]]''|italic=unset}}). However, before Latin suffixes that are not freely attachable to English words, the ''u'':\n* may be dropped, for example in ''[[wikt:honorary|honorary]]'', ''[[wikt:honorific|honorific]]'', ''[[wikt:humorist|humorist]]'', ''[[wikt:vigorous|vigorous]]'', ''[[wikt:humorous|humorous]]'', ''[[wikt:laborious|laborious]]'', and ''[[wikt:invigorate|invigorate]]'';\n* may be either dropped or kept, for example in ''colo(u)ration'' and ''colo(u)rize ''or'' colourise''; or\n* may be kept, for example in ''{{lang|en-GB|[[wikt:colourist|colourist]]}}''.<ref name=\"Webster's Third, p. 24a\"/>\n\nIn American usage, derivatives and inflected forms are built by simply adding the suffix in all cases (for example, ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:favorite|favorite]]}}'', ''{{lang|en-US|[[savouriness|savory]]}}'' etc.) since the ''u'' is absent to begin with.\n\n====Exceptions====\nAmerican usage, in most cases, keeps the ''u'' in the word ''[[wikt:glamour|glamour]]'', which comes from [[Scots language|Scots]], not Latin or French. ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:glamor|Glamor]]}}'' is sometimes used in imitation of the spelling reform of other ''-our'' words to ''-or''. Nevertheless, the adjective ''[[wikt:glamorous|glamorous]]'' often drops the first \"u\". ''{{lang|en-GB|[[wikt:saviour|Saviour]]}}'' is a somewhat common variant of ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:savior|savior]]}}'' in the US. The British spelling is very common for ''{{lang|en-GB|honour}}'' (and ''{{lang|en-GB|favour}}'') in the formal language of [[wedding invitation]]s in the US.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Letitia Baldrige's Complete Guide to the New Manners for the '90s: A Complete Guide to Etiquette |first=Letitia |last=Baldrige |authorlink=Letitia Baldrige |year=1990 |publisher=Rawson |isbn=0-89256-320-6 |page=214}}</ref> The name of the {{lang|en-GB|[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']]|italic=unset}} has a ''u'' in it as the [[spacecraft]] was named after [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]'s ship, {{lang|en-GB|[[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']]|italic=unset}}. The special car on [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Coast Starlight]]'' train is known as the [[Pacific Parlour]] car, not ''Pacific Parlor''. [[Proper name]]s such as ''[[Pearl Harbor]]'' or ''[[Sydney Harbour]]'' are usually spelled according to their native-variety spelling vocabulary.\n\nThe name of the herb ''[[Satureja|savory]]'' is thus spelled everywhere, although the related adjective ''savo(u)ry'', like ''savo(u)r'', has a ''u'' in the UK. ''Honor'' (the name) and ''arbor'' (the tool) have ''-or'' in Britain, as mentioned above, as does the word ''pallor''. As a general noun, ''[[rigour]]'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259r}} has a ''u'' in the UK; the medical term ''[[rigor (medicine)|rigor]]'' (sometimes {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|a\u026a|\u0261|\u0259r}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rigor|title=rigor - definition of rigor in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=}}</ref> does not, such as in ''rigor mortis'', which is Latin. Derivations of ''rigour''/''rigor'' such as ''rigorous'', however, are typically spelled without a ''u'' even in the UK. Words with the ending ''-irior'', ''-erior'' or similar are spelled thus everywhere.\n\nThe word [[armour]] was once somewhat common in American usage but has disappeared except in some brand names such as [[Under Armour]].\n\nThe cardinal numbers ''[[wikt:four|four]]'' and ''[[wikt:fourteen|fourteen]]'', when written as words, are always spelled with a ''u'', as are the ordinal numbers ''[[wikt:fourth|fourth]]'' and ''[[wikt:fourteenth|fourteenth]]''. ''[[wikt:forty|Forty]]'' and ''[[wikt:fortieth|fortieth]]'', however, are always spelled without a ''u''.\n\n====Commonwealth usage====\nCommonwealth countries normally follow British usage. [[Canadian English]] most commonly uses the ''-our'' ending and ''-our-'' in derivatives and inflected forms. However, owing to the close historic, economic, and cultural relationship with the United States, ''-or'' endings are also sometimes used. Throughout the late 19th and early to mid-20th century, most Canadian newspapers chose to use the American usage of ''-or'' endings, originally to save time and money in the era of manual [[movable type]].<ref name=OC31Mar1990>{{cite news |title=Practical concerns spelled the end for -our |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=31 March 1990 |page=B3 |first=William |last=MacPherson }}</ref> However, in the 1990s, the majority of Canadian newspapers officially updated their spelling policies to the British usage of ''-our''. This coincided with a renewed interest in Canadian English, and the release of the updated Gage Canadian Dictionary in 1997 and the first Oxford Canadian Dictionary in 1998. Historically, most libraries and educational institutions in Canada have supported the use of the Oxford English Dictionary rather than the American Webster's Dictionary. Today, the use of a distinctive set of Canadian English spellings is viewed by many Canadians as one of the cultural uniquenesses of Canada (especially when compared to the United States).\n\nIn Australia, ''-or'' endings enjoyed some use throughout the 19th century and in the early 20th century. Like Canada, though, most major Australian newspapers have switched from \"''-or''\" endings to \"''-our''\" endings. The \"''-our''\" spelling is taught in schools nationwide as part of the Australian curriculum. The most notable countrywide use of the ''-or'' ending is for the {{lang|en-US|[[Australian Labor Party]]}}, which was originally called \"the Australian Labour Party\" (name adopted in 1908), but was frequently referred to as both \"Labour\" and \"Labor\". The \"Labor\" was adopted from 1912 onward due to the influence of the {{lang|en-US|[[American labor movement]]}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Labor: History|url=http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/labor-history/|work=ALP.org.au|access-date=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617043320/http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/labor-history/|archive-date=17 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[King O'Malley]].

Following this, ''-re'' became the most common usage in Britain. In America, following the publication of [[Webster's dictionary]] in the early 19th century, American English started exclusively using ''-er''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, some words have been changed from ''-re'' to ''-er'' in both varieties. These include ''[[wikt:chapter|chapter]]'', ''[[wikt:December|December]]'', ''[[wikt:disaster|disaster]]'', ''[[wikt:enter|enter]]'', ''[[wikt:filter|filter]]'', ''[[wikt:letter|letter]]'', ''[[wikt:member|member]]'', ''[[wikt:minister|minister]]'', ''[[wikt:monster|monster]]'', ''[[wikt:November|November]]'', ''[[wikt:number|number]]'', ''[[wikt:October|October]]'', ''[[wikt:offer|offer]]'', ''[[wikt:oyster|oyster]]'', ''[[wikt:powder|powder]]'', ''[[wikt:proper|proper]]'', ''[[wikt:September|September]]'', ''[[wikt:sober|sober]]'' and ''[[wikt:tender|tender]]''. Words using the ''\"-meter\"'' suffix (from Ancient Greek -[[wikt:\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]] ''m\u00e9tron'', via French ''[[wikt:-m\u00e8tre|-m\u00e8tre]]'') normally had the ''-re'' spelling from earliest use in English but were superseded by ''-er''. Examples include ''[[wikt:thermometer|thermometer]]'' and ''[[wikt:barometer|barometer]]''.\n\nThe ''e'' preceding the ''r'' is kept in American inflected forms of nouns and verbs, for example, {{lang|en-US|''fibers'', ''reconnoitered'', ''centering''|italic=unset}}, which are {{lang|en-GB|''fibres'', ''reconnoitred'', and ''centring''|italic=unset}} respectively in British English. ''{{lang|en-GB|Centring}}'' is an interesting example, since, according to the ''OED'', it is a ''\"word ... of 3 syllables (in careful pronunciation)\"''<ref>(Oxford English Dictionary: Second edition).</ref> (i.e., {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025bnt\u0259r\u026a\u014b/}}), yet there is no vowel in the spelling corresponding to the second syllable ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}). The OED third edition (revised entry of June 2016) allows either two or three syllables.  The three-syllable version is listed as only the American pronunciation of ''centering'' on the [[OED|Oxford Dictionaries Online]] website. The ''e'' is dropped for other derivations, for example, ''central'', ''fibrous'', ''spectral''. However, the existence of related words without ''e'' before the ''r'' is not proof for the existence of an ''-re'' British spelling: for example, ''entry'' and ''entrance'' come from ''enter'', which has not been spelled ''entre'' for centuries.<ref>From the ''OED'' cites, Chaucer used both forms, but the last usages of the \"re\" form were in the early 18th century. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'': 1989 edition.</ref>\n\nThe difference relates only to root words; ''-er'' rather than ''-re'' is universal as a suffix for agentive (''reader'', ''winner'', ''user'') and comparative (''louder'', ''nicer'') forms. One outcome is the British distinction of ''[[wikt:meter|meter]]'' for a [[measuring instrument]] from ''{{lang|en-GB|metre}}'' for [[Metre|the unit of length]]. However, while \"{{lang|en-GB|[[Metre (poetry)|poetic metre]]}}\" is often ''-re'', [[Iambic pentameter|pentameter]], [[hexameter]] etc. are always ''-er''.<ref>Except in a 1579 usage (Oxford English Dictionary: 1989 edition).</ref>\n\n====Exceptions====\nMany other words have ''-er'' in British English. These include Germanic words; such as ''anger'', ''mother'', ''timber'' and ''water'' and Romance words ''danger'', ''quarter'' and ''river''.\n\nThe ending ''-cre'', as in ''[[acre]]'',<ref name=\"acre/louvre\">Although ''acre'' was spelled ''\u00e6cer'' in Old English and ''aker'' in [[Middle English]], the ''acre'' spelling of [[Middle French]] was introduced in the 15th century. Similarly, ''loover'' was respelled in the 17th century by influence of the unrelated [[Louvre]]. (See ''OED'', s.v. ''acre'' and ''louvre'')</ref> ''[[wikt:lucre|lucre]]'', ''[[wikt:massacre|massacre]]'', and ''[[wikt:mediocre|mediocre]]'', is used in both British and American English to show that the ''c'' is pronounced {{IPA|/k/}} rather than {{IPA|/s/}}. The spellings ''ogre'' and ''euchre'' are also the same in both British and American English.\n\n{{Anchor|Theatre}} ''{{lang|en-US|[[wikt:theater|Theater]]}}'' is the prevailing American spelling used to refer to both the dramatic arts and buildings where stage performances and screenings of films take place (i.e., \"{{lang|en-US|movie theaters}}\"); for example, a national newspaper such as ''The New York Times'' would use ''{{lang|en-US|theater}}'' in its entertainment section.

For example, the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] has a \"Department of ''Theatre'' and Drama\", which offers courses that lead to the \"Bachelor of Arts in ''Theatre''\", and whose professed aim is \"to prepare our graduate students for successful 21st Century careers in the ''theatre'' both as practitioners and scholars\".<ref>https://theatre.wisc.edu/</ref>\n\nSome placenames in the United States use ''[[wikt:centre|Centre]]'' in their names. Examples include the [[Stonebriar Centre]] mall, the cities of [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] and [[Centreville, Illinois|Centreville]], [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]] and [[Centre College]]. Sometimes, these places were named before spelling changes but more often the spelling merely serves as an affectation.\n\nFor British ''{{lang|en-GB|accoutre}}'', the American practice varies: the ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' prefers the ''-re'' spelling,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=accouter |title=accoutre |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> but ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' prefers the ''-er'' spelling.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/A0044600.html accouter]</ref>\n\nMore recent French loanwords keep the ''-re'' spelling in American English. These are not exceptions when a French-style pronunciation is used ({{IPA|/r\u0259/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u0259(r)/}}), as with ''[[double entendre]]'', ''[[wikt:genre|genre]]'' and ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]''. However, the unstressed {{IPA|/\u0259(r)/}} pronunciation of an ''-er'' ending is used more (or less) often with some words, including ''[[wikt:cadre|cadre]]'', ''[[wikt:macabre|macabre]]'', ''[[ma\u00eetre d']]'', [[wikt:Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], ''[[wikt:piastre|piastre]]'', and ''[[wikt:timbre|timbre]]''.\n\n====Commonwealth usage====\nThe ''-re'' endings are mostly standard throughout the Commonwealth. The ''-er'' spellings are recognized as minor variants in Canada, partly due to American influence, and are sometimes used in proper names (such as Toronto's controversially named [[Centerpoint Mall (Toronto)|Centerpoint Mall]]).<ref>Peters, p&nbsp;461.</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|ce_se}}''-ce'', ''-se''===\nFor ''[[wiktionary:advice|advice]]''/''[[wiktionary:advise|advise]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:device|device]]''/''[[wiktionary:devise|devise]]'', American English and British English both keep the noun\u2013verb distinction both graphically and phonetically (where the pronunciation is -{{IPA|/s/}} for the noun and -{{IPA|/z/}} for the verb). For ''[[wiktionary:licence|licence]]/[[wiktionary:license|license]]'' or ''[[wiktionary:practice|practice]]/[[wiktionary:practise|practise]]'', British English also keeps the noun\u2013verb distinction graphically (although phonetically the two words in each pair are [[homophone]]s with -{{IPA|/s/}} pronunciation). On the other hand, American English uses ''[[wiktionary:license|license]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:practice|practice]]'' for both nouns and verbs (with -{{IPA|/s/}} pronunciation in both cases too).\n\nAmerican English has kept the Anglo-French spelling for ''[[wiktionary:defense|defense]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:offense|offense]]'', which are ''[[wiktionary:defence|defence]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:offence|offence]]'' in British English. Likewise, there are the American ''[[wiktionary:pretense|pretense]]'' and British ''[[wiktionary:pretence|pretence]]''; but derivatives such as ''[[wiktionary:defensive|defensive]]'', ''[[wiktionary:offensive|offensive]]'', and ''[[wiktionary:pretension|pretension]]'' are always thus spelled in both systems.\n\nAustralian<ref>Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers of Australian Government Publications, Third Edition, Revised by John Pitson, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1978, page 10, \"In general, follow the spellings given in the latest edition of the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary.''</ref> and Canadian usage generally follows British.\n\n==={{Anchor|xion_ction}}''-xion'', ''-ction''===\nThe spelling ''[[wiktionary:connexion|connexion]]'' is now rare in everyday British usage, its use lessening as knowledge of Latin lessens,<ref>Peters (2004: 135)</ref> and it is not used at all in the US: the more common ''connection'' has become the standard worldwide.

Thus, in British English ''analyse'', ''[[catalyse]]'', ''[[hydrolyse]]'' and ''[[paralyse]]'', but in American English ''analyze'', ''[[catalyze]]'', ''[[hydrolyze]]'' and ''[[paralyze]]''.\n\n''Analyse'' was the more common spelling in 17th- and 18th-century English. Some dictionaries of the time however preferred ''analyze'', such as [[Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum|John Kersey's of 1702]], [[An Universal Etymological English Dictionary|Nathan Bailey's of 1721]] and [[A Dictionary of the English Language|Samuel Johnson's of 1755]]. In Canada, ''-yze'' is preferred, but ''-yse'' is also very common. In South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, ''-yse'' is the prevailing form.\n\nEnglish verbs ending in either ''-lyse'' or ''-lyze'' are not similar to the original Greek verb, which is ''\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9 l\u00fdo'' (\"I release\"). Instead, they come from the noun form {{lang|el|[[wikt:\u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2|\u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2]]}} ''[[lysis]]'', with the ''-ise'' or ''-ize'' suffix.

Additionally, in American English, ''dialogue'' is an extremely common spelling compared to ''dialog'', although both are treated as acceptable ways to spell the word<ref>Both the ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'' and ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' have \"catalog\" as the main [[headword]] and \"catalogue\" as an equal variant.</ref> (thus the inflected forms, ''cataloged'' and ''cataloging'' vs. ''catalogued'' and ''cataloguing''). Words like ''[[:wikt:demagogue|demagogue]]'', ''[[:wikt:pedagogue|pedagogue]]'', and ''[[:wikt:synagogue|synagogue]]'' are seldom used without ''-ue'' even in American English.\n\nIn Australia, ''analog'' is standard for the adjective,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} but both ''analogue'' and ''analog'' are current for the noun; in all other cases the ''-gue'' endings strongly prevail,<ref>Peters, p. 236.</ref> for example ''monologue'', except for such expressions as ''[[dialog box]]'' in computing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.openfiledialog.aspx |title=MSDN C#.NET OpenFileDialog Class |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> which are also used in the UK. In Australia, ''analog'' is used in its technical and electronic sense, as in ''analog electronics''.<ref name=\"Fourth Edition 2005\"/> In Canada and New Zealand, ''analogue'' is used, but ''analog'' has some currency as a technical term<ref>Peters, p. 36.</ref> (e.g., in electronics, as in \"analog electronics\" as opposed to \"digital electronics\" and some video-game consoles might have an ''analog stick''<!--But isn't this most likely because video consoles are designed in America?-->). The ''-ue'' is absent worldwide in related words like ''analogy'', ''analogous'', and ''analogist''.\n\nBoth British and American English use the spelling ''-gue'' with a silent ''-ue'' for certain words that are not part of the ''-ogue'' set, such as ''tongue'' (cf. [[:wikt:tong|tong]]), ''plague'', ''vague'', and ''league.'' In addition, when the ''-ue'' is not silent, as in the words ''argue,'' ''ague'' and ''segue,'' all varieties of English use ''-gue.''\n\n====Commonwealth usage====\nIn Canada, ''e'' is usually preferred over ''oe'' and often over ''ae'',{{Citation needed|date=September 2009|reason=I absolutely disagree...I rarely see anyone up here not preferring ae to e.}} but ''oe'' and ''ae'' are sometimes found in the academic and scientific writing as well as government publications (for example the fee schedule of the [[Ontario Health Insurance Plan]]). In Australia, ''encyclopedia'' and ''medieval'' are spelled with ''e'' rather than ''ae'', as with American usage, and the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' also notes a growing tendency towards replacing ''ae'' and ''oe'' with ''e'' worldwide.<ref name=\"Fourth Edition 2005\"/> Elsewhere, the British usage prevails, but the spellings with just ''e'' are increasingly used.<ref>Peters, p. 20, p. 389.</ref> ''Manoeuvre'' is the only spelling in Australia, and the most common one in Canada, where ''maneuver'' and ''manoeuver'' are also sometimes found.<ref>Peters, p. 338.</ref>\n\n==Doubled consonants==\nThe plural of the noun ''bus'' is usually  ''buses'', with ''busses'' a minor American variant.<ref name=\"bus_cald\"/> Conversely, inflections of the verb ''bus'' usually double the ''s'' in British (''busses, bussed, bussing'') but not American (''buses, bused, busing'').<ref name=\"bus_cald\">{{cite web |title=bus |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bus?q=bus_1 |website=Cambridge English Dictionary |accessdate=19 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Doubled in British English===\nThe final consonant of an English word is sometimes doubled in both American and British spelling when adding a suffix beginning with a vowel, for example ''strip/stripped'', which prevents confusion with ''stripe/striped'' and shows the difference in pronunciation (see [[Digraph (orthography)#Double letters|digraph]]). Generally, this happens only when the word's final syllable is stressed and when it also ends with a lone vowel followed by a lone consonant. In British English, however, a final ''-l'' is often doubled even when the final syllable is unstressed.<ref name=\"Peters, p. 309\">Peters, p. 309.</ref> This exception is no longer usual in American English, seemingly because of [[Noah Webster]].<ref>Cf. Oxford English Dictionary, ''traveller, traveler''.</ref> The ''-ll-'' spellings are nevertheless still deemed acceptable variants by both Merriam-Webster Collegiate and American Heritage dictionaries.\n* The British English doubling is used for all inflections (''-ed'', ''-ing'', ''-er'', ''-est'') and for the noun suffixes ''-er'' and ''-or''. Therefore, British English usage is ''cancelled'', ''counsellor'', ''cruellest'', ''labelled'', ''modelling'', ''quarrelled'', ''signalling'', ''traveller'', and ''travelling''. Americans typically use ''canceled'', ''counselor'', ''cruelest'', ''labeled'', ''modeling'', ''quarreled'', ''signaling'', ''traveler'', and ''traveling''. However, for certain words such as ''cancelled'', the ''-ll-'' spelling is very common in American English as well.\n** The word ''parallel'' keeps a single ''-l-'' in British English, as in American English (''paralleling'', ''unparalleled''), to avoid the unappealing cluster ''-llell-''.\n** Words with two vowels before a final ''l'' are also spelled with ''-ll-'' in British English before a suffix when the first vowel either acts as a consonant (''equalling'' and ''initialled''; in the United States, ''equaling'' or ''initialed''), or belongs to a separate syllable (British ''fu\u2022el\u2022ling'' and ''di\u2022alled''; American ''fu\u2022el\u2022ing'' and ''di\u2022aled'').\n*** British ''woollen'' is a further exception due to the double vowel (American: ''woolen''). Also, ''wooly'' is accepted in American English, though ''woolly'' prevails in both systems.<ref>Peters, p. 581</ref>\n*** The verb ''surveil'', a [[back-formation]] from ''surveillance'', always makes ''surveilling'', ''surveilled''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/surveil|title=Surveil|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=3 January 2018}}; {{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/surveil|title=British & World English > surveil|work=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n* Endings ''-ize''/''-ise'', ''-ism'', ''-ist'', ''-ish'' usually do not double the ''l'' in British English; for example, ''normalise'', ''dualism'', ''novelist'', and ''devilish''.\n** Exceptions: ''tranquillise''; ''duellist'', ''medallist'', ''panellist'', and sometimes ''triallist'' in British English.\n* For ''-ous'', British English has a single ''l'' in ''scandalous'' and ''perilous'', but the \"ll\" in ''marvellous'' and ''libellous''.\n* For ''-ee'', British English has ''libellee''.\n* For ''-age'', British English has ''[[pupillage]]'' but ''vassalage''.\n* American English sometimes has an unstressed ''-ll-'', as in the UK, in some words where the root has ''-l''. These are cases where the change happens in the source language, which was often Latin. (Examples: ''bimetallism'', ''cancellation'', ''chancellor'', ''crystallize'', ''excellent'', ''tonsillitis'', and ''raillery''.)\n* All forms of English have ''compelled'', ''excelling'', ''propelled'', ''rebelling'' (notice the stress difference); ''revealing'', ''fooling'' (note the double vowel before the l); and ''hurling'' (consonant before the ''l'').\n* Canadian and Australian English mostly follow British usage.<ref name=\"Peters, p. 309\"/>\n\nAmong consonants other than ''l'', practice varies for some words, such as where the final syllable has [[secondary stress]] or an unreduced vowel. In the United States, the spellings ''kidnaped'' and ''worshiped'', which were introduced by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in the 1920s,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/news/media/chicago2.php |title=Errant Spelling: Moves for simplification turn Inglish into another langwaj |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=8 June 1997 |pages=Section 3A page 14 |accessdate=17 March 2007 |first=Eric |last=Zorn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703161726/http://www.spellingsociety.org/news/media/chicago2.php |archive-date=3 July 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> are common, but ''kidnapped'' and ''worshipped'' prevail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kidnapped|title=Definition of KIDNAPPED|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/worshipped|title=Definition of WORSHIPPED|publisher=}}</ref> ''Kidnapped'' and ''worshipped'' are the only standard British spellings. However, ''focused'' is the predominant spelling in both British and American English, ''focussed'' being just a minor variant in British English.<ref>https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/focused</ref>\n\nMiscellaneous:\n* British ''calliper'' or ''caliper''; American ''caliper''.\n* British ''jewellery''; American ''jewelry''. The word originates from the Old French word ''jouel''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lazarosoho.com/Jewelry-vs-Jewellery_b_54.html | title=Jewelry vs. Jewellery | publisher=Lazaro Soho | accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> (whose contemporary French equivalent is ''joyau'', with the same meaning). The standard pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|u\u02d0|\u0259|l|r|i}}<ref>''Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?dict=CALD&key=42648&ph=on jewellery UK, American jewelry]</ref> does not reflect this difference, but the non-standard pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|u\u02d0|l|\u0259r|i}} (which exists in New Zealand and Britain, hence the Cockney rhyming slang word ''tomfoolery'' {{IPAc-en|t|\u0252|m|\u02c8|f|u\u02d0|l|\u0259r|i}}) does. According to Fowler, ''jewelry'' used to be the \"rhetorical and poetic\" spelling in the UK, and was still used by ''[[The Times]]'' into the mid-20th century. Canada has both, but ''jewellery'' is more often used. Likewise, the Commonwealth (including Canada) has ''jeweller'' and the US has ''jeweler'' for a jewel(le)ry seller.\n\n===Doubled in American English===\nConversely, there are words where British writers prefer a single ''l'' and Americans a double ''l''. In American usage, the spelling of words is usually not changed when they form the main part (not prefix or suffix) of other words, especially in newly formed words and in words whose main part is in common use. Words with this spelling difference include\n''wil(l)ful'', ''skil(l)ful'', ''thral(l)dom'', ''appal(l)'', ''fulfil(l)'', ''fulfil(l)ment'', ''enrol(l)ment'', ''instal(l)ment''. These words have monosyllabic cognates always written with ''-ll'': ''will'', ''skill'', ''thrall'', ''pall'', ''fill'', ''roll'', ''stall''. Cases where a single ''l'' nevertheless occurs in both American and British English include ''null''\u2192''annul'', ''annulment''; ''till''\u2192''until'' (although some prefer ''til'' to reflect the single ''l'' in ''until'', sometimes using an apostrophe ('''til''); this should be considered a [[hypercorrection]] as ''till'' predates the use of ''until''); and others where the connection is not clear or the monosyllabic cognate is not in common use in American English (e.g., ''null'' is used mainly as a technical term in law, mathematics, and computer science).\n\nIn the UK, a single ''l'' is generally preferred in ''distil(l)'', ''instil(l)'', ''enrol(l)'', and ''enthral(l)ment'', and ''enthral(l)'', although ''ll'' was formerly used;<ref>''OED'' Second Edition</ref> these are always spelled with ''ll'' in American usage. The former British spellings ''instal'', ''fulness'', and ''dulness'' are now quite rare.<ref>Peters, p. 283</ref> The Scottish ''[[tolbooth]]'' is cognate with ''[[Tollbooth (disambiguation)|tollbooth]]'', but it has a distinct meaning.\n\nIn both American and British usages, words normally spelled ''-ll'' usually drop the second ''l'' when used as prefixes or suffixes, for example ''full''\u2192''useful'', ''handful''; ''all''\u2192''almighty'', ''altogether''; ''well''\u2192''welfare'', ''welcome''; ''chill''\u2192''chilblain''.\n\nBoth the British ''fulfil'' and the American ''fulfill'' never use ''-ll-'' in the middle (i.e., *''fullfill'' and *''fullfil'' are incorrect).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/fulfil?showCookiePolicy=true |title=fulfil |work=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{OED|fulfil}}</ref>\n\nJohnson wavered on this issue. His dictionary of 1755 [[Lemmatization|lemmatizes]] ''distil'' and ''instill'', ''downhil'' and ''uphill''.<ref>Peters, p. 501.</ref>\n\n==Dropped \"e\"==\nBritish English sometimes keeps a silent \"e\" when adding suffixes where American English does not. Generally speaking, British English drops it in only some cases in which it is needed to show pronunciation whereas American English only uses it where needed.\n* British prefers ''ageing'',<ref>Peters, p. 22.</ref> American usually ''aging'' (compare ''raging'', ''ageism''). For the noun or verb \"route\", British English often uses ''routeing'',<ref>Peters, p. 480. Also [[National Routeing Guide]]</ref> but in America ''routing'' is used. The military term ''rout'' forms ''routing'' everywhere. However, all of these words form \"router\", whether used in the context of carpentry, data communications, or the military. (e.g., \"Attacus was the router of the Huns at ....\")\n\nBoth forms of English keep the silent \"e\" in the words ''dyeing'', ''singeing'', and ''swingeing''<ref>In American English, ''swingeing'' is sometimes spelled ''swinging'' [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/swingeing?r=66 see American Heritage Dictionary entry], and the reader has to discern from the context which word and pronunciation is meant.</ref> (in the sense of ''dye'', ''singe'', and ''swinge''), to distinguish from ''dying'', ''singing'', ''swinging'' (in the sense of ''die'', ''sing'', and ''swing'').

The distinction is only about a century old.<ref>Peters, p. 285</ref> In American usage, ''insure'' may also be used in the former sense, but ''ensure'' may not be used in the latter sense.

The unqualified ''[[ton]]'' usually refers to the [[long ton]] ({{convert|2240|lb|kg|0|disp=or}}) in the UK and to the [[short ton]] ({{convert|2000|lb|kg|0|disp=or}}) in the US (but note that the tonne and long ton differ by only 1.6%, and are roughly interchangeable when accuracy is not critical; ton and tonne are usually pronounced the same in speech).\n\n* '''''[[metre#Spelling|meter/metre]]''''': In British English there is a distinction between ''[[metre]]'' as a unit of length, and a ''meter'' in the sense of an ammeter or a water meter, whereas the standard American spelling for both is \"meter\".<ref>The Metric Conversion Act of 1985 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the [[International System of Units|SI]] for use in the US The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326162948/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}).

British usage, at one stage in the recent past, preferred single quotation marks for ordinary use, but double quotation marks are again now increasingly common; American usage has always preferred double quotation marks, as have Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand English.

British English has moved away from this style while American English has kept it. British style now prefers to punctuate according to the sense, in which punctuation marks only appear inside quotation marks if they were there in the original. Formal British English practice requires a full stop to be put inside the quotation marks if the quoted item is a full sentence that ends where the main sentence ends, but it is common to see the stop outside the ending quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=Michael|title=Punctuation and Quotation Marks|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pun1.htm|work=World Wide Words |accessdate=9 December 2010|year=2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202134153/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pun1.htm| archivedate= 2 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{cols|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Australian English]]\n* [[Canadian English]]\n* [[English language in England]]\n* [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n* [[English orthography]]\n* [[Hong Kong English]]\n* [[Hiberno-English]]\n* [[Indian English]]\n* [[Malaysian English]]\n* [[Manx English]]\n* [[New Zealand English]]\n* [[Philippine English]]\n* [[Scottish English]]\n* [[Singaporean English]]\n* [[South African English]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Chambers, J.K.

{"title_page": "Medicare (Australia)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{use Australian English|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Image:Medicare brand.svg|thumb|The Medicare scheme logo]]\n\n'''Medicare''' is the publicly funded [[universal health care]] insurance scheme in [[Australia]] (including its external territories) operated by [[Services Australia]] (formerly the Department of Human Services). Medicare is the main source of payment of [[health care in Australia]], either partially or fully covering the cost of most [[primary health care]] services for eligible citizens, residents and some visitors. Residents are entitled to a rebate for treatment by medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a [[Medicare (Australia)#Medicare provider numbers|Medicare provider number]], and they can also obtain free treatment in state public hospitals.\n\nSome specialties and allied health services are at least partly covered by Medicare for certain patients with chronic illness. These services include [[ophthalmology]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[audiology]], but not most dental services.\n\nMedicare sets a schedule of fees, called the '''Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''MBS'''), formerly '''Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''CMBS'''); this schedule covers which services are covered, what the fee for that service is deemed to be, and the level (as a percentage) to which they are covered by Medicare rebates to the patient.\n\nThe scheme was created in 1975 by the [[Whitlam Government]] under the brand ''Medibank'', and was limited by the [[Fraser Government]] in 1976 to paying customers only. The [[Hawke Government]] reinstated universal health care in 1984 under the brand of ''Medicare''. [[Medibank]] continued to exist as a government-owned private health insurance provider until it was privatised by the [[Abbott Government]] in 2014.\n\n'''Reciprocal Health Care Agreements''' ('''RHCA''') are in place with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Slovenia]], [[Malta]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[New Zealand]], which entitles visitors from these countries limited access to public health care in Australia and eligible Australians to reciprocal rights while in one of these countries.\n\n==Constitutional framework==\nAustralia's Medicare scheme operates under power granted to the federal Parliament by [[s:Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act#Part V.--Powers of the Parliament.|Section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution]], which was inserted by a [[Australian referendum, 1946 (Social Services)|referendum of 1946]], and gave the federal Parliament power, subject to the Constitution, to make laws with respect to: ''The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances.''\n\nThis empowers the Commonwealth to provide benefits under the Medicare scheme, but not to provide health care services directly. The operation of hospitals, for example, remains within the jurisdiction of the states and territories, and the Commonwealth must operate through their authority.\n\nPrivately run hospitals are also part of the Medicare scheme. Medicare benefits are payable for medical treatment provided to admitted patients of private hospitals as well as public hospitals. However, a patient in a private hospital (by definition, a private patient) would need private insurance coverage to help him or her meet any of the hospital charges such as accommodation costs, as well as some or all of the remainder of the doctor's charges above the 75% Medicare benefit.\n\n==History==\n\n===Health insurance prior to Medibank===\nThere was an increase in the number of [[Australians]] covered by health insurance plans following the end of the [[Second World War]]. However, a large proportion of the [[Australia]]n population continued to lack coverage for health risks in the early 1970s. In 1972, 17% of Australians outside of [[Queensland]] (which had a free public health care system<ref>Health Reform: Public Success, Private Failure by Daniel Drache and Terry Sullivan</ref>) were uninsured, most of whom were on low incomes.\n\n===Medibank (1975-76)===\nThe [[Whitlam government|Whitlam Labor government]], elected in 1972, sought to put an end to the two-tier system by extending healthcare coverage to the entire population.<ref>''Understanding the Australian Health Care System'' by Eileen Willis, Louise Reynolds, and Keleher Helen.</ref> Before the Labor Party came to office, [[Bill Hayden]], one of the Labor Party's front bench members of parliament, took the main responsibility for developing the preliminary plans to establish a universal health scheme.\n\nMedibank started on schedule on 1 July 1975.<ref name=\"medicbrief\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |title=Medicare \u2013 Background Brief |last=Biggs |first=Amanda |date=29 October 2004 |work=Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Canberra, ACT |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207065307/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2012 }}</ref> In nine months, the [[Health Insurance Commission]] (HIC) had increased its staff from 22 to 3500, opened 81 offices, installed 31 minicomputers, 633 terminals and 10 medium-sized computers linked by land-lines to the central computer, and issued registered health insurance cards to 90% of the Australian population.\n\n===Medibank Mark II (1976-81)===\nAfter a change of government at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|December 1975 election]], the [[Fraser Government|Fraser Coalition government]] established the Medibank Review Committee in January 1976. This lead to legislative changes, and the launch of 'Medibank Mark II' on 1 October 1976.\n\nAlso that year, the Fraser government also passed the [[Medibank Private]] bill, that allowed the HIC to enter the private health insurance business. \n\nIn 1978, [[bulk billing]] was restricted to pensioners and the socially disadvantaged. Rebates were reduced to 75% of the schedule fee. The health insurance levy was also scrapped that year.\n\nIn 1979, Medibank rebates were cut further. In 1981, access to Medibank was restricted further, and an income tax rebate was introduced for holders of private health insurance to encourage it's uptake.\n\nFinally, the original Medibank was dissolved entirely in late 1981, leaving behind Medibank Private.\n\n===Medicare (1984-current)===\nOn 1 February 1984, the original Medibank model was reinstated by the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor government]], but renamed Medicare to distinguish it from Medibank Private which continued to exist.\n\n====Easyclaim====\nEasyclaim was launched in 2006, under which a patient would pay the medical practitioner the consultation fee and the receptionist would send a message to Medicare to release the amount of rebate due to the patient's designated bank account. The rebate amount would take into account the patient's concession status and thresholds. In effect, the patient only pays the gap.<ref>https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/medicare-easyclaim/about/what-you-need-know</ref> In recent years, it has been replaced with HICAPS (Health Insurance Claim At Point of Sale). For providers not using HICAPS, patients can make claims on-the-spot (where Medicare will pay the patient at a later date), online, through the Medicare mobile apps, or at joint Medicare-Centrelink Service Centres.\n\n====Better Access Scheme====\nThe [[Better Access Scheme]] extends Medicare to cover more [[allied health]] services than it did previously, including in the area of [[mental health]]. It became available in November 2006.\n\n====National Disability Insurance Scheme====\nA long-standing criticism of the Medicare schedule was it's limited coverage of services to improve the lives of people with disability. This was addressed when the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (ALP) established the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]], which was progressively rolled out across the country between 2013 and 2020. It provides funding for health services beyond those in the Medicare schedule.\n\n====MBS indexation freeze====\nIn the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (ALP), a freeze on Medicare Benefits Scheme indexation was announced as a temporary measure, to run until 2017. This put pressure on the ability of doctors to provide [[bulk billing]], which reduced access by people to free visits to a doctor. People on the lowest incomes increasingly chose to make less visits than they would have before.\n\nIn the [[2016 Australian federal budget]] (Coalition), the indexation freeze was extended to 2020. At the 2019 federal election, the ALP promised that if elected, they would unfreeze GP schedules a year early, a measure matched by the eventually elected Coalition. \n\n====Mediscare====\nTowards the end of the campaign for the [[2016 Australian federal election]], a text identified as being from \"Medicare\" was sent to many people, saying \"Mr Turnbull's plans to privatise Medicare will take us down the road of no return. Time is running out to Save Medicare.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mills |first1=Stephen |title=Three reasons why we should have seen Labor's 'Medicare SMS' coming |url=https://theconversation.com/three-reasons-why-we-should-have-seen-labors-medicare-sms-coming-62177 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> Leader of the Liberal Party, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], had not announced such plans, and the Department of Human Services had not sent the message. It had instead been sent by Liberal opposing political party [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Queensland Labor]]. The furore over the deceptive text brought attention to the value of Medicare to Australians. The affair was widely dubbed \"Mediscare\".\n\n==Funding of scheme==\n[[File:Total health expenditure per capita, US Dollars PPP.png|thumb|right|350px|Total health spending per capita, in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] [[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]], of Australia compared amongst various other first world nations since 1995.]]\n\n===Medicare levy===\nMedicare is presently nominally funded by an income tax surcharge, known as the ''Medicare levy'', which is currently 2% of a resident taxpayer's taxable income.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare levy |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |website=www.ato.gov.au |accessdate=28 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629085049/http://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |archivedate=29 June 2013 }}</ref> However, revenue raised by the levy falls far short of funding the entirety of Medicare expenditure, and any shortfall is paid out of general government expenditure.\n\nThe [[2013 Australian federal budget|2013 budget]] increased the Medicare levy from 1.5% to 2% from 1 July 2014, ostensibly to fund the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare levy increase to fund DisabilityCare Australia |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|website=www.ato.gov.au|accessdate=28 February 2015|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> The [[2017 Australian federal budget|2017 budget]] proposed to increase the Medicare levy from 2% to 2.5%, from 1 July 2018, but this proposal was scrapped on 25 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/turnbull-government-to-scrap-8-billion-medicare-levy-increase-20180425-p4zbl1.html|title=Turnbull government to scrap $8 billion Medicare levy increase |first=Eryk|last=Bagshaw|date=25 April 2018|website=The Age}}</ref>\n\nWhen the levy is payable, it is calculated on the whole of an individual's taxable income, and not just the amount above the low-income threshold.\n\n===Low income exemptions ===\nLow income earners are exempt from the Medicare levy, with different exemption thresholds applying to singles, families, seniors and pensioners, with a phasing-in range. Since 2015\u201316, the exemptions have applied to taxable incomes below $21,335, or $33,738 for seniors and pensioners. The phasing-in range is for taxable incomes between $21,335 and $26,668, or $33,738 and $42,172 for seniors and pensioners.\n\n==Medicare rebates or benefits==\n===Medicare Benefits Schedule===\nMedicare sets a schedule of fees for medical services, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS),<ref>{{cite web |title=MBS Online |url=http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/ |publisher=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |language=en}}</ref> which is freely accessible online. The schedule fee is the government's standard cost of a particular medical service. The [[Australian Medical Association]] (the doctors' union) maintains a similar schedule called the ''AMA List of Medical Services and Fees''<ref>{{cite web |title=AMA Fees List |url=https://feeslist.ama.com.au/ |website=feeslist.ama.com.au |publisher=Australian Medical Association}}</ref> (AMA Fees List), which provides members with \"costing assistance and guidance\". It represents the \"market rate\" for services.\n\nService providers can charge consumers whatever fee they wish, which is often lower than the schedule fee for low income clients, and higher than the schedule fee for everyone else.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sivey |first1=Peter |title=Specialists are free to set their fees, but there are ways to ensure patients don't get ripped off |url=https://theconversation.com/specialists-are-free-to-set-their-fees-but-there-are-ways-to-ensure-patients-dont-get-ripped-off-97372 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> In 2010, an OECD study found that Australia was the only one of the 29 countries studied to give service providers this freedom.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paris |first1=Val\u00e9rie |last2=Devaux |first2=Marion |last3=Wei |first3=Lihan |title=Health Systems Institutional Characteristics: A Survey of 29 OECD Countries |url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-systems-institutional-characteristics_5kmfxfq9qbnr-en;jsessionid=TSmilSnVSuyMGrrOcmC9_oZU.ip-10-240-5-84 |website=OECD iLibrary |publisher=OECD |language=en |doi=10.1787/5kmfxfq9qbnr-en |date=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt it's inception, the MBS was the same as the AMA's equivalent. However, the government has allowed a large gap to grow between the MBS fees and what is charged in the market, in part by freezing indexation of the schedule fees for specialists from 2012 to 2020, and GPs from 2014 to 2020. It has been suggested that MBS schedule fees are now approximately 45% of the AMA list fees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bulwinkel |first1=Kim |title=There seems little understanding... |url=https://theconversation.com/specialists-are-free-to-set-their-fees-but-there-are-ways-to-ensure-patients-dont-get-ripped-off-97372#comment_1626266 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> In 2019, the AMA produced a poster suggesting that if the MBS schedule fees had increased by the same amount as their members' costs, they would more than three times what they currently were.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why is there a gap? |url=https://feeslist.ama.com.au/resources-ama-gaps-poster |website=feeslist.ama.com.au |publisher=Australian Medical Association}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the AMA stated: \"Indexation of the MBS and the private schedules have not kept pace with the costs of providing medical care. This is why patients may have out-of-pocket costs for medical services.  The AMA List is indexed annually at a rate that takes account of the cost of providing medical services and is therefore higher than the MBS and private schedules.

The out-of-pocket costs for Australians are continuing to increase, as a result of increases in healthcare costs above Medicare schedule increases, and also because a Medicare benefits freeze has been imposed over the last few years. Medical practitioners choosing to cease or cut back on bulk-billing also increases out-of-pocket costs to patients.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIf a practitioner does not bulk bill a particular patient, that patient will receive a bill for the medical expenses and is obligated to pay the bill. The practitioner is paid the full amount of the bill. The patient is reimbursed by Medicare 85% of the schedule fee and is out-of-pocket for the balance of the bill. Medicare accumulates the gap amounts, which is the difference between the schedule fee and the 85% reimbursed by Medicare, paid by the patient, to determine when the safety net threshold is reached. After the threshold is reached, the patient is reimbursed for the balance of the schedule fee (i.e., 15%). In the three months to July 2016, 85.9% of GP visits were bulk billed, which fell to 85.4% in the three months to September 2016.<ref name=\"medistats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/medicare-statistics-show-bulk-billing-is-falling/news-story/ef723aeac2a9ed6effaa44cf14669413|title=Bulk billing rates are falling|website=news.com.au}}</ref>\n\nMany medical practitioners charge more than the schedule fee, and the amount in excess of the schedule fee must be borne by the patient and is not counted towards the safety net threshold.\n\n===Medicare safety nets===\nTo provide additional relief to those who incur higher than usual medical costs, Medicare safety nets have been set up. These provide singles and families with an additional rebate when an annual threshold (determined on a calendar year basis) is reached for out-of-hospital Medicare services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www9.health.gov.au/mbs/fullDisplay.cfm?type=note&q=G10.2&qt=noteID&criteria=medicare%20safety%20nets|title=Note G10.2 - Medicare Benefits Schedule}}</ref> There are two safety nets:\n# the original Medicare safety net, and\n# the extended Medicare safety net.\n\nThe thresholds for both safety nets are indexed on 1 January each year to the [[Consumer Price Index]].\n\n====Original Medicare safety net====\nUnder the original Medicare safety net, once an annual threshold in gap costs has been reached, the Medicare rebate for out-of-hospital services is increased to 100% of the schedule fee (up from 85%).  Gap costs refer to the difference between the standard Medicare rebate (85% of the schedule fee) and the actual fee paid, but limited to 100% of the schedule fee.

Once an annual threshold in out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital Medicare services is reached, the Medicare rebate will increase to 80% of any future out-of-pocket costs (now subject to the EMSN fee cap) for out-of-hospital Medicare services for the remainder of the calendar year.  Out-of-pocket costs are the difference between the fee actually paid to the practitioner (subject to the fee cap) and the standard Medicare rebate.\n\nWhen introduced, the general threshold for singles and families was $700 and $300 for singles and families that hold a Commonwealth concession card, and families that received Family Tax Benefit Part (A) (FTB(A)) and families that qualify for notional FTB(A). On 1 January 2006 the thresholds were increased to $1,000 and $500 respectively. From then the EMSN was indexed by the Consumer Price Index on 1 January each year.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/Review_%20Extended_Medicare_Safety_Net/$File/ExtendedMedicareSafetyNetReview.pdf Extended Medicare Safety Net Review]</ref>\n\nSince 1 January 2010, some medical fees have been subject to an EMSN fee cap, so that the out-of-pocket costs used in determining whether the threshold has been reached are limited to that cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/EMSN2011-ExecutiveSummary|title=Extended Medicare Safety Net Review of Capping Arrangements Report 2011: Executive Summary|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|last=Ageing}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpm.org/en/Surveys/CHERE_-_Australia/14/The_Medicare_Safety_Net__review_and_response.html|title=HealthPolicyMonitor - Surveys- CHERE - Australia- 14- The Medicare Safety Net: review and response}}</ref> The EMSN fee cap also applies for any rebate that is paid once the EMSN threshold is reached.

A practitioner may have more than one number, if, for example, they practise from more than one location.\n\n===Medicare card===\nMedicare issues each person entitled to receive benefits under the scheme with a [[Medicare card (Australia)|Medicare card]] which has a number that must be used when making a claim. The card must be produced or the Medicare number provided if the Medicare rebate is paid directly to the doctor under the [[bulk billing]] system; and in its absence the doctor cannot bulk bill for the consultation. The doctor is permitted to keep a record of the patient's card number and use it at subsequent visits.\n\nIt is also necessary to provide a card number (although not necessarily show the card) to gain access to the public hospital system to be treated as a public patient.<ref>[http://www.hcf.com.au/media_center.asp?ID=17&member_id=Guest \"] {{webarchive

will admit patients without a number or card and resolve Medicare eligibility issues after treatment.\n\nThe Medicare card will also be required when accessing medical, hospital or pharmaceutical services in a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement.\n\n==Practitioner review programs==\nThis is a basic overview of the practitioner review process in point form:\n* Medicare Australia provide a federal framework to deliver a health system to the people of Australia.\n* Delivering health care to millions relies on proper utilisation of limited resources.\n* As such, to make sure the services provided under the Medicare umbrella (including medicines administered by the PBS), reviews and audits are conducted.\n* To quote the Medicare website, \"identification and reviews of practitioners' practice profiles protect patients and the community from the risks and costs of inappropriate practice\".<ref>Medicare Australia's website: http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/</ref>\n* Inappropriate practice is defined twofold:\n** \"services that would be unacceptable to the general body of members\".\n** includes the rendering of \"80 or more professional attendances on each of 20 more days in a 12-month period\", i.e. rorting the system through false services rendered.\n* When practitioner is reviewed, their data is compared with that of their peers.\n* If this data is markedly different then this practitioner may be referred to the Practitioner Review Program.\n* If concerns still remain at the end of the Practitioner Review Program, then a referral to the Professional Services Review (PSR) can be made.\n* The PSR:\n** Practitioners are always contacted by the PSR when a review concerning them is conducted.\n** Practitioners covered by the PSR include all who provide services within the PBS and/or Medicare framework (this includes doctors, dentists, allied health professionals).\n** The Medical Director of the PSR acts as a last-ditch arbitrator.\n** The Medical Director will compare the reported case to random data.\n** The outcome may be no further action, a reprimand (administered by the Determining Authority), counseling, etc.<ref>Medicare Australia and the Professional Services Review System, Sara Bird, Australian Family Physician (Volume 37, Number 9), September 2008.</ref>\n\n==Reciprocal

Australia]]\n[[Category:Medicare Australia]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1975]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{use Australian English|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Image:Medicare brand.svg|thumb|The Medicare scheme logo]]\n\n'''Medicare''' is the publicly funded [[universal health care]] insurance scheme in [[Australia]] (including its external territories) operated by [[Services Australia]] (formerly the Department of Human Services). Medicare is the main source of payment of [[health care in Australia]], either partially or fully covering the cost of most [[primary health care]] services for eligible citizens, residents and some visitors. Residents are entitled to a rebate for treatment by medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a [[Medicare (Australia)#Medicare provider numbers|Medicare provider number]], and they can also obtain free treatment in state public hospitals.\n\nSome specialties and allied health services are at least partly covered by Medicare for certain patients with chronic illness. These services include [[ophthalmology]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[audiology]], but not most dental services.\n\nMedicare sets a schedule of fees, called the '''Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''MBS'''), formerly '''Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''CMBS'''); this schedule covers which services are covered, what the fee for that service is deemed to be, and the level (as a percentage) to which they are covered by Medicare rebates to the patient.\n\nThe scheme was created in 1975 by the [[Whitlam Government]] under the brand ''Medibank'', and was limited by the [[Fraser Government]] in 1976 to paying customers only. The [[Hawke Government]] reinstated universal health care in 1984 under the brand of ''Medicare''. [[Medibank]] continued to exist as a government-owned private health insurance provider until it was privatised by the [[Abbott Government]] in 2014.\n\n'''Reciprocal Health Care Agreements''' ('''RHCA''') are in place with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Slovenia]], [[Malta]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[New Zealand]], which entitles visitors from these countries limited access to public health care in Australia and eligible Australians to reciprocal rights while in one of these countries.\n\n==Constitutional framework==\nAustralia's Medicare scheme operates under power granted to the federal Parliament by [[s:Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act#Part V.--Powers of the Parliament.|Section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution]], which was inserted by a [[Australian referendum, 1946 (Social Services)|referendum of 1946]], and gave the federal Parliament power, subject to the Constitution, to make laws with respect to: ''The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances.''\n\nThis empowers the Commonwealth to provide benefits under the Medicare scheme, but not to provide health care services directly. The operation of hospitals, for example, remains within the jurisdiction of the states and territories, and the Commonwealth must operate through their authority.\n\nPrivately run hospitals are also part of the Medicare scheme. Medicare benefits are payable for medical treatment provided to admitted patients of private hospitals as well as public hospitals. However, a patient in a private hospital (by definition, a private patient) would need private insurance coverage to help him or her meet any of the hospital charges such as accommodation costs, as well as some or all of the remainder of the doctor's charges above the 75% Medicare benefit.\n\n==History==\n\n===Health insurance prior to Medibank===\nThere was an increase in the number of [[Australians]] covered by health insurance plans following the end of the [[Second World War]]. However, a large proportion of the [[Australia]]n population continued to lack coverage for health risks in the early 1970s. In 1972, 17% of Australians outside of [[Queensland]] (which had a free public health care system<ref>Health Reform: Public Success, Private Failure by Daniel Drache and Terry Sullivan</ref>) were uninsured, most of whom were on low incomes.\n\n===Medibank (1975-76)===\nThe [[Whitlam government|Whitlam Labor government]], elected in 1972, sought to put an end to the two-tier system by extending healthcare coverage to the entire population.<ref>''Understanding the Australian Health Care System'' by Eileen Willis, Louise Reynolds, and Keleher Helen.</ref> Before the Labor Party came to office, [[Bill Hayden]], one of the Labor Party's front bench members of parliament, took the main responsibility for developing the preliminary plans to establish a universal health scheme.\n\nMedibank started on schedule on 1 July 1975.<ref name=\"medicbrief\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |title=Medicare \u2013 Background Brief |last=Biggs |first=Amanda |date=29 October 2004 |work=Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Canberra, ACT |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207065307/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2012 }}</ref> In nine months, the [[Health Insurance Commission]] (HIC) had increased its staff from 22 to 3500, opened 81 offices, installed 31 minicomputers, 633 terminals and 10 medium-sized computers linked by land-lines to the central computer, and issued registered health insurance cards to 90% of the Australian population.\n\n===Medibank Mark II (1976-81)===\nAfter a change of government at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|December 1975 election]], the [[Fraser Government|Fraser Coalition government]] established the Medibank Review Committee in January 1976. This lead to legislative changes, and the launch of 'Medibank Mark II' on 1 October 1976.\n\nAlso that year, the Fraser government also passed the [[Medibank Private]] bill, that allowed the HIC to enter the private health insurance business. \n\nIn 1978, [[bulk billing]] was restricted to pensions and the socially disadvantaged. Rebates were reduced to 75% of the schedule fee. The health insurance levy was also scrapped that year.\n\nIn 1979, Medibank rebates were cut further. In 1981, access to Medibank was restricted further, and an income tax rebate was introduced for holders of private health insurance to encourage it's uptake.\n\nFinally, the original Medibank was dissolved entirely in late 1981, leaving behind Medibank Private.\n\n===Medicare (1984-current)===\nOn 1 February 1984, the original Medibank model was reinstated by the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor government]], but renamed Medicare to distinguish it from Medibank Private which continued to exist.\n\n====Easyclaim====\nEasyclaim was launched in 2006, under which a patient would pay the medical practitioner the consultation fee and the receptionist would send a message to Medicare to release the amount of rebate due to the patient's designated bank account. The rebate amount would take into account the patient's concession status and thresholds. In effect, the patient only pays the gap.<ref>https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/medicare-easyclaim/about/what-you-need-know</ref> In recent years, it has been replaced with HICAPS (Health Insurance Claim At Point of Sale). For providers not using HICAPS, patients can make claims on-the-spot (where Medicare will pay the patient at a later date), online, through the Medicare mobile apps, or at joint Medicare-Centrelink Service Centres.\n\n====Better Access Scheme====\nThe [[Better Access Scheme]] extends Medicare to cover more [[allied health]] services than it did previously, including in the area of [[mental health]]. It became available in November 2006.\n\n====National Disability Insurance Scheme====\nA long-standing criticism of the Medicare schedule was it's limited coverage of services to improve the lives of people with disability. This was addressed when the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (ALP) established the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]], which was progressively rolled out across the country between 2013 and 2020. It provides funding for health services beyond those in the Medicare schedule.\n\n====MBS indexation freeze====\nIn the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (ALP), a freeze on Medicare Benefits Scheme indexation was announced as a temporary measure, to run until 2017. This put pressure on the ability of doctors to provide [[bulk billing]], which reduced access by people to free visits to a doctor. People on the lowest incomes increasingly chose to make less visits than they would have before.\n\nIn the [[2016 Australian federal budget]] (Coalition), the indexation freeze was extended to 2020. At the 2019 federal election, the ALP promised that if elected, they would unfreeze GP schedules a year early, a measure matched by the eventually elected Coalition. \n\n====Mediscare====\nTowards the end of the campaign for the [[2016 Australian federal election]], a text identified as being from \"Medicare\" was sent to many people, saying \"Mr Turnbull's plans to privatise Medicare will take us down the road of no return. Time is running out to Save Medicare.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mills |first1=Stephen |title=Three reasons why we should have seen Labor's 'Medicare SMS' coming |url=https://theconversation.com/three-reasons-why-we-should-have-seen-labors-medicare-sms-coming-62177 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> Leader of the Liberal Party, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], had not announced such plans, and the Department of Human Services had not sent the message. It had instead been sent by Liberal opposing political party [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Queensland Labor]]. The furore over the deceptive text brought attention to the value of Medicare to Australians. The affair was widely dubbed \"Mediscare\".\n\n==Funding of scheme==\n[[File:Total health expenditure per capita, US Dollars PPP.png|thumb|right|350px|Total health spending per capita, in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] [[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]], of Australia compared amongst various other first world nations since 1995.]]\n\n===Medicare levy===\nMedicare is presently nominally funded by an income tax surcharge, known as the ''Medicare levy'', which is currently 2% of a resident taxpayer's taxable income.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare levy |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |website=www.ato.gov.au |accessdate=28 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629085049/http://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |archivedate=29 June 2013 }}</ref> However, revenue raised by the levy falls far short of funding the entirety of Medicare expenditure, and any shortfall is paid out of general government expenditure.\n\nThe [[2013 Australian federal budget|2013 budget]] increased the Medicare levy from 1.5% to 2% from 1 July 2014, ostensibly to fund the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare levy increase to fund DisabilityCare Australia |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|website=www.ato.gov.au|accessdate=28 February 2015|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> The [[2017 Australian federal budget|2017 budget]] proposed to increase the Medicare levy from 2% to 2.5%, from 1 July 2018, but this proposal was scrapped on 25 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/turnbull-government-to-scrap-8-billion-medicare-levy-increase-20180425-p4zbl1.html|title=Turnbull government to scrap $8 billion Medicare levy increase |first=Eryk|last=Bagshaw|date=25 April 2018|website=The Age}}</ref>\n\nWhen the levy is payable, it is calculated on the whole of an individual's taxable income, and not just the amount above the low-income threshold.\n\n===Low income exemptions ===\nLow income earners are exempt from the Medicare levy, with different exemption thresholds applying to singles, families, seniors and pensioners, with a phasing-in range. Since 2015\u201316, the exemptions have applied to taxable incomes below $21,335, or $33,738 for seniors and pensioners. The phasing-in range is for taxable incomes between $21,335 and $26,668, or $33,738 and $42,172 for seniors and pensioners.\n\n==Medicare rebates or benefits==\n===Medicare Benefits Schedule===\nMedicare sets a schedule of fees for medical services, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS),<ref>{{cite web |title=MBS Online |url=http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/ |publisher=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |language=en}}</ref> which is freely accessible online. The schedule fee is the government's standard cost of a particular medical service. The [[Australian Medical Association]] (the doctors' union) maintains a similar schedule called the ''AMA List of Medical Services and Fees''<ref>{{cite web |title=AMA Fees List |url=https://feeslist.ama.com.au/ |website=feeslist.ama.com.au |publisher=Australian Medical Association}}</ref> (AMA Fees List), which provides members with \"costing assistance and guidance\". It represents the \"market rate\" for services.\n\nService providers can charge consumers whatever fee they wish, which is often lower than the schedule fee for low income clients, and higher than the schedule fee for everyone else.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sivey |first1=Peter |title=Specialists are free to set their fees, but there are ways to ensure patients don't get ripped off |url=https://theconversation.com/specialists-are-free-to-set-their-fees-but-there-are-ways-to-ensure-patients-dont-get-ripped-off-97372 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> In 2010, an OECD study found that Australia was the only one of the 29 countries studied to give service providers this freedom.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paris |first1=Val\u00e9rie |last2=Devaux |first2=Marion |last3=Wei |first3=Lihan |title=Health Systems Institutional Characteristics: A Survey of 29 OECD Countries |url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-systems-institutional-characteristics_5kmfxfq9qbnr-en;jsessionid=TSmilSnVSuyMGrrOcmC9_oZU.ip-10-240-5-84 |website=OECD iLibrary |publisher=OECD |language=en |doi=10.1787/5kmfxfq9qbnr-en |date=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt it's inception, the MBS was the same as the AMA's equivalent. However, the government has allowed a large gap to grow between the MBS fees and what is charged in the market, in part by freezing indexation of the schedule fees for specialists from 2012 to 2020, and GPs from 2014 to 2020. It has been suggested that MBS schedule fees are now approximately 45% of the AMA list fees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bulwinkel |first1=Kim |title=There seems little understanding... |url=https://theconversation.com/specialists-are-free-to-set-their-fees-but-there-are-ways-to-ensure-patients-dont-get-ripped-off-97372#comment_1626266 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> In 2019, the AMA produced a poster suggesting that if the MBS schedule fees had increased by the same amount as their members' costs, they would more than three times what they currently were.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why is there a gap? |url=https://feeslist.ama.com.au/resources-ama-gaps-poster |website=feeslist.ama.com.au |publisher=Australian Medical Association}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the AMA stated: \"Indexation of the MBS and the private schedules have not kept pace with the costs of providing medical care. This is why patients may have out-of-pocket costs for medical services.  The AMA List is indexed annually at a rate that takes account of the cost of providing medical services and is therefore higher than the MBS and private schedules. The AMA List guides members in setting their fees with periodic indexation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Setting Medical Fees and Billing Practices 2017 |url=https://ama.com.au/position-statement/setting-medical-fees-and-billing-practices-2017 |website=Australian Medical Association |language=en |date=25 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, each private health insurer has their own independently-maintained fee schedule for medical services.\n\n===Standard rebate===\nThe standard Medicare rebate or benefit is 100% of a [[general practitioner]] and 85% of a [[Specialty (medicine)|specialist]] schedule fee.<ref name=\"wisc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/whatiscovered/medicare.htm |title=What is covered by Medicare? |publisher=Private Health Insurance Ombudsman |accessdate=4 June 2014 }}</ref> Where medical practitioners bill Medicare directly (called \"[[bulk billing]]\"), they agree with Medicare to accept 85% of the schedule fee in full payment for their services.

Services such as ophthalmology, physiotherapy, [[podiatry]] and audiology (especially though [[Hearing Australia]]) are covered, while others such as (most) dental services are not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/topics/education-guide-chronic-disease-individual-allied-health-services-medicare-items-10950-10970/33196|title=Education guide - Chronic disease individual allied health services Medicare items 10950-10970 - Australian Government Department of Human Services|website=www.humanservices.gov.au|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> For Australians struggling with [[Mental health in Australia|mental health]], Medicare provides up to 10 fully covered individual and group counselling sessions per year as part of the [[Better Access Scheme]].

The out-of-pocket costs for Australians are continuing to increase, as a result of increases in healthcare costs above Medicare schedule increases, and also because a Medicare benefits freeze has been imposed over the last few years. Medical practitioners choosing to cease or cut back on bulk-billing also increases out-of-pocket costs to patients.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIf a practitioner does not bulk bill a particular patient, that patient will receive a bill for the medical expenses and is obligated to pay the bill. The practitioner is paid the full amount of the bill. The patient is reimbursed by Medicare 85% of the schedule fee and is out-of-pocket for the balance of the bill. Medicare accumulates the gap amounts, which is the difference between the schedule fee and the 85% reimbursed by Medicare, paid by the patient, to determine when the safety net threshold is reached. After the threshold is reached, the patient is reimbursed for the balance of the schedule fee (i.e., 15%). In the three months to July 2016, 85.9% of GP visits were bulk billed, which fell to 85.4% in the three months to September 2016.<ref name=\"medistats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/medicare-statistics-show-bulk-billing-is-falling/news-story/ef723aeac2a9ed6effaa44cf14669413|title=Bulk billing rates are falling|website=news.com.au}}</ref>\n\nMany medical practitioners charge more than the schedule fee, and the amount in excess of the schedule fee must be borne by the patient and is not counted towards the safety net threshold.\n\n===Medicare safety nets===\nTo provide additional relief to those who incur higher than usual medical costs, Medicare safety nets have been set up. These provide singles and families with an additional rebate when an annual threshold (determined on a calendar year basis) is reached for out-of-hospital Medicare services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www9.health.gov.au/mbs/fullDisplay.cfm?type=note&q=G10.2&qt=noteID&criteria=medicare%20safety%20nets|title=Note G10.2 - Medicare Benefits Schedule}}</ref> There are two safety nets:\n# the original Medicare safety net, and\n# the extended Medicare safety net.\n\nThe thresholds for both safety nets are indexed on 1 January each year to the [[Consumer Price Index]].\n\n====Original Medicare safety net====\nUnder the original Medicare safety net, once an annual threshold in gap costs has been reached, the Medicare rebate for out-of-hospital services is increased to 100% of the schedule fee (up from 85%).  Gap costs refer to the difference between the standard Medicare rebate (85% of the schedule fee) and the actual fee paid, but limited to 100% of the schedule fee.

Once an annual threshold in out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital Medicare services is reached, the Medicare rebate will increase to 80% of any future out-of-pocket costs (now subject to the EMSN fee cap) for out-of-hospital Medicare services for the remainder of the calendar year.  Out-of-pocket costs are the difference between the fee actually paid to the practitioner (subject to the fee cap) and the standard Medicare rebate.\n\nWhen introduced, the general threshold for singles and families was $700 and $300 for singles and families that hold a Commonwealth concession card, and families that received Family Tax Benefit Part (A) (FTB(A)) and families that qualify for notional FTB(A). On 1 January 2006 the thresholds were increased to $1,000 and $500 respectively. From then the EMSN was indexed by the Consumer Price Index on 1 January each year.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/Review_%20Extended_Medicare_Safety_Net/$File/ExtendedMedicareSafetyNetReview.pdf Extended Medicare Safety Net Review]</ref>\n\nSince 1 January 2010, some medical fees have been subject to an EMSN fee cap, so that the out-of-pocket costs used in determining whether the threshold has been reached are limited to that cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/EMSN2011-ExecutiveSummary|title=Extended Medicare Safety Net Review of Capping Arrangements Report 2011: Executive Summary|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|last=Ageing}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpm.org/en/Surveys/CHERE_-_Australia/14/The_Medicare_Safety_Net__review_and_response.html|title=HealthPolicyMonitor - Surveys- CHERE - Australia- 14- The Medicare Safety Net: review and response}}</ref> The EMSN fee cap also applies for any rebate that is paid once the EMSN threshold is reached.

The provider number is required to appear on the practitioners\u2019 bills, prescriptions or service requests (referrals) that are eligible for a Medicare benefit. A practitioner may have more than one number, if, for example, they practise from more than one location.\n\n===Medicare card===\nMedicare issues each person entitled to receive benefits under the scheme with a [[Medicare card (Australia)|Medicare card]] which has a number that must be used when making a claim. The card must be produced or the Medicare number provided if the Medicare rebate is paid directly to the doctor under the [[bulk billing]] system; and in its absence the doctor cannot bulk bill for the consultation. The doctor is permitted to keep a record of the patient's card number and use it at subsequent visits.\n\nIt is also necessary to provide a card number (although not necessarily show the card) to gain

will admit patients without a number or card and resolve Medicare eligibility issues after treatment.\n\nThe Medicare card will also be required when accessing medical, hospital or pharmaceutical services in a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement.\n\n==Practitioner review programs==\nThis is a basic overview of the practitioner review process in point form:\n* Medicare Australia provide a federal framework to deliver a health system to the people of Australia.\n* Delivering health care to millions relies on proper utilisation of limited resources.\n* As such, to make sure the services provided under the Medicare umbrella (including medicines administered by the PBS), reviews and audits are conducted.\n* To quote the Medicare website, \"identification and reviews of practitioners' practice profiles protect patients and the community from the risks and costs of inappropriate practice\".<ref>Medicare Australia's website: http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/</ref>\n* Inappropriate practice is defined twofold:\n** \"services that would be unacceptable to the general body of members\".\n** includes the rendering of \"80 or more professional attendances on each of 20 more days in a 12-month period\", i.e. rorting the system through false services rendered.\n* When practitioner is reviewed, their data is compared with that of their peers.\n* If this data is markedly different then this practitioner may be referred to the Practitioner Review Program.\n* If concerns still remain at the end of the Practitioner Review Program, then a referral to the Professional Services Review (PSR) can be made.\n* The PSR:\n** Practitioners are always contacted by the PSR when a review concerning them is conducted.\n** Practitioners covered by the PSR include all who provide services within the PBS and/or Medicare framework (this includes doctors, dentists, allied health professionals).\n** The Medical Director of the PSR acts as a last-ditch arbitrator.\n** The Medical Director will compare the reported case to random data.\n** The outcome may be no further action, a reprimand (administered by the Determining Authority), counseling, etc.<ref>Medicare Australia and the Professional Services Review System, Sara Bird, Australian Family Physician (Volume 37, Number 9), September 2008.</ref>\n\n==Reciprocal

Duels in this form were chiefly practiced in [[early modern Europe]] with precedents in the medieval code of [[chivalry]], and continued into the modern period (18th to late 19th centuries, if not beyond) especially among [[Officer (armed forces)|military officers]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries (and earlier), duels were mostly fought with [[sword]]s (the [[rapier]], and later the [[small sword]]), but beginning in the late 18th century in [[England]], duels were more commonly fought using [[pistol]]s. [[Fencing]] and pistol duels continued to co-exist throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe duel was based on a code of [[honour|honor]]. Duels were fought not so much to kill the opponent as to gain \"satisfaction\", that is, to restore one's honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one's life for it, and as such the tradition of dueling was originally reserved for the male members of [[nobility]]; however, in the modern era it extended to those of the [[upper classes]] generally. On occasion, duels with [[pistol]]s or swords were fought between women.<ref>Hopton, p.182</ref><ref>Hopton, pp.173-174</ref>\n\nLegislation against dueling goes back to the medieval period. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) outlawed duels,<ref>IV Lateran c. 18, Peter R.

Dueling largely fell out of favor in England by the mid-19th century and in [[Continental Europe]] by the turn of the 20th century.

In Medieval society, judicial duels were fought by knights and squires to end various disputes.<ref name=\"Dav\">David Levinson and Karen Christensen.

Judicial combat took two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat.<ref name=\"Dav\"/> The feat of arms was used to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The battle was fought as a result of a slight or challenge to one party's [[honor]] which could not be resolved by a court. Weapons were standardized and typical of a knight's armoury, for example longswords, polearms etc., however, weapon quality and augmentations were at the discretion of the knight, for example, a spiked hand guard or an extra grip for half-swording. The parties involved would wear their own armour; for example, one knight wearing full plate might face another wearing chain mail. The duel lasted until one party could no longer fight back. In early cases, the defeated party was then executed. This type of duel soon evolved into the more [[Chivalry|chivalric]] ''[[pas d'armes]],'' or \"passage of arms\", a chivalric [[hastilude]] that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. A knight or group of knights (''tenans'' or \"holders\") would stake out a travelled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass (''venans'' or \"comers\") must first fight, or be disgraced.<ref>Hubbard, Ben. ''Gladiators: From Spartacus to Spitfires''. Canary Press (August 15, 2011). Chapter: Pas D'armes. ASIN: B005HJTS8O.</ref> If a traveling ''venans'' did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the ''venans'' chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] was critical of dueling throughout medieval history, frowning both on the traditions of [[judicial combat]] and on the duel on points of [[honour|honor]] among the nobility.\nJudicial duels were deprecated by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] of 1215, but the judicial duel persisted in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] into the 15th century.<ref>\nIn 1459 (''MS Thott 290 2'') [[Hans Talhoffer]] reported that in spite of Church disapproval, there were nevertheless seven capital crimes that were still commonly accepted as resolvable by means of a judicial duel.</ref> The word duel comes from the Latin 'duellum', cognate with 'bellum', meaning 'war'.\n\n===Renaissance and early modern Europe ===\nDuring the early [[Renaissance]], dueling established the status of a respectable [[gentry|gentleman]] and was an accepted manner to resolve disputes. [[File:Dueling engraving.jpg|thumb|240px|Dueling remained highly popular in European society, despite various attempts at banning the practice.]]\n\nThe first published ''[[code duello]]'', or \"code of dueling\", appeared in [[Renaissance Italy]]. The first formalized national code was [[France]]'s, during the [[Renaissance]].\n\nBy the 17th century, duelling had become regarded as a prerogative of the [[aristocracy]], throughout Europe, and attempts to discourage or suppress it generally failed. For example, King [[Louis XIII]] of [[France]] outlawed dueling in 1626, a law which remained in force afterwards, and his successor [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] intensified efforts to wipe out the duel. Despite these efforts, dueling continued unabated, and it is estimated that between 1685 and 1716, French officers fought 10,000 duels, leading to over 400 deaths.<ref>Lynn, p. 257.</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]], as late as 1777, a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]]. A copy of the code, known as 'The twenty-six commandments', was to be kept in a gentleman's pistol case for reference should a dispute arise regarding procedure.<ref name=\"Hamilton 1829\">{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Joseph |title=The only approved guide through all the stages of a quarrel |publisher=Millikin |location=Dublin |year=1829 |edition=(Internet Archive) |url=https://archive.org/details/onlyapprovedguid00hami |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment-era opposition===\nBy the late 18th century, [[Enlightenment era]] values began to influence society with new self-conscious ideas about [[politeness]], [[civil society|civil behaviour]] and new attitudes towards [[violence]]. The cultivated art of politeness demanded that there should be no outward displays of anger or violence, and the concept of honor became more personalized.\n\nBy the 1770s the practice of dueling was increasingly coming under attack from many sections of enlightened society, as a violent relic of Europe's medieval past unsuited for modern life. As England began to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialize]] and benefit from urban planning and more effective [[Metropolitan police|police forces]], the culture of street violence in general began to slowly wane. The growing [[middle class]] maintained their reputation with recourse to either bringing charges of [[libel]], or to the fast-growing print media of the early 19th century, where they could defend their honor and resolve conflicts through correspondence in newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|title=The Death of Dueling|accessdate=2014-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107223937/http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nInfluential new intellectual trends at the turn of the 19th century bolstered the anti-dueling campaign; the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]] stressed that praiseworthy actions were exclusively restricted to those that maximize human welfare and happiness, and the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] notion of the \"Christian conscience\" began to actively promote social activism. Individuals in the [[Clapham Sect]] and similar societies, who had successfully campaigned for the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], condemned dueling as ungodly violence and as an egocentric culture of honor.<ref>David W.

Many of those killed or wounded were [[midshipmen]] or junior officers.

[[French Fourth Republic|After World War II]], duels had become rare even in France, and those that still occurred were covered in the press as eccentricities. Duels in France in this period, while still taken seriously as a matter of honor, were not fought to the death. They consisted of fencing with the \u00e9p\u00e9e mostly in a fixed distance with the aim of drawing blood from the opponent's arm.\nIn 1949, former Vichy-official [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]] fought school teacher Roger Nordmann.<ref>\"A French lawyer and a schoolteacher fought a duel today in a meadow near Paris.  Roger Nordmann the schoolteacher was reportedly pricked by the lawyer Jean-Louis Tixier- Vignancour's sword and the duel ended with everyone's honor intact. The feud started three weeks go when. Tixier-Vignancbur challenged Nordmann to a duel with pistols after he said Nordmann insulted him during a treason trial; Nordmann accepted the challenge but said he had never fired anything more potent than . a water pistol. He then chose two of his prettiest girl students, as seconds. The 'lawyer objected on the grounds that a second must be ready to take his principal's place and he could not lift his hand against a woman. The weapons and the seconds Were properly arranged after weeks of negotiations. The duelists went into hiding from newspapermen and police, since dueling is illegal.

This isn't the \"jousting\" article.-->\nThe custom of \"flinging the gauntlet in the face of another Knight\" is illustrated in early Italian romances such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]''\n(The Scots Magazine 89/90 (1822), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fFw3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA575 p. 575]), and the English phrase of  \"throwing down the gauntlet\" occurs in the context of [[Renaissance-era jousting|Tudor-era tournaments]] from the 1540s.\n<!--\nA reference to the supposedly medieval practice is found in the pseudo-medieval poetry of [[Thomas Chatterton]] (''The Tournament: An Interlude'', purportedly written in the 15th century by \"Thomas Rowley\"), ''there's mie gauntlette onn mie gaberdyne.''-->\n</ref>\n\nUsually challenges were delivered in writing by one or more close friends who acted as \"seconds\". The challenge, written in formal language, laid out the real or imagined grievances and a demand for satisfaction. The challenged party then had the choice of accepting or refusing the challenge. Grounds for refusing the challenge could include that it was frivolous, or that the challenger was not generally recognized as a \"gentleman\" since dueling was limited to persons of equal social station. However care had to be taken before declining a challenge, as it could result in accusations of cowardice or be perceived as an insult to the challenger's seconds if it was implied that they were acting on behalf of someone of low social standing. Participation in a duel could be honorably refused on account of a major difference in age between the parties and, to a lesser extent, in cases of social inferiority on the part of the challenger. Such inferiority had to be immediately obvious, however. As author [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] states, \"with social distinctions often difficult to measure,\" most men could not escape on such grounds without the appearance of cowardice.<ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram. Southern Honor: Ethics & Behavior in the Old South. Oxford University Press, 2007, p.355-356</ref>\n\nOnce a challenge was accepted, if not done already, both parties (known as \"principals\") would appoint trusted representatives to act as their seconds with no further direct communication between the principals being allowed until the dispute was settled. The seconds had a number of responsibilities, of which the first was to do all in their power to avert bloodshed provided their principal's honor was not compromised. This could involve back and forth correspondence about a mutually agreeable lesser course of action, such as a formal apology for the alleged offense.\n\nIn the event that the seconds failed to persuade their principals to avoid a fight they then attempted to agree on terms for the duel that would limit the chance of a fatal outcome, consistent with the generally accepted guidelines for affairs of honor. The exact rules or etiquette for dueling varied by time and locale but were usually referred to as the [[code duello]]. In most cases the challenged party had the choice of weapons, with swords being favored in many parts of continental Europe and pistols in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nIt was the job of the seconds to make all of the arrangements in advance, including how long the duel would last and what conditions would end the duel. Often sword duels were only fought until blood was drawn, thus severely limiting the likelihood of death or grave injury since a scratch could be considered as satisfying honor. In pistol duels, the number of shots to be permitted and the range were set out. Care was taken by the seconds to ensure the ground chosen gave no unfair advantage to either party. A doctor or surgeon was usually arranged to be on hand. Other things often arranged by the seconds could go into minute details that might seem odd in the modern world, such as the dress code (duels were often formal affairs), the number and names of any other witnesses to be present and whether or not refreshments would be served.<ref>Lynn, p. 255, 257.</ref>\n\n===Field of honor===\n{{Redirect|Field of honor||Field of Honor (disambiguation){{!}}Field of Honor}}\nThe chief criteria for choosing the field of honor were isolation, to avoid discovery and interruption by the authorities; and jurisdictional ambiguity, to avoid legal consequences. Islands in rivers dividing two jurisdictions were popular dueling sites; the cliffs below Weehawken on the Hudson River where the [[Hamilton-Burr duel]] occurred were a popular field of honor for New York duellists because of the uncertainty whether New York or New Jersey jurisdiction applied. Duels traditionally took place at dawn, when the poor light would make the participants less likely to be seen, and to force an interval for reconsideration or sobering-up.\n\nFor some time before the mid-18th century, swordsmen dueling at dawn often carried lanterns to see each other. This happened so regularly that fencing manuals integrated lanterns into their lessons. An example of this is using the lantern to parry blows and blind the opponent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/Angelo.php |title=How to Defend a Monopoly |publisher=Classicalfencing.com |date=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The manuals sometimes show the combatants carrying the lantern in the left hand wrapped behind the back, which is still one of the traditional positions for the off hand in modern fencing.<ref>[http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525024932/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png|date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions===\nAt the choice of the offended party, the duel could be fought to a number of conclusions:\n* To first blood, in which case the duel would be ended as soon as one man was wounded, even if the wound was minor.\n* Until one man was so severely wounded as to be physically unable to continue the duel.\n* To the death (or \"\u00e0 l'outrance\"), in which case there would be no satisfaction until one party was mortally wounded.\n* In the case of pistol duels, each party would fire one shot. If neither man was hit and if the challenger stated that he was satisfied, the duel would be declared over. If the challenger was not satisfied, a pistol duel could continue until one man was wounded or killed, but to have more than three exchanges of fire was considered barbaric and, on the rare occasion that no hits were achieved, somewhat ridiculous. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUnder the latter conditions, one or both parties could intentionally miss in order to fulfill the conditions of the duel, without loss of either life or honor. However, doing so, known as [[delope|deloping]], could imply that one's opponent was not worth shooting. This practice occurred despite being expressly banned by the [[Code duello|Code Duello]] of 1777. Rule XII stated: \"No dumb shooting or firing in the air is admissible in any case... children's play must be dishonourable on one side or the other, and is accordingly prohibited.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904223840/http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n\nPractices varied, however, but unless the challenger was of a higher social standing, such as a baron or prince challenging a knight, the person being challenged was allowed to decide the time and weapons used in the duel. The offended party could stop the duel at any time if he deemed his honor satisfied. In some duels, the seconds would take the place of the primary dueller if the primary was not able to finish the duel. This was usually done in duels with swords, where one's expertise was sometimes limited. The second would also act as a witness.\n\n===Pistol duel===\n[[File:Yevgeny Onegin by Repin.jpg|thumb|right|The fictional pistol duel between [[Eugene Onegin]] and Vladimir Lensky. Watercolour by [[Ilya Repin]] (1899)]]\nFor a pistol duel, the two would typically start at a pre-agreed length of ground, which would be measured out by the seconds and marked, often with swords stuck in the ground (referred to as \"points\"). At a given signal, often the dropping of a handkerchief, the principals could advance and fire at will. This latter system reduced the possibility of cheating, as neither principal had to trust the other not to turn too soon. Another system involved alternate shots being taken, beginning with the challenged firing first.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMany historical duels were prevented by the difficulty of arranging the ''\"methodus pugnandi\"''.

These stressed the need to protect one's reputation and social mask and prescribed the circumstances under which an insulted party should issue a challenge.\nThe word ''duel'' was introduced in the 1590s, modelled after [[Medieval Latin]] ''duellum'' (an archaic Latin form of ''bellum'' \"war\", but associated by popular etymology with ''duo'' \"two\", hence  \"one-on-one combat\").<ref>This usage apparently goes back to [[John of Legnano]], author of a 14th-century work on dueling, ''De Bello'', cited by [[du Cange]]\n''Pugna corporalis deliberata hinc inde duorum, ad purgationem, gloriam, vel odii aggregationem.''\n[http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/DUELLUM3 3.

Dueling was further propagated by the arrival of Italian fencing masters such as Rocco Bonetti and Vincento Saviolo. By the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] dueling was well entrenched within a militarised peerage&nbsp;\u2013 one of the most important duels being that between [[Lord Kinloss|Edward Bruce, 2nd Lord Kinloss]] and [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset|Edward Sackville]] (later the 4th Earl of Dorset) in 1613, during which Bruce was killed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DgEOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=Lord+Bruce+Earl+of+Dorset+1613+duel#v=onepage&q=Lord%20Bruce%20Earl%20of%20Dorset%201613%20duel&f=false|title=The Duel: A History of Duelling|first=Robert|last=Baldick|publisher=Chapman & Hall|year=1965|accessdate=19 April 2011|isbn=9780600328377}}</ref> James I encouraged [[Francis Bacon]] as Solicitor-General to prosecute would-be duellists in the [[Court of Star Chamber]], leading to about two hundred prosecutions between 1603 and 1625. He also issued an edict against dueling in 1614 and is believed to have supported production of an anti-dueling tract by the [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]]. Dueling however, continued to spread out from the court, notably into the army. In the mid-17th century it was for a time checked by the activities of the Parliamentarians whose Articles of War specified the death penalty for would-be duellists. Nevertheless, dueling survived and increased markedly with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Among the difficulties of anti-dueling campaigners was that although monarchs uniformly proclaimed their general hostility to dueling, they were nevertheless very reluctant to see their own favourites punished. In 1712 both the [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] and [[Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun|Charles 4th Baron Mohun]] were killed in a [[Hamilton\u2013Mohun Duel|celebrated duel]] induced by political rivalry and squabbles over an inheritance.\n\nBy the 1780s, the values of the duel had spread into the broader and emerging society of gentlemen. Research shows that much the largest group of later duellists were military officers, followed by the young sons of the metropolitan elite (see Banks, ''A Polite Exchange of Bullets''). Dueling was also popular for a time among doctors and, in particular, in the legal professions. Quantifying the number of duels in Britain is difficult, but there are about 1,000 attested between 1785 and 1845 with fatality rates at least 15% and probably somewhat higher. The last duel in England was fought in 1852 between two French political exiles.<ref name=KEG/>\n\nIn 1777, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]], a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels.

Punishments for participation in duels were rather mild&nbsp;\u2013 up to a year's imprisonment if the outcome of the duel was death or grievous bodily harm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marek Adamiec |url=http://monika.univ.gda.pl/~literat/honor/ |title=Polski kodeks honorowy |publisher=Monika.univ.gda.pl |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>\n\n====Russia====\n[[File:Duel of Pushkin and d'Anthes (19th century).jpg|thumb|Depiction of the pistol duel of [[Alexander Pushkin]] vs. [[Georges d'Anth\u00e8s]], January 1837]]\nThe tradition of dueling and the word ''duel'' itself were brought to Russia in the 17th century by adventurers in Russian service. Dueling quickly became so popular \u2013 and the number of casualties among the commanding ranks so high \u2013 that, in 1715, Emperor [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the First]] was forced to forbid the practice on pain of having both duellists hanged. Despite this official ban, dueling became a significant military tradition in the Russian Empire with a detailed unwritten [[w:ru:\u0414\u0443\u044d\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441|dueling code]]&nbsp;\u2013 which was eventually written down by V. Durasov and released in print in 1908.<ref>V. Durasov \"The Dueling Code\" {{ISBN|5-7905-1634-3}}</ref> This code forbade duels between people of different [[Table of Ranks|ranks]]. For instance, an infantry captain could not challenge a major but could easily pick on a Titular Counsellor. On the other hand, a higher ranked person could not stoop to challenge lower ranks; so, it was up to his subordinates or servants to take revenge on their master's behalf.\n\nDueling was also common among prominent Russian writers, poets, and politicians. Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] fought 29 duels, challenging many prominent figures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-push.net/ |title=Pushkin duels. Full list|publisher=D-push.net|accessdate=2012-10-22|language=ru}}</ref> before being killed in a duel with [[Georges d'Anth\u00e8s]] in 1837. His successor [[Mikhail Lermontov]] was killed four years later by fellow Army officer [[Nikolai Martynov]]. The dueling tradition died out in the [[Russian Empire]] slowly from the mid-19th century.\n\n===Americas===\n\n====Latin America====\nDuels were common in much of [[South America]] during the 20th century,<ref name=\"DSP\"/> although generally illegal. In [[Argentina]], during the 18th and 19th century, it was common for ''[[gaucho]]s''\u2014cowboys\u2014to resolve their disputes in a fight using working knives called ''[[Fac\u00f3n|facones]]''. After the turn of the 19th century, when repeating handguns became more widely available, use of the fac\u00f3n as a close-combat weapon declined. Among the gauchos, many continued to wear the knife, though mostly as a tool. However, it was occasionally still used to settle arguments \"of honor\". In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping when one could no longer see clearly through the blood.\n\nIn Peru there were several high-profile duels by politicians in the early part of the 20th century including one in 1957 involving [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]], who went on to become President. In 2002 Peruvian independent congressman Eittel Ramos challenged Vice President [[David Waisman]] to a duel with pistols, saying the vice president had insulted him.

Three ironies emerged from the dueling custom. First, though confined to a segment of the upper classes, dueling served essentially the same purpose as the lowest eye-gouging battle among [[Tennessee]] hog drivers. Second, because of this congruence between upper and lower concepts of [[honor]], dueling was not at all undemocratic. It enabled lesser men to enter, however imperfectly, the ranks of leaders, and allowed followers to manipulate leaders to their taste. Third, the promise of esteem and status that beckoned men to the field of honor did not always match the expectation, but often enough dueling served as a form of [[scapegoating]] for unresolved personal problems.<ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram. 1982.

Many [[kshatriya]] considered it shameful to die in bed, and in their old age often arranged for a ''yuddha-dhan'', literally meaning \"combat charity\". According to this practice when a warrior felt he did not have much time to live, he would go along with a few attendants and ask another king for a duel or a small scale battle. In this way he chooses his own time and manner of death and is assured that he will die fighting. Duels to the death were legal in some periods, and punishable by execution in others.<ref name=Auboyer>{{cite book |title=Daily Life in Ancient India |author=Jeanine Auboyer |year=1965 |pp=58 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=France}}</ref>\n\nAncient epics and texts like the ''[[Dharmashastra]]'' tell that duels took place under strict rules of conduct, and to violate them was both shameful and sinful. According to these rules, it was forbidden to injure or kill an opponent who has lost their weapon, who surrenders, or who has been knocked unconscious. The ''[[Manusm\u1e5bti]]'' tells that if a warrior's topknot comes loose during a duel, the opponent must give him time to bind his hair before continuing. Both duellists are required to wield the same weapon, and specific rules may have existed for each weapon. For example, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' records that hitting below the waist is forbidden in mace duels.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University|author=Kaushik Roy}}</ref> In one ancient form of dueling, two warriors wielded a knife in the right hand while their left hands were tied together.<ref name=Auboyer/>\n\nThe Portuguese traveller [[Duarte Barbosa]] tells that dueling was a common practice among the nobles of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], and it was the only legal manner in which \"murder\" could be committed. After fixing a day for the duel and getting permission from the king or minister, the duellists would arrive at the appointed field \"with great pleasure\". Duellists would wear no armour and were bare from the waist up. From the waist down they wore cotton cloth tightly round with many folds. The weapons used for dueling were swords, shields and daggers which the king would appoint them of equal length. Judges decided what rewards would be given to duellists; the winner may even acquire the loser's estate.<ref>{{cite book |title= Travels of Duerte Barbosa |author=M.L. Dames |year=1918 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nDuels in [[Manipur]] were first recorded in the ''Chainarol-Puya'' which details the ethics of dueling. When a fighter was challenged, the day for the bout would be fixed to allow for time to prepare the weapons. Allowing the opponent the first chance to fire an arrow or hurl a spear was considered particularly courageous. The duel itself was not necessarily to the death, and usually ended once first blood has been drawn. However, the victor was still expected to behead the loser. Either before the duel or before the beheading, the fighters would share the meals and wine prepared by their wives. If it had been so requested beforehand, the loser's body may be cremated. Heads were taken as trophies, as was custom among the headhunters of northeast India. Various taboos existed such as not killing an opponent who runs, begs or cries out of fear, or anyone who pleads for protection.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn [[Kerala]], duels known as [[ankam]] were fought by the [[kalari]]-trained [[Chekavar]] caste on behalf of their local rulers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=Chekavan+|title= Communal Road to a Secular Kerala.Page 30|work=George Mathew|publisher=Concept Pub.Co, 1989|isbn=978-81-7022-282-8|accessdate=2007-12-28|year= 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xNAI9F8IBOgC&pg=PA27&dq=Chekavar+Sevakan|title= Religion and Social Conflict in South Asia.Page 27|work=Bardwell L.

Duels in this form were chiefly practiced in [[early modern Europe]] with precedents in the medieval code of [[chivalry]], and continued into the modern period (18th to late 19th centuries, if not beyond) especially among [[Officer (armed forces)|military officers]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries (and earlier), duels were mostly fought with [[sword]]s (the [[rapier]], and later the [[small sword]]), but beginning in the late 18th century in [[England]], duels were more commonly fought using [[pistol]]s. [[Fencing]] and pistol duels continued to co-exist throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe duel was based on a code of [[honour|honor]]. Duels were fought not so much to kill the opponent as to gain \"satisfaction\", that is, to restore one's honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one's life for it, and as such the tradition of dueling was originally reserved for the male members of [[nobility]]; however, in the modern era it extended to those of the [[upper classes]] generally. On occasion, duels with [[pistol]]s or swords were fought between women.<ref>Hopton, p.182</ref><ref>Hopton, pp.173-174</ref>\n\nLegislation against dueling goes back to the medieval period. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) outlawed duels,<ref>IV Lateran c. 18, Peter R. Coss, ''The Moral World of the Law'',  Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 78</ref> and civil legislation in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against dueling was passed in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref name=\"Liszt\"/>\nFrom the early 17th century, duels became illegal in the countries where they were practiced. Dueling largely fell out of favor in England by the mid-19th century and in [[Continental Europe]] by the turn of the 20th century. Dueling declined in the [[Eastern United States]] in the 19th century and by the time the [[American Civil War]] broke out, dueling had begun to wane even in the \n[[Southern United States|South]].<ref name=uuooooav>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/sfeature/dueling.html The History of Dueling in America] PBS.org, Accessed February 8, 2014</ref> Public opinion, not legislation, caused the change.<ref name=uuooooav />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and Middle Ages===\n[[File:Gerichtlicher Zweikampf.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a judicial combat in the Dresden codex of the ''Sachsenspiegel'' (early to mid-14th century), illustrating the provision that the two combatants must \"share the sun\", i.e. align themselves perpendicular to the Sun so that neither has an advantage.]]\n{{Further|Single combat}}\n[[File:Manifesto disfida di barletta.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative poster for the fourth centennial of the ''Disfida di Barletta'', the [[Challenge of Barletta]], fought on 13 February 1503 between 13 Italian and 13 French [[knights]] all shown wearing full [[plate armour]].]]\n\nIn [[Western world|Western]] society, the formal concept of a duel developed out of the [[mediaeval|medieval]] [[judicial duel]] and older pre-Christian practices such as the [[Viking Age]] ''[[holmgang]]''. In Medieval society, judicial duels were fought by knights and squires to end various disputes.<ref name=\"Dav\">David Levinson and Karen Christensen.

Boydell Press (November 18, 2010). pp. 157-160. {{ISBN|978-1843835967}}</ref> Countries like [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Ireland]] practiced this tradition. Judicial combat took two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat.<ref name=\"Dav\"/> The feat of arms was used to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The battle was fought as a result of a slight or challenge to one party's [[honor]] which could not be resolved by a court. Weapons were standardized and typical of a knight's armoury, for example longswords, polearms etc., however, weapon quality and augmentations were at the discretion of the knight, for example, a spiked hand guard or an extra grip for half-swording. The parties involved would wear their own armour; for example, one knight wearing full plate might face another wearing chain mail. The duel lasted until one party could no longer fight back. In early cases, the defeated party was then executed. This type of duel soon evolved into the more [[Chivalry|chivalric]] ''[[pas d'armes]],'' or \"passage of arms\", a chivalric [[hastilude]] that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. A knight or group of knights (''tenans'' or \"holders\") would stake out a travelled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass (''venans'' or \"comers\") must first fight, or be disgraced.<ref>Hubbard, Ben. ''Gladiators: From Spartacus to Spitfires''. Canary Press (August 15, 2011). Chapter: Pas D'armes. ASIN: B005HJTS8O.</ref> If a traveling ''venans'' did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the ''venans'' chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] was critical of dueling throughout medieval history, frowning both on the traditions of [[judicial combat]] and on the duel on points of [[honour|honor]] among the nobility.\nJudicial duels were deprecated by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] of 1215, but the judicial duel persisted in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] into the 15th century.<ref>\nIn 1459 (''MS Thott 290 2'') [[Hans Talhoffer]] reported that in spite of Church disapproval, there were nevertheless seven capital crimes that were still commonly accepted as resolvable by means of a judicial duel.</ref> The word duel comes from the Latin 'duellum', cognate with 'bellum', meaning 'war'.\n\n===Renaissance & early modern Europe ===\nDuring the early [[Renaissance]], dueling established the status of a respectable [[gentry|gentleman]] and was an accepted manner to resolve disputes. [[File:Dueling engraving.jpg|thumb|240px|Dueling remained highly popular in European society, despite various attempts at banning the practice.]]\n\nThe first published ''[[code duello]]'', or \"code of dueling\", appeared in [[Renaissance Italy]]. The first formalized national code was [[France]]'s, during the [[Renaissance]].\n\nBy the 17th century, duelling had become regarded as a prerogative of the [[aristocracy]], throughout Europe, and attempts to discourage or suppress it generally failed. For example, King [[Louis XIII]] of [[France]] outlawed dueling in 1626, a law which remained in force afterwards, and his successor [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] intensified efforts to wipe out the duel. Despite these efforts, dueling continued unabated, and it is estimated that between 1685 and 1716, French officers fought 10,000 duels, leading to over 400 deaths.<ref>Lynn, p. 257.</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]], as late as 1777, a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]]. A copy of the code, known as 'The twenty-six commandments', was to be kept in a gentleman's pistol case for reference should a dispute arise regarding procedure.<ref name=\"Hamilton 1829\">{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Joseph |title=The only approved guide through all the stages of a quarrel |publisher=Millikin |location=Dublin |year=1829 |edition=(Internet Archive) |url=https://archive.org/details/onlyapprovedguid00hami |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment-era opposition===\nBy the late 18th century, [[Enlightenment era]] values began to influence society with new self-conscious ideas about [[politeness]], [[civil society|civil behaviour]] and new attitudes towards [[violence]]. The cultivated art of politeness demanded that there should be no outward displays of anger or violence, and the concept of honor became more personalized.\n\nBy the 1770s the practice of dueling was increasingly coming under attack from many sections of enlightened society, as a violent relic of Europe's medieval past unsuited for modern life. As England began to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialize]] and benefit from urban planning and more effective [[Metropolitan police|police forces]], the culture of street violence in general began to slowly wane. The growing [[middle class]] maintained their reputation with recourse to either bringing charges of [[libel]], or to the fast-growing print media of the early 19th century, where they could defend their honor and resolve conflicts through correspondence in newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|title=The Death of Dueling|accessdate=2014-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107223937/http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nInfluential new intellectual trends at the turn of the 19th century bolstered the anti-dueling campaign; the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]] stressed that praiseworthy actions were exclusively restricted to those that maximize human welfare and happiness, and the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] notion of the \"Christian conscience\" began to actively promote social activism. Individuals in the [[Clapham Sect]] and similar societies, who had successfully campaigned for the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], condemned dueling as ungodly violence and as an egocentric culture of honor.<ref>David W.

Many of those killed or wounded were [[midshipmen]] or junior officers.

Victoria, BC was known to have been the centre of at least two duels near the time of the gold rush.  One involved a British arrival by the name of George Sloane, and an American, John Liverpool, both arriving via San Francisco in 1858.  Duel by pistols, Sloane was fatally injured and Liverpool shortly returned to the US.  The fight originally started on board the ship over a young woman, Miss Bradford, and then carried on later in Victoria's tent city.<ref>The Old Cemeteries Society (Pioneer Square) pgs 7-9.</ref> Another duel, involving a Mr. Muir, took place around 1861, but was moved to a US island near Victoria.\n\nThe last fatal duel in [[England]] took place on Priest Hill, between [[Englefield Green]] and [[Old Windsor]], on 19 October 1852, between two French political exiles, Frederic Cournet and [[Emmanuel Barth\u00e9lemy]], the former being killed.<ref name=\"KEG\"/>\n\nBy the outbreak of [[World War I]], dueling had not only been made illegal almost everywhere in the [[Western world]], but was also widely seen as an anachronism. Military establishments in most countries frowned on dueling because officers were the main contestants. Officers were often trained at military academies at government's expense; when officers killed or disabled one another it imposed an unnecessary financial and leadership strain on a military organization, making dueling unpopular with high-ranking officers.<ref>Holland, Barbara.

[[French Fourth Republic|After World War II]], duels had become rare even in France, and those that still occurred were covered in the press as eccentricities. Duels in France in this period, while still taken seriously as a matter of honor, were not fought to the death. They consisted of fencing with the \u00e9p\u00e9e mostly in a fixed distance with the aim of drawing blood from the opponent's arm.\nIn 1949, former Vichy-official [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]] fought school teacher Roger Nordmann.<ref>\"A French lawyer and a schoolteacher fought a duel today in a meadow near Paris.  Roger Nordmann the schoolteacher was reportedly pricked by the lawyer Jean-Louis Tixier- Vignancour's sword and the duel ended with everyone's honor intact. The feud started three weeks go when. Tixier-Vignancbur challenged Nordmann to a duel with pistols after he said Nordmann insulted him during a treason trial; Nordmann accepted the challenge but said he had never fired anything more potent than . a water pistol. He then chose two of his prettiest girl students, as seconds. The 'lawyer objected on the grounds that a second must be ready to take his principal's place and he could not lift his hand against a woman.

This isn't the \"jousting\" article.-->\nThe custom of \"flinging the gauntlet in the face of another Knight\" is illustrated in early Italian romances such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]''\n(The Scots Magazine 89/90 (1822), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fFw3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA575 p. 575]), and the English phrase of  \"throwing down the gauntlet\" occurs in the context of [[Renaissance-era jousting|Tudor-era tournaments]] from the 1540s.\n<!--\nA reference to the supposedly medieval practice is found in the pseudo-medieval poetry of [[Thomas Chatterton]] (''The Tournament: An Interlude'', purportedly written in the 15th century by \"Thomas Rowley\"), ''there's mie gauntlette onn mie gaberdyne.''-->\n</ref>\n\nUsually challenges were delivered in writing by one or more close friends who acted as \"seconds\". The challenge, written in formal language, laid out the real or imagined grievances and a demand for satisfaction. The challenged party then had the choice of accepting or refusing the challenge. Grounds for refusing the challenge could include that it was frivolous, or that the challenger was not generally recognized as a \"gentleman\" since dueling was limited to persons of equal social station. However care had to be taken before declining a challenge, as it could result in accusations of cowardice or be perceived as an insult to the challenger's seconds if it was implied that they were acting on behalf of someone of low social standing. Participation in a duel could be honorably refused on account of a major difference in age between the parties and, to a lesser extent, in cases of social inferiority on the part of the challenger. Such inferiority had to be immediately obvious, however. As author [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] states, \"with social distinctions often difficult to measure,\" most men could not escape on such grounds without the appearance of cowardice.<ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram. Southern Honor: Ethics & Behavior in the Old South. Oxford University Press, 2007, p.355-356</ref>\n\nOnce a challenge was accepted, if not done already, both parties (known as \"principals\") would appoint trusted representatives to act as their seconds with no further direct communication between the principals being allowed until the dispute was settled. The seconds had a number of responsibilities, of which the first was to do all in their power to avert bloodshed provided their principal's honor was not compromised. This could involve back and forth correspondence about a mutually agreeable lesser course of action, such as a formal apology for the alleged offense.\n\nIn the event that the seconds failed to persuade their principals to avoid a fight they then attempted to agree on terms for the duel that would limit the chance of a fatal outcome, consistent with the generally accepted guidelines for affairs of honor. The exact rules or etiquette for dueling varied by time and locale but were usually referred to as the [[code duello]]. In most cases the challenged party had the choice of weapons, with swords being favored in many parts of continental Europe and pistols in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nIt was the job of the seconds to make all of the arrangements in advance, including how long the duel would last and what conditions would end the duel. Often sword duels were only fought until blood was drawn, thus severely limiting the likelihood of death or grave injury since a scratch could be considered as satisfying honor. In pistol duels, the number of shots to be permitted and the range were set out. Care was taken by the seconds to ensure the ground chosen gave no unfair advantage to either party. A doctor or surgeon was usually arranged to be on hand. Other things often arranged by the seconds could go into minute details that might seem odd in the modern world, such as the dress code (duels were often formal affairs), the number and names of any other witnesses to be present and whether or not refreshments would be served.<ref>Lynn, p. 255, 257.</ref>\n\n===Field of honor===\n{{Redirect|Field of honor||Field of Honor (disambiguation){{!}}Field of Honor}}\nThe chief criteria for choosing the field of honor were isolation, to avoid discovery and interruption by the authorities; and jurisdictional ambiguity, to avoid legal consequences. Islands in rivers dividing two jurisdictions were popular dueling sites; the cliffs below Weehawken on the Hudson River where the [[Hamilton-Burr duel]] occurred were a popular field of honor for New York duellists because of the uncertainty whether New York or New Jersey jurisdiction applied. Duels traditionally took place at dawn, when the poor light would make the participants less likely to be seen, and to force an interval for reconsideration or sobering-up.\n\nFor some time before the mid-18th century, swordsmen dueling at dawn often carried lanterns to see each other. This happened so regularly that fencing manuals integrated lanterns into their lessons. An example of this is using the lantern to parry blows and blind the opponent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/Angelo.php |title=How to Defend a Monopoly |publisher=Classicalfencing.com |date=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The manuals sometimes show the combatants carrying the lantern in the left hand wrapped behind the back, which is still one of the traditional positions for the off hand in modern fencing.<ref>[http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525024932/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png|date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions===\nAt the choice of the offended party, the duel could be fought to a number of conclusions:\n* To first blood, in which case the duel would be ended as soon as one man was wounded, even if the wound was minor.\n* Until one man was so severely wounded as to be physically unable to continue the duel.\n* To the death (or \"\u00e0 l'outrance\"), in which case there would be no satisfaction until one party was mortally wounded.\n* In the case of pistol duels, each party would fire one shot. If neither man was hit and if the challenger stated that he was satisfied, the duel would be declared over. If the challenger was not satisfied, a pistol duel could continue until one man was wounded or killed, but to have more than three exchanges of fire was considered barbaric and, on the rare occasion that no hits were achieved, somewhat ridiculous. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUnder the latter conditions, one or both parties could intentionally miss in order to fulfill the conditions of the duel, without loss of either life or honor. However, doing so, known as [[delope|deloping]], could imply that one's opponent was not worth shooting. This practice occurred despite being expressly banned by the [[Code duello|Code Duello]] of 1777. Rule XII stated: \"No dumb shooting or firing in the air is admissible in any case... children's play must be dishonourable on one side or the other, and is accordingly prohibited.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904223840/http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n\nPractices varied, however, but unless the challenger was of a higher social standing, such as a baron or prince challenging a knight, the person being challenged was allowed to decide the time and weapons used in the duel. The offended party could stop the duel at any time if he deemed his honor satisfied. In some duels, the seconds would take the place of the primary dueller if the primary was not able to finish the duel. This was usually done in duels with swords, where one's expertise was sometimes limited. The second would also act as a witness.\n\n===Pistol duel===\n[[File:Yevgeny Onegin by Repin.jpg|thumb|right|The fictional pistol duel between [[Eugene Onegin]] and Vladimir Lensky. Watercolour by [[Ilya Repin]] (1899)]]\nFor a pistol duel, the two would typically start at a pre-agreed length of ground, which would be measured out by the seconds and marked, often with swords stuck in the ground (referred to as \"points\"). At a given signal, often the dropping of a handkerchief, the principals could advance and fire at will. This latter system reduced the possibility of cheating, as neither principal had to trust the other not to turn too soon. Another system involved alternate shots being taken, beginning with the challenged firing first.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMany historical duels were prevented by the difficulty of arranging the ''\"methodus pugnandi\"''.

These stressed the need to protect one's reputation and social mask and prescribed the circumstances under which an insulted party should issue a challenge.\nThe word ''duel'' was introduced in the 1590s, modelled after [[Medieval Latin]] ''duellum'' (an archaic Latin form of ''bellum'' \"war\", but associated by popular etymology with ''duo'' \"two\", hence  \"one-on-one combat\").<ref>This usage apparently goes back to [[John of Legnano]], author of a 14th-century work on dueling, ''De Bello'', cited by [[du Cange]]\n''Pugna corporalis deliberata hinc inde duorum, ad purgationem, gloriam, vel odii aggregationem.''\n[http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/DUELLUM3 3.

He also issued an edict against dueling in 1614 and is believed to have supported production of an anti-dueling tract by the [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]]. Dueling however, continued to spread out from the court, notably into the army. In the mid-17th century it was for a time checked by the activities of the Parliamentarians whose Articles of War specified the death penalty for would-be duellists. Nevertheless, dueling survived and increased markedly with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Among the difficulties of anti-dueling campaigners was that although monarchs uniformly proclaimed their general hostility to dueling, they were nevertheless very reluctant to see their own favourites punished. In 1712 both the [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] and [[Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun|Charles 4th Baron Mohun]] were killed in a [[Hamilton\u2013Mohun Duel|celebrated duel]] induced by political rivalry and squabbles over an inheritance.\n\nBy the 1780s, the values of the duel had spread into the broader and emerging society of gentlemen. Research shows that much the largest group of later duellists were military officers, followed by the young sons of the metropolitan elite (see Banks, ''A Polite Exchange of Bullets''). Dueling was also popular for a time among doctors and, in particular, in the legal professions. Quantifying the number of duels in Britain is difficult, but there are about 1,000 attested between 1785 and 1845 with fatality rates at least 15% and probably somewhat higher. The last duel in England was fought in 1852 between two French political exiles.<ref name=KEG/>\n\nIn 1777, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]], a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels.

Dueling quickly became so popular \u2013 and the number of casualties among the commanding ranks so high \u2013 that, in 1715, Emperor [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the First]] was forced to forbid the practice on pain of having both duellists hanged. Despite this official ban, dueling became a significant military tradition in the Russian Empire with a detailed unwritten [[w:ru:\u0414\u0443\u044d\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441|dueling code]]&nbsp;\u2013 which was eventually written down by V. Durasov and released in print in 1908.<ref>V. Durasov \"The Dueling Code\" {{ISBN|5-7905-1634-3}}</ref> This code forbade duels between people of different [[Table of Ranks|ranks]]. For instance, an infantry captain could not challenge a major but could easily pick on a Titular Counsellor. On the other hand, a higher ranked person could not stoop to challenge lower ranks; so, it was up to his subordinates or servants to take revenge on their master's behalf.\n\nDueling was also common among prominent Russian writers, poets, and politicians. Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] fought 29 duels, challenging many prominent figures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-push.net/ |title=Pushkin duels.

In [[Argentina]], during the 18th and 19th century, it was common for ''[[gaucho]]s''\u2014cowboys\u2014to resolve their disputes in a fight using working knives called ''[[Fac\u00f3n|facones]]''. After the turn of the 19th century, when repeating handguns became more widely available, use of the fac\u00f3n as a close-combat weapon declined. Among the gauchos, many continued to wear the knife, though mostly as a tool. However, it was occasionally still used to settle arguments \"of honor\". In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping when one could no longer see clearly through the blood.\n\nIn Peru there were several high-profile duels by politicians in the early part of the 20th century including one in 1957 involving [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]], who went on to become President.

Second, because of this congruence between upper and lower concepts of [[honor]], dueling was not at all undemocratic. It enabled lesser men to enter, however imperfectly, the ranks of leaders, and allowed followers to manipulate leaders to their taste.

Many [[kshatriya]] considered it shameful to die in bed, and in their old age often arranged for a ''yuddha-dhan'', literally meaning \"combat charity\". According to this practice when a warrior felt he did not have much time to live, he would go along with a few attendants and ask another king for a duel or a small scale battle. In this way he chooses his own time and manner of death and is assured that he will die fighting. Duels to the death were legal in some periods, and punishable by execution in others.<ref name=Auboyer>{{cite book |title=Daily Life in Ancient India |author=Jeanine Auboyer |year=1965 |pp=58 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=France}}</ref>\n\nAncient epics and texts like the ''[[Dharmashastra]]'' tell that duels took place under strict rules of conduct, and to violate them was both shameful and sinful. According to these rules, it was forbidden to injure or kill an opponent who has lost their weapon, who surrenders, or who has been knocked unconscious. The ''[[Manusm\u1e5bti]]'' tells that if a warrior's topknot comes loose during a duel, the opponent must give him time to bind his hair before continuing. Both duellists are required to wield the same weapon, and specific rules may have existed for each weapon. For example, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' records that hitting below the waist is forbidden in mace duels.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University|author=Kaushik Roy}}</ref> In one ancient form of dueling, two warriors wielded a knife in the right hand while their left hands were tied together.<ref name=Auboyer/>\n\nThe Portuguese traveller [[Duarte Barbosa]] tells that dueling was a common practice among the nobles of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], and it was the only legal manner in which \"murder\" could be committed. After fixing a day for the duel and getting permission from the king or minister, the duellists would arrive at the appointed field \"with great pleasure\". Duellists would wear no armour and were bare from the waist up. From the waist down they wore cotton cloth tightly round with many folds. The weapons used for dueling were swords, shields and daggers which the king would appoint them of equal length. Judges decided what rewards would be given to duellists; the winner may even acquire the loser's estate.<ref>{{cite book |title= Travels of Duerte Barbosa |author=M.L. Dames |year=1918 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nDuels in [[Manipur]] were first recorded in the ''Chainarol-Puya'' which details the ethics of dueling. When a fighter was challenged, the day for the bout would be fixed to allow for time to prepare the weapons. Allowing the opponent the first chance to fire an arrow or hurl a spear was considered particularly courageous. The duel itself was not necessarily to the death, and usually ended once first blood has been drawn. However, the victor was still expected to behead the loser. Either before the duel or before the beheading, the fighters would share the meals and wine prepared by their wives. If it had been so requested beforehand, the loser's body may be cremated. Heads were taken as trophies, as was custom among the headhunters of northeast India. Various taboos existed such as not killing an opponent who runs, begs or cries out of fear, or anyone who pleads for protection.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn [[Kerala]], duels known as [[ankam]] were fought by the [[kalari]]-trained [[Chekavar]] caste on behalf of their local rulers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=Chekavan+|title= Communal Road to a Secular Kerala.Page 30|work=George Mathew|publisher=Concept Pub.Co, 1989|isbn=978-81-7022-282-8|accessdate=2007-12-28|year= 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xNAI9F8IBOgC&pg=PA27&dq=Chekavar+Sevakan|title= Religion and Social Conflict in South Asia.Page 27|work=Bardwell L.

The challenger stands with a loosened sarong around him and respectfully invites the other man to step into the sarong. The sarong itself is kept taut around both their waists. When both men are inside, an agreement to fight til death and thereafter shall be no hereditary grudge nor will any party be allowed to question the duel, shall be made. If both fighters agree, they then engage each other within the confined space of a single sarong.<ref name=\"Sitobo Lalang Lipa\">{{cite web |url=http://mirror.unpad.ac.id/koran/mediaindonesia/2010-09-18/mediaindonesia_2010-09-18_021.pdf |title=Tomanurung Perang Sejati Orang Bugis |publisher=Media Indonesia |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Unlike the more typical [[kris]] duel of Javanese and Malay culture, the Bugis-Makassar community instead wield [[badik]], the local single-edge knife. Because avoiding injury is near-impossible even for the victor, this type of duel was considered a sign of extraordinary bravery, masculinity and the warrior mentality. Although true ''sitobo lalang lipa'' are no longer practiced, enactments of these duels are still performed at cultural shows today.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Miyamoto-Musashi-Fights-Sasaki-Kojiro-at-Ganryujima-Ukiyo-e.png|thumb|Depiction of the duel of [[Miyamoto Musashi]] vs. [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]]]]\nIn [[Edo period]] Japan, there was a tradition of dueling ({{nihongo2|\u6c7a\u95d8|help=yes}}, kett\u014d) among the [[samurai]] class.\nOn April 14, 1612 the famous Japanese swordsman [[Miyamoto Musashi]] dueled his rival [[Sasaki Kojiro]] on the island of Funajima. Musashi is said to have fought over 60 duels and was never defeated.\n\n===Philippines===\nDueling was a common practice in the Philippines since ancient times, and continued to be recorded during Spanish and American colonialism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marcialtirada.net/filipino_weapons |title=Philippine Martial Arts Institute - Traditional Filipino Weapons |publisher=Marcialtirada.net |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> In the [[Visayas]], there is a tradition of dueling where the offended party would first ''hagit'' or challenge the offender. The offender would have the choice whether to accept or decline the challenge. In the past, choice of weapons was not limited. But most often, [[Bolo knife|bolos]], rattan canes, and knives were the preferred weapons. Duels were either first-blood, submission, or to the last man standing. Duels to death were known as ''huego-todo'' (without bounds).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The older generation of [[Filipino martial art]]ists still tell of duels which occurred during their youth.\n\nDuels with the [[bolo knife]] were prominent in North and Central Philippines, common in farmlands where the machete-like bolo is commonly used as a domestic tool. A duel reported internationally occurred on 14 April 1920 by Prescott Journal Miner which was known as \"The First Bolo Duel in Manila since the American Occupation\". It happened when \u00c1ngel Umali and Tranquilino Paglinawan met with friends in a vacant lot near the city centre before dusk to settle a feud; Paglinawan lost his left hand. With no law against bolo fights, Umali was charged for a petty crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=906&dat=19200416&id=HllIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7k4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3515,3703863|title=Bolos Weapons in Filipino Duel: One Hand Cut Off|accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>\n\nBolo fights are still seen today, albeit rarely, and have become part of Filipino rural culture. On 7 January 2012, two middle-aged farmers were wounded after a bolo duel over the harvest of rice in a village in [[Zamboanga City]]. Geronimo \u00c1lvarez and Jes\u00fas Guerrero were drinking and at the height of their arguing \u00c1lvarez allegedly pulled out his bolo and hacked Guerrero. Guerrero also pulled his bolo and repeatedly hacked \u00c1lvarez, and their relatives immediately intervened and rushed them to hospital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/zamboanga/local-news/2012/01/07/argument-over-rice-harvest-leads-bolo-duel-199362 |title=Argument over rice harvest leads to bolo duel in Zamboanga City |newspaper=Sun.Star |date=2012-01-07 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Duels in popular culture==\n{{Further|Combat in film}}\nDueling has provided themes for numerous works of popular culture.\n\n===Examples in films===\n* ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1926), with [[duelling pistol|dueling pistols]]\n* ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (1934 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1934), [[Sword|swords]]\n* ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935), swords\n* ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1937), swords\n* ''[[Jezebel (1938 film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938), with duelling pistol\n* ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938), swords\n* ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940), swords\n* ''[[The Son of Monte Cristo]]'' (1940), swords\n* ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), which shows two main characters becoming friends after fighting a duel, the preparations for which are shown in great detail\n* In ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952), the climactic duel is reputed to be the longest in cinema at over six minutes.\n* ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), with dueling pistols\n* ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (1964-1966) with pistols using [[Fast draw|quick draw]].
