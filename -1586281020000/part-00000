According to this account, they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of these Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=51}} Param\u0101rtha states that the [[Kukku\u1e6dika]] sect did not accept the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras as ''[[buddhavacana]]'' (\"words of the Buddha\"), while the [[Lokottarav\u0101da]] sect and the [[Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika]] sect did accept the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras as ''buddhavacana''.<ref>Sree Padma.

Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2008.</ref> The Therav\u0101din ''[[Dipavamsa|D\u012bpava\u1e43sa]]'', for example, records that the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas had no abhidharma.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=213}} However, other sources indicate that there were such collections of abhidharma, and the Chinese pilgrims [[Faxian]] and [[Xuanzang]] both mention Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika abhidharma. On the basis of textual evidence as well as inscriptions at [[Nagarjunakonda|N\u0101g\u0101rjunako\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101]], Joseph Walser concludes that at least some Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika sects probably had an abhidharma collection, and that it likely contained five or six books.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=212-213}}\n\n===Caitika===\nThe [[Caitika]]s included a number of sub-sects including the P\u016brva\u015bailas, Apara\u015bailas, Siddh\u0101rthikas, and R\u0101jagirikas. In the 6th century CE, Avalokitavrata writes that Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras such as the ''Praj\u00f1\u0101paramit\u0101'' and others are chanted by the Apara\u015bailas and the P\u016brva\u015bailas.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=53}} Also in the 6th century CE, [[Bhavaviveka|Bh\u0101vaviveka]] speaks of the Siddh\u0101rthikas using a Vidy\u0101dh\u0101ra Pi\u1e6daka, and the P\u016brva\u015bailas and Apara\u015bailas both using a [[Bodhisattva]] Pi\u1e6daka, implying collections of [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] texts within these Caitika schools.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=53}}\n\n===Bahu\u015brut\u012bya===\nThe [[Bahusrutiya|Bahu\u015brut\u012bya]] school is said to have included a Bodhisattva Pi\u1e6daka in their canon. The ''{{IAST|Satyasiddhi \u015a\u0101stra}}'', also called the ''{{IAST|Tattvasiddhi \u015a\u0101stra}}'', is an extant abhidharma from the Bahu\u015brut\u012bya school. This abhidharma was translated into Chinese in sixteen fascicles (Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka 1646).<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0966.html|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (K 966)}}</ref> Its authorship is attributed to Harivarman, a third-century monk from central India. Param\u0101rtha cites this Bahu\u015brut\u012bya abhidharma as containing a combination of [[Hinayana|H\u012bnay\u0101na]] and Mah\u0101y\u0101na doctrines, and Joseph Walser agrees that this assessment is correct.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=52}}\n\n===Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da===\nThe [[Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da|Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101dins]] held that the Buddha's teachings in the various pi\u1e6dakas were nominal (Skt.

''hetuphala'').{{sfn|Dutt|1998|p=118}} Therefore, all teachings were viewed by the Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101dins as being of provisional importance, since they cannot contain the ultimate truth.{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=98}} It has been observed that this view of the Buddha's teachings is very close to the fully developed position of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras.{{sfn|Dutt|1998|p=118}} {{sfn|Harris|1991|p=98}}\n\n===S\u0101rv\u0101stiv\u0101da===\nScholars at present have \"a nearly complete collection of s\u016btras from the [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] school\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sujato|first=Bhikkhu|authorlink=Bhante Sujato|url=http://santipada.googlepages.com/whatthebuddhareallytaught|title=The Pali Nik\u0101yas and Chinese \u0100gamas|website=What the Buddha Really Taught|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref> thanks to a recent discovery in Afghanistan of roughly two-thirds of D\u012brgha \u0100gama in Sanskrit.

It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Charlotte Flair]], who is in her record-tying second reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 9, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Paige as NXT Women's Champion WrestleMania Axxess 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural NXT Women's Champion [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], shown here with the original championship belt design]]\nIn June 2012, the [[WWE]] established [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] as their [[Farm team|developmental territory]], replacing [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]]. On the May 30 tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] June 5), WWE's [[Chief Brand Officer]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that there would be an eight-woman [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[Professional wrestling tournament|tournament]], featuring four women from NXT and four from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Women's Champion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=WWE NEWS: McMahon's Friday tweet - anti-smoking, Stephanie introduces NXT Women's Title (w/Pic), Cena check-in, Ross new blog, Dupree wins title|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_70982.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Namako|first=Jason|title=WWE NXT Results - 5/30/13 (#1 Contender Battle Royal)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/41777-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-13-1-contender-battle-royal|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Justin|title=James's WWE NXT results 5/29 & 6/5: Wyatts defend Tag Titles, NXT Women's Title introduced, #1 contender battle royal, Parade of released NXT wrestlers in matches|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_71102.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> During the June 20 tapings of ''NXT'' (aired July 24), [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] defeated [[Emma (wrestler)|Emma]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion.<ref name=FirstChamp/>\n\nPaige successfully defended her title at [[NXT Arrival|Arrival]] against Emma, however, then-NXT [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Manager (GM) 4|General Manager]] [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] stripped Paige of the title on the April 24, 2014 episode of ''NXT'', as Paige had recently won the [[WWE Divas Championship]], and was in turn promoted to WWE's main roster. A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. On the September 16, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', now NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] would defend her title against [[Sasha Banks]] in the [[main event]] at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect|TakeOver: Respect]] on October 7 in the first ever 30-minute [[Iron Man match|Iron Woman match]] in WWE history.<ref name=\"NXTSeptember16\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_87531.shtml|title=James's WWE NXT report 9/16 - Week 180: Bayley returns to Full Sail as Women's champ, big set-up for \"Takeover,\" Dusty Tag Classic continues, Adam Rose dumps on NXT, more; Overall Reax|author=James, Justin|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> At the event, Bayley defeated Banks to retain the championship, scoring the win with 3 falls to 2.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melok|first1=Bobby|title=NXT Women's Champion Bayley vs. Sasha Banks (30-Minute WWE Iron Man Match)|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-2015-10-07/bayley-sasha-banks-nxt-womens-title-iron-man-match-27942052|publisher=WWE|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=97087&p=3|title=WWE NXT TakeOver Respect report: Sasha Banks and Bayley go 30 minutes, the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners crowned, Asuka makes her NXT in ring debut (poor Dana), and more|author=Trionfo, Richard|website=PWInsider|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand. This would become official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the [[USA Network]]. This also made the NXT Women's Championship one of the top three singles titles for women in WWE, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]]\u2014which had replaced the Divas title in 2016\u2013and [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/triple-h-discusses-nxt-as-a-third-brand-putting-talent-in-a-position-to-succeed-more/|title=Triple H Discusses NXT as a Third Brand, Putting Talent in a Position to Succeed, More \u2013 411MANIA|website=www.411mania.com}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, WWE briefly began referring to the women's championship as the \"NXT Championship\" to bring it on an equal level as the men's title,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/worldscollide/wwe-worlds-collide-2020/article/rhea-ripley-toni-storm-results|title=Could Toni Storm dethrone Rhea Ripley at Worlds Collide?|work=WWE|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref> though reverted back to calling it the NXT Women's Championship soon after; it remained as NXT Women's Championship on the official title history during this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/nxt-womens-championship|title=NXT Women's Championship|work=WWE|accessdate=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Inaugural championship tournament (2013) ===\n<!-- This section is transcluded to [[WWE tournaments]].

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

Yet by 2002, [[number pooling]] was being enforced in the 209 and 559 area codes.  Instead of handing out numbers in blocks of 10,000 to private companies (as had been normal practice since the beginning of the [[NANP]] in 1947), only 1,000 numbers would be handed out at a time.  For example, instead of granting [[AT&T California|Pacific Bell]] all numbers (559) 330-xxxx, only numbers (559) 330-0xxx, or (559) 330-1xxx or (559) 330-2xxx, and so on, would be granted.\n\n==See

other regions that had experienced area code changes during the area code boom of the 1990s, both 559 and 209 were in the early planning stages of relief, potentially creating the need for introduction of further new area codes.  Yet by 2002, [[number pooling]] was being enforced in the 209 and 559 area codes.  Instead of handing out numbers in blocks of 10,000 to private companies (as had been normal practice since the beginning of the [[NANP]] in 1947), only 1,000 numbers would be handed out at a time.  For example, instead of granting [[AT&T California|Pacific Bell]] all numbers (559) 330-xxxx, only numbers (559) 330-0xxx, or (559) 330-1xxx or (559) 330-2xxx, and so on, would be granted.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of California area codes]]\n*[[List of NANP area codes]]\n*[[North American Numbering Plan]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{No footnotes|date=October 2009}}\n* ''[http://www.lincmad.com LincMad]'' \n* ''[http://www.areacode-info.com AreaCode-Info]''\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nanpa.com/ North American Numbering Plan Administration]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050721013005/http://www.whitepages.com/10001/maps/CA Area code map of California] from whitepages.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091008013807/http://www.areacodedownload.com/559/index.html 559 Area Code] from AreaCodeDownload.com\n\n{{Area code box | State = CA | This = area code 559\n  | N = [[area code 209|209]]\n  | S = [[area code 661|661]]\n  | E = [[area codes 442 and 760|442/760]]\n  | W = [[area codes 805 and 820|805/820]], [[area code 831|831]]\n}}\n\n{{Coord|37|-120|region:US-CA|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Area codes in California|559]]\n[[Category:Fresno County, California]]\n[[Category:Madera County, California]]\n[[Category:Kings County, California]]\n[[Category:Tulare County, California]]\n[[Category:San Joaquin Valley]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 1998]]\n[[Category:Area codes in the United States|559]]\n", "name_user": "2600:387:b:9a2::46", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCities in the 559 area code)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_559"}
