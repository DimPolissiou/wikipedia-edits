The real beginning of his career happened with the [[Prague]] band TAM. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek did not stay with them for long, however. In the first months of 1985, TAM was offered an opening slot for the annual concert of the band Orient, which they accepted without hesitation. Coincidentally, this concert was attended by members of the heavy metal band [[Vitacit]], whose lead singer Dan Horyna departed in February of the same year. Vitacit liked K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's vocals so much that they immediately offered him the vacant spot, which he accepted.\n\n===Vitacit===\nVitacit had been together since 1973, but had never recorded any material. In 1985, after K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek joined, they met guitarist and singer [[Milo\u0161 \"Dodo\" Dole\u017eal]], who became the band's new frontman. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Dole\u017eal went on to write a number of hit songs together.\nVitacit had much success and filled concert halls throughout 1985 and 1986. By 1987, they began to attract attention from record labels, and received several offers. In January of that year, however, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek announced his departure from the band. His last concerts with Vitacit were held in a grim atmosphere, and on 15 March 1987, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Vitacit performed together for the last time.\n\n===Citron===\nIn February 1987, the [[Ostrava]]-based metal band [[Citron (band)|Citron]] was hit by an unexpected event. Their singer Stanislav Hranick\u00fd broke his leg and was unable to perform for an extended period of time. For this reason, the band hired Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek as his replacement. They immediately began to work on their third album, titled ''Radegast''. Upon release, the album went gold, and was the first big success for K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek. The following year, Citron won the [[Zlat\u00fd slav\u00edk]] award. Citron went on to tour extensively, not only in Czechoslovakia, but also in Poland, the USSR, and Germany. They appeared frequently on television, topped music charts, and garnered much success during this period. In early 1989, the band began to prepare their next studio album, ''Vypus\u0165te psy!'' (Release the Dogs!), but disagreements began to show among them. They managed to record a demo and release two singles, before K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek departed the band in August 1989. Guitarist Jaroslav Barto\u0148 followed, and together they formed the group [[Kreyson]].\n\n===Kreyson and solo work===\n{{further|Kreyson}}\n[[File:Kreyson.jpg|thumb|Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Kreyson, 1990]]\nIn 1989, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek collaborated with [[Karel Svoboda (composer)|Karel Svoboda]] on the title song for the well-known television series ''Dlouh\u00e1 m\u00edle''. In the same year, he founded his own band, Kreyson, together with Jaroslav Barto\u0148 from Citron. In 1990, Kreyson released their first album, titled ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'' (Angel on the Run). The album was recorded in both Czech and English versions with the help of producer Jan N\u011bmec. The single \"Vzd\u00e1len\u00e1\" (Far Away) proved to be a huge success, topping all domestic charts, and the band went on tour for the rest of the year. In 1990, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released his first solo record, titled ''Zlatej chlapec'' (Golden Boy), which was also a big success and sold 100,000 copies within 14 days. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek won his second gold record. In the following years, Kreyson released the albums ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (Crusaders), ''Elix\u00edr \u017divota'' (Elixir of Life), and ''Z\u00e1kon D\u017eungle'' (Law of the Jungle). Just like ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'', ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' came out both in Czech and in English. In 1993, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released another solo album, titled ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (The Key to My Soul), which received Diamond certification the following year for 400,000 copies sold. 1994 also saw the release of ''Best of L\u00e1\u010fa K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek'', the artist's first compilation album. Towards the end of that year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek sang a duet with internationally renowned Czech opera diva [[Eva Urbanov\u00e1]] in a rock adaptation of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. In 1995, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek was voted among the top three most popular singers in the nation. The same year, he sang the intro song to the cartoon ''O Malence'' together with Slovak singer [[Dara Rolins]].\nIn 1996, the holiday album ''Kam hv\u011bzdy chod\u00ed sp\u00e1t'' (Where the Stars Go to Sleep) was released in collaboration with the [[Bambini di Praga]] youth choir. The album also included a duet with crooner [[Karel Gott]] on the song \"Panis Angelicus\".\n\n===Damiens and other projects===\nIn 1997, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek recorded an album titled ''V\u0161em L\u00e1sk\u00e1m'' with violin virtuoso [[Jaroslav Sv\u011bcen\u00fd]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ladislav Krizek & Jaroslav Sveceny |url=https://www.velkykosik.cz/hudba/vsem-laskam/ |website=velkykosik.cz |date= |accessdate=18 April 2020 |language=cs}}</ref>\nAt the end of the year, he launched the group Damiens with his brother Miroslav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek. In the fall of 1998, the duo released the single \"L\u00e1sko m\u011bj se\" (Take Care, Love). In the same year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek sang a duet with [[Kate\u0159ina Bro\u017eov\u00e1]] on [[Michal David]]'s musical ''Kr\u00e1ska a zv\u00ed\u0159e'' (Beauty and the Beast). In March 1999, Damiens released their debut album, entitled ''K\u0159\u00eddla'' (Wings), which quickly won a gold record. In October of that year, they released ''K\u0159\u00eddla - Zlat\u00fd bonus'' (Wings - Golden Bonus), which included bonus tracks to the original release. In the 1999 edition of [[\u010cesk\u00fd slav\u00edk]], the duo won the \"Newcomer of the Year\" award. On the occasion of Karel Gott's 60th birthday, Damiens performed his song \"Adres\u00e1t nezn\u00e1m\u00fd\" (Addressee Unknown) at a large concert hall in Prague. Ladislav also sang Gott's famous hit \"Paganini\".\nAt the end of 2000, Damiens were invited by Karel Gott to host his concert tour ''\u010cesk\u00e9 v\u00e1noce 2000'' (Czech Christmas 2000). In the same year, the duo released their second album, ''Sv\u011bt z\u00e1zrak\u016f'' (World of Miracles), which again went gold for the sale of 25,000 copies.\n\nIn the spring of 2001, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek recorded the album ''S\u00edla n\u00e1vrat\u016f'' (The Power of Returns) with Citron, a selection of hits he had sung with them in the past. In the same year, Damiens was again invited to play Karel Gott's Christmas tour. The following year, Damiens released another record, titled ''Nechci z\u016fstat s\u00e1m'' (I Don't Want to Be Alone), which went gold.\n\n===Zem\u011b poh\u00e1dek===\nK\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's voice gained prominence in 2005, when he composed and sang the song \"Zem\u011b poh\u00e1dek\" (Land of Fairy Tales), as the theme of the advertising campaign for a children's online film store of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreyson |url=https://bandzone.cz/kreyson?at=info |website=bandzone.cz |date= |accessdate=17 April 2020 |language=cs}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Kreyson and Citron===\nDuring 2006, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek, together with guitarist Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc, performed all over the Czech Republic, playing acoustic arrangements of Vitacit, Citron, and Kreyson hits. In the middle of the year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek resuscitated Kreyson, which had been on hiatus since 1996, and announced a contest to find new band members. A total of 90 experienced musicians took part, of which 37 were shortlisted. The final decision was made on 25 January 2007, and the band began to play again after 11 years of silence.<ref>{{cite web|title=K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek: Sl\u00e1va je droga.

In the same year, he founded his own band, Kreyson, together with Jaroslav Barto\u0148 from Citron. In 1990, Kreyson released their first album, titled ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'' (Angel on the Run). The album was recorded in both Czech and English versions with the help of producer Jan N\u011bmec. The single \"Vzd\u00e1len\u00e1\" (Far Away) proved to be a huge success, topping all domestic charts, and the band went on tour for the rest of the year. In 1990, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released his first solo record, titled ''Zlatej chlapec'' (Golden Boy), which was also a big success and sold 100,000 copies within 14 days. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek won his second gold record. In the following years, Kreyson released the albums ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (Crusaders), ''Elix\u00edr \u017divota'' (Elixir of Life), and ''Z\u00e1kon D\u017eungle'' (Law of the Jungle). Just like ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'', ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' came out both in Czech and in English. In 1993, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released another solo album, titled ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (The Key to My Soul), which received Diamond certification the following year for 400,000 copies sold. 1994 also saw the release of ''Best of L\u00e1\u010fa K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek'', the artist's first compilation album. Towards the end of that year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek sang a duet with internationally-renowned Czech opera diva [[Eva Urbanov\u00e1]] in a rock adaptation of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. In 1995, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek was voted among the top three most popular singers in the nation. The same year, he sang the intro song to the cartoon ''O Malence'' together with Slovak singer [[Dara Rolins]].\nIn 1996, the holiday album ''Kam hv\u011bzdy chod\u00ed sp\u00e1t'' (Where the Stars Go to Sleep) was released in collaboration with the [[Bambini di Praga]] youth choir. The album also included a duet with crooner [[Karel Gott]] on the song \"Panis Angelicus\".\n\n===Damiens and other projects===\nIn 1997, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek recorded an album titled ''V\u0161em L\u00e1sk\u00e1m'' with violin virtuoso [[Jaroslav Sv\u011bcen\u00fd]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ladislav Krizek & Jaroslav Sveceny |url=https://www.velkykosik.cz/hudba/vsem-laskam/ |website=velkykosik.cz |date= |accessdate=18 April 2020 |language=cs}}</ref>\nAt the end of the year, he launched the group Damiens with his brother Miroslav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek. In the fall of 1998, the duo released the single \"L\u00e1sko m\u011bj se\" (Take Care, Love). In the same year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek sang a duet with [[Kate\u0159ina Bro\u017eov\u00e1]] on [[Michal David]]'s musical ''Kr\u00e1ska a zv\u00ed\u0159e'' (Beauty and the Beast). In March of 1999, Damiens released their debut album, entitled ''K\u0159\u00eddla'' (Wings), which quickly won a gold record. In October of that year, they released ''K\u0159\u00eddla - Zlat\u00fd bonus'' (Wings - Golden Bonus), which included bonus tracks to the original release. In the 1999 edition of [[\u010cesk\u00fd slav\u00edk]], the duo won the \"Newcomer of the Year\" award. On the occasion of Karel Gott's 60th birthday, Damiens performed his song \"Adres\u00e1t nezn\u00e1m\u00fd\" (Addressee Unknown) at a large concert hall in Prague. Ladislav also sang Gott's famous hit \"Paganini\".\nAt the end of 2000, Damiens were invited by Karel Gott to host his concert tour ''\u010cesk\u00e9 v\u00e1noce 2000'' (Czech Christmas 2000). In the same year, the duo released their second album, ''Sv\u011bt z\u00e1zrak\u016f'' (World of Miracles), which again went gold for the sale of 25,000 copies.\n\nIn the spring of 2001, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek recorded the album ''S\u00edla n\u00e1vrat\u016f'' (The Power of Returns) with Citron, a selection of hits he had sung with them in the past. In the same year, Damiens was again invited to play Karel Gott's Christmas tour. The following year, Damiens released another record, titled ''Nechci z\u016fstat s\u00e1m'' (I Don't Want to Be Alone), which went gold.\n\n===Zem\u011b poh\u00e1dek===\nK\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's voice gained prominence in 2005, when he composed and sang the song \"Zem\u011b poh\u00e1dek\" (Land of Fairy Tales), as the theme of the advertising campaign for a children's online film store of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreyson |url=https://bandzone.cz/kreyson?at=info |website=bandzone.cz |date= |accessdate=17 April 2020 |language=cs}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Kreyson and Citron===\nDuring 2006, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek, together with guitarist Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc, performed all over the Czech Republic, playing acoustic arrangements of Vitacit, Citron, and Kreyson hits. In the middle of the year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek resuscitated Kreyson, which had been on hiatus since 1996, and announced a contest to find new band members. A total of 90 experienced musicians took part, of which 37 were shortlisted. The final decision was made on 25 January 2007, and the band began to play again after 11 years of silence.<ref>{{cite web|title=K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek: Sl\u00e1va je droga.

Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica; at the time he thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom by [[Jonathan Cape]] on 8 April 1957.\n\nThe story centres on a plot by [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]], the Soviet [[counter-intelligence]] agency, to assassinate Bond in such a way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in [[Istanbul]] and on the [[Orient Express]]. The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to report on an [[Interpol]] conference; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express. ''From Russia, with Love'' deals with the East\u2013West tensions of the [[Cold War]], and the decline of British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.\n\n''From Russia, with Love'' received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] to the Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', which listed ''From Russia, with Love'' as one of US President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the [[From Russia with Love (film)|second film]] in the [[James Bond in film|Bond series]], starring [[Sean Connery]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Quote box|quote=Not that it matters, but a great deal of the background to this story is accurate.&nbsp;...\n\nSMERSH, a contraction of Smiert Spionam\u2014Death to Spies\u2014exists and remains today the most secret department of the Soviet government.|source = Ian Fleming, ''From Russia, with Love'', Author's note{{sfn|Fleming|1957|p=6}}|align=right|width=30em|border=1px|salign=right}}\n\n[[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]], the Soviet [[counterintelligence]] agency, plans to commit a grand act of terrorism in the intelligence field. For this, it targets the British secret service agent [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]. Due in part to his role in the defeat of the SMERSH agents [[Le Chiffre]], Mr Big and [[Hugo Drax]], Bond has been listed as an enemy of the Soviet state and a \"death warrant\" is issued for him. His death is planned to precipitate a major sex scandal, which will run in the world press for months and leave his and his service's reputations in tatters. Bond's killer is to be the SMERSH executioner Donovan \"Red\" Grant, a British Army deserter and psychopath whose homicidal urges coincide with the full moon. Kronsteen, SMERSH's chess-playing master planner, and Colonel [[Rosa Klebb]], the head of Operations and Executions, devise the operation. They instruct an attractive young cipher clerk, Corporal [[Tatiana Romanova]], to falsely defect from her post in [[Istanbul]] and claim to have fallen in love with Bond after seeing a photograph of him. As an added lure for Bond, Romanova will provide the British with a Spektor, a Russian decoding device much coveted by [[MI6]]. She is not told the details of the plan.\n\n[[File:Orient Express 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Orient Express]], on which Bond travelled from Istanbul to Paris]]\nThe offer of defection is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects her and the Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, [[M (James Bond)|M]], orders him to go to Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the [[Orient Express]]. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]] agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third MGB agent.\n\nAt [[Trieste]] a man introduces himself as Captain Nash, a fellow MI6 agent, and Bond presumes he has been sent by M as added protection for the rest of the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Nash later wakes Bond, holding him at gunpoint, and reveals himself as the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is to shoot both of them, throw Romanova's body out the window, and plant a film of their love-making in her luggage; in addition, the Spektor is [[booby-trapped]] to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal cigarette case between the pages of a book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.\n\nLater, in Paris, after successfully delivering Romanova and the booby-trapped Spektor to his superiors, Bond meets Rosa Klebb. She is captured but manages to kick Bond with a poisoned blade concealed in her shoe; the story ends with Bond fighting for breath and falling to the floor.\n\n==Background and writing history==\nBy January 1956 the author [[Ian Fleming]] had published three novels\u2014''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' in 1953, ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' in 1954 and ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' in 1955. A fourth, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', was being edited and prepared for production.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=268\u201369}}<ref name=\"IFP: Books\" />{{efn|''Diamonds Are Forever'' was published in March 1956.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=289}} }} That month Fleming travelled to his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica to write ''From Russia, with Love''. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in ''[[Hansom Books|Books and Bookmen]]'' magazine: \"I write for about three hours in the morning&nbsp;... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written&nbsp;... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\"{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=101}} that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=v}} One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=14}} and wrote to his friend, the American author [[Raymond Chandler]]: \"My muse is in a very bad way&nbsp;... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks.\"{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=209}} Fleming re-wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted.\n\n<blockquote>Breathing became difficult.

It's really a lady's gun\u2014and not a very nice lady at that! Dare I suggest that Bond should be armed with a .38 or a nine millimetre\u2014let's say a German Walther PPK? That's far more appropriate.<ref name=\"DT: Boothroyd\" /></blockquote>\n\nBoothroyd's suggestions came too late to be included in ''From Russia, with Love'', but one of his guns\u2014a .38 [[Smith & Wesson]] [[snubnosed revolver]] modified with one third of the trigger guard removed\u2014was used as the model for Chopping's image.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=160}} Fleming later thanked Boothroyd by naming the armourer in [[Dr. No (novel)|''Dr. No'']] Major Boothroyd.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}}\n\n==Development==\n\n===Plot inspirations===\n[[File:Enigma-G.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A mechanical machine, much like an old-fashioned typewriter, is in a wooden box|The [[Enigma machine]] was used as the basis for the fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine]]\n\nAs with several of his works, Fleming appropriated the names or backgrounds of people he knew or had heard of for the story's characters: Red Grant, a Jamaican river guide\u2014whom Fleming's biographer [[Andrew Lycett]] described as \"a cheerful, voluble giant of villainous aspect\"\u2014was used for the half-German, half-Irish assassin.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=282}}{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} Rosa Klebb was partly based on [[Zoya Voskresenskaya|Colonel Rybkina]], a real-life member of the Lenin Military-Political Academy about whom Fleming had written an article for ''The Sunday Times''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=93}}{{sfn|Halloran|1986|p=163}} The Spektor machine used as the bait for Bond was not a [[Cold War]] device, but had its roots in the Second World War [[Enigma machine]], which Fleming had tried to obtain while serving in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}\n\nThe idea of the Orient Express came from two sources: Fleming had returned from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=12}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=30}} He also knew of the story of Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attach\u00e9 and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of [[Salzburg]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=96}} Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in ''Live and Let Die'', ''Diamonds Are Forever'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=16}}\n\nThe cultural historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] points out that ''From Russia, with Love'' was written and published at a time when tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A [[Operation Gold|joint British and American operation]] to tap into landline communication of the [[Soviet Army]] headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet-occupied zone]] had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver [[Lionel Crabb]] had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser ''[[Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze|Ordzhonikidze]]'' while the ship was moored in [[Portsmouth Harbour]], an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|popular uprising]] in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=28}}\n\n===Characters===\nTo make Bond a more rounded character, Fleming put further aspects of his personality into his creation. The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that Bond's \"physical and mental ennui\" is a reflection of Fleming's poor health and low spirits when he wrote the book.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=208}}{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=316}} The early depictions of Bond were based on earlier literary characters. In ''[[New Statesman]]'', the journalist William Cook writes of the early Bond:\n\n<blockquote>James Bond is the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the [[Bulldog Drummond]] tales of Lieutenant Colonel [[H. C. McNeile|Herman Cyril McNeile]] (aka \"Sapper\") and the [[Richard Hannay]] stories of [[John Buchan]]. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain&nbsp;... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing on from the character development of Bond in his previous four novels, Fleming adds further background to Bond's private life, largely around his home life and personal habits, with Bond's introduction to the story seeing him at breakfast with his housekeeper, May.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=106}} The novelist [[Raymond Benson]]\u2014who later wrote a series of Bond novels\u2014sees aspects of self-doubt entering Bond's mind with the \"soft\" life he has been leading when he is introduced in the book. Benson identifies Bond's fear when the flight to Istanbul encounters severe turbulence from a storm, and notes Bond's apparent nervousness when he first meets Romanova; he seems concerned and guilty about his mission.{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=106\u201307}} The other characters in the book are also well developed, according to Benson. He considers that the head of the Turkish office, Darko Kerim Bey, is \"one of Fleming's more colourful characters\"; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel (in ''Live and Let Die'') and Colombo (in the short story \"[[Risico]]\").{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=107\u201308}} Parker considers that Kerim is \"an antidote\" to Bond's lethargy,{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=209}} while the essayist [[Umberto Eco]] sees the character as having some of the moral qualities of the villains in the series, but that those qualities are used in support of Bond.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=39}}<ref name=\"Synnott: Beauty\" />\n\n''From Russia, with Love'' is one of the few stories by Fleming in which the Soviets are the main enemy,{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=208}} although Eco considers Bond's Russian opponents \"so monstrous, so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously\".{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=46}} Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=108}}{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=28\u201329}} Eco\u2014and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels\u2014consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a \"sexually neuter\" individual.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=39}} Red Grant was Fleming's first \"psychotic opponent\" for Bond, according to Benson.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=108}} [[Charlie Higson]]\u2014who later wrote the [[Young Bond]] series\u2014finds Grant to be \"a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a 'drowned man'.\"{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vii}}\n\n==Style==\nAccording to Higson, Fleming spent the first four novels changing the style of his books, and his approach to his characters, but in ''From Russia, with Love'' the author \"finally hits on the classic Bond formula, and he happily moved into his most creative phase\".{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vi}} The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that the previous novels were, in essence, episodic detective stories, while ''From Russia, with Love'' is structured differently, with an \"extended opening picture\" that describes Grant, the Russians and Romanova before moving onto the main story and then bringing back some of the elements when least expected.{{sfn|Panek|1981|pp=212\u201313}} The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book, and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=105}} Eco identifies that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a \"cleverly presented\" beginning, similar to the opening of a film.{{efn|The narrative describes Grant as an immobile man, lying by a swimming pool, waiting to be massaged; it has no direct connection to the main storyline.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=51}}}} Eco remarks that \"Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill\".{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=51}}\n\nBenson describes the \"Fleming Sweep\" as taking the reader from one chapter to another using \"hooks\" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=85}} He feels that the \"Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot\" of ''From Russia, with Love'' and, though it was the longest of Fleming's novels, \"the Sweep makes it seem half as long\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=105}} [[Kingsley Amis]], who later wrote a Bond novel, considers that the story is \"full of pace and conviction\",{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=154\u201355}} while Parker identifies \"cracks\" in the plot of the novel, but believes that \"the action mov[es] fast enough for the reader to skim over them\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=198}}\n\nFleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism,{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}}{{sfn|Butler|1973|p=241}} which Amis calls \"the Fleming effect\".{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=112}} Amis describes \"the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world&nbsp;... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced.\"{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=111\u201312}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe cultural historians Janet Woollacott and [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] consider that Fleming's preface note\u2014in which he informs readers that \"a great deal of the background to this story is accurate\"\u2014indicates that in this novel \"cold war tensions are most massively present, saturating the narrative from beginning to end\".{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=28}} As in ''Casino Royale'', the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post-Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}} The journalist William Cook observes that, with the British Empire in decline \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\"<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /> Woollacott and Bennett agree, and maintain that \"Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining.\"{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=28}} In ''From Russia, with Love'', this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England \"we don't show teeth any more\u2014only gums.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=227}}\n\nWoollacott and Bennett argue that in selecting Bond as the target for the Russians, he is \"deemed the most consummate embodiment of the myth of England\".{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=138}} The literary critic [[Meir Sternberg]] sees the theme of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] running through several of the Bond stories, including ''From Russia, with Love''. He sees Bond as [[Saint George]]\u2014the [[patron saint]] of England\u2014in the story, and notes that the opening chapter begins with an examination of a [[dragonfly]] as it flies over the supine body of Grant.<ref name=\"Style: Dragon\" />{{efn|Sternberg also points out that in ''Moonraker'', Bond's opponent is named Drax ({{lang|de|Drache}} is German for dragon), while in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1963) the character Marc-Ange Draco's surname is Latin for dragon, and in ''From Russia, with Love'' Darko Kerim's first name is \"an anagrammatic variation on the same cover name\".<ref name=\"Style: Dragon\" />}}\n\n==Publication and reception==\n\n===Publication history===\n''From Russia, with Love'' was released in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers [[Jonathan Cape]].<ref name=\"Richardson (1957)\"/> The American edition was published a few weeks later by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}}<ref name=\"Boucher (1957)\" /> Fleming was pleased with the book and later said:\n\n<blockquote>Personally I think ''from Russia, with Love'' was, in many respects, my best book, but the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}</blockquote>\n\nIn November 1956 the Prime Minister, [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]], had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}} and the publication of ''From Russia, with Love'' was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=313}} The serialisation of the story in ''[[Daily Express|The Daily Express]]'' in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book;{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=16}} a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later.

It continued the series of Bond radio adaptations featuring Jarvis and Stephens following [[Dr. No (novel)|''Dr. No'']] in 2008 and [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']] in 2010.<ref name=\"BBC adaps\" />\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notes}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|colwidth=25em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Style: Dragon\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Sternberg|first1=Meir|authorlink1=Meir Sternberg|title=Knight Meets Dragon in the James Bond Saga: Realism and Reality-Models|journal=Style|date=Spring 1983|volume=17|issue=2|pages=142\u201380|jstor=42945465|publisher=Penn State University Press|location=University Park, PA}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Synnott: Beauty\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Synnott|first1=Anthony|title=The Beauty Mystique: Ethics and Aesthetics in the Bond Genre|journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society|date=Spring 1990|volume=3|issue=3|pages=407\u201326|jstor=20006960}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DT: Boothroyd\">\n{{cite news\n |title=Bond's unsung heroes: Geoffrey Boothroyd, the real Q\n |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/5320024/Bonds-unsung-heroes-Geoffrey-Boothroyd-the-real-Q.html\n |accessdate=24 March 2016\n |work=The Daily Telegraph\n |date=21 May 2009\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924190337/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/5320024/Bonds-unsung-heroes-Geoffrey-Boothroyd-the-real-Q.html\n |archivedate=24 September 2015\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Fleming: Istanbul\">\n{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Ian|title=The Great Riot of Istanbul|newspaper=The Sunday Times|p=14|date=11 September 1955}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\">\n{{cite news|last=Cook|first=William|title=Novel man|newspaper=New Statesman|date=28 June 2004|page=40}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Time: Kennedy\">{{cite journal|last=Sidey|first=Hugh|title=The President's Voracious Reading Habits|journal=Life|date=17 March 1961|volume=50|issue=11|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUUEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA5&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=5 October 2011|issn=0024-3019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506171126/https://books.google.com/books?id=vUUEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA5&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Symons (1957)\">\n{{cite news|last=Symons|first=Julian|title=The End of the Affair|newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement|date=12 April 1957|authorlink=Julian Symons|page=230}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Times (1957)\">\n{{cite news|title=New Fiction|newspaper=The Times|date=11 April 1957|page=13}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Richardson (1957)\">\n{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Maurice|title=Crime Ration|newspaper=The Observer|date=14 April 1957|page=16}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Boucher (1957)\">\n{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Anthony|title=Criminals at Large|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 September 1957|page=BR15}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Kirsch (1957)\">\n{{cite news|last=Kirsch|first=Robert R|title=The Book Report|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=28 August 1957|page=B5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IFP: Books\">\n{{cite web\n |title=Ian Fleming's James Bond Titles\n |url=http://www.ianfleming.com/books/\n |publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]]\n |accessdate=7 August 2015\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810024322/http://www.ianfleming.com/books/\n |archivedate=10 August 2015\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"D Exp serial\">\n{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Ian|title=From Russia, with Love|newspaper=Daily Express|date=1 April 1957|page=10}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Brooke BFI\">\n{{cite web\n |last=Brooke\n |first=Michael\n |title=From Russia with Love (1963)\n |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/520462/\n |work=Screenonline\n |publisher=[[British Film Institute]]\n |accessdate=5 October 2011\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414181929/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/520462/\n |archivedate=14 April 2016\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC adaps\">\n{{cite web\n |title=Saturday Drama: From Russia with Love\n |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kxzr6\n |publisher=BBC\n |accessdate=15 July 2012\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219090509/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kxzr6\n |archivedate=19 December 2016\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Amis|first=Kingsley|authorlink=Kingsley Amis|title=The James Bond Dossier|year=1966|publisher=Pan Books |location=London |oclc=154139618|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Alan|last2=Hearn|first2=Marcus|year=2001|title=Kiss Kiss Bang!

Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica; at the time he thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom by [[Jonathan Cape]] on 8 April 1957.\n\nThe story centres on a plot by [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]], the Soviet [[counter-intelligence]] agency, to assassinate Bond in such a way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in [[Istanbul]] and on the [[Orient Express]]. The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to report on an [[Interpol]] conference; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express. ''From Russia, with Love'' deals with the East\u2013West tensions of the [[Cold War]], and the decline of British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.\n\n''From Russia, with Love'' received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] to the Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', which listed ''From Russia, with Love'' as one of US President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the [[From Russia with Love (film)|second film]] in the [[James Bond in film|Bond series]], starring [[Sean Connery]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Quote box|quote=Not that it matters, but a great deal of the background to this story is accurate.&nbsp;...\n\nSMERSH, a contraction of Smiert Spionam\u2014Death to Spies\u2014exists and remains today the most secret department of the Soviet government.|source = Ian Fleming, ''From Russia, with Love'', Author's note{{sfn|Fleming|1957|p=6}}|align=right|width=30em|border=1px|salign=right}}\n\n[[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]], the Soviet [[counterintelligence]] agency, plans to commit a grand act of terrorism in the intelligence field. For this, it targets the British secret service agent [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]. Due in part to his role in the defeat of the SMERSH agents [[Le Chiffre]], Mr Big and [[Hugo Drax]], Bond has been listed as an enemy of the Soviet state and a \"death warrant\" is issued for him. His death is planned to precipitate a major sex scandal, which will run in the world press for months and leave his and his service's reputations in tatters. Bond's killer is to be the SMERSH executioner Donovan \"Red\" Grant, a British Army deserter and psychopath whose homicidal urges coincide with the full moon. Kronsteen, SMERSH's chess-playing master planner, and Colonel [[Rosa Klebb]], the head of Operations and Executions, devise the operation. They instruct an attractive young cipher clerk, Corporal [[Tatiana Romanova]], to falsely defect from her post in [[Istanbul]] and claim to have fallen in love with Bond after seeing a photograph of him. As an added lure for Bond, Romanova will provide the British with a Spektor, a Russian decoding device much coveted by [[MI6]]. She is not told the details of the plan.\n\n[[File:Orient Express 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Orient Express]], on which Bond travelled from Istanbul to Paris]]\nThe offer of defection is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects her and the Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, [[M (James Bond)|M]], orders him to go to Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the [[Orient Express]]. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]] agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third MGB agent.\n\nAt [[Trieste]] a man introduces himself as Captain Nash, a fellow MI6 agent, and Bond presumes he has been sent by M as added protection for the rest of the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Nash later wakes Bond, holding him at gunpoint, and reveals himself as the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is to shoot both of them, throw Romanova's body out the window, and plant a film of their love-making in her luggage; in addition, the Spektor is [[booby-trapped]] to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal cigarette case between the pages of a book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.\n\nLater, in Paris, after successfully delivering Romanova and the booby-trapped Spektor to his superiors, Bond meets Rosa Klebb. She is captured but manages to kick Bond with a poisoned blade concealed in her shoe; the story ends with Bond fighting for breath and falling to the floor.\n\n==Background and writing history==\nBy January 1956 the author [[Ian Fleming]] had published three novels\u2014''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' in 1953, ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' in 1954 and ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' in 1955. A fourth, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', was being edited and prepared for production.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=268\u201369}}<ref name=\"IFP: Books\" />{{efn|''Diamonds Are Forever'' was published in March 1956.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=289}} }} That month Fleming travelled to his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica to write ''From Russia, with Love''. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in ''[[Hansom Books|Books and Bookmen]]'' magazine: \"I write for about three hours in the morning&nbsp;... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written&nbsp;... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\"{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=101}} that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=v}} One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=14}} and wrote to his friend, the American author [[Raymond Chandler]]: \"My muse is in a very bad way&nbsp;... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks.\"{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=209}} Fleming re-wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted.\n\n<blockquote>Breathing became difficult. Bond sighed to the depth of his lungs. He clenched his jaws and half closed his eyes, as people do when they want to hide their drunkenness.&nbsp;... He prised his eyes open.&nbsp;... Now he had to gasp for breath. Again his hand moved up towards his cold face. He had an impression of Mathis starting towards him. Bond felt his knees begin to buckle&nbsp;... [he] pivoted slowly on his heel and crashed head-long to the wine-red floor.<p>\n''From Russia, with Love'', novel's closing lines</blockquote>\n\nFleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=293}} By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=307\u201308}}\n\nFleming's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 to cover an [[Interpol]] conference for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' was a source of much of the background information in the story.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=96\u201397}} While there he met the Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan, who became the model for Darko Kerim;{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=12}} Fleming took down many of Kalkavan's conversations in a notebook, and used them verbatim in the novel.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=96\u201397}}{{efn|While in Turkey, Fleming wrote an account of the [[Istanbul pogrom]]s, \"The Great Riot of Istanbul\", which was published in ''The Sunday Times'' on 11 September 1955.<ref name=\"Fleming: Istanbul\" />}}\n\nAlthough Fleming did not date the event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor\u2014both of whom wrote books for [[Ian Fleming Publications]]\u2014have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|novel series]] as a whole. Chancellor put the events of ''From Russia, with Love'' in 1955; Griswold considers the story to have taken place between June and August 1954.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=13}}{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nIn August 1956, for fifty [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]], Fleming commissioned [[Richard Chopping]] to provide the art for the cover, based on Fleming's design; the result won a number of prizes.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}}{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=300}} After ''Diamonds Are Forever'' had been published in March 1956, Fleming received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, [[Geoffrey Boothroyd]], criticising the author's choice of firearm for Bond.\n\n<blockquote>I wish to point out that a man in James Bond's position would never consider using a .25 Beretta. It's really a lady's gun\u2014and not a very nice lady at that! Dare I suggest that Bond should be armed with a .38 or a nine millimetre\u2014let's say a German Walther PPK?

Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of [[Salzburg]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=96}} Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in ''Live and Let Die'', ''Diamonds Are Forever'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=16}}\n\nThe cultural historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] points out that ''From Russia, with Love'' was written and published at a time when tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A [[Operation Gold|joint British and American operation]] to tap into landline communication of the [[Soviet Army]] headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet-occupied zone]] had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver [[Lionel Crabb]] had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser ''[[Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze|Ordzhonikidze]]'' while the ship was moored in [[Portsmouth Harbour]], an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|popular uprising]] in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=28}}\n\n===Characters===\nTo make Bond a more rounded character, Fleming put further aspects of his personality into his creation. The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that Bond's \"physical and mental ennui\" is a reflection of Fleming's poor health and low spirits when he wrote the book.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=208}}{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=316}} The early depictions of Bond were based on earlier literary characters. In ''[[New Statesman]]'', the journalist William Cook writes of the early Bond:\n\n<blockquote>James Bond is the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the [[Bulldog Drummond]] tales of Lieutenant Colonel [[H. C. McNeile|Herman Cyril McNeile]] (aka \"Sapper\") and the [[Richard Hannay]] stories of [[John Buchan]]. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain&nbsp;... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing on from the character development of Bond in his previous four novels, Fleming adds further background to Bond's private life, largely around his home life and personal habits, with Bond's introduction to the story seeing him at breakfast with his housekeeper, May.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=106}} The novelist [[Raymond Benson]]\u2014who later wrote a series of Bond novels\u2014sees aspects of self-doubt entering Bond's mind with the \"soft\" life he has been leading when he is introduced in the book. Benson identifies Bond's fear when the flight to Istanbul encounters severe turbulence from a storm, and notes Bond's apparent nervousness when he first meets Romanova; he seems concerned and guilty about his mission.{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=106\u201307}} The other characters in the book are also well developed, according to Benson. He considers that the head of the Turkish office, Darko Kerim Bey, is \"one of Fleming's more colourful characters\"; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel (in ''Live and Let Die'') and Colombo (in the short story \"[[Risico]]\").{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=107\u201308}} Parker considers that Kerim is \"an antidote\" to Bond's lethargy,{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=209}} while the essayist [[Umberto Eco]] sees the character as having some of the moral qualities of the villains in the series, but that those qualities are used in support of Bond.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=39}}<ref name=\"Synnott: Beauty\" />\n\n''From Russia, with Love'' is one of the few stories by Fleming in which the Soviets are the main enemy,{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=208}} although Eco considers Bond's Russian opponents \"so monstrous, so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously\".{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=46}} Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=108}}{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=28\u201329}} Eco\u2014and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels\u2014consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a \"sexually neuter\" individual.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=39}} Red Grant was Fleming's first \"psychotic opponent\" for Bond, according to Benson.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=108}} [[Charlie Higson]]\u2014who later wrote the [[Young Bond]] series\u2014finds Grant to be \"a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a 'drowned man'.\"{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vii}}\n\n==Style==\nAccording to Higson, Fleming spent the first four novels changing the style of his books, and his approach to his characters, but in ''From Russia, with Love'' the author \"finally hits on the classic Bond formula, and he happily moved into his most creative phase\".{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vi}} The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that the previous novels were, in essence, episodic detective stories, while ''From Russia, with Love'' is structured differently, with an \"extended opening picture\" that describes Grant, the Russians and Romanova before moving onto the main story and then bringing back some of the elements when least expected.{{sfn|Panek|1981|pp=212\u201313}} The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book, and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=105}} Eco identifies that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a \"cleverly presented\" beginning, similar to the opening of a film.{{efn|The narrative describes Grant as an immobile man, lying by a swimming pool, waiting to be massaged; it has no direct connection to the main storyline.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=51}}}} Eco remarks that \"Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill\".{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=51}}\n\nBenson describes the \"Fleming Sweep\" as taking the reader from one chapter to another using \"hooks\" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=85}} He feels that the \"Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot\" of ''From Russia, with Love'' and, though it was the longest of Fleming's novels, \"the Sweep makes it seem half as long\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=105}} [[Kingsley Amis]], who later wrote a Bond novel, considers that the story is \"full of pace and conviction\",{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=154\u201355}} while Parker identifies \"cracks\" in the plot of the novel, but believes that \"the action mov[es] fast enough for the reader to skim over them\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=198}}\n\nFleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism,{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}}{{sfn|Butler|1973|p=241}} which Amis calls \"the Fleming effect\".{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=112}} Amis describes \"the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world&nbsp;... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced.\"{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=111\u201312}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe cultural historians Janet Woollacott and [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] consider that Fleming's preface note\u2014in which he informs readers that \"a great deal of the background to this story is accurate\"\u2014indicates that in this novel \"cold war tensions are most massively present, saturating the narrative from beginning to end\".{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=28}} As in ''Casino Royale'', the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post-Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}} The journalist William Cook observes that, with the British Empire in decline \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\"<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /> Woollacott and Bennett agree, and maintain that \"Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining.\"{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=28}} In ''From Russia, with Love'', this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England \"we don't show teeth any more\u2014only gums.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=227}}\n\nWoollacott and Bennett argue that in selecting Bond as the target for the Russians, he is \"deemed the most consummate embodiment of the myth of England\".{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=138}} The literary critic [[Meir Sternberg]] sees the theme of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] running through several of the Bond stories, including ''From Russia, with Love''. He sees Bond as [[Saint George]]\u2014the [[patron saint]] of England\u2014in the story, and notes that the opening chapter begins with an examination of a [[dragonfly]] as it flies over the supine body of Grant.<ref name=\"Style: Dragon\" />{{efn|Sternberg also points out that in ''Moonraker'', Bond's opponent is named Drax ({{lang|de|Drache}} is German for dragon), while in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1963) the character Marc-Ange Draco's surname is Latin for dragon, and in ''From Russia, with Love'' Darko Kerim's first name is \"an anagrammatic variation on the same cover name\".<ref name=\"Style: Dragon\" />}}\n\n==Publication and reception==\n\n===Publication history===\n''From Russia, with Love'' was released in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers [[Jonathan Cape]].<ref name=\"Richardson (1957)\"/> The American edition was published a few weeks later by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}}<ref name=\"Boucher (1957)\" /> Fleming was pleased with the book and later said:\n\n<blockquote>Personally I think ''from Russia, with Love'' was, in many respects, my best book, but the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}</blockquote>\n\nIn November 1956 the Prime Minister, [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]], had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}} and the publication of ''From Russia, with Love'' was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=313}} The serialisation of the story in ''[[Daily Express|The Daily Express]]'' in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book;{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=16}} a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' on 17 March 1961, the US President [[John F. Kennedy]] listed ''From Russia, with Love'' as one of his ten favourite books.<ref name=\"Time: Kennedy\" />{{efn|Kennedy's brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] was also an avid reader of the Bond novels, as was [[Allen Dulles]], the [[Director of Central Intelligence]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=260, 262}}}} This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US.{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vi}}{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=383}} There was a further boost to sales following the release of the [[From Russia with Love (film)|film of the same name]] in 1963, which saw the sales of the [[Pan Books|Pan]] paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2009|pp=17, 21}}\n\n===Reception===\n''From Russia, with Love'' received mainly positive reviews from critics.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=239}} [[Julian Symons]], in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', considered that it was Fleming's \"tautest, most exciting and most brilliant tale\", that the author \"brings the thriller in line with modern emotional needs\", and that Bond \"is the intellectual's [[Mike Hammer]]: a killer with a keen eye and a soft heart for a woman\".<ref name=\"Symons (1957)\" /> The critic for ''[[The Times]]'' was less persuaded by the story, suggesting that \"the general tautness and brutality of the story leave the reader uneasily hovering between fact and fiction\".<ref name=\"Times (1957)\" /> Although the review compared Fleming in unflattering terms to [[Peter Cheyney]], a [[crime fiction]] writer of the 1930s and 1940s, it concluded that ''From Russia, with Love'' was \"exciting enough of its kind\".<ref name=\"Times (1957)\"/>\n\n''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s critic, Maurice Richardson, thought that ''From Russia, with Love'' was a \"stupendous plot to trap&nbsp;... Bond, our deluxe cad-clubman agent\" and wondered \"Is this the end of Bond?\"<ref name=\"Richardson (1957)\" /> The reviewer for the ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' declared that \"Ian Fleming is in a class by himself\",{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} while the critic for ''The Sunday Times'' argued that \"If a psychiatrist and a thoroughly efficient copywriter got together to produce a fictional character who would be the mid-twentieth century subconscious male ambition, the result would inevitably be James Bond.\"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}\n\nWriting in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Anthony Boucher]]\u2014described by a Fleming biographer, [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], as \"throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man\"{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=99}}\u2014was damning in his review, saying that ''From Russia, with Love'' was Fleming's \"longest and poorest book\".<ref name=\"Boucher (1957)\" /> Boucher further wrote that the novel contained \"as usual, sex-cum-sadism with a veneer of literacy but without the occasional brilliant setpieces\".<ref name=\"Boucher (1957)\"/> The critic for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', conversely, wrote that \"Mr Fleming is intensely observant, acutely literate and can turn a clich\u00e9 into a silk purse with astute alchemy\".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} Robert R Kirsch, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', also disagreed with Boucher, saying that \"the espionage novel has been brought up to date by a superb practitioner of that nearly lost art: Ian Fleming.\"<ref name=\"Kirsch (1957)\" /> In Kirsch's opinion, ''From Russia, with Love'' \"has everything of the traditional plus the most modern refinements in the sinister arts of spying\".<ref name=\"Kirsch (1957)\"/>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{see also|James Bond (comic strip)}}\n\n''From Russia, with Love'' was serialised in ''The Daily Express'' from 1 April 1957;<ref name=\"D Exp serial\" /> it was the first Bond novel the paper had adapted.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=16}} In 1960 the novel was also adapted as a daily [[comic strip]] in the paper and was syndicated worldwide. The series, which ran from 3 February to 21 May 1960,{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} was written by [[Henry Gammidge]] and illustrated by [[John McLusky]].{{sfn|McLusky|Gammidge|Hern|Fleming|2009|p=5}} The comic strip was reprinted in 2005 by [[Titan Books]] in the ''Dr. No'' anthology, which also included ''Diamonds Are Forever'' and ''Casino Royale''.{{sfn|McLusky|Gammidge|Hern|Fleming|2009|p=135}}\n\nThe film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' was released in 1963, produced by [[Albert R.

It was the second Bond film in the [[Eon Productions]] series and starred [[Sean Connery]] as Bond.<ref name=\"Brooke BFI\" /> The film version contained some changes to the novel, with the leading villains switching from SMERSH to [[SPECTRE]], a fictional terrorist organisation.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=21}} In the main it was a faithful adaptation of the novel; the ending was changed to make clear Bond's survival. Benson declares that \"many fans consider it ''the'' best Bond film, simply because it is close to Fleming's original story\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=172\u201374}}\n\nThe novel was dramatised for radio in 2012 by Archie Scottney, directed by [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] and produced by [[Rosalind Ayres]]; it featured a full cast starring [[Toby Stephens]] as James Bond and was first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]].

[[Clinicians]] must hold a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that is from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]] and from a communication sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA), the profession's national governing body as well as individual state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's [[College of education]], but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]], but only the master's degree is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA).\n\nAll clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>  They must pass multiple [[comprehensive exams]] also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.\n\nAfter all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:\n* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).\n* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org}}</ref>\n* Receive [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).\n* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.\n\nMaintaining licensure through continuing education:\n* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).\n\nContinuing education and training obligations:\n* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n* Participate in continuing education.\n* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.\n* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.\n* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nProfessional suffix:\n* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).\n* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the \"three Cs\" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.\n\n===Salary information===\nSalaries of SLPs in the United States depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location. The ASHA 2016 Schools Survey revealed that SLPs received a median academic year salary of $62,000, which is a 2% increase from the latest Schools Survey done in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2016-Schools-Survey-SLP-Salary-Trends.pdf|title= Schools Survey Report: SLP Annual Salary and Hourly Wage Trends 2004\u20132016 |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}</ref> The 2015 SLP Health Care Survey placed the median salary for SLPs working within the health care industry at $75,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2015-SLP-Health-Care-Survey-Annual-Salaries.pdf|title=SLP Health Care Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> However, salaries can range from $60,570\u201397,770.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/speech-language-pathologist/salary |title= Speech-Language Pathologist Salary |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= www.usnews.com |publisher= U.S. News |access-date= 8 March 2018 |quote=Speech-language pathologists have seen a spike in pay the past few years.

Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}</ref> Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.\n\n==Clients and patients==\nSpeech-language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.\n\n===Infants and children===\n* Infants with injuries due to complications at birth, [[feeding]] and [[swallowing]] difficulties, including [[dysphagia]]\n* Children with mild, moderate or severe:\n** Genetic disorders that adversely affect speech, language and/or cognitive development including [[cleft palate]], [[Down syndrome]], [[DiGeorge syndrome]]\n** [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]<ref name=\"Bellani-2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bellani | first1 = M. | last2 = Moretti | first2 = A. | last3 = Perlini | first3 = C. | last4 = Brambilla | first4 = P. | title = Language disturbances in ADHD. | journal = Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 311\u20135 |date=Dec 2011 | pmid = 22201208 | doi=10.1017/S2045796011000527}}</ref><ref name=ICD10>{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Version for 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=World Health Organisation }}</ref>\n** [[Autism|Autism spectrum disorders]],<ref>https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/autism.aspx</ref> including [[Asperger syndrome]]<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>\n** [[Developmental delay]]\n** [[Feeding disorder]]s, including oral motor deficits\n** [[Cranial nerve]] damage\n** [[Hearing loss]]\n** [[Craniofacial abnormality|Craniofacial anomalies]] that adversely affect speech, language and/or cognitive development\n** [[Language delay]]\n** [[Specific language impairment]]\n** Specific difficulties in producing sounds, called [[Speech and language pathology in school settings#Articulation disorders|articulation disorders]], (including [[vocalic r|vocalic /r/]] and lisps)\n** Pediatric [[traumatic brain injury]]\n** [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]]\n** [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|Cleft palate]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ogata|first=Y|title=The Speech Therapy of Cleft Palate Patients as an Oral Rehabilitation|url=http://www.jdentistry.ui.ac.id/index.php/JDI/article/view/758|journal=Journal of Dentistry Indonesia|volume=4|issue=3|year=1997|pages=46\u201347|doi=10.14693/jdi.v4i3.758|pmid=|access-date=15 May 2016|doi-broken-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nIn the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through [[speech and language pathology in school settings|the public school system]].

Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's [[College of education]], but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]], but only the master's degree is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA).\n\nAll clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>  They must pass multiple [[comprehensive exams]] also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.\n\nAfter all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:\n* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).\n* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org}}</ref>\n* Receive [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).\n* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.\n\nMaintaining licensure through continuing education:\n* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).\n\nContinuing education and training obligations:\n* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n* Participate in continuing education.\n* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.\n* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.\n* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nProfessional suffix:\n* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).\n* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the \"three Cs\" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.\n\n===Salary information===\nSalaries of SLPs in the United States depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location.

Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}</ref> Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.\n\n==Clients and patients==\nSpeech-language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.\n\n===Infants and children===\n* Infants with injuries due to complications at birth, [[feeding]] and [[swallowing]] difficulties, including [[dysphagia]]\n* Children with mild, moderate or severe:\n** Genetic disorders that adversely affect speech, language and/or cognitive development including [[cleft palate]], [[Down syndrome]], [[DiGeorge syndrome]]\n** [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]<ref name=\"Bellani-2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bellani | first1 = M. | last2 = Moretti | first2 = A. | last3 = Perlini | first3 = C. | last4 = Brambilla | first4 = P. | title = Language disturbances in ADHD. | journal = Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 311\u20135 |date=Dec 2011 | pmid = 22201208 | doi=10.1017/S2045796011000527}}</ref><ref name=ICD10>{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Version for 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=World Health Organisation }}</ref>\n** [[Autism|Autism spectrum disorders]],<ref>https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/autism.aspx</ref> including [[Asperger syndrome]]<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>\n** [[Developmental delay]]\n** [[Feeding disorder]]s, including oral motor deficits\n** [[Cranial nerve]] damage\n** [[Hearing loss]]\n** [[Craniofacial abnormality|Craniofacial anomalies]] that adversely affect speech, language and/or cognitive development\n** [[Language delay]]\n** [[Specific language impairment]]\n** Specific difficulties in producing sounds, called [[Speech and language pathology in school settings#Articulation disorders|articulation disorders]], (including [[vocalic r|vocalic /r/]] and lisps)\n** Pediatric [[traumatic brain injury]]\n** [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]]\n** [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|Cleft palate]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ogata|first=Y|title=The Speech Therapy of Cleft Palate Patients as an Oral Rehabilitation|url=http://www.jdentistry.ui.ac.id/index.php/JDI/article/view/758|journal=Journal of Dentistry Indonesia|volume=4|issue=3|year=1997|pages=46\u201347|doi=10.14693/jdi.v4i3.758|pmid=|access-date=15 May 2016|doi-broken-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nIn the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through [[speech and language pathology in school settings|the public school system]].
