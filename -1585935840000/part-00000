It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first two-game modes were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles and ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for those platforms, in addition for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the first two games have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming become a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a sandbox game mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe.  Players are encouraged to be very creative in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although as of 2019, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent Off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 | last1=Alwani | first1=Rishi | publisher=Gadgets360 | date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first two-game modes were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles and ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for those platforms, in addition for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the first two games have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming become a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a sandbox game mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe.  Players are encouraged to be very creative in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although as of 2019, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent Off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 | last1=Alwani | first1=Rishi | publisher=Gadgets360 | date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.

On Yeonpyeong-ri, an island near [[Incheon]] where many haenyeo worked, their wages, on average, constituted 40 to 48 percent of a typical family's total income.<ref name=\":22\" /> &nbsp;The prominent place of haenyeo in Jeju's economy and in their individual family units continued long after Japanese colonization. &nbsp;In the early 1960s, for example, haenyeo harvests accounted for 60% of Jeju's fisheries revenue and 40% of haenyeo husbands remained unemployed.<ref name=\"RRR32792\" /><ref name=\"nyt-201403292\" />\n\n== In society ==\nBecause so many families relied on the haenyeo for the majority of their income, a semi-matriarchal society developed on Jeju with the haenyeo at the head of the household.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cElFBvPqwjc|title=Episode 5: Haenyeo Female Divers|last=|first=|date=|website=Youtube|publisher=Travel Tours Korea LA18|format=Video|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\":22\" /> On the tiny islets off the coast of Jeju, such as Mara Island, where sea-diving was the sole source of income, this reversal of traditional gender roles was fully realized; men would look after the children and go shopping while the women would bring in money for the family.<ref name=\":2\" /> &nbsp;Other manifestations of Jeju's unique society include men paying a dowry to the family of the bride (a reversal of the custom on the Korean mainland) and families celebrating the birth of girls over the birth of boys.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Mermaids of Jeju \u2013 Korean Female Divers Haenyeo {{!}} Official Korea Tourism Organization|url = http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=260918|website = english.visitkorea.or.kr|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nWhile certain elements of a matriarchal society surfaced in Jeju, they were not enough to completely overcome the predominance of [[Confucianism]]. As a result, beyond the domestic sphere, little else about Jeju society was different from what existed on the Korean mainland. For example, men filled all political leadership roles and were the only ones who could perform ancestor-worship ceremonies and inherit property and the familial line. Furthermore, during the era of colonial rule, haenyeo remained peasants, never moving up the chain to become small-business owners or managers of seafood manufacturing plants.<ref name=\":22\" /> Even in the home, most haenyeo remained the primary caregiver and handled at least half of the domestic chores.<ref name=\"RRR32792\" />{{rp|107}}\n\nToday, things have changed. The haenyeo are celebrated as one of Jeju's most valued treasures. The Korean government shows its appreciation for the unique contributions of the haenyeo to Jeju's culture by subsidizing their gear and granting them exclusive rights to sell fresh seafood.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"nyt-201403292\" /> Furthermore, in March 2014, the government requested the [[UNESCO]] to add haenyeo to its [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage list]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInscribed in 2016 (11.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/culture-of-jeju-haenyeo-women-divers-01068\n\n== Declining numbers ==\nLike many other vestiges of the past, the sea-diving industry has fallen victim to industrialisation. Beginning in the 1960s, the Korean government sought ways to jumpstart the country's economy in every province. Because Jeju was not a practical place to build factories, the Korean government decided to turn it into an exporter of [[mandarin orange]]s. By 1969, a majority of rural workers had joined this new industry. Additionally, about 2% of all land in Jeju was dedicated to farming mandarin oranges. In the 1970s, the government launched another program to bolster Jeju's [[tourism]] industry. &nbsp;By 1978, tourism had surpassed agriculture as the island's largest industry.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\nAll of this change had a significant impact on haenyeo numbers. Given alternatives to back-breaking labor in miserable conditions, women abandoned the sea-diving industry in droves.<ref name=\":22\" />&nbsp;In the five years between 1965 and 1970, numbers dropped from 23,081 to 14,143.<ref name=\":22\" /> Even more damning to the haenyeo way of life, education opportunities and attractive positions in emerging industries has deterred younger girls from becoming haenyeo.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tourists and traditional divers in a common fishing ground|last = Lee|first = Joung-Hun|date = July 9, 2011|journal = Ecological Economics|doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.07.013 |access-date = |last2 = Iwasa|first2 = Yoh |volume=70 |pages=2350\u20132360}}</ref>{{rp|2350}} In 1970, 31% of haenyeo were 30 years old or younger, 55% were between 30 and 49 years old and only 14% were 50 or older.

On Yeonpyeong-ri, an island near [[Incheon]] where many haenyeo worked, their wages, on average, constituted 40 to 48 percent of a typical family's total income.<ref name=\":22\" /> &nbsp;The prominent place of haenyeo in Jeju's economy and in their individual family units continued long after Japanese colonization. &nbsp;In the early 1960s, for example, haenyeo harvests accounted for 60% of Jeju's fisheries revenue and 40% of haenyeo husbands remained unemployed.<ref name=\"RRR32792\" /><ref name=\"nyt-201403292\" />\n\n== In society ==\nBecause so many families relied on the haenyeo for the majority of their income, a semi-matriarchal society developed on Jeju with the haenyeo at the head of the household.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cElFBvPqwjc|title=Episode 5: Haenyeo Female Divers|last=|first=|date=|website=Youtube|publisher=Travel Tours Korea LA18|format=Video|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\":22\" /> On the tiny islets off the coast of Jeju, such as Mara Island, where sea-diving was the sole source of income, this reversal of traditional gender roles was fully realized; men would look after the children and go shopping while the women would bring in money for the family.<ref name=\":2\" /> &nbsp;Other manifestations of Jeju's unique society include men paying a dowry to the family of the bride (a reversal of the custom on the Korean mainland) and families celebrating the birth of girls over the birth of boys.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Mermaids of Jeju \u2013 Korean Female Divers Haenyeo {{!}} Official Korea Tourism Organization|url = http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=260918|website = english.visitkorea.or.kr|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nWhile certain elements of a matriarchal society surfaced in Jeju, they were not enough to completely overcome the predominance of [[Confucianism]]. As a result, beyond the domestic sphere, little else about Jeju society was different from what existed on the Korean mainland. For example, men filled all political leadership roles and were the only ones who could perform ancestor-worship ceremonies and inherit property and the familial line. Furthermore, during the era of colonial rule, haenyeo remained peasants, never moving up the chain to become small-business owners or managers of seafood manufacturing plants.<ref name=\":22\" /> Even in the home, most haenyeo remained the primary caregiver and handled at least half of the domestic chores.<ref name=\"RRR32792\" />{{rp|107}}\n\nToday, things have changed. The haenyeo are celebrated as one of Jeju's most valued treasures. The Korean government shows its appreciation for the unique contributions of the haenyeo to Jeju's culture by subsidizing their gear and granting them exclusive rights to sell fresh seafood.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"nyt-201403292\" /> Furthermore, in March 2014, the government requested the [[UNESCO]] to add haenyeo to its [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage list]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInscribed in 2016 (11.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/culture-of-jeju-haenyeo-women-divers-01068\n\n== Declining numbers ==\nLike many other vestiges of the past, the sea-diving industry has fallen victim to industrialisation. Beginning in the 1960s, the Korean government sought ways to jumpstart the country's economy in every province. Because Jeju was not a practical place to build factories, the Korean government decided to turn it into an exporter of [[mandarin orange]]s. By 1969, a majority of rural workers had joined this new industry. Additionally, about 2% of all land in Jeju was dedicated to farming mandarin oranges. In the 1970s, the government launched another program to bolster Jeju's [[tourism]] industry. &nbsp;By 1978, tourism had surpassed agriculture as the island's largest industry.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\nAll of this change had a significant impact on haenyeo numbers. Given alternatives to back-breaking labor in miserable conditions, women abandoned the sea-diving industry in droves.<ref name=\":22\" />&nbsp;In the five years between 1965 and 1970, numbers dropped from 23,081 to 14,143.<ref name=\":22\" /> Even more damning to the haenyeo way of life, education opportunities and attractive positions in emerging industries has deterred younger girls from becoming haenyeo.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tourists and traditional divers in a common fishing ground|last = Lee|first = Joung-Hun|date = July 9, 2011|journal = Ecological Economics|doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.07.013 |access-date = |last2 = Iwasa|first2 = Yoh |volume=70 |pages=2350\u20132360}}</ref>{{rp|2350}} In 1970, 31% of haenyeo were 30 years old or younger, 55% were between 30 and 49 years old and only 14% were 50 or older.
