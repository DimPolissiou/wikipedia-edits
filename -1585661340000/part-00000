It follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest by his father King [[Dasharatha]], on request of his step-mother [[Kaikeyi]]. His travels across forests in India with his wife [[Sita]] and brother [[Lakshmana]], the kidnapping of his wife by [[Ravana]], the great king of [[Lanka]], resulting in a war with him, and Ram's eventual return to [[Ayodhya]] to be crowned king. This is the culmination point of the epic. \nThere have been many attempts to unravel the epic's historical growth and compositional layers; various recent scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE, with later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.<ref name=\"Brockington1998\">{{cite book|author=J.

It consists of nearly 24,000 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] (mostly set in the [[Shloka]]/[[Anustubh]] meter), divided into seven Kand's (adi kand, ayodhya kand, aranya kand, kishkindhya kand, sundara kand, lanka kanda and uttara kand) and about 500 sargas (chapters). In [[Hindu]] tradition, it is considered to be the ''adi-kavya'' (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal husband and the ideal king. ''Ramayana'' was an important influence on later [[Sanskrit]] poetry and Hindu life and culture. Like ''Mahabharata'', ''Ramayana'' presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative [[allegory]], interspersing philosophical and ethical elements. The characters [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Hanuman]],  and [[Ravana]] are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the [[South Asian]] nations of [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[South-East Asian]] countries of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThere are many [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of ''Ramayana'']] in Indian languages, besides Buddhist, Sikh, and [[Rama in Jainism|Jain]] adaptations. There are also [[Cambodia]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Philippines|Filipino]], [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Laos|Lao]], [[Myanmar|Burmese]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the tale.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Ramayana'' means \"Rama\" + \"Aayana\" , where as Rama is name of Lord or God and Aayana means Path or Way. The literal meaning of the name is \"the journey of R\u0101ma\" or \"the career of R\u0101ma\" or in other words path or way taken or chosen by Rama during the human life cycle form at earth, during [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga]] [[Hindu units of time|(869000 years ago)]] in Jambudweep(Java Plum)/Aryavart/India.<ref>Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland Goldman, 'R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a', in ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', ed. by Knut A.

The text survives in several thousand partial and complete manuscripts, the oldest of which is a [[palm-leaf manuscript]] found in Nepal and dated to the 11th century CE.

Textual scholar [[Robert P. Goldman]] differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] writes that \"the ''Ramayana'', like the ''Mahabharata'', is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind.\"\n\nThere has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes (Bala kanda and Uttara kand) of Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' were composed by the original author.

However, the general cultural background of the ''Ramayana'' is one of the post-[[urbanization]] periods of the eastern part of north [[India]], while the ''Mahabharata'' reflects the Kuru areas west of this, from the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] to the late [[Vedas|Vedic]] period.\n\nBy tradition, the text belongs to the [[Treta Yuga]], second of the four eons ([[yuga]]) of [[Hindu]] chronology. [[Rama]] is said to have been born in the [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga (869000 years ago)]] to king [[Dasharatha]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].\n\nThe names of the characters (Rama, Sita, Dasharatha, [[Janaka]], [[Vashista]], [[Vishwamitra]]) are all known only in the late [[Vedic]] literature.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, a king named Janaka appears in a lengthy dialogue in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad '']] with no reference to Rama or the ''Ramayana''.<ref>''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ''4:1:1; trans.

According to the modern [[academic]] view, [[Vishnu]], who, according to [[Bala Kanda]], was incarnated as [[Rama]], first came into prominence with the epics themselves and further, during the puranic period of the later 1st millennium CE. Also, in the epic Mahabharata, there is a version of the ''Ramayana'' known as ''Ramopakhyana''. This version is depicted as a narration to [[Yudhishthira]].\n\nBooks two to six form the oldest portion of the epic, while the first and last books (Bala kanda and Uttara kand, respectively) are later additions: style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the epic have led scholars since Hermann Jacobi to the present toward this consensus.<ref>Ajay K.

Once, Kaikeyi saved Dasaratha in a war and as a reward, she got the privilege from Dasaratha to fulfil two of her wishes at any time of her lifetime. She made use of the opportunity and forced Dasharatha to make their son Bharata crown prince and send Rama into exile for 14 years. Dasharatha dies heartbroken after Rama goes into exile.\n* '''[[Rama]]''' is the main character of the tale. Portrayed as the seventh avatar of god [[Vishnu]], he is the eldest and favourite son of [[Dasharatha]], the king of Ayodhya and his Chief Queen, [[Kausalya]]. He is portrayed as the epitome of virtue. Dasharatha is forced by Kaikeyi to command Rama to relinquish his right to the throne for fourteen years and go into exile. Rama kills the evil demon Ravana, who abducted his wife Sita, and later returns to Ayodhya to form an ideal state.\n[[File:Rama and monkey chiefs.jpg|thumb|right|Rama and the monkey chiefs]]\n* '''[[Sita]]''' (Vaidehi) is another of the tale's protagonists.She was the blood of sages who sacrificed their lives to develop the powerful force to get rid of earth from demons. This blood was collected in a pot and was buried in Earth, so She is called the daughter of Mother Earth, adopted by King Janaka, and Rama's beloved wife. Rama went to [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush (bow) while trying to tie a knot to it in a competition organized by King Janaka of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]]. The competition was to find the most suitable husband for Sita and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the avatara of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue. She follows her husband into exile and is abducted by the Lanka's king Ravana. She is imprisoned on the island of [[Lanka]], until Rama rescues her by defeating Ravana. Later, she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]].\n* '''[[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]''' is the son of Dasharatha and Queen Kaikeyi. when he learns that his mother Kaikeyi has forced Rama into exile and caused Dasharatha to die brokenhearted, he storms out of the palace and goes in search of Rama in the forest. When Rama refuses to return from his exile to assume the throne, Bharata obtains Ram's sandals and places them on the throne as a gesture that Rama is the true king. Bharata then rules Ayodhya as the regent of Rama for the next fourteen years, staying outside the city of Ayodhya. He was married to [[Mandavi]].\n* '''[[Lakshmana]]''' (Saumitra) is a younger brother of Rama, who chose to go into exile with him. He is the son of King Dasharatha and Queen Sumitra and twin of Shatrughna. Lakshmana is portrayed as an avatar of [[Shesha]], the [[n\u0101ga]] associated with the god Vishnu. He spends his time protecting Sita and Rama, during which time he fights the demoness [[Shurpanakha]]. He is forced to leave Sita, who was deceived by the demon [[Maricha]] into believing that Rama was in trouble. Sita is abducted by Ravana upon his leaving her. He was married to Sita's younger sister [[Urmila]].\n* '''[[Shatrughna]]''' (Ripudaman: Killer of enemies) is a son of Dasharatha and his third wife Queen Sumitra.

Dasharatha was the king of Ayodhya. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. He was childless for a long time and anxious to produce an heir, so he performs a fire sacrifice known as ''putra-kameshti yajna''. As a consequence, Rama was first born to Kaushalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born to Sumitra. These sons are endowed, to various degrees, with the essence of the Supreme Trinity Entity [[Vishnu]]; Vishnu had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon [[Ravana]], who was oppressing the gods, and who could only be destroyed by a mortal. The boys were reared as the princes of the realm, receiving instructions from the scriptures and in warfare from Vashistha. When Rama was 16 years old, sage Vishwamitra comes to the court of Dasharatha in search of help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses Rama, who is followed by Lakshmana, his constant companion throughout the story. Rama and Lakshmana receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vishwamitra and proceed to destroy the demons: Tadka and many more.\n\n[[Janaka]] was the king of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]. One day, a female child was found in the field by the king in the deep furrow dug by his plough. Overwhelmed with joy, the king regarded the child as a \"miraculous gift of god\". The child was named Sita, the Sanskrit word for furrow. Sita grew up to be a girl of unparalleled beauty and charm. The king had decided that who ever could lift and wield the heavy bow, presented to his ancestors by [[Shiva]], could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string, it got broken.<ref>{{cite book|title=CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.|publisher=sacredtexts.com|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry067.htm|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> Marriages were arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka.

On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyi \u2013 her jealousy aroused by [[Manthara]], a wicked maidservant \u2013 claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterises him throughout the story. He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, \"the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.\" After Ram's departure, King Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule. But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile.\n[[File:Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.</center>]]\n\n===''Aranya kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Aranya Kanda}}\n\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ravana]] fights [[Jatayu]] as he carries off the kidnapped Sita.

At the [[Panchavati]] forest they are visited by a [[rakshasi]] named [[Shurpanakha]], sister of Ravana. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill Sita. Lakshmana stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and Dushan organise an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his raskshasas.\n\nWhen the news of these events reach Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the ''rakshasa'' [[Maricha]]. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Rama, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade Sita from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time, Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow Ram's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshman's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline, the [[Lakshmana rekha|Lakshmana rekha]], around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. With the coast finally clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, Sita is tricked into leaving the rekha and is then forcibly carried away by Ravana.<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

At Lanka, Sita is kept under the guard of ''rakshasis''. Ravana asks Sita to marry him, but she refuses, being eternally devoted to Rama. Meanwhile, Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction from Jatayu and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet [[Kabandha]] and the ascetic [[Shabari]], who direct them towards Sugriva and Hanuman.\n\n===''Kishkindha kanda''===\n\n[[File:Stone bas relief at Banteay Srei in Cambodia.jpg|thumb|A stone bas-[[relief]] at Banteay Srei in [[Cambodia]] depicts the combat between [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and [[Sugriva]] (middle).

Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes and an adherent of [[Sugriva]], the banished pretender to the throne of Kishkindha. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] thus regaining the kingdom of Kishkindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita. However Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time in enjoying his powers. The clever former ape queen [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] (wife of Vali) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lakshmana from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from north, east and west. The southern search party under the leadership of [[Angada]] and Hanuman learns from a vulture named [[Sampati]] (elder brother of Jatayu), that Sita was taken to Lanka.\n\n===''Sundara kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Sundara Kanda}}\n[[File:Sita at ashokavana.jpg|thumb|right|Ravana is meeting Sita at Ashokavana. Hanuman is seen on the tree.]]\n\n''Sundara kand'' forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramyana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of [[Hanuman]]'s adventures. After learning about Sita, Hanuman [[shapeshifting|assumes]] a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way he meets with many challenges like facing a Gandharva kanya who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Mainakudu who offers Hanuman assistance and offers him rest. Hanuman refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for Sita.\n\nAfter entering into Lanka, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lanka. Hanuman fights with her and subjugates her in order to get into Lanka. In the process Lankini, who had an earlier vision/warning from the gods that the end of Lanka nears if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanuman explores the demons' kingdom and spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita, giving Ram's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Ram; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ramyana will not have significance if Hanuman carries her to Rama \u2013 \"When Rama is not there Ravana carried Sita forcibly and when Ravana was not there, Hanuman carried Sita back to Ram\". She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.\n\nHanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news.\n\n===''Yuddha kanda''===\n\n[[File:Battle at Lanka, Ramayana, Udaipur, 1649-53.jpg|thumb|The ''Battle at Lanka, Ramyana'' by [[Sahibdin]].

Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother [[Vibhishana]]. The apes named [[Nala]] and [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] construct a floating bridge (known as [[Adam's Bridge|Rama Setu]])<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son [[Indrajit]] hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana, who is badly wounded. So Hanuman assumes a gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching Mount Sumeru, Hanuman was unable to identify the herb that could cure Lakshmana and so decided to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Eventually, the war ends when Rama kills Ravana. Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.\n\nOn meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity, as he wants to get rid of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]], lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her innocence. The episode of ''Agni Pariksha'' varies in the versions of Ramayana by Valmiki and [[Tulsidas]]. In [[Tulsidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanas]], Sita was under the protection of Agni (see [[Maya Sita|Maya Sita]]) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.\n\n=== Uttara kanda ===\nUttara kanda is the last book of Ramayana. It depicts Ram's reign of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], birth of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Luv]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]] and last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called 'Ram-rajya' (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled and satisfied). But as time passes, spies start getting rumours that people are questioning Sita's purity as she stayed in the home of another man for a year without her husband. The common folk start gossiping about Sita and question Ram's decision to make her Queen. Rama is extremely distraught on hearing the news, but finally tells Lakshmana that \"Purity of the Queen of Ayodhya has to be above any gossip and rumour. Take Sita to a forest outside Ayodhya and leave her there. Also tell her not to identify herself as the Queen of Ayodhya as that would be an insult to our forefathers\". Lakshmana reluctantly drops Sita in a forest for another exile.\n\nSita finds refuge in Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashRama, where she gives birth to twin boys, Luv and Kush. [[Shambuka]], a [[shudra]] ascetic, is slain by Rama for attempting to perform penance. This act of Shambuka is perceived by Rama as an act in violation of [[dharma]] as he believes that the bad [[karma]], resulting from this act, caused the death of a [[Brahmin]]'s son in his kingdom.<ref>Government of Maharashtra, ''Nasik District Gazeteer: History - Ancient Period'' {{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107163101/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }} (text credited to Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. V.

Luv and Kusha capture the horse (sign of the yajna) and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya which come to protect the horse. Later on, both the brothers defeat [[Lakshmana]], Bharat, Shatrughan and other warriors and take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally Rama himself arrives and defeats the 2 mighty brothers. Valmiki updates Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's sacrifice to the common folks. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya but face many difficulties while convincing the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task . At one point of time, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama realises that Luv and Kush are his own sons. Again complicit Nagarsen (One of the primaries who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenged Sita's character and asked her to prove her purity. Sita is overflown with emotions and decides to go back to the mother earth from where she emerged. She prays to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoomidevi]] (Goddess of Earth), the ground breaks into half and closes after Sita vanishes into it. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally takes samadhi into River [[Sarayu]] along with his 3 brothers and leaves the world. He goes back to [[Vaikuntha|Vaikunth]] in his [[Vishnu]] form.\n\n==Versions==\n\n{{see also|Versions of Ramayana}}\n\n[[File:Wat phra keaw ramayana fresco.jpg|thumb|right|The epic story of ''Ramyana'' was adopted by several cultures across Asia.

[[Prambanan]] Trimurti temple near [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\n\nAs in many oral epics, multiple versions of the ''Ramayana'' survive. In particular, the ''Ramayana'' related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on ''Ramayana'' in [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Maldives]].\n\n===India===\nThere are diverse regional versions of the ''Ramayana'' written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the 12th century, [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] wrote [[Ramavataram]], known popularly as [[Kambaramayanam]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], but references to [[Ramayana in Tamil literature|Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature]] as early as 300 BC. A [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]], was written by [[Gona Budda Reddy]] in the 14th century. The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the early 14th century [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' inspired [[Sri Ramacharit Manas]] by [[Tulsidas]] in 1576, an epic [[Awadhi]] (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of [[bhakti]]; it is an acknowledged masterpiece of India, popularly known as ''Tulsi-krita Ramayana''. [[Gujarat]]i poet Premanand wrote a version of the ''Ramayana'' in the 17th century. Other versions include [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version by [[Krittibas Ojha]] in the 15th century; [[Vilanka Ramayana]] by 15th century poet [[Sarala Dasa]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=1 January 2006|isbn=9780816075645|first=Constance|last=Jones|first2=James D.|last2=Ryan}}</ref> and ''[[Dandi Ramayana]]'' (also known as ''[[Jagamohana Ramayana]]'') by 16th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in [[Odia language|Odia]]; a Torave Ramayana in [[Kannada]] by 16th-century poet Narahari; [[Adhyathmaramayanam]], a [[Malayalam]] version by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] in the 16th century; in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Sridhara in the 18th century; in [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]'s [[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]] in [[Kannada]].\n\nThere is a sub-plot to the ''Ramayana'', prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of [[Ahiravan]] and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess [[Kali]]. [[Adbhuta Ramayana]] is a version that is obscure but also attributed to [[Valmiki]] \u2013 intended as a supplementary to the original [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth \u2013 in this case to [[Ravana]]'s wife, [[Mandodari]] as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in her [[Mahakali]] form.\n\n====Early references in Tamil literature====\n{{main|Ramayana in Tamil literature}}\nEven before [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] wrote the [[Ramavataram]] in Tamil in the 12th century AD, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era.

Rama (called R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a (Lakkha\u1e47a) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha.  Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile. After nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkha\u1e47a and Sita returned; R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of S\u012bt\u0101.There is no Ravan in this version i.e. no Ram-ravan war.\n\nIn the explanatory commentary on J\u0101taka, R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita is said to have been a previous incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and Sita an incarnation of [[Yasodhar\u0101]].\n\nBut, [[Ravana]] appears in other Buddhist literature, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].\n\n====Jain version====\n\n{{main|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Jain]] versions of the ''Ramayana'' can be found in the various [[Jain agama (disambiguation)|Jain agama]]s like Ravisena's [[Padma Purana|Padmapurana]] (story of Padmaja and [[Rama]], Padmaja being the name of [[Sita]]), [[Hemacandra]]'s [[Salakapurusa|Trisastisalakapurusa charitra]] (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's ''Vasudevahindi'' and ''Uttarapurana'' by Gunabhadara. According to [[Jain cosmology]], every [[Kalachakra (Jainism)|half time cycle]] has nine sets of [[Balarama]], [[Vasudeva]] and prativasudeva. Rama, [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] are the eighth [[Balarama|baladeva]], [[vasudeva]] and [[prativasudeva]] respectively. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-[[chakravartin]]s. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''jinacharitra'' (lives of jinas) by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] (3d\u20134th century BCE).\n\nIn the Jain epic of ''Ramayana'', it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Soul in his last life, is unwilling to kill.<ref name=\"A.K\">{{cite book|last1=Ramanujan|first1=A.K|title=The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|page=145|edition=4. impr.|url=http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf}}</ref> Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana.<ref name=\"A.K\"/> In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] and attains [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|Hell]]. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to [[Jain texts]], Ravana will be the future [[Tirthankara]] (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.\n\nThe Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's ''Ramayana''. Dasharatha, the king of Saketa had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Ram's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama. Furthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven. Rama, after lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains [[Kevala Jnana]] omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the [[Naraka (Jainism)|fourth hell]], will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his [[Ganadhara]].\n\n====Sikh version====\n\nIn [[Guru Granth Sahib]], there is a description of two types of ''Ramayana''. One is a spiritual ''Ramayana'' which is the actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravana is ego, Sita is ''budhi'' (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is ''mann'' (attention, mind). Guru Granth Sahib also believes in the existence of [[Dashavatara]] who were kings of their times which tried their best to restore order to the world. King Rama (Ramchandra) was one of those who is not covered in Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Granth Sahib states:\n:\u0a39\u0a41\u0a15\u0a2e\u0a3f \u0a09\u0a2a\u0a3e\u0a0f \u0a26\u0a38 \u0a05\u0a09\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e\u0965\n:\u0939\u0941\u0915\u092e\u093f \u0909\u092a\u093e\u090f \u0926\u0938 \u0905\u0909\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0965\n:By [[hukam]] (supreme command), he created his ten incarnations\nThis version of the ''Ramayana'' was written by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], which is part of [[Dasam Granth]].\n\nHe also said that the almighty, invisible, all prevailing God created great numbers of Indras, Moons and Suns, Deities, Demons and sages, and also numerous saints and Brahmanas (enlightened people). But they too were caught in the noose of death (Kaal) ([[transmigration of the soul]]). This is similar to the explanation in [[Bhagavad Gita]] which is part of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref>[https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-11-32/ Bhagavad Gita 11.32]</ref>\n\n===Nepal===\n\nBesides being the site of discovery of the oldest surviving manuscript of the ''Ramayana'', Nepal gave rise to two regional variants in mid 19th \u2013 early 20th century. One, written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]], is considered the first epic of [[Nepali language]], while the other, written by [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]] was a foundational influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].\n\n[[Bhanubhakta Ramayana|Ramayana]] written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]] is one of the most popular verses in Nepal. The popularization of the ''Ramayana'' and its tale, originally written in [[Sanskrit Language]] was greatly enhanced by the work of Bhanubhakta. Mainly because of his writing of Nepali Ramayana, Bhanubhakta is also called ''Aadi Kavi'' or ''The Pioneering Poet''.\n\n===Southeast Asian===\n\n====Cambodia====\n\n[[File:Sita Ravana Cambodia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cambodian classical dancers as Sita and Ravana, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh (c. 1920s)]]\nThe Cambodian version of the ''Ramayana'', [[Reamker]] ({{lang-km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178a\u17b7\u17cd}} - ''Glory of Ram''), is the most famous story of Khmer literature since the [[Kingdom of Funan]] era. It adapts the Hindu concepts to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. The Reamker has several differences from the original ''Ramayana'', including scenes not included in the original and emphasis on [[Hanuman]] and [[Sovanna Maccha]], a retelling which influences the Thai and Lao versions. Reamker in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, such as sculpture, [[Khmer classical dance]], [[Theatre of Cambodia|theatre]] known as ''lakhorn luang'' (the foundation of the royal ballet), poetry and the mural and bas-reliefs seen at the [[Silver Pagoda]] and [[Angkor Wat]].\n\n====Indonesia====\n\n[[File:Ramayana Java.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Lakshmana]], Rama and Sita during their exile in [[Dandaka Forest]] depicted in [[Javanese dance]]]]\nThere are several Indonesian adaptations of Ramayana, including the Javanese ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Ramayana Kakawin Vol. 1 | work=archive.org | url=https://archive.org/details/RamayanaKakawinVol.1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b0274d0f-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad|title=The Kakawin Ramayana -- an old Javanese rendering of the  \u2026|website=www.nas.gov.sg|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> and Balinese ''Ramakavaca''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DN4xDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA277&lpg=PA277&dq=ramakavaca+Bali&source=bl&ots=0D7IBVmozt&sig=rVa66uSls2okxDlH5v_BEINcceg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioxueFvYvYAhUEmJQKHWGNBH8Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=ramakavaca%20Bali&f=false|title=ABC of Hinduism|last=Bhalla|first=Prem P.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Educreation Publishing|page=277|language=en}}</ref> The first half of ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]'' is similar to the original Sanskrit version, while the latter half is very different.

Each year, many devout pilgrims trace their journey through India and Nepal, halting at each of the holy sites along the way.

It follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest by his father King [[Dasharatha]], on request of his step-mother [[Kaikeyi]]. His travels across forests in India with his wife [[Sita]] and brother [[Lakshmana]], the kidnapping of his wife by [[Ravana]], the great king of [[Lanka]], resulting in a war with him, and Ram's eventual return to [[Ayodhya]] to be crowned king. This is the culmination point of the epic. In another version of Ramayana Sita is Ravana\u2019s daughter. <ref>http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190902-how-indias-ancient-myths-are-being-rewritten</ref>\n\nThere have been many attempts to unravel the epic's historical growth and compositional layers; various recent scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE, with later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.<ref name=\"Brockington1998\">{{cite book|author=J.

It consists of nearly 24,000 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] (mostly set in the [[Shloka]]/[[Anustubh]] meter), divided into seven Kand's (adi kand, ayodhya kand, aranya kand, kishkindhya kand, sundara kand, lanka kanda and uttara kand) and about 500 sargas (chapters). In [[Hindu]] tradition, it is considered to be the ''adi-kavya'' (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal husband and the ideal king. ''Ramayana'' was an important influence on later [[Sanskrit]] poetry and Hindu life and culture. Like ''Mahabharata'', ''Ramayana'' presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative [[allegory]], interspersing philosophical and ethical elements. The characters [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Hanuman]],  and [[Ravana]] are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the [[South Asian]] nations of [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[South-East Asian]] countries of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThere are many [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of ''Ramayana'']] in Indian languages, besides Buddhist, Sikh, and [[Rama in Jainism|Jain]] adaptations. There are also [[Cambodia]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Philippines|Filipino]], [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Laos|Lao]], [[Myanmar|Burmese]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the tale.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Ramayana'' means \"Rama\" + \"Aayana\" , where as Rama is name of Lord or God and Aayana means Path or Way. The literal meaning of the name is \"the journey of R\u0101ma\" or \"the career of R\u0101ma\" or in other words path or way taken or chosen by Rama during the human life cycle form at earth, during [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga]] [[Hindu units of time|(869000 years ago)]] in Jambudweep(Java Plum)/Aryavart/India.<ref>Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland Goldman, 'R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a', in ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', ed. by Knut A.

The definition of ''itih\u0101sa'' is a narrative of past events (''pur\u0101v\u1e5btta'') which includes teachings on [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|the goals of human life]]. According to Hindu tradition, ''Ramayana'' takes place during a period of time known as [[Treta Yuga]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Wzg6wFJ5xwC&pg=PR21&dq=RAMAYANA+TOOK+PLACE+IN+TRETA+YUG&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=RAMAYANA%20TOOK%20PLACE%20IN%20TRETA%20YUG&f=false Ramayana By William Buck]</ref>\n\nIn its extant form, Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' is an epic poem of some 24,000 verses. The text survives in several thousand partial and complete manuscripts, the oldest of which is a [[palm-leaf manuscript]] found in Nepal and dated to the 11th century CE. A Times of India report dated 18 December 2015 informs about the discovery of a 6th-century manuscript of the ''Ramayana'' at the Asiatic Society library, [[Kolkata]].<ref name=\"Dasa Griba Rakshash Charitram Vadha\">{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee Pandey|first1=Jhimli|title=6th-century Ramayana found in Kolkata, stuns scholars|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/6th-century-Ramayana-found-in-Kolkata-stuns-scholars/articleshow/50227724.cms|accessdate=20 December 2015|agency=TNN|newspaper=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|date=18 Dec 2015 <!-- 09.08AM IST --> }}</ref> The ''Ramayana'' text has several regional renderings, recensions and sub recensions. Textual scholar [[Robert P. Goldman]] differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] writes that \"the ''Ramayana'', like the ''Mahabharata'', is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind.\"\n\nThere has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes (Bala kanda and Uttara kand) of Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' were composed by the original author. Most Hindus still believe they are integral parts of the book, in spite of some style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the book.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nRetellings include [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]]'s ''[[Ramavataram]]'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (c. 11th\u201312th century), [[Gona Budda Reddy]]'s ''Ramayanam'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (c. 13th century), [[Madhava Kandali]]'s [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] (c. 14th century), [[Krittibas Ojha]]'s [[Krittivasi Ramayan]] (also known as ''Shri Ram Panchali'') in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (c. 15th century), [[Sarala Das]]' [[Vilanka Ramayana]] (c. 15th century)<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The History of Medieval Vaishnavism in Orissa|author=Mukherjee, P.|date=1981|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120602298|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7LFzfbhmJcMC&pg=PA74|page=74|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Living Thoughts of the Ramayana|date=2002|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=9788179920022|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BMyxwk5g3NEC&pg=PT7|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=A Critical Inventory of R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a Studies in the World: Foreign languages|author1=Krishnamoorthy, K.|author2=Mukhopadhyay, S.|author3=Sahitya Akademi|date=1991|publisher=Sahitya Akademi in collaboration with Union Academique Internationale, Bruxelles|isbn=9788172015077|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NgeTtWkD0VkC&pg=PR27|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|title=R\u0101makath\u0101 and Other Essays|author1=Bulcke, C.|author2=Pras\u0101da, D.|date=2010|publisher=Vani Prakashan|isbn=9789350001073|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cvE4wF-cfX0C&pg=PA116|page=116|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref> and Balarama Dasa's ''Dandi Ramayana'' (also known as the ''Jagamohan Ramayana'') (c. 16th century) both in [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Sant (religion)|sant]] [[Eknath]]'s [[Bhavarth Ramayan]] (c. 16th century) in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tulsidas]]' [[Ramcharitamanas]] (c. 16th century) in [[Awadhi]] (which is an eastern form of [[Hindi]]) and [[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan]]'s [[Adhyathmaramayanam]] in [[Malayalam]].\n\n==Period==\n\n[[File:Avatars.jpg|thumb|Rama (left third from top) depicted in the [[Dashavatara]], the ten avatars of [[Vishnu]]. Painting from [[Jaipur]], now at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]\n\nIn terms of narrative time, the action of the ''Ramayana'' predates the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. However, the general cultural background of the ''Ramayana'' is one of the post-[[urbanization]] periods of the eastern part of north [[India]], while the ''Mahabharata'' reflects the Kuru areas west of this, from the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] to the late [[Vedas|Vedic]] period.\n\nBy tradition, the text belongs to the [[Treta Yuga]], second of the four eons ([[yuga]]) of [[Hindu]] chronology. [[Rama]] is said to have been born in the [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga (869000 years ago)]] to king [[Dasharatha]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].\n\nThe names of the characters (Rama, Sita, Dasharatha, [[Janaka]], [[Vashista]], [[Vishwamitra]]) are all known only in the late [[Vedic]] literature.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, a king named Janaka appears in a lengthy dialogue in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad '']] with no reference to Rama or the ''Ramayana''.<ref>''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ''4:1:1; trans.

According to the modern [[academic]] view, [[Vishnu]], who, according to [[Bala Kanda]], was incarnated as [[Rama]], first came into prominence with the epics themselves and further, during the puranic period of the later 1st millennium CE. Also, in the epic Mahabharata, there is a version of the ''Ramayana'' known as ''Ramopakhyana''. This version is depicted as a narration to [[Yudhishthira]].\n\nBooks two to six form the oldest portion of the epic, while the first and last books (Bala kanda and Uttara kand, respectively) are later additions: style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the epic have led scholars since Hermann Jacobi to the present toward this consensus.<ref>Ajay K.

He has three queens, [[Kausalya]], [[Kaikeyi]] and [[Sumitra]], and four sons: [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], and twins [[Lakshmana]], Shatrughna and Rama. Once, Kaikeyi saved Dasaratha in a war and as a reward, she got the privilege from Dasaratha to fulfil two of her wishes at any time of her lifetime. She made use of the opportunity and forced Dasharatha to make their son Bharata crown prince and send Rama into exile for 14 years. Dasharatha dies heartbroken after Rama goes into exile.\n* '''[[Rama]]''' is the main character of the tale. Portrayed as the seventh avatar of god [[Vishnu]], he is the eldest and favourite son of [[Dasharatha]], the king of Ayodhya and his Chief Queen, [[Kausalya]]. He is portrayed as the epitome of virtue. Dasharatha is forced by Kaikeyi to command Rama to relinquish his right to the throne for fourteen years and go into exile. Rama kills the evil demon Ravana, who abducted his wife Sita, and later returns to Ayodhya to form an ideal state.\n[[File:Rama and monkey chiefs.jpg|thumb|right|Rama and the monkey chiefs]]\n* '''[[Sita]]''' (Vaidehi) is another of the tale's protagonists.She was the blood of sages who sacrificed their lives to develop the powerful force to get rid of earth from demons. This blood was collected in a pot and was buried in Earth, so She is called the daughter of Mother Earth, adopted by King Janaka, and Rama's beloved wife. Rama went to [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush (bow) while trying to tie a knot to it in a competition organized by King Janaka of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]]. The competition was to find the most suitable husband for Sita and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the avatara of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue. She follows her husband into exile and is abducted by the Lanka's king Ravana. She is imprisoned on the island of [[Lanka]], until Rama rescues her by defeating Ravana. Later, she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]].\n* '''[[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]''' is the son of Dasharatha and Queen Kaikeyi. when he learns that his mother Kaikeyi has forced Rama into exile and caused Dasharatha to die brokenhearted, he storms out of the palace and goes in search of Rama in the forest. When Rama refuses to return from his exile to assume the throne, Bharata obtains Ram's sandals and places them on the throne as a gesture that Rama is the true king. Bharata then rules Ayodhya as the regent of Rama for the next fourteen years, staying outside the city of Ayodhya. He was married to [[Mandavi]].\n* '''[[Lakshmana]]''' (Saumitra) is a younger brother of Rama, who chose to go into exile with him. He is the son of King Dasharatha and Queen Sumitra and twin of Shatrughna. Lakshmana is portrayed as an avatar of [[Shesha]], the [[n\u0101ga]] associated with the god Vishnu. He spends his time protecting Sita and Rama, during which time he fights the demoness [[Shurpanakha]]. He is forced to leave Sita, who was deceived by the demon [[Maricha]] into believing that Rama was in trouble. Sita is abducted by Ravana upon his leaving her. He was married to Sita's younger sister [[Urmila]].\n* '''[[Shatrughna]]''' (Ripudaman: Killer of enemies) is a son of Dasharatha and his third wife Queen Sumitra. He is the youngest brother of Rama and also the twin brother of Lakshmana.

He is believed to live until our modern world.\n* '''[[Sugriva]]''', a vanara king who helped Rama regain Sita from Ravana. He had an agreement with Rama through which Vali \u2013 Sugriva's brother and king of Kishkindha \u2013 would be killed by Rama in exchange for Sugriva's help in finding Sita. Sugriva ultimately ascends the throne of Kishkindha after the slaying of Vali and fulfills his promise by putting the Vanara forces at Ram's disposal.

Angada and Tara are instrumental in reconciling [[Rama]] and his brother, [[Lakshmana]], with [[Sugriva]] after Sugriva fails to fulfill his promise to help Rama find and rescue his wife. Together they are able to convince Sugriva to honour his pledge to Rama instead of spending his time carousing and drinking.\n\n;Riksha\n* '''[[Jambavan]]/Jamvanta''' is known as Riksharaj (King of the Rikshas).

Rama and Sita, Lakshmana and Urmila, Bharata and Mandavi and Shatrughna with Shrutakirti.]]\n\nThis \"Sarga\" (section) details the stories of Rama's childhood and events related the time-frame. Dasharatha was the king of Ayodhya. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. He was childless for a long time and anxious to produce an heir, so he performs a fire sacrifice known as ''putra-kameshti yajna''. As a consequence, Rama was first born to Kaushalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born to Sumitra. These sons are endowed, to various degrees, with the essence of the Supreme Trinity Entity [[Vishnu]]; Vishnu had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon [[Ravana]], who was oppressing the gods, and who could only be destroyed by a mortal. The boys were reared as the princes of the realm, receiving instructions from the scriptures and in warfare from Vashistha. When Rama was 16 years old, sage Vishwamitra comes to the court of Dasharatha in search of help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses Rama, who is followed by Lakshmana, his constant companion throughout the story. Rama and Lakshmana receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vishwamitra and proceed to destroy the demons: Tadka and many more.\n\n[[Janaka]] was the king of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]. One day, a female child was found in the field by the king in the deep furrow dug by his plough. Overwhelmed with joy, the king regarded the child as a \"miraculous gift of god\". The child was named Sita, the Sanskrit word for furrow. Sita grew up to be a girl of unparalleled beauty and charm. The king had decided that who ever could lift and wield the heavy bow, presented to his ancestors by [[Shiva]], could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string, it got broken.<ref>{{cite book|title=CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.|publisher=sacredtexts.com|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry067.htm|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> Marriages were arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka. Rama gets married to Sita, [[Lakshmana]] to [[Urmila]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] to [[Mandavi]] and [[Shatrughna]] to [[Shrutakirti]]. The weddings were celebrated with great festivity in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and the marriage party returns to Ayodhya.\n\n===''Ayodhya kanda''===\n[[File:Ayodhya Nagri.jpg|thumb|285px|Gold carving depiction of the legendary [[Ayodhya]] at the [[Ajmer Jain temple]].]]\nAfter Rama and Sita have been married for twelve years, an elderly Dasharatha expresses his desire to crown Rama, to which the Kosala assembly and his subjects express their support. On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyi \u2013 her jealousy aroused by [[Manthara]], a wicked maidservant \u2013 claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterises him throughout the story. He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, \"the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.\" After Ram's departure, King Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule. But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile.\n[[File:Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.</center>]]\n\n===''Aranya kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Aranya Kanda}}\n\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ravana]] fights [[Jatayu]] as he carries off the kidnapped Sita.

At the [[Panchavati]] forest they are visited by a [[rakshasi]] named [[Shurpanakha]], sister of Ravana. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill Sita. Lakshmana stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and Dushan organise an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his raskshasas.\n\nWhen the news of these events reach Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the ''rakshasa'' [[Maricha]]. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Rama, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade Sita from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time, Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow Ram's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshman's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline, the [[Lakshmana rekha|Lakshmana rekha]], around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. With the coast finally clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, Sita is tricked into leaving the rekha and is then forcibly carried away by Ravana.<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

At Lanka, Sita is kept under the guard of ''rakshasis''. Ravana asks Sita to marry him, but she refuses, being eternally devoted to Rama. Meanwhile, Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction from Jatayu and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet [[Kabandha]] and the ascetic [[Shabari]], who direct them towards Sugriva and Hanuman.\n\n===''Kishkindha kanda''===\n\n[[File:Stone bas relief at Banteay Srei in Cambodia.jpg|thumb|A stone bas-[[relief]] at Banteay Srei in [[Cambodia]] depicts the combat between [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and [[Sugriva]] (middle).

Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes and an adherent of [[Sugriva]], the banished pretender to the throne of Kishkindha. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] thus regaining the kingdom of Kishkindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita. However Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time in enjoying his powers. The clever former ape queen [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] (wife of Vali) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lakshmana from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from north, east and west. The southern search party under the leadership of [[Angada]] and Hanuman learns from a vulture named [[Sampati]] (elder brother of Jatayu), that Sita was taken to Lanka.\n\n===''Sundara kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Sundara Kanda}}\n[[File:Sita at ashokavana.jpg|thumb|right|Ravana is meeting Sita at Ashokavana. Hanuman is seen on the tree.]]\n\n''Sundara kand'' forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramyana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of [[Hanuman]]'s adventures. After learning about Sita, Hanuman [[shapeshifting|assumes]] a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way he meets with many challenges like facing a Gandharva kanya who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Mainakudu who offers Hanuman assistance and offers him rest. Hanuman refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for Sita.\n\nAfter entering into Lanka, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lanka. Hanuman fights with her and subjugates her in order to get into Lanka. In the process Lankini, who had an earlier vision/warning from the gods that the end of Lanka nears if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanuman explores the demons' kingdom and spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita, giving Ram's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Ram; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ramyana will not have significance if Hanuman carries her to Rama \u2013 \"When Rama is not there Ravana carried Sita forcibly and when Ravana was not there, Hanuman carried Sita back to Ram\". She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.\n\nHanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news.\n\n===''Yuddha kanda''===\n\n[[File:Battle at Lanka, Ramayana, Udaipur, 1649-53.jpg|thumb|The ''Battle at Lanka, Ramyana'' by [[Sahibdin]].

Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother [[Vibhishana]]. The apes named [[Nala]] and [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] construct a floating bridge (known as [[Adam's Bridge|Rama Setu]])<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son [[Indrajit]] hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana, who is badly wounded. So Hanuman assumes a gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching Mount Sumeru, Hanuman was unable to identify the herb that could cure Lakshmana and so decided to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Eventually, the war ends when Rama kills Ravana. Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.\n\nOn meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity, as he wants to get rid of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]], lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her innocence. The episode of ''Agni Pariksha'' varies in the versions of Ramayana by Valmiki and [[Tulsidas]]. In [[Tulsidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanas]], Sita was under the protection of Agni (see [[Maya Sita|Maya Sita]]) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.\n\n=== Uttara kanda ===\nUttara kanda is the last book of Ramayana. It depicts Ram's reign of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], birth of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Luv]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]] and last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called 'Ram-rajya' (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled and satisfied). But as time passes, spies start getting rumours that people are questioning Sita's purity as she stayed in the home of another man for a year without her husband. The common folk start gossiping about Sita and question Ram's decision to make her Queen. Rama is extremely distraught on hearing the news, but finally tells Lakshmana that \"Purity of the Queen of Ayodhya has to be above any gossip and rumour. Take Sita to a forest outside Ayodhya and leave her there. Also tell her not to identify herself as the Queen of Ayodhya as that would be an insult to our forefathers\". Lakshmana reluctantly drops Sita in a forest for another exile.\n\nSita finds refuge in Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashRama, where she gives birth to twin boys, Luv and Kush. [[Shambuka]], a [[shudra]] ascetic, is slain by Rama for attempting to perform penance. This act of Shambuka is perceived by Rama as an act in violation of [[dharma]] as he believes that the bad [[karma]], resulting from this act, caused the death of a [[Brahmin]]'s son in his kingdom.<ref>Government of Maharashtra, ''Nasik District Gazeteer: History - Ancient Period'' {{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107163101/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }} (text credited to Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. V.

Luv and Kusha capture the horse (sign of the yajna) and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya which come to protect the horse. Later on, both the brothers defeat [[Lakshmana]], Bharat, Shatrughan and other warriors and take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally Rama himself arrives and defeats the 2 mighty brothers. Valmiki updates Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's sacrifice to the common folks. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya but face many difficulties while convincing the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task . At one point of time, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama realises that Luv and Kush are his own sons. Again complicit Nagarsen (One of the primaries who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenged Sita's character and asked her to prove her purity. Sita is overflown with emotions and decides to go back to the mother earth from where she emerged. She prays to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoomidevi]] (Goddess of Earth), the ground breaks into half and closes after Sita vanishes into it. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally takes samadhi into River [[Sarayu]] along with his 3 brothers and leaves the world. He goes back to [[Vaikuntha|Vaikunth]] in his [[Vishnu]] form.\n\n==Versions==\n\n{{see also|Versions of Ramayana}}\n\n[[File:Wat phra keaw ramayana fresco.jpg|thumb|right|The epic story of ''Ramyana'' was adopted by several cultures across Asia.

[[Prambanan]] Trimurti temple near [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\n\nAs in many oral epics, multiple versions of the ''Ramayana'' survive. In particular, the ''Ramayana'' related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on ''Ramayana'' in [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Maldives]].\n\n===India===\nThere are diverse regional versions of the ''Ramayana'' written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the 12th century, [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] wrote [[Ramavataram]], known popularly as [[Kambaramayanam]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], but references to [[Ramayana in Tamil literature|Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature]] as early as 300 BC. A [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]], was written by [[Gona Budda Reddy]] in the 14th century. The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the early 14th century [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' inspired [[Sri Ramacharit Manas]] by [[Tulsidas]] in 1576, an epic [[Awadhi]] (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of [[bhakti]]; it is an acknowledged masterpiece of India, popularly known as ''Tulsi-krita Ramayana''. [[Gujarat]]i poet Premanand wrote a version of the ''Ramayana'' in the 17th century. Other versions include [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version by [[Krittibas Ojha]] in the 15th century; [[Vilanka Ramayana]] by 15th century poet [[Sarala Dasa]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=1 January 2006|isbn=9780816075645|first=Constance|last=Jones|first2=James D.|last2=Ryan}}</ref> and ''[[Dandi Ramayana]]'' (also known as ''[[Jagamohana Ramayana]]'') by 16th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in [[Odia language|Odia]]; a Torave Ramayana in [[Kannada]] by 16th-century poet Narahari; [[Adhyathmaramayanam]], a [[Malayalam]] version by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] in the 16th century; in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Sridhara in the 18th century; in [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]'s [[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]] in [[Kannada]].\n\nThere is a sub-plot to the ''Ramayana'', prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of [[Ahiravan]] and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess [[Kali]]. [[Adbhuta Ramayana]] is a version that is obscure but also attributed to [[Valmiki]] \u2013 intended as a supplementary to the original [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth \u2013 in this case to [[Ravana]]'s wife, [[Mandodari]] as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in her [[Mahakali]] form.\n\n====Early references in Tamil literature====\n{{main|Ramayana in Tamil literature}}\nEven before [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] wrote the [[Ramavataram]] in Tamil in the 12th century AD, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era.

Rama (called R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a (Lakkha\u1e47a) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha.  Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile. After nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkha\u1e47a and Sita returned; R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of S\u012bt\u0101.There is no Ravan in this version i.e. no Ram-ravan war.\n\nIn the explanatory commentary on J\u0101taka, R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita is said to have been a previous incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and Sita an incarnation of [[Yasodhar\u0101]].\n\nBut, [[Ravana]] appears in other Buddhist literature, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].\n\n====Jain version====\n\n{{main|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Jain]] versions of the ''Ramayana'' can be found in the various [[Jain agama (disambiguation)|Jain agama]]s like Ravisena's [[Padma Purana|Padmapurana]] (story of Padmaja and [[Rama]], Padmaja being the name of [[Sita]]), [[Hemacandra]]'s [[Salakapurusa|Trisastisalakapurusa charitra]] (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's ''Vasudevahindi'' and ''Uttarapurana'' by Gunabhadara. According to [[Jain cosmology]], every [[Kalachakra (Jainism)|half time cycle]] has nine sets of [[Balarama]], [[Vasudeva]] and prativasudeva. Rama, [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] are the eighth [[Balarama|baladeva]], [[vasudeva]] and [[prativasudeva]] respectively. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-[[chakravartin]]s. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''jinacharitra'' (lives of jinas) by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] (3d\u20134th century BCE).\n\nIn the Jain epic of ''Ramayana'', it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Soul in his last life, is unwilling to kill.<ref name=\"A.K\">{{cite book|last1=Ramanujan|first1=A.K|title=The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|page=145|edition=4. impr.|url=http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf}}</ref> Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana.<ref name=\"A.K\"/> In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] and attains [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|Hell]]. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to [[Jain texts]], Ravana will be the future [[Tirthankara]] (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.\n\nThe Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's ''Ramayana''. Dasharatha, the king of Saketa had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Ram's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama. Furthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven. Rama, after lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains [[Kevala Jnana]] omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the [[Naraka (Jainism)|fourth hell]], will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his [[Ganadhara]].\n\n====Sikh version====\n\nIn [[Guru Granth Sahib]], there is a description of two types of ''Ramayana''. One is a spiritual ''Ramayana'' which is the actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravana is ego, Sita is ''budhi'' (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is ''mann'' (attention, mind). Guru Granth Sahib also believes in the existence of [[Dashavatara]] who were kings of their times which tried their best to restore order to the world. King Rama (Ramchandra) was one of those who is not covered in Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Granth Sahib states:\n:\u0a39\u0a41\u0a15\u0a2e\u0a3f \u0a09\u0a2a\u0a3e\u0a0f \u0a26\u0a38 \u0a05\u0a09\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e\u0965\n:\u0939\u0941\u0915\u092e\u093f \u0909\u092a\u093e\u090f \u0926\u0938 \u0905\u0909\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0965\n:By [[hukam]] (supreme command), he created his ten incarnations\nThis version of the ''Ramayana'' was written by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], which is part of [[Dasam Granth]].\n\nHe also said that the almighty, invisible, all prevailing God created great numbers of Indras, Moons and Suns, Deities, Demons and sages, and also numerous saints and Brahmanas (enlightened people). But they too were caught in the noose of death (Kaal) ([[transmigration of the soul]]). This is similar to the explanation in [[Bhagavad Gita]] which is part of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref>[https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-11-32/ Bhagavad Gita 11.32]</ref>\n\n===Nepal===\n\nBesides being the site of discovery of the oldest surviving manuscript of the ''Ramayana'', Nepal gave rise to two regional variants in mid 19th \u2013 early 20th century. One, written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]], is considered the first epic of [[Nepali language]], while the other, written by [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]] was a foundational influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].\n\n[[Bhanubhakta Ramayana|Ramayana]] written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]] is one of the most popular verses in Nepal. The popularization of the ''Ramayana'' and its tale, originally written in [[Sanskrit Language]] was greatly enhanced by the work of Bhanubhakta. Mainly because of his writing of Nepali Ramayana, Bhanubhakta is also called ''Aadi Kavi'' or ''The Pioneering Poet''.\n\n===Southeast Asian===\n\n====Cambodia====\n\n[[File:Sita Ravana Cambodia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cambodian classical dancers as Sita and Ravana, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh (c. 1920s)]]\nThe Cambodian version of the ''Ramayana'', [[Reamker]] ({{lang-km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178a\u17b7\u17cd}} - ''Glory of Ram''), is the most famous story of Khmer literature since the [[Kingdom of Funan]] era.

He was a conventional [[court painter]] of portraits for three [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s in Vienna and Prague, also producing religious subjects and, among other things, a series of coloured drawings of exotic animals in the imperial [[menagerie]].

He was also the court decorator and costume designer. [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], who visited [[Vienna]] in 1570 and 1573, saw Arcimboldo's work and commissioned a copy of his ''The Four Seasons'' which incorporates his own monarchic [[symbol]]s.\n\nArcimboldo's conventional work, on traditional religious subjects, has fallen into oblivion, but his portraits of human heads made up of vegetables, plants, fruits, sea creatures and tree roots, were greatly admired by his contemporaries and remain a source of fascination today.\n\nAt a distance, his portraits looked like normal human portraits.  However, individual objects in each portrait were actually overlapped together to make various anatomical shapes of a human.  They were carefully constructed by his imagination.  The assembled objects in each portrait were not random: each was related by characterization.<ref>Maiorino, Giancarlo. ''The Portrait of Eccentricity: Arcimboldo and the Mannerist Grotesque.''  The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991. Print.</ref>  In the portrait now represented by several copies called ''The Librarian'', Arcimboldo used objects that signified the book culture at that time, such as the curtain that created individual study rooms in a library.  The animal tails, which became the beard of the portrait, were used as dusters.  By using everyday objects, the portraits were decoration and still-life paintings at the same time.<ref name=\"Elhard, K. C 2005\">Elhard, K.

In ''The Librarian'', although the painting might have appeared ridiculous, it also contained a criticism of wealthy people who collected books only to own them, rather than to read them.<ref name=\"Elhard, K.

It was during this last phase of his career that he produced the composite portrait of Rudolph II (see above), as well as his self-portrait as the Four Seasons.  His Italian contemporaries honored him with poetry and manuscripts celebrating his illustrious career.\n\nWhen the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army invaded [[Prague]] in 1648, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], many of Arcimboldo's paintings were taken from [[Rudolf II]]'s collection.\n\nHis works can be found in Vienna's [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] and the [[Ambras Castle|Habsburg Schloss Ambras]] in [[Innsbruck]]; the [[Louvre]] in Paris; as well as in numerous museums in Sweden. In Italy, his work is in [[Cremona]], [[Brescia]], and the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]].

A transitional period from 1520 to 1590, Mannerism adopted some artistic elements from the High Renaissance and influenced other elements in the Baroque period.

In ''The Spring'', the human portrait was composed of only various spring flowers and plants.  From the hat to the neck, every part of the portrait, even the lips and nose, was composed of flowers, while the body was composed of plants.  On the other hand, in ''The Winter'', the human was composed mostly of roots of trees.  Some leaves from evergreen trees and the branches of other trees became hair, while a straw mat became the costume of the human portrait.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1976, the Spanish sculptor [[Miguel Berrocal]] created the original bronze sculpture interlocking in 20 elements titled ''Opus 144 ARCIMBOLDO BIG'' as a homage to the Italian painter. This work was followed by the limited-edition sculpture in 1000 copies titled ''Opus 167 OMAGGIO AD ARCIMBOLDO (HOMAGE TO ARCIMBOLDO)'' of 1976\u20131979 consisting of 30 interlocking elements.\n\nThe works of Arcimboldo, especially his multiple [[image]]s and visual puns, were rediscovered in the early 20th century by [[Surrealist]] artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. The exhibition entitled \"The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century\u201d at the [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]] (1987) includes numerous 'double meaning' paintings. Arcimboldo's influence can also be seen in the work of [[Shigeo Fukuda]], [[Istv\u00e1n Orosz]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Vic Muniz]], and Sandro del Prete, as well as the films of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]].<ref>[Literature:''The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century''.

After the deaths of Arcimboldo and his patron\u2014the emperor Rudolph II\u2014the heritage of the artist was quickly forgotten, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. Only in 1885 did the art critic K. Kasati publish the monograph \"Giuseppe Arcimboldi, Milan Artist\" in which the main attention was given to Arcimboldi's role as a portraitist.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\">Werner Kriegeskorte (2000).

Gustav Hocke [de] drew parallels between Arcimboldo, [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and [[Max Ernst]]'s works. A volume monograph of B. Geyger and the book by F. Legrand and F. Xu were published in 1954.\n\nSince 1978 T. DaCosta Kaufmann was engaged in Arcimboldo's heritage, and wrote of the artist defending his dissertation \"Variations on an imperial subject\". His volume work, published in 2009, summed up the attitude of modern art critics towards Arcimboldo. An article published in 1980 by [[Roland Barthes]] was devoted to Arcimboldo's works.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\"/>\n\nArchimboldo's relation with surrealism was emphasized at landmark exhibitions in New York (\"Fantastic art, [[dada]], [[surrealism]]\", 1937) and in Venice (\"Arcimboldo's Effect: Evolution of the person in painting from the XVI century\", Palazzo Grassi, 1987) where Arcimboldo's allegories were presented.{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} The largest encyclopedic exhibition of Arcimboldo's heritage, where about 150 of his works were presented, including graphics, was held in Vienna in 2008.

In total about 20 of his pictures remain, but many more have been lost, according to mentions of his contemporaries and documents of the era. His cycles ''Four Elements'' and ''Seasons'', which the artist repeated with little changes, are most known. Some of his paintings include ''[[The Librarian (painting)|The Librarian]]'', ''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'', ''The Cook'', ''Cupbearer'', and other pictures.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000).

Taschen. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Attempts of interpretation begin with judgments of the cultural background and philosophy of the artist, however a consensus in this respect is not developed. B. Geyger, who for the first time raised these questions, relied mainly on judgments of contemporaries\u2014[[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo|Lomazzo]], [[:it:Gregorio Comanini|Comanini]], and [[:it:Paolo Morigia|Morigia]], who used the terms \"scherzi, grilli, and capricci\" (respectively, \"jokes\", \"whims\", \"caprices\").{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} Geyger's monograph is entitled: \"Comic pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". Geyger considered the works of the artist as inversion, when the ugliness seems beautiful, or, on the contrary, as the disgrace exceeding the beauty, entertaining the regal customer.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 32\u201334. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> A similar point of view was stated by [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], but he reduced works of the artist to the theory of language, believing that fundamentals of Arcimboldo's art philosophy is linguistic, because without creating new signs he confused them by mixing and combining elements that then played a role in the innovation of language.<ref>Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 335</ref> \n\n<blockquote>Arcimboldo speaks double language, at the same time obvious and obfuscatory; he creates \"mumbling\" and \"gibberish\", but these inventions remain quite rational. Generally, the only whim (bizarrerie) which isn't afforded by Arcimboldo \u2013 he doesn't create language absolutely unclear \u2026 his art not madly.<ref>Roland Barthes. ''Arcimboldo''. p. 338</ref></blockquote>Arcimboldo's classification as [[Mannerism|mannerist]] also belongs to the 20th century. Its justification contains in Gustav Rehn Hok's work ''The world as a Labyrinth'', published in 1957. Arcimboldo was born in the late Renaissance, and his first works were done in a traditional Renaissance manner. In Hok's opinion, during the Renaissance era the artist had to be first of all the talented handicraftsman who skillfully imitated the nature, as the idea of fine art was based on its studying. [[Mannerism]] differed from the [[Renaissance]] art in attraction to \"not naturalistic abstraction\". It was a continuation of artistic innovation in the late Middle Ages\u2014art embodying ideas. According to G. Hok, in consciousness there is concetto\u2014the concept of a picture or a picture of the concept, an intellectual prototype. Arcimboldo, making a start from concetti, painted metaphorical and fantastic pictures, extremely typical for manneristic art.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 56\u201358. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> In ''[[On Ugliness]]'', which was published under [[Umberto Eco]]'s edition, Arcimboldo also admitted belonging to manneristic tradition for which \"...the preference for aspiration to strange, extravagant and shapeless over expressional fine\" is peculiar.<ref>''Storia della bruttezza'' (Bompiani, 2007 \u2013 English translation: ''On Ugliness'', 2007). p.169</ref>\n\nIn the work ''Arcimboldo and archimboldesk'', F. Legrand and F. Xu tried to reconstruct philosophical views of the artist. They came to a conclusion that the views represented a kind of [[Platonism|Platonic pantheism]]. The key to reconstruction of Arcimboldo's outlook seemed to them to be in the symbolism of court celebrations staged by the artist, and in his allegorical series. According to Plato's dialogues \"[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]\", an immemorial god created the Universe from chaos by a combination of four elements \u2013 fire, water, air and the earth, as defines all-encompassing unity.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 58\u201360. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\nIn T. Dakosta Kauffman's works serious interpretation of heritage of Arcimboldo in the context of culture of the 16th century is carried out consistently. Kauffman in general was skeptical about attribution of works by Arcimboldo, and recognized as undoubted originals only four pictures, those with a signature of the artist. He based the interpretation on the text of the unpublished poem by J. Fonteo \"The picture ''Seasons'' and ''Four Elements'' of the imperial artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". According to Fonteo, the allegorical cycles of Arcimboldo transfer ideas of greatness of the emperor. The harmony in which fruits and animals are combined into images of the human head symbolizes harmony of the empire under the good board of the Habsburgs. Images of seasons and elements are always presented in profile, but thus ''Winter'' and ''Water'', ''Spring'' and ''Air'', ''Summer'' and ''Fire'', ''Fall'' and ''Earth'' are turned to each other. In each cycle symmetry is also observed: two heads look to the right, and two \u2014 to the left. Seasons alternate in an invariable order, symbolizing both constancy of the nature and eternity of board of the Habsburgs' house. The political symbolics also hints at it: at the image of ''Air'' there are Habsburg symbols \u2014 a peacock and an eagle and ''Fire'' is decorated with a chain of the Award of the Golden Fleece, a great master of which by tradition was a head of a reigning dynasty. However it is made of flints and shod steel. Guns also point to the aggressive beginning. The Habsburg symbolics is present in the picture ''Earth'', where the lion's skin designates a heraldic sign of Bohemia. Pearls and corals similar to cervine horns in ''Water'' hint at the same. {{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=97\u2014101}}<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese.

He was also the court decorator and costume designer. [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], who visited [[Vienna]] in 1570 and 1573, saw Arcimboldo's work and commissioned a copy of his ''The Four Seasons'' which incorporates his own monarchic [[symbol]]s.\n\nArcimboldo's conventional work, on traditional religious subjects, has fallen into oblivion, but his portraits of human heads made up of vegetables, plants, fruits, sea creatures and tree roots, were greatly admired by his contemporaries and remain a source of fascination today.\n\nAt a distance, his portraits looked like normal human portraits.  However, individual objects in each portrait were actually overlapped together to make various anatomical shapes of a human.  They were carefully constructed by his imagination.

It was during this last phase of his career that he produced the composite portrait of Rudolph II (see above), as well as his self-portrait as the Four Seasons.  His Italian contemporaries honored him with poetry and manuscripts celebrating his illustrious career.\n\nWhen the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army invaded [[Prague]] in 1648, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], many of Arcimboldo's paintings were taken from [[Rudolf II]]'s collection.\n\nHis works can be found in Vienna's [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] and the [[Ambras Castle|Habsburg Schloss Ambras]] in [[Innsbruck]]; the [[Louvre]] in Paris; as well as in numerous museums in Sweden.

A transitional period from 1520 to 1590, Mannerism adopted some artistic elements from the High Renaissance and influenced other elements in the Baroque period.

In ''The Spring'', the human portrait was composed of only various spring flowers and plants.  From the hat to the neck, every part of the portrait, even the lips and nose, was composed of flowers, while the body was composed of plants.  On the other hand, in ''The Winter'', the human was composed mostly of roots of trees.  Some leaves from evergreen trees and the branches of other trees became hair, while a straw mat became the costume of the human portrait.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1976, the Spanish sculptor [[Miguel Berrocal]] created the original bronze sculpture interlocking in 20 elements titled ''Opus 144 ARCIMBOLDO BIG'' as a homage to the Italian painter. This work was followed by the limited-edition sculpture in 1000 copies titled ''Opus 167 OMAGGIO AD ARCIMBOLDO (HOMAGE TO ARCIMBOLDO)'' of 1976\u20131979 consisting of 30 interlocking elements.\n\nThe works of Arcimboldo, especially his multiple [[image]]s and visual puns, were rediscovered in the early 20th century by [[Surrealist]] artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. The exhibition entitled \"The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century\u201d at the [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]] (1987) includes numerous 'double meaning' paintings. Arcimboldo's influence can also be seen in the work of [[Shigeo Fukuda]], [[Istv\u00e1n Orosz]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Vic Muniz]], and Sandro del Prete, as well as the films of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]].<ref>[Literature:''The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century''.

After the deaths of Arcimboldo and his patron\u2014the emperor Rudolph II\u2014the heritage of the artist was quickly forgotten, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. Only in 1885 did the art critic K. Kasati publish the monograph \"Giuseppe Arcimboldi, Milan Artist\" in which the main attention was given to Arcimboldi's role as a portraitist.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\">Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 30. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[surrealism]] its theorists paid attention to the formal work of Arcimboldo, and in the first half of the 20th century many articles were devoted to his heritage. Gustav Hocke [de] drew parallels between Arcimboldo, [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and [[Max Ernst]]'s works. A volume monograph of B. Geyger and the book by F. Legrand and F. Xu were published in 1954.\n\nSince 1978 T. DaCosta Kaufmann was engaged in Arcimboldo's heritage, and wrote of the artist defending his dissertation \"Variations on an imperial subject\". His volume work, published in 2009, summed up the attitude of modern art critics towards Arcimboldo. An article published in 1980 by [[Roland Barthes]] was devoted to Arcimboldo's works.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\"/>\n\nArchimboldo's relation with surrealism was emphasized at landmark exhibitions in New York (\"Fantastic art, [[dada]], [[surrealism]]\", 1937) and in Venice (\"Arcimboldo's Effect: Evolution of the person in painting from the XVI century\", Palazzo Grassi, 1987) where Arcimboldo's allegories were presented.{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} The largest encyclopedic exhibition of Arcimboldo's heritage, where about 150 of his works were presented, including graphics, was held in Vienna in 2008. In spite of the fact that very few works of Arcimboldo are available in the art market, their auction cost is in the range of five to 10 million dollars. Experts note that it is very modest for an artist at such a level of popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/arts/design/17vogel.html?_r=0|title=Arcimboldo Work Bought in Time for Exhibition|author=Carol Vogel|work=The New York Times|date= September 16, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/16/AR2010091606901.html|title=Arcimboldo's 'Four Seasons' will join National Gallery of Art collection|author= Blake Gopnik|work=Washington Post|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref>\n\nArcimboldo's art heritage is badly identified, especially as it concerns his early works and pictures in traditional style. In total about 20 of his pictures remain, but many more have been lost, according to mentions of his contemporaries and documents of the era. His cycles ''Four Elements'' and ''Seasons'', which the artist repeated with little changes, are most known. Some of his paintings include ''[[The Librarian (painting)|The Librarian]]'', ''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'', ''The Cook'', ''Cupbearer'', and other pictures.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 16\u201420. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Arcimboldo's works are stored in the state museums and private collections of Italy (including [[Uffizi]] Gallery), France ([[Louvre]]), Austria, the Czech Republic, Sweden, and in the US.\n\n===Art interpretations===\nThe main object of modern art critics interpretation are the \"curious\" paintings of Arcimboldo whose works, according to V. Krigeskort, \"are absolutely unique\".<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Attempts of interpretation begin with judgments of the cultural background and philosophy of the artist, however a consensus in this respect is not developed. B. Geyger, who for the first time raised these questions, relied mainly on judgments of contemporaries\u2014[[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo|Lomazzo]], [[:it:Gregorio Comanini|Comanini]], and [[:it:Paolo Morigia|Morigia]], who used the terms \"scherzi, grilli, and capricci\" (respectively, \"jokes\", \"whims\", \"caprices\").{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} Geyger's monograph is entitled: \"Comic pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". Geyger considered the works of the artist as inversion, when the ugliness seems beautiful, or, on the contrary, as the disgrace exceeding the beauty, entertaining the regal customer.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 32\u201334. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> A similar point of view was stated by [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], but he reduced works of the artist to the theory of language, believing that fundamentals of Arcimboldo's art philosophy is linguistic, because without creating new signs he confused them by mixing and combining elements that then played a role in the innovation of language.<ref>Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 335</ref> \n\n<blockquote>Arcimboldo speaks double language, at the same time obvious and obfuscatory; he creates \"mumbling\" and \"gibberish\", but these inventions remain quite rational. Generally, the only whim (bizarrerie) which isn't afforded by Arcimboldo \u2013 he doesn't create language absolutely unclear \u2026 his art not madly.<ref>Roland Barthes. ''Arcimboldo''. p. 338</ref></blockquote>Arcimboldo's classification as [[Mannerism|mannerist]] also belongs to the 20th century. Its justification contains in Gustav Rehn Hok's work ''The world as a Labyrinth'', published in 1957. Arcimboldo was born in the late Renaissance, and his first works were done in a traditional Renaissance manner. In Hok's opinion, during the Renaissance era the artist had to be first of all the talented handicraftsman who skillfully imitated the nature, as the idea of fine art was based on its studying. [[Mannerism]] differed from the [[Renaissance]] art in attraction to \"not naturalistic abstraction\". It was a continuation of artistic innovation in the late Middle Ages\u2014art embodying ideas. According to G. Hok, in consciousness there is concetto\u2014the concept of a picture or a picture of the concept, an intellectual prototype. Arcimboldo, making a start from concetti, painted metaphorical and fantastic pictures, extremely typical for manneristic art.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 56\u201358. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> In ''[[On Ugliness]]'', which was published under [[Umberto Eco]]'s edition, Arcimboldo also admitted belonging to manneristic tradition for which \"...the preference for aspiration to strange, extravagant and shapeless over expressional fine\" is peculiar.<ref>''Storia della bruttezza'' (Bompiani, 2007 \u2013 English translation: ''On Ugliness'', 2007). p.169</ref>\n\nIn the work ''Arcimboldo and archimboldesk'', F. Legrand and F. Xu tried to reconstruct philosophical views of the artist. They came to a conclusion that the views represented a kind of [[Platonism|Platonic pantheism]]. The key to reconstruction of Arcimboldo's outlook seemed to them to be in the symbolism of court celebrations staged by the artist, and in his allegorical series. According to Plato's dialogues \"[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]\", an immemorial god created the Universe from chaos by a combination of four elements \u2013 fire, water, air and the earth, as defines all-encompassing unity.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 58\u201360. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\nIn T. Dakosta Kauffman's works serious interpretation of heritage of Arcimboldo in the context of culture of the 16th century is carried out consistently. Kauffman in general was skeptical about attribution of works by Arcimboldo, and recognized as undoubted originals only four pictures, those with a signature of the artist. He based the interpretation on the text of the unpublished poem by J. Fonteo \"The picture ''Seasons'' and ''Four Elements'' of the imperial artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". According to Fonteo, the allegorical cycles of Arcimboldo transfer ideas of greatness of the emperor. The harmony in which fruits and animals are combined into images of the human head symbolizes harmony of the empire under the good board of the Habsburgs. Images of seasons and elements are always presented in profile, but thus ''Winter'' and ''Water'', ''Spring'' and ''Air'', ''Summer'' and ''Fire'', ''Fall'' and ''Earth'' are turned to each other. In each cycle symmetry is also observed: two heads look to the right, and two \u2014 to the left. Seasons alternate in an invariable order, symbolizing both constancy of the nature and eternity of board of the Habsburgs' house. The political symbolics also hints at it: at the image of ''Air'' there are Habsburg symbols \u2014 a peacock and an eagle and ''Fire'' is decorated with a chain of the Award of the Golden Fleece, a great master of which by tradition was a head of a reigning dynasty. However it is made of flints and shod steel. Guns also point to the aggressive beginning. The Habsburg symbolics is present in the picture ''Earth'', where the lion's skin designates a heraldic sign of Bohemia. Pearls and corals similar to cervine horns in ''Water'' hint at the same. {{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=97\u2014101}}<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese.
