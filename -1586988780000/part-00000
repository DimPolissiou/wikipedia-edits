It can also be split to make sandwiches. Sizes, maize types, and added ingredients vary its preparation. It is similar in shape to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] ''[[gordita]]'' and the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] ''[[pupusa]]''.\n\n==Origins==\nThe ''arepa'' is a [[pre-Columbian]] dish from the area that is now [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]. Instruments used to make flour for the ''arepas'', and the clay slabs on which they were cooked, were often found at [[Archaeology of the Americas|archaeological sites in the area]]. Although it has not been specified in which country an ''arepa'' was cooked for the first time, it has been possible to define the oldest dates of the presence of maize in Colombia and in Venezuela. For example, In Colombia, the first record of the existence of corn dates from about 3,000 years ago, while in Venezuela the estimate is about 2,800 years ago. In other words, the creation of the ''arepa'' most likely happened almost simultaneously in both countries, but well before either territory became a country with demarcated borders.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-38698394 |title=''\u00bfDe d\u00f3nde es la arepa realmente: venezolana o colombiana?'' |last=Lovera |first=Patricia Sulbar\u00e1n |date=2017 |work=BBC Mundo |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThroughout its history, the ''arepa'' has stayed mainly unchanged from the ''arepas'' that pre-Columbian native peoples would have consumed, making the ''arepa'' one of the few pre-contact traditions that have remained popular in the years since [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Arepa, sabor y tradici\u00f3n del campo -ancient tradition.jpg|thumb|''Arepas'' being prepared]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe ''arepa'' is a flat, round, unleavened patty of soaked, ground kernels of maize, or\u2014more frequently nowadays\u2014maize meal or maize flour that can be grilled, baked, fried, boiled or steamed. The characteristics vary by color, flavor, size, and the food with which it may be stuffed, depending on the region. It can be topped or filled with meat, eggs, tomatoes, salad, cheese, shrimp, or fish depending on the meal.\n\n==Production==\nThe flour is mixed with [[water]] and [[salt]], and occasionally oil, butter, eggs, and/or milk. Because the flour is already cooked, the blend forms into patties easily. After being kneaded and formed, the patties are fried, grilled, or baked. This production of maize is unusual for not using the [[nixtamalization]] (alkali cooking) process to remove the pericarp of the kernels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bon Appetit {{!}} Recipes & Menu Ideas|url=https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/arepas |website=Bon Appetit |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |date=September 2014}}</ref> This makes ''arepa'' flour different from ''masa'' flour, which is used to make tortillas.<ref name=\"Blazes\">{{Cite web |url = http://southamericanfood.about.com/od/glossaryofterms/g/arepaflour.htm|title = Masarepa - Precooked Corn Flour for Making Arepas |date = |accessdate = July 8, 2015 |website = About Food |publisher = |last = Blazes |first = Marian}}</ref>\n\n''Arepa'' flour is specially prepared (cooked in water, then dried) for making ''arepas'' and other maize dough-based dishes, such as ''[[hallaca]]s'', ''[[bollo]]s'', ''[[tamale]]s'', ''[[empanada]]s'' and ''[[chicha]]''.

The ''arepas'' can be cooked in four different ways: roasted, baked, boiled and fried.\n\nAnother way to make ''arepas'' is using a Tosty Arepa, an appliance that, like precooked corn flour, revolutionized the way in which the ''arepas'' were prepared and reduced the preparation time. The Tosty Arepa is a creation of [[Sunbeam Products|The Oster Company]] of Venezuela, which dates back to 1989, has since been transformed into more modern and efficient models.\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey of the Venezuelan people, nearly 70 percent of the nation ate ''arepas'' on a regular basis.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |url=http://visionagropecuaria.com/venezolanos-consumen-125-kilos-menos-harina-maiz-precocida-al-ano/ |title=''Venezolanos consumen 12,5 kilos menos de harina de ma\u00edz precocida al a\u00f1o - Visi\u00f3n Agropecuaria'' |last=Agropecuaria |first=Vision |date=2016-11-22 |work=Visi\u00f3n Agropecuaria |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=es-ES}}</ref> It is common for Venezuelans to eat ''arepas'' throughout the day, both as snacks and as sides to meals, creating a culture where these [[Maize|corn]] products can be found almost everywhere.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/national-traditions/venezuelan-tradition1.htm |title=How Venezuelan Traditions Work |date=2011-07-25 |work=Traditional Venezuelan Food - How Venezuelan Traditions Work {{!}} HowStuffWorks |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=en}}</ref> The ''arepa'' is seen as a cornerstone of a [[Venezuelan cuisine|Venezuelan diet]], and in a good financial year, the average Venezuelan consumes about 30 kilos of the [[Cornmeal|corn flour]] used to make ''arepas''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Venezuelan arepas are commonly filled with a great variety of different fillings, from beef and [[avocado]] to yellow cheese, varying widely by the location of where they are sold and the ingredients that can be obtained.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Decrease in consumption due to food shortages====\nSince the [[Shortages in Venezuela|2015 food shortages]] began, the consumption of ''arepas'' has significantly decreased.<ref name=\":1\" /> These shortages have caused the citizens of Venezuela to be unable to get enough basic food supplies, including the corn flour used to make ''arepas''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/looters-target-venezuelan-food-stores-as-shortages-spark-frustration |title=Looters target Venezuelan food stores as shortages spark frustration |last=Reuters |date=2015-08-07 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The consumption of the corn flour per capita has decreased from 30 kilos per year in 2014 to 17.5 in 2016.<ref name=\":1\" /> These shortages have caused some to say that the ''arepa'' is dying in Venezuela.<ref name=\":0\" /> Venezuelan citizens who want to buy corn flour in order to make ''arepas'' must wait in line for hours to receive government price-regulated corn flour, or they must purchase for much more on the black market.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[Cachapa]]\n* [[List of maize dishes]]\n* [[List of breads]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/T0395E/T0395E07.htm Food and Agricultural Organization, United Nations.

It can also be split to make sandwiches. Sizes, maize types, and added ingredients vary its preparation. It is similar in shape to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] ''[[gordita]]'' and the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] ''[[pupusa]]''.\n\n==Origins==\nThe ''arepa'' is a [[pre-Columbian]] dish from the area that is now [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]. Instruments used to make flour for the ''arepas'', and the clay slabs on which they were cooked, were often found at [[Archaeology of the Americas|archaeological sites in the area]]. Although it has not been specified in which country an ''arepa'' was cooked for the first time, it has been possible to define the oldest dates of the presence of maize in Colombia and in Venezuela. For example, In Colombia, the first record of the existence of corn dates from about 3,000 years ago, while in Venezuela the estimate is about 2,800 years ago. In other words, the creation of the ''arepa'' most likely happened almost simultaneously in both countries, but well before either territory became a country with demarcated borders.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-38698394 |title=''\u00bfDe d\u00f3nde es la arepa realmente: venezolana o colombiana?'' |last=Lovera |first=Patricia Sulbar\u00e1n |date=2017 |work=BBC Mundo |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThroughout its history, the ''arepa'' has stayed mainly unchanged from the ''arepas'' that pre-Columbian native peoples would have consumed, making the ''arepa'' one of the few pre-contact traditions that have remained popular in the years since [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Arepa, sabor y tradici\u00f3n del campo -ancient tradition.jpg|thumb|''Arepas'' being prepared]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe ''arepa'' is a flat, round, unleavened patty of soaked, ground kernels of maize, or\u2014more frequently nowadays\u2014maize meal or maize flour that can be grilled, baked, fried, boiled or steamed. The characteristics vary by color, flavor, size, and the food with which it may be stuffed, depending on the region. It can be topped or filled with meat, eggs, tomatoes, salad, cheese, shrimp, or fish depending on the meal.\n\n==Production==\nThe flour is mixed with [[water]] and [[salt]], and occasionally oil, butter, eggs, and/or milk. Because the flour is already cooked, the blend forms into patties easily. After being kneaded and formed, the patties are fried, grilled, or baked. This production of maize is unusual for not using the [[nixtamalization]] (alkali cooking) process to remove the pericarp of the kernels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bon Appetit {{!}} Recipes & Menu Ideas|url=https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/arepas |website=Bon Appetit |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |date=September 2014}}</ref> This makes ''arepa'' flour different from ''masa'' flour, which is used to make tortillas.<ref name=\"Blazes\">{{Cite web |url = http://southamericanfood.about.com/od/glossaryofterms/g/arepaflour.htm|title = Masarepa - Precooked Corn Flour for Making Arepas |date = |accessdate = July 8, 2015 |website = About Food |publisher = |last = Blazes |first = Marian}}</ref>\n\n''Arepa'' flour is specially prepared (cooked in water, then dried) for making ''arepas'' and other maize dough-based dishes, such as ''[[hallaca]]s'', ''[[bollo]]s'', ''[[tamale]]s'', ''[[empanada]]s'' and ''[[chicha]]''.

Some of these brands are Juana, Demasa, CASA, Venezuela and ''Harina Producto Alimenticio Nacional'' (PAN, National Food Product Flour). The latter has become a generic name for all maize flours in the country given the phenomenon of [[genericide]].\n\nIn 1960, [[Empresas Polar]], under the slogan \"''\u00a1Se acab\u00f3 la piladera!''\" launched the PAN precooked corn flour, obtained due to the procedure developed by the Venezuelan mechanical engineer Luis Alberto Caballero Mej\u00edas, that represented an important alternative to avoid the long process of making ''arepas'' with a [[mortar and pestle]] (''pil\u00f3n''). The ''arepas'' can be cooked in four different ways: roasted, baked, boiled and fried.\n\nAnother way to make ''arepas'' is using a Tosty Arepa, an appliance that, like precooked corn flour, revolutionized the way in which the ''arepas'' were prepared and reduced the preparation time. The Tosty Arepa is a creation of [[Sunbeam Products|The Oster Company]] of Venezuela, which dates back to 1989, has since been transformed into more modern and efficient models.\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey of the Venezuelan people, nearly 70 percent of the nation ate ''arepas'' on a regular basis.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |url=http://visionagropecuaria.com/venezolanos-consumen-125-kilos-menos-harina-maiz-precocida-al-ano/ |title=''Venezolanos consumen 12,5 kilos menos de harina de ma\u00edz precocida al a\u00f1o - Visi\u00f3n Agropecuaria'' |last=Agropecuaria |first=Vision |date=2016-11-22 |work=Visi\u00f3n Agropecuaria |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=es-ES}}</ref> It is common for Venezuelans to eat ''arepas'' throughout the day, both as snacks and as sides to meals, creating a culture where these [[Maize|corn]] products can be found almost everywhere.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/national-traditions/venezuelan-tradition1.htm |title=How Venezuelan Traditions Work |date=2011-07-25 |work=Traditional Venezuelan Food - How Venezuelan Traditions Work {{!}} HowStuffWorks |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=en}}</ref> The ''arepa'' is seen as a cornerstone of a [[Venezuelan cuisine|Venezuelan diet]], and in a good financial year, the average Venezuelan consumes about 30 kilos of the [[Cornmeal|corn flour]] used to make ''arepas''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Venezuelan arepas are commonly filled with a great variety of different fillings, from beef and [[avocado]] to yellow cheese, varying widely by the location of where they are sold and the ingredients that can be obtained.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Decrease in consumption due to food shortages====\nSince the [[Shortages in Venezuela|2015 food shortages]] began, the consumption of ''arepas'' has significantly decreased.<ref name=\":1\" /> These shortages have caused the citizens of Venezuela to be unable to get enough basic food supplies, including the corn flour used to make ''arepas''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/looters-target-venezuelan-food-stores-as-shortages-spark-frustration |title=Looters target Venezuelan food stores as shortages spark frustration |last=Reuters |date=2015-08-07 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The consumption of the corn flour per capita has decreased from 30 kilos per year in 2014 to 17.5 in 2016.<ref name=\":1\" /> These shortages have caused some to say that the ''arepa'' is dying in Venezuela.<ref name=\":0\" /> Venezuelan citizens who want to buy corn flour in order to make ''arepas'' must wait in line for hours to receive government price-regulated corn flour, or they must purchase for much more on the black market.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[Cachapa]]\n* [[List of maize dishes]]\n* [[List of breads]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/T0395E/T0395E07.htm Food and Agricultural Organization, United Nations.

It is part of the [[American Mafia]] originating in [[South Side, Chicago]].\n\nThe Outfit rose to power in the 1920s under the control of [[Johnny Torrio]] and [[Al Capone]], and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for control of the distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition. Since then, the Outfit has been involved in a wide range of criminal activities, including loansharking, gambling, prostitution, extortion, political corruption, and murder. Capone was convicted of income tax evasion in 1931, and the Outfit was next run by [[Paul Ricca]]. He shared power with [[Tony Accardo]] from 1943 until his death in 1972; Accardo became the sole power in the Outfit upon Ricca's death and was one of the longest-sitting bosses of all time upon his death in the early 1990s.\n\nThe Outfit did not have a monopoly on organized crime in Chicago, but it was the most powerful, violent, and largest criminal organization in the Midwest. Its influence at its peak stretched as far as California and Florida. Higher law enforcement attention and general attrition has led to its gradual decline since the late 20th century. From 1997 to 2018, the Chicago Outfit was believed to be led by [[John DiFronzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsn.org/cc97.html |title=Who's Who in Chicago Outfit for 1997 ISPN-97-10-12 |publisher=Ipsn.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe early years of organized crime in Chicago, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were marked by the division of various [[street gang]]s controlling the South Side and North Side, as well as the [[Black Hand (blackmail)|Black Hand]] organizations of [[Little Italy, Chicago|Little Italy]].\n\n[[Big Jim Colosimo]] centralized control in the early 20th century. Colosimo was born in [[Calabria]], Italy, in 1878, immigrated to Chicago in 1895, where he established himself as a criminal. By 1909, with the help of bringing [[Johnny Torrio]] from New York to Chicago, he was successful enough that he was encroaching on the [[criminal activity]] of the Black Hand organization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Binder|first=John|title=The Chicago Outfit|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0738523267|page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"dr.com.tr\">{{cite web |title=When the Outfit Ran Chicago, Vol I:The \"Big Jim\" Colosimo Era |url=https://www.dr.com.tr/ekitap/when-the-outfit-ran-chicago-vol-i-the-big-jim-colosimo-era |website=D&R |accessdate=10 December 2018 |language=tr}}</ref>\n\n===Prohibition and Capone===\nIn 1919, Capone also left New York for Chicago at the invitation of Torrio. Capone began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where he contracted [[syphilis]]. Timely use of [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]] probably could have cured the infection, but he apparently never sought treatment.<ref>Get Capone: The Secret Plot That Captured America's Most Wanted, by Jonathan Eig. p17</ref>\n\nWhen [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] went into effect in 1920, Torrio pushed for the gang to enter into [[Rum-running|bootlegging]], but Colosimo stubbornly refused. In March 1920, Colosimo secured an uncontested divorce from his wife Victoria Moresco.<ref name=chicagodead>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-07-26-8702250077-story.html|title=THE VICE LORD WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH A CHOIR SINGER|publisher=chicagotribune.com|date=July 26, 1987}}</ref> A month later, he and singer Dale Winter eloped to [[West Baden Springs, Indiana]]. Upon their return, he bought a home on the South Side.<ref name=chicagodead/> On May 11, 1920, Torrio called and told Colosimo that a shipment was about to arrive at his restaurant.

With Capone taking the role of an actual businessman and partner of the owner, the Outfit had a legitimate way to source their money, which prevented incrimination and unnecessary attention from law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/nkazmers/organizedcrime2.html|title=Organized Crime- How it was changed by Prohibition|last=Hales|first=Taylor|date=January 4, 2018|website=University of Michigan|access-date=January 4, 2018}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nTorrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with Capone as his right-hand man. He was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller [[North Side Gang]] led by [[Dean O'Banion]] (also known as Dion O'Banion) was of mixed ethnicity, and it came under pressure from the Genna brothers who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that Torrio was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side, despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes.<ref>{{cite book |title= Capone: The Man and the Era|url= https://archive.org/details/caponemanera00berg|url-access= registration|last= Bergreen|first= Laurence|year= 1994|publisher= Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-684-82447-5|pages= [https://archive.org/details/caponemanera00berg/page/131 131\u2013132]}}</ref> In a fateful step, Torrio either arranged for or acquiesced to the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop on November 10, 1924. This placed [[Hymie Weiss]] at the head of the gang, backed by [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Bugs Moran]]. Weiss had been a close friend of O'Banion, and the North Siders made it a priority to get revenge on his killers.<ref>Bergreen, pp&nbsp;134\u2013135</ref><ref>Bergreen, p. 138</ref><ref name=\"myalcaponemuseum.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id89.htm|title=Hymie Weiss|website=Myalcaponemuseum.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1925, Capone was ambushed, leaving him shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, on January 24, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip with his wife Anna, when he was shot several times. After recovering, he effectively resigned and handed control to Capone, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection.<ref name = \"Paul Sann\">Paul Sann, ''The Lawless Decade: Bullets, Broads and Bathtub Gin'', Courier Corporation, 2012, p.111</ref> In turn, he was able to use more violence to increase revenue.

Geographically, this was the period when Outfit muscle extended to [[Milwaukee]] and [[Madison, Wisconsin]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and especially to Hollywood and other California cities, where The Outfit's extortion of labor unions gave it leverage over the [[motion picture industry]].\n\nIn the early 1940s, a handful of top Outfit leaders went to prison because they were found to be extorting [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] by controlling the unions that compose Hollywood's movie industry, and manipulating and misusing the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Central States]] [[Pension fund]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Binder|first=John|title=The Chicago Outfit|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0738523267|page=56}}</ref> \nIn 1943, the Outfit was caught red-handed shaking down the Hollywood movie industry. Ricca wanted Nitti to take the fall.  However, Nitti had found that he was [[claustrophobic]], years earlier while in jail for 18 months (for [[tax evasion]]), and he decided to end his life rather than face more imprisonment for extorting Hollywood. Ricca then became the boss in name as well as in fact, with enforcement chief [[Tony Accardo]] as underboss\u2014the start of a partnership that lasted for almost 30 years.  Around this time, the Outfit began bringing in members of the [[Forty-Two Gang]], a notoriously violent youth gang. Among them were [[Sam Giancana|Sam \"Momo\" Giancana]], [[Sam DeStefano|Sam \"Mad Sam\" DeStefano]], [[Felix Alderisio|Felix \"Milwaukee Phil\" Alderisio]], and [[Fiore Buccieri|Fiore \"Fifi\" Buccieri]].\n\nRicca was sent to prison later in 1943 for his part in The Outfit plot to control Hollywood. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, along with a number of other mobsters. Through the \"magic\" of political connections, the whole group of Outfit mobsters was released after three years, largely due to the efforts of Outfit \"fixer\" [[Murray Humphreys|Murray \"The Camel\" Humphreys]]. Ricca could not associate with mobsters as a condition of his parole.  Accardo nominally took power as boss, but actually shared power with Ricca, who continued behind the scenes as a senior consultant\u2014one of the few instances of shared power in organized crime.\n\nAccardo joined Ricca in semi-retirement in 1957 due to some \"[[surveillance|heat]]\" that he was getting from the IRS.  From then on, Ricca and Accardo allowed several others to nominally serve as boss, such as Giancana, Alderisio, [[Joey Aiuppa]], [[William Daddano|William \"Willie Potatoes\" Daddano]], and [[Jackie Cerone|Jackie \"the Lackey\" Cerone]]. Most of the front bosses originated from the Forty-Two Gang. However, no major business transactions took place without Ricca and Accardo's knowledge and approval, and certainly no \"[[contract killing|hits]].\"  By staying behind the scenes, Ricca and Accardo lasted far longer than Capone.  Ricca died in 1972, leaving Accardo as the sole power behind the scenes.\n\n====1960s\u20131990s====\n\nAlong with the voting allegations, the Outfit was involved in a [[Central Intelligence Agency]]\u2013Mafia [[collusion]] during Castro's overthrow of the Cuban government. In exchange for its help, the Outfit was to be given access to its former casinos if it helped overthrow [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Operation Mongoose]] or [[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Operation Family Jewels]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/27/usa.cuba |title=CIA conspired with mafia to kill Castro |last=Tisdall |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Tisdall |work=The Guardian |date=June 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> The Outfit failed in that endeavor and faced increasing indictments under the administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (JFK). The Outfit is the subject of [[Mafia and the Kennedy Assassination|some theories]] regarding the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination]] and that of JFK's brother [[Robert Kennedy]].\n\nThe Outfit reached the height of its power in the early 1960s. Accardo used the [[Teamsters]] pension fund, with the aid of [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Sidney Korshak]], and [[Jimmy Hoffa]], to engage in massive [[money laundering]] through the Outfit's casinos. The 1970s and 1980s were a hard time for the Outfit, as law enforcement continued to penetrate the organization, spurred by poll-watching politicians. [[Off-track betting]] reduced [[bookmaking]] profits, and illicit casinos withered under competition from legitimate casinos. Activities such as auto theft and professional [[sports betting]] did not replace the lost profits.\n\nThe Outfit controlled casinos in Las Vegas and \"[[Skimming (casinos)|skimmed]]\" millions of dollars over the course of several decades. Most recently, top mob figures have been found guilty of crimes dating back to as early as the mid-1960s. It has been rumored that the $2&nbsp;million skimmed from the casinos in the Court case of 1986 was used to build the Old Neighborhood Italian American Club, the founder of which was [[Angelo J. LaPietra|Angelo J. \"The Hook\" LaPietra]].\n\n[[Allen Dorfman]], a key figure in the Outfit's money embezzlement operations, was investigated by the Department of Justice. In 1982, the FBI wire-tapped Dorfman's personal and company phone lines and was able to gather the evidence needed to convict Dorfman and several of his associates on attempts to bribe a state senator to get rid of the trucking industry rates. If Dorfman succeeded, the Outfit would have seen a huge gain of profit. This was known as Operation Pendorf and was a huge blow to the Chicago crime syndicate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-31/news/9703310046_1_wiretaps-pension-fund-teamsters-union|title=Retiring FBI Agent Recalls Bugging Role in Teamsters Case|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-04-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOperation GAMBAT (GAMBling ATtorney) proved to be a crippling blow to the Outfit's tight grip on the Chicago political machine. [[Pat Marcy]], a made man in the Outfit, ran the city's [[Chicago City Council|First Ward]], which represented most of downtown Chicago. Marcy and company controlled the [[circuit courts]] from the 1950s until the late 1980s with the help of [[Alderman]] [[Fred Roti]] and Democratic Committeeman [[John D'Arco Sr.]] Together, the First Ward fixed cases involving everything from minor traffic violations to murder.\n\nAttorney and First Ward associate [[Robert Cooley (lawyer)|Robert Cooley]] was one of the lawyers who represented many mafiosi and associates in which cases were fixed. As a trusted man within the First Ward, Cooley was asked to \"take out\" a city police officer. Cooley was also an addicted gambler and in debt, so he approached the U.S. Justice Department's [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force]], declaring that he wanted to \"destroy Marcy and the First Ward\".\n\nCooley was soon in touch with the FBI and began cooperating as a federal informant. Through the years, he maintained close ties to Marcy and the big shots of the First Ward. He wore an electronic surveillance device, recording valuable conversations at the notorious \"First Ward Table\", located at \"Counselor's Row\" across the street from [[Chicago City Hall]]. The results in Operation Gambat (Gambling Attorney) were convictions of 24 corrupt judges, lawyers, and cops.\n\nAccardo died in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baumann|first=Edward|title=FORMER FBI AGENT BILL ROEMER TAKES A LOOK AT MOB BOSS TONY ACCARDO|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-29/entertainment/9511050426_1_william-roemer-joe-batters-johnny-torrio|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 29, 1995|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> In a measure of how successfully he had managed to stay out of the limelight, he never spent a day in jail (or only spent one day, depending on the source) despite an arrest record dating to 1922. Chicago's transition from Accardo to the next generation of Outfit bosses has been more of an administrative change than a power struggle, distinct from the way that organized crime leadership transitions take place in New York City.\n\n===21st century===\n\nHigher law enforcement investigations and general attrition led to the Outfit's gradual decline since the late 20th century. The Old Neighborhood Italian American Club is considered to be the hangout of Old Timers as they live out their golden years.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The Club's founder was [[Angelo J. LaPietra]] \"The Hook\", who was the main Council at the time of his death in 1999.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] launched ''[[Operation Family Secrets]]'',<ref>[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:0hazFO3699QJ:www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2005/pr0425_01.pdf+operation+family+secrets&hl=en&gl=us] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> which indicted 14 Outfit members and associates under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO), including [[Joseph Lombardo]], [[Nicholas Calabrese]], [[Frank Calabrese Sr.]] and [[James Marcello]].

It is part of the [[American Mafia]] originating in [[South Side, Chicago]].\n\nThe Outfit rose to power in the 1920s under the control of [[Johnny Torrio]] and [[Al Capone]], and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for control of the distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition. Since then, the Outfit has been involved in a wide range of criminal activities, including loansharking, gambling, prostitution, extortion, political corruption, and murder. Capone was convicted of income tax evasion in 1931, and the Outfit was next run by [[Paul Ricca]]. He shared power with [[Tony Accardo]] from 1943 until his death in 1972; Accardo became the sole power in the Outfit upon Ricca's death and was one of the longest-sitting bosses of all time upon his death in the early 1990s.\n\nThe Outfit did not have a monopoly on organized crime in Chicago, but it was the most powerful, violent, and largest criminal organization in the Midwest. Its influence at its peak stretched as far as California and Florida. Higher law enforcement attention and general attrition has led to its gradual decline since the late 20th century. From 1997 to 2018, the Chicago Outfit was believed to be led by [[John DiFronzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsn.org/cc97.html |title=Who's Who in Chicago Outfit for 1997 ISPN-97-10-12 |publisher=Ipsn.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe early years of organized crime in Chicago, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were marked by the division of various [[street gang]]s controlling the South Side and North Side, as well as the [[Black Hand (blackmail)|Black Hand]] organizations of [[Little Italy, Chicago|Little Italy]].\n\n[[Big Jim Colosimo]] centralized control in the early 20th century. Colosimo was born in [[Calabria]], Italy, in 1878, immigrated to Chicago in 1895, where he established himself as a criminal. By 1909, with the help of bringing [[Johnny Torrio]] from New York to Chicago, he was successful enough that he was encroaching on the [[criminal activity]] of the Black Hand organization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Binder|first=John|title=The Chicago Outfit|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0738523267|page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"dr.com.tr\">{{cite web |title=When the Outfit Ran Chicago, Vol I:The \"Big Jim\" Colosimo Era |url=https://www.dr.com.tr/ekitap/when-the-outfit-ran-chicago-vol-i-the-big-jim-colosimo-era |website=D&R |accessdate=10 December 2018 |language=tr}}</ref>\n\n===Prohibition and Capone===\nIn 1919, Capone also left New York for Chicago at the invitation of Torrio. Capone began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where he contracted [[syphilis]]. Timely use of [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]] probably could have cured the infection, but he apparently never sought treatment.<ref>Get Capone: The Secret Plot That Captured America's Most Wanted, by Jonathan Eig. p17</ref>\n\nWhen [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] went into effect in 1920, Torrio pushed for the gang to enter into [[Rum-running|bootlegging]], but Colosimo stubbornly refused. In March 1920, Colosimo secured an uncontested divorce from his wife Victoria Moresco.<ref name=chicagodead>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-07-26-8702250077-story.html|title=THE VICE LORD WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH A CHOIR SINGER|publisher=chicagotribune.com|date=July 26, 1987}}</ref> A month later, he and singer Dale Winter eloped to [[West Baden Springs, Indiana]].

With Capone taking the role of an actual businessman and partner of the owner, the Outfit had a legitimate way to source their money, which prevented incrimination and unnecessary attention from law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/nkazmers/organizedcrime2.html|title=Organized Crime- How it was changed by Prohibition|last=Hales|first=Taylor|date=January 4, 2018|website=University of Michigan|access-date=January 4, 2018}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nTorrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with Capone as his right-hand man. He was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller [[North Side Gang]] led by [[Dean O'Banion]] (also known as Dion O'Banion) was of mixed ethnicity, and it came under pressure from the Genna brothers who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that Torrio was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side, despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes.<ref>{{cite book |title= Capone: The Man and the Era|url= https://archive.org/details/caponemanera00berg|url-access= registration|last= Bergreen|first= Laurence|year= 1994|publisher= Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-684-82447-5|pages= [https://archive.org/details/caponemanera00berg/page/131 131\u2013132]}}</ref> In a fateful step, Torrio either arranged for or acquiesced to the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop on November 10, 1924. This placed [[Hymie Weiss]] at the head of the gang, backed by [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Bugs Moran]].

Twelve days later, on January 24, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip with his wife Anna, when he was shot several times. After recovering, he effectively resigned and handed control to Capone, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection.<ref name = \"Paul Sann\">Paul Sann, ''The Lawless Decade: Bullets, Broads and Bathtub Gin'', Courier Corporation, 2012, p.111</ref> In turn, he was able to use more violence to increase revenue.

Geographically, this was the period when Outfit muscle extended to [[Milwaukee]] and [[Madison, Wisconsin]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and especially to Hollywood and other California cities, where The Outfit's extortion of labor unions gave it leverage over the [[motion picture industry]].\n\nIn the early 1940s, a handful of top Outfit leaders went to prison because they were found to be extorting [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] by controlling the unions that compose Hollywood's movie industry, and manipulating and misusing the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Central States]] [[Pension fund]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Binder|first=John|title=The Chicago Outfit|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0738523267|page=56}}</ref> \nIn 1943, the Outfit was caught red-handed shaking down the Hollywood movie industry. Ricca wanted Nitti to take the fall.  However, Nitti had found that he was [[claustrophobic]], years earlier while in jail for 18 months (for [[tax evasion]]), and he decided to end his life rather than face more imprisonment for extorting Hollywood. Ricca then became the boss in name as well as in fact, with enforcement chief [[Tony Accardo]] as underboss\u2014the start of a partnership that lasted for almost 30 years.  Around this time, the Outfit began bringing in members of the [[Forty-Two Gang]], a notoriously violent youth gang. Among them were [[Sam Giancana|Sam \"Momo\" Giancana]], [[Sam DeStefano|Sam \"Mad Sam\" DeStefano]], [[Felix Alderisio|Felix \"Milwaukee Phil\" Alderisio]], and [[Fiore Buccieri|Fiore \"Fifi\" Buccieri]].\n\nRicca was sent to prison later in 1943 for his part in The Outfit plot to control Hollywood. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, along with a number of other mobsters. Through the \"magic\" of political connections, the whole group of Outfit mobsters was released after three years, largely due to the efforts of Outfit \"fixer\" [[Murray Humphreys|Murray \"The Camel\" Humphreys]]. Ricca could not associate with mobsters as a condition of his parole.  Accardo nominally took power as boss, but actually shared power with Ricca, who continued behind the scenes as a senior consultant\u2014one of the few instances of shared power in organized crime.\n\nAccardo joined Ricca in semi-retirement in 1957 due to some \"[[surveillance|heat]]\" that he was getting from the IRS.  From then on, Ricca and Accardo allowed several others to nominally serve as boss, such as Giancana, Alderisio, [[Joey Aiuppa]], [[William Daddano|William \"Willie Potatoes\" Daddano]], and [[Jackie Cerone|Jackie \"the Lackey\" Cerone]]. Most of the front bosses originated from the Forty-Two Gang. However, no major business transactions took place without Ricca and Accardo's knowledge and approval, and certainly no \"[[contract killing|hits]].\"  By staying behind the scenes, Ricca and Accardo lasted far longer than Capone.  Ricca died in 1972, leaving Accardo as the sole power behind the scenes.\n\n====1960s\u20131990s====\n\nAlong with the voting allegations, the Outfit was involved in a [[Central Intelligence Agency]]\u2013Mafia [[collusion]] during Castro's overthrow of the Cuban government. In exchange for its help, the Outfit was to be given access to its former casinos if it helped overthrow [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Operation Mongoose]] or [[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Operation Family Jewels]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/27/usa.cuba |title=CIA conspired with mafia to kill Castro |last=Tisdall |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Tisdall |work=The Guardian |date=June 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> The Outfit failed in that endeavor and faced increasing indictments under the administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (JFK). The Outfit is the subject of [[Mafia and the Kennedy Assassination|some theories]] regarding the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination]] and that of JFK's brother [[Robert Kennedy]].\n\nThe Outfit reached the height of its power in the early 1960s. Accardo used the [[Teamsters]] pension fund, with the aid of [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Sidney Korshak]], and [[Jimmy Hoffa]], to engage in massive [[money laundering]] through the Outfit's casinos. The 1970s and 1980s were a hard time for the Outfit, as law enforcement continued to penetrate the organization, spurred by poll-watching politicians. [[Off-track betting]] reduced [[bookmaking]] profits, and illicit casinos withered under competition from legitimate casinos. Activities such as auto theft and professional [[sports betting]] did not replace the lost profits.\n\nThe Outfit controlled casinos in Las Vegas and \"[[Skimming (casinos)|skimmed]]\" millions of dollars over the course of several decades. Most recently, top mob figures have been found guilty of crimes dating back to as early as the mid-1960s. It has been rumored that the $2&nbsp;million skimmed from the casinos in the Court case of 1986 was used to build the Old Neighborhood Italian American Club, the founder of which was [[Angelo J. LaPietra|Angelo J. \"The Hook\" LaPietra]].\n\n[[Allen Dorfman]], a key figure in the Outfit's money embezzlement operations, was investigated by the Department of Justice. In 1982, the FBI wire-tapped Dorfman's personal and company phone lines and was able to gather the evidence needed to convict Dorfman and several of his associates on attempts to bribe a state senator to get rid of the trucking industry rates. If Dorfman succeeded, the Outfit would have seen a huge gain of profit. This was known as Operation Pendorf and was a huge blow to the Chicago crime syndicate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-31/news/9703310046_1_wiretaps-pension-fund-teamsters-union|title=Retiring FBI Agent Recalls Bugging Role in Teamsters Case|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-04-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOperation GAMBAT (GAMBling ATtorney) proved to be a crippling blow to the Outfit's tight grip on the Chicago political machine. [[Pat Marcy]], a made man in the Outfit, ran the city's [[Chicago City Council|First Ward]], which represented most of downtown Chicago. Marcy and company controlled the [[circuit courts]] from the 1950s until the late 1980s with the help of [[Alderman]] [[Fred Roti]] and Democratic Committeeman [[John D'Arco Sr.]] Together, the First Ward fixed cases involving everything from minor traffic violations to murder.\n\nAttorney and First Ward associate [[Robert Cooley (lawyer)|Robert Cooley]] was one of the lawyers who represented many mafiosi and associates in which cases were fixed. As a trusted man within the First Ward, Cooley was asked to \"take out\" a city police officer. Cooley was also an addicted gambler and in debt, so he approached the U.S. Justice Department's [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force]], declaring that he wanted to \"destroy Marcy and the First Ward\".\n\nCooley was soon in touch with the FBI and began cooperating as a federal informant. Through the years, he maintained close ties to Marcy and the big shots of the First Ward. He wore an electronic surveillance device, recording valuable conversations at the notorious \"First Ward Table\", located at \"Counselor's Row\" across the street from [[Chicago City Hall]]. The results in Operation Gambat (Gambling Attorney) were convictions of 24 corrupt judges, lawyers, and cops.\n\nAccardo died in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baumann|first=Edward|title=FORMER FBI AGENT BILL ROEMER TAKES A LOOK AT MOB BOSS TONY ACCARDO|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-29/entertainment/9511050426_1_william-roemer-joe-batters-johnny-torrio|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 29, 1995|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> In a measure of how successfully he had managed to stay out of the limelight, he never spent a day in jail (or only spent one day, depending on the source) despite an arrest record dating to 1922. Chicago's transition from Accardo to the next generation of Outfit bosses has been more of an administrative change than a power struggle, distinct from the way that organized crime leadership transitions take place in New York City.\n\n===21st century===\n\nHigher law enforcement investigations and general attrition led to the Outfit's gradual decline since the late 20th century. The Old Neighborhood Italian American Club is considered to be the hangout of Old Timers as they live out their golden years.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The Club's founder was [[Angelo J. LaPietra]] \"The Hook\", who was the main Council at the time of his death in 1999.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] launched ''[[Operation Family Secrets]]'',<ref>[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:0hazFO3699QJ:www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2005/pr0425_01.pdf+operation+family+secrets&hl=en&gl=us] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> which indicted 14 Outfit members and associates under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO), including [[Joseph Lombardo]], [[Nicholas Calabrese]], [[Frank Calabrese Sr.]] and [[James Marcello]].

While at Stanford, Corman realised he did not want to be an engineer.\n\nHe enlisted in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] with six months of study to complete. He served in the navy from 1944 to 1946. He returned to Stanford to finish his degree, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Industrial Engineering]] in 1947.<ref name=\"STANFORDALUMNIMAGAZINE\">[https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=29323 \"The Award of a Lifetime for Roger Corman\"], ''Stanford Alumni Magazine'', January/February 2010</ref> While at Stanford University, Corman was initiated in the fraternity [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]].\n\nIn 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on [[Slauson Avenue]] in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss \"I've made a terrible mistake.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Holte|first=Michael Ned|title=Value Engineering: Roger Corman with his own Context|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/value-engineering-roger-corman-within-his-own-context|publisher=East of Borneo|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> His brother Gene was already working in the film industry as an agent and Roger decided to go into filmmaking instead.\n\n==Early film career==\nCorman found work at [[20th Century Fox]] initially in the mail room. He worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as ''[[The Gunfighter (film)|The Gunfighter]]'' with [[Gregory Peck]]. When Corman received no credit at all he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the [[GI Bill]], Corman studied English Literature at [[Oxford University]] and lived in Paris for a time.\n\n[[File:Roger Corman crop.jpg|thumb|Corman in 2006]]\nHe then returned to Los Angeles and tried to re-establish himself in the film industry. He took various jobs, including television stage hand at KLAC and a messenger at Fox. He worked as an assistant to agent Dick Hyland, a literary agent.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|date=February 13, 1952|page=74|title=Hollywood}}</ref>\n\n===''Highway Dragnet''===\nCorman wrote a script in his spare time and sold it to [[William F.

Corman also worked as associate producer on the film for nothing, just for the experience.\n\n===Producer===\nCorman used his script fee and personal contacts to raise $12,000 to produce his first feature, a science fiction film, ''[[The Monster From the Ocean Floor]]'' (1954). It was produced by Corman's own company, Palo Alto, and released by [[Robert L. Lippert]].\n\nThe film did well enough to encourage Corman to produce another film, the racing car thriller ''[[The Fast and the Furious (1954 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (1955), directed by its star, [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], and co-starring [[Dorothy Malone]].\n\nCorman sold the movie to a new independent company, the [[American Releasing Company]], run by [[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]]. Although Corman had a number of offers for the film from Republic and Columbia, he elected to go with ARC because they undertook to advance money to enable him to make two more movies.\n\n===Director===\nCorman's second film for ARC was one he decided to direct, ''[[Five Guns West]]'' (1955), a Western, made in colour for around $60,000, with Malone and [[John Lund (actor)|John Lund]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Seven Theaters Offer 'Sabrina'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 24, 1954|page= 14}}</ref> The script was written by [[Robert Wright Campbell]], who would work with Corman on several more occasions.\n\nCorman announced he would make four more projects for ARC: ''High Steel'', ''Cobra'', ''Fortress Beneath the Sea'', and an untitled film from Campbell.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Schofield Gets Huston Attention|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 9, 1955|page= 21}}</ref> Instead Corman did some uncredited directing on ''[[The Beast with a Million Eyes]]'' (1955), then made another Western, ''[[Apache Woman]]'' (1955), starring [[Lloyd Bridges]], written by [[Lou Rusoff]]. Rusoff and Corman reunited on ''[[Day the World Ended]]'' (1955), a post-apocalyptic science fiction film, which was popular.\n\nCorman was to make ''The Devil on Horseback'' by [[Charles B. Griffith]] about the [[Brownsville Raid]]<ref>Story of Ex-Fighter to Be Dramatic Film Hopper, Hedda. ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif] July 12, 1955: 12.</ref> but it was too expensive.\n\nThe [[Woolner Brothers]], Louisiana drive-in owners, financed Corman's ''[[Swamp Women]]'' (1956), a girls-on-the-lam saga.\n\nHe returned to ARC for two Westerns, ''[[The Oklahoma Woman]]'' (1956) and ''[[Gunslinger (film)|Gunslinger]]'' (1956) (with Ireland); ''Gunslinger'' was co-written by Griffith, who would become a crucial collaborator for Corman over the next five years. He bought a script from [[Curtis Harrington]], ''The Girl from Beneath the Sea''.<ref>{{cite news|title='Matador' is eyed by two studios: Allied and United Artists Are Discussing Plan to Sponsor Jointly Conrad Novel R.K.O. to Share Arness Of Local Origin|first=Thomas M.|last=Pryor|newspaper=New York Times |date=March 12, 1956|page= 23}}</ref> Harrington would make it for Corman years later as ''[[Night Tide]]'' (1961).\n\n===American International Pictures and Allied Artists===\nARC changed their name to \"American International Pictures\". Corman was established as their leading filmmaker. They financed Corman's next film as director, the science fiction story, ''[[It Conquered the World]]'' (1956).  Co-written by Griffith, it was a follow up to ''The Day the World Ended''. It was a big hit.\n\nHe optioned a TV play ''The Stake'' and hoped to get [[Dana Andrews]] to star.<ref>Drama: Gable, Turner Costar Deal Foreseen; Andrews Indicated for 'Stake'\nSchallert, Edwin.

Instead, [[Walter Mirisch]] of [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] hired Corman to make ''[[The Undead (film)|The Undead]]'' (1957), inspired by ''[[The Search for Bridey Murphy]]''. Griffith wrote the script.\n\nIn June, Corman made a science fiction film for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]],  ''[[Not of This Earth (1957 film)|Not of this Earth]]'' (1957), written by Griffith.\n\nIn August 1956, AIP financed a Corman heist movie shot in Hawaii, ''[[Naked Paradise]]'' (1957), co-written by Griffith. Corman shot it back to back with a movie made with his own money, ''[[She Gods of Shark Reef]]'' (1958) - Corman wound up selling the movie to AIP.\n\nCorman and Griffith reunited in ''[[Attack of the Crab Monsters]]'' (1957) for Allied, which wound up being one of his most successful early films.<ref>Flynn, Sanders, Raft Sought as Stellar Trio; 'Sheep Man' Keel Film Schallert, Edwin.

Later, Corman used the sets for that film for ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' (1963), made for Filmgroup but released by AIP, and starring [[Boris Karloff]] (whose scenes were all shot in two days) and Jack Nicholson. Corman did not direct all of this film; additional scenes were shot by Monte Hellman, Coppola and Jack Hill, among others.\n\n''[[The Young Racers]]'' (1963) was produced and directed by Corman in Europe for AIP, starring and written by Campbell. Working on the film was [[Francis Ford Coppola]] who Corman financed to make his directorial debut, ''[[Dementia 13]]'' (1963).\n\nBack in the U.S., Corman made ''[[X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes]]'' (1963), a contemporary science fiction for AIP starring [[Ray Milland]].

While at Stanford, Corman realised he did not want to be an engineer.\n\nHe enlisted in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] with six months of study to complete. He served in the navy from 1944 to 1946. He returned to Stanford to finish his degree, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Industrial Engineering]] in 1947.<ref name=\"STANFORDALUMNIMAGAZINE\">[https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=29323 \"The Award of a Lifetime for Roger Corman\"], ''Stanford Alumni Magazine'', January/February 2010</ref> While at Stanford University, Corman was initiated in the fraternity [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]].\n\nIn 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on [[Slauson Avenue]] in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss \"I've made a terrible mistake.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Holte|first=Michael Ned|title=Value Engineering: Roger Corman with his own Context|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/value-engineering-roger-corman-within-his-own-context|publisher=East of Borneo|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> His brother Gene was already working in the film industry as an agent and Roger decided to go into filmmaking instead.\n\n==Early film career==\nCorman found work at [[20th Century Fox]] initially in the mail room. He worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as ''[[The Gunfighter (film)|The Gunfighter]]'' with [[Gregory Peck]]. When Corman received no credit at all he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the [[GI Bill]], Corman studied English Literature at [[Oxford University]] and lived in Paris for a time.\n\n[[File:Roger Corman crop.jpg|thumb|Corman in 2006]]\nHe then returned to Los Angeles and tried to re-establish himself in the film industry. He took various jobs, including television stage hand at KLAC and a messenger at Fox. He worked as an assistant to agent Dick Hyland, a literary agent.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|date=February 13, 1952|page=74|title=Hollywood}}</ref>\n\n===''Highway Dragnet''===\nCorman wrote a script in his spare time and sold it to [[William F.

Corman also worked as associate producer on the film for nothing, just for the experience.\n\n===Producer===\nCorman used his script fee and personal contacts to raise $12,000 to produce his first feature, a science fiction film, ''[[The Monster From the Ocean Floor]]'' (1954). It was produced by Corman's own company, Palo Alto, and released by [[Robert L. Lippert]].\n\nThe film did well enough to encourage Corman to produce another film, the racing car thriller ''[[The Fast and the Furious (1954 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (1955), directed by its star, [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], and co-starring [[Dorothy Malone]].\n\nCorman sold the movie to a new independent company, the [[American Releasing Company]], run by [[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]]. Although Corman had a number of offers for the film from Republic and Columbia, he elected to go with ARC because they undertook to advance money to enable him to make two more movies.\n\n===Director===\nCorman's second film for ARC was one he decided to direct, ''[[Five Guns West]]'' (1955), a Western, made in colour for around $60,000, with Malone and [[John Lund (actor)|John Lund]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Seven Theaters Offer 'Sabrina'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 24, 1954|page= 14}}</ref> The script was written by [[Robert Wright Campbell]], who would work with Corman on several more occasions.\n\nCorman announced he would make four more projects for ARC: ''High Steel'', ''Cobra'', ''Fortress Beneath the Sea'', and an untitled film from Campbell.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Schofield Gets Huston Attention|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 9, 1955|page= 21}}</ref> Instead Corman did some uncredited directing on ''[[The Beast with a Million Eyes]]'' (1955), then made another Western, ''[[Apache Woman]]'' (1955), starring [[Lloyd Bridges]], written by [[Lou Rusoff]]. Rusoff and Corman reunited on ''[[Day the World Ended]]'' (1955), a post-apocalyptic science fiction film, which was popular.\n\nCorman was to make ''The Devil on Horseback'' by [[Charles B. Griffith]] about the [[Brownsville Raid]]<ref>Story of Ex-Fighter to Be Dramatic Film Hopper, Hedda. ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif] July 12, 1955: 12.</ref> but it was too expensive.\n\nThe [[Woolner Brothers]], Louisiana drive-in owners, financed Corman's ''[[Swamp Women]]'' (1956), a girls-on-the-lam saga.\n\nHe returned to ARC for two Westerns, ''[[The Oklahoma Woman]]'' (1956) and ''[[Gunslinger (film)|Gunslinger]]'' (1956) (with Ireland); ''Gunslinger'' was co-written by Griffith, who would become a crucial collaborator for Corman over the next five years. He bought a script from [[Curtis Harrington]], ''The Girl from Beneath the Sea''.<ref>{{cite news|title='Matador' is eyed by two studios: Allied and United Artists Are Discussing Plan to Sponsor Jointly Conrad Novel R.K.O. to Share Arness Of Local Origin|first=Thomas M.|last=Pryor|newspaper=New York Times |date=March 12, 1956|page= 23}}</ref> Harrington would make it for Corman years later as ''[[Night Tide]]'' (1961).\n\n===American International Pictures and Allied Artists===\nARC changed their name to \"American International Pictures\". Corman was established as their leading filmmaker. They financed Corman's next film as director, the science fiction story, ''[[It Conquered the World]]'' (1956).  Co-written by Griffith, it was a follow up to ''The Day the World Ended''. It was a big hit.\n\nHe optioned a TV play ''The Stake'' and hoped to get [[Dana Andrews]] to star.<ref>Drama: Gable, Turner Costar Deal Foreseen; Andrews Indicated for 'Stake'\nSchallert, Edwin.

Corman shot it back to back with a movie made with his own money, ''[[She Gods of Shark Reef]]'' (1958) - Corman wound up selling the movie to AIP.\n\nCorman and Griffith reunited in ''[[Attack of the Crab Monsters]]'' (1957) for Allied, which wound up being one of his most successful early films.<ref>Flynn, Sanders, Raft Sought as Stellar Trio; 'Sheep Man' Keel Film Schallert, Edwin.

Campbell wrote the script.\n\nAlso for AIP, he did ''[[Teenage Caveman (1958 film)|Teenage Caveman]]'' (1958), with [[Robert Vaughn]], originally titled ''Prehistoric World''.\n\nHe helped produce two films for Allied Artists, both from scripts by [[Leo Gordon]]: ''[[Hot Car Girl]]'' (1958), directed by [[Bernard Kowalski]] and produced by his brother Gene (the first film they made together) from a script by Gordon; and ''[[The Cry Baby Killer (1958)|The Cry Baby Killer]]'' (1958), which gave [[Jack Nicholson]] his first starring role.\n\nHe had his biggest budget yet for ''[[I, Mobster]]'' (1958), a gangster story, co-produced by [[Edward L. Alperson]] and Corman's brother Gene for [[20th Century Fox]]. In September 1958 he was reported scouting locations in Australia to do a remake of [[H.

The film was co-financed by Pathe labs; AIP put pressure on Pathe and ended up buying out their interest.\n\nFor producer [[Edward Small]], Corman made a historical horror piece about [[Richard III]], ''[[Tower of London (1962 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1962), starring [[Vincent Price]].  It was meant to be the first in a three-picture deal with Small, but Corman did not enjoy working with the producer.\n\nFor Filmgroup he also bought the rights to a Soviet science fiction film, ''[[Nebo Zovyot]]'' (1959) and had some additional footage shot for it by his then-assistant, [[Francis Ford Coppola]]; the result was ''[[Battle Beyond the Sun]]'' (1962). He also released ''[[The Magic Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1962), dubbed from an overseas film.\n\nThe fourth Poe was an anthology, ''[[Tales of Terror]]'' (1962), shot in late 1961. One of the installments, \"The Black Cat\", was a comedy, inspiring Corman to do a whole Poe story comedically next: ''[[The Raven (1963 film)|The Raven]]'' (1963). Later, Corman used the sets for that film for ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' (1963), made for Filmgroup but released by AIP, and starring [[Boris Karloff]] (whose scenes were all shot in two days) and Jack Nicholson. Corman did not direct all of this film; additional scenes were shot by Monte Hellman, Coppola and Jack Hill, among others.\n\n''[[The Young Racers]]'' (1963) was produced and directed by Corman in Europe for AIP, starring and written by Campbell. Working on the film was [[Francis Ford Coppola]] who Corman financed to make his directorial debut, ''[[Dementia 13]]'' (1963).\n\nBack in the U.S., Corman made ''[[X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes]]'' (1963), a contemporary science fiction for AIP starring [[Ray Milland]].  He followed it with ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'' (1963), ostensibly part of the Poe cycle\u2014it featured Price and was made for AIP, written by Beaumont\u2014but was actually based on a story by [[H.P. Lovecraft]].\n\nCorman directed a war film in Yugoslavia with his brother, ''[[The Secret Invasion]]'' (1964), with [[Stewart Granger]] and [[Mickey Rooney]], from a script by Campbell. Following this he announced he would make ''The Life of Robert E. Lee'' as part of a four-picture deal with Filmgroup worth $3.75 million.

Developed by [[Shiny Entertainment]], the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. The game was [[porting|ported]] to [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS 9.2]] in 2001.\n\nUnlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, ''Sacrifice'' places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their [[Magic point|mana]]&mdash;energy for casting spells&mdash;constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, ''Sacrifice'' offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.\n\n''Sacrifice'' was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses [[Tessellation (computer graphics)|tesselation]]: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, ''Sacrifice'' can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as [[Tim Curry]], and the musical compositions of [[Kevin Manthei]]. ''Sacrifice'' was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, ''Sacrifice'' was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPublished in 2000 for the [[Windows 98]] platform (and in the following year for [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS 9.2]]), ''Sacrifice'' is a [[real-time strategy]] video game that incorporates elements of the [[Action game|action]] genre.

Eldred fled to the world that he and Mithras stand on. The world&mdash;having suffered a past cataclysm&mdash;was riven into a collection of five floating islands. A god rules over each realm, seeking to impose his or her own agenda. The rivalries among the gods are aggravated by Mithras's prophecy of a traitor amongst them. Sensing the opportunity for a new lease on life, Eldred offers his service to the gods.<ref name=ignadams />\n\nThe campaign spans ten missions. In each mission, the player chooses a god for Eldred to champion, receiving creatures and spells from that god.

Eldred warns the gods; they believe one of them supports the demon and fall upon each other to eliminate the traitor. By the last stage of the campaign, Eldred has helped one god to kill the others.

Developed by [[Shiny Entertainment]], the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. The game was [[porting|ported]] to [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS 9.2]] in 2001.\n\nUnlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, ''Sacrifice'' places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their [[Magic point|mana]]&mdash;energy for casting spells&mdash;constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, ''Sacrifice'' offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.\n\n''Sacrifice'' was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses [[Tessellation (computer graphics)|tesselation]]: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, ''Sacrifice'' can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as [[Tim Curry]], and the musical compositions of [[Kevin Manthei]]. ''Sacrifice'' was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, ''Sacrifice'' was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPublished in 2000 for the [[Windows 98]] platform (and in the following year for [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS 9.2]]), ''Sacrifice'' is a [[real-time strategy]] video game that incorporates elements of the [[Action game|action]] genre.

Eldred fled to the world that he and Mithras stand on. The world&mdash;having suffered a past cataclysm&mdash;was riven into a collection of five floating islands. A god rules over each realm, seeking to impose his or her own agenda. The rivalries among the gods are aggravated by Mithras's prophecy of a traitor amongst them. Sensing the opportunity for a new lease on life, Eldred offers his service to the gods.<ref name=ignadams />\n\nThe campaign spans ten missions. In each mission, the player chooses a god for Eldred to champion, receiving creatures and spells from that god. The player can build up a selection of units and spells from different gods by changing Eldred's allegiance between missions; the selections are used in later missions or multiplayer sessions.

Eldred warns the gods; they believe one of them supports the demon and fall upon each other to eliminate the traitor. By the last stage of the campaign, Eldred has helped one god to kill the others. After the end of the wizard's narration, Mithras reveals himself as Marduk.

The organization's name is derived from the original ''Mafia'' or ''Cosa nostra'', the [[Sicilian Mafia]], with \"American Mafia\" originally referring simply to Mafia groups from Sicily operating in America, as the organization originally emerged as an offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia; however, the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American [[gangster]]s and Italian crime groups (such as the [[Camorra in New York|American Camorra]]) living in the United States and Canada that were not of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] origin. It is often colloquially referred to as the '''Italian Mafia''' or '''Italian Mob''', though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime groups in Italy]].\n\nThe Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrant]] [[Little Italy|neighborhoods or ghettos]] in New York's [[East Harlem]] (or [[Italian Harlem]]), the [[Lower East Side]], and [[Brooklyn]]. It also emerged in other areas of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and several other major metropolitan areas (such as [[New Orleans]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Mike Dash|author-link=Mike Dash|year=2009|title=First Family|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfamilyterro00dash|url-access=registration}}</ref> and [[Chicago]]) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from [[Sicily]] and other regions of [[Southern Italy]]. It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States. [[Campania|Neapolitan]], [[Calabria]]n, and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S., as well as independent Italian-American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with [[Italian organized crime]] groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the [[Camorra]] of [[Naples]], and the [['Ndrangheta]] of [[Calabria]]. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a \"[[Crime family|family,]]\" as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known. Despite the name of \"family\" to describe the various units, they are not familial groupings.<ref>Roberto M.

At its peak, the American Mafia dominated organized crime in the United States. Each crime family has its own territory (except for the Five Families) and operates independently, while nationwide coordination is overseen by [[The Commission (mafia)|the Commission]], which consists of the bosses of each of the strongest families.\n\nToday, most of the Mafia's activities are contained to the [[northeastern United States]] and Chicago, where they continue to dominate organized crime, despite the increasing numbers of other crime groups.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Barrett, Devlin|author2=Gardiner, Sean|title=Structure Keeps Mafia Atop Crime Heap|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704115404576096392318489246|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Gardiner, Sean|author2=Shallwani, Parvaiz|title=Mafia Is Down\u2014but Not Out|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304626804579363363092833756|work=Wall Street Journal|date=24 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==\n{{further|Sicilian Mafia#Etymology}}\n\nThe word ''mafia'' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8ma\u02d0fja|lang}}) derives from the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] adjective ''mafiusu'', which, roughly translated, means \"swagger\", but can also be translated as \"boldness\" or \"[[wikt:bravado|bravado]]\". In reference to a man, ''mafiusu'' (''mafioso'' in Italian) in 19th century [[Sicily]] signified \"fearless\", \"enterprising\", and \"proud\", according to scholar [[Diego Gambetta]].<ref name=\"mafiusu\">This etymology is based on the books ''Che cosa \u00e8 la mafia?'' by [[Gaetano Mosca]], ''Mafioso'' by Gaia Servadio, ''The Sicilian Mafia'' by Diego Gambetta, ''Mafia & Mafiosi'' by Henner Hess, and ''Cosa Nostra'' by John Dickie (see [[#Books|Books]] below).</ref> In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective ''mafiusa'' means 'beautiful' or 'attractive'.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins: The Black Hand===\n{{Main|Black Hand (extortion)}}\n[[File:Paul Kelly-2.jpg|thumb|Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli (also known as [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]]), founder of the [[Five Points Gang]]]]\nThe first published account of what became the Mafia in the United States dates to the spring of 1869. The ''[[Times-Picayune|New Orleans Times]]'' reported that the city's Second District had become overrun by \"well-known and notorious Sicilian murderers, counterfeiters and burglars, who, in the last month, have formed a sort of general co-partnership or stock company for the plunder and disturbance of the city.\" Emigration from southern Italy to the Americas was primarily to Brazil and Argentina, and New Orleans had a heavy volume of port traffic to and from both locales.\n\nMafia groups in the United States first became influential in the New York City area, gradually progressing from small neighborhood operations in poor [[Little Italy|Italian ghettos]] to citywide and eventually national organizations. The Black Hand was a name given to an [[extortion]] method used in Italian neighborhoods at the turn of the 20th century. It has been sometimes mistaken for the Mafia itself, which it is not. The Black Hand was a criminal society, but there were many small Black Hand gangs. Black Hand extortion was often (wrongly) viewed as the activity of a single organization because Black Hand criminals in Italian communities throughout the United States used the same methods of extortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/lippmanstudy/articles/Lombardo.pdf |title=Sagepub.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}</ref>\n\n[[Giuseppe Morello]] was the first known Mafia member to immigrate to the United States.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, and the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He was arrested in [[New Orleans]] in 1881 and extradited to Italy.<ref name=\"FBI\"/>\n\nNew Orleans was also the site of the first possible Mafia incident in the United States that received both national and international attention.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> On October 15, 1890, New Orleans Police Superintendent [[David Hennessy]] was murdered execution-style.

Kelly recruited some street hoodlums who later became some of the most famous crime bosses of the century such as [[Johnny Torrio]], [[Al Capone]], [[Lucky Luciano]] and [[Frankie Yale]]. They were often in conflict with the [[Eastman Gang|Jewish Eastmans]] of the same area. There was also an influential Mafia family in East Harlem. The Neapolitan [[Camorra]] was also very active in Brooklyn. In Chicago, the 19th Ward was an Italian neighborhood that became known as the \"Bloody Nineteenth\" due to the frequent violence in the ward, mostly as a result of Mafia activity, [[feud]]s, and vendettas.\n\n===Prohibition era===<!--pls do not change, [[The Mafia during Prohibition]] links to here -->\nOn January 16, 1919, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] began in the United States with the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] making it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell alcohol. Despite these bans, there was still a very high demand for it from the public. This created an atmosphere that tolerated crime as a means to provide liquor to the public, even among the police and city politicians. Not explicitly related to Mafia involvement the murder rate during the Prohibition Era rose from 6.8 per 100,000 individuals to 9.7 and within the first three months proceeding the Eighteenth Amendment, a half million dollars in bonded whiskey was stolen from government warehouses.<ref>Abadinsky, Howard.

The bootlegging industry organized members of these gangs before they were distinguished as today's known families. The new industry required members at all different employment levels, such as bosses, lawyers, truckers, and even members to eliminate competitors through threat/force. Gangs hijacked each other's alcohol shipments, forcing rivals to pay them for \"protection\" to leave their operations alone, and armed guards almost invariably accompanied the caravans that delivered the liquor.<ref>Mason, Phillip.

The Mafia thrived by following a strict set of rules that originated in Sicily that called for an organized hierarchical structure and a [[code of silence]] that forbade its members from cooperating with the police ([[Omert\u00e0]]). Failure to follow any of these rules was punishable by death.\n\nThe rise of power that the Mafia acquired during Prohibition would continue long after alcohol was made legal again. Criminal empires which had expanded on bootleg money would find other avenues to continue making large sums of money. When alcohol ceased to be prohibited in 1933, the Mafia diversified its money-making criminal activities to include (both old and new): illegal gambling operations, [[loan shark]]ing, [[extortion]], [[protection racket]]s, drug trafficking, [[Fence (criminal)|fencing]], and labor racketeering through control of labor unions.<ref>Dubro, James.

The FBI put a lot more effort and resources into organized crime actives nationwide and created the [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force]] in various cities. However, while all this created more pressure on the Mafia, it did little to curb their criminal activities.

They created schemes to keep the money that they owed in taxes after the sale of millions of dollars' worth of wholesale petroleum. This allowed them to sell more gasoline at even lower prices. [[Michael Franzese]], also known as the Yuppie Don, ran and organized a gas scandal and stole over $290 million in gasoline taxes by evading the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and shutting down the gas station before government officials could make him pay what he owed.

This tactic helped them grow in power and influence in many cities with big labor unions such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and many others. Many members of the Mafia were enlisted in unions and even became union executives. [[La Cosa Nostra]] was a Mafia group that rose to [[economic power]] through their heavy involvement in unions. The Mafia has controlled unions all over the U.S. to extort money and resources out of big business, with recent indictments of corruption involving the New Jersey Waterfront Union, the Concrete Workers Union, and the [[Teamster Union|teamster union]].<ref>{{Cite news|ssrn=2002404|title=American Gangsters: RICO, Criminal Syndicates, and Conspiracy Law as Market Control|last=Levin|first=Benjamin|date=2013|work=periodical}}</ref>\n\nRestaurants were yet another powerful means by which the Mafia could gain economic power. A large concentration of Mafia owned restaurants were in New York City. Not only were they the setting of many killings and important meetings, but they were also an effective means of smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods. From 1985 to 1987, Sicilian Mafiosi in the U.S. imported an estimated $1.65 billion worth of heroin [[Pizza Connection Trial|through pizzerias]], hiding the cargo in various food products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/218555.pdf|title=United Nations Activities: La Cosa Nostra in the United States|last=Finckenauer|first=James O.|date=December 6, 2007|work=International Center National Institute of Justice|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref name=nyt030504>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/03/nyregion/gaetano-badalamenti-80-led-pizza-connection-ring.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Gaetano Badalamenti, 80; Led Pizza Connection Ring], The New York Times (Obituary), May 3, 2004</ref>\n\nAnother one of the areas of the economy that the Mafia was most influential was [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], beginning just after World War II with the opening of the first gambling resort \"[[Flamingo Las Vegas|The Flamingo]]\".<ref name=\"weebly\"/> Many credit the Mafia with being a big part of the city's development in the mid 20th Century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/03/nevadas-20th-century-economy-a-tale-of-water-minin/|title=Nevada's 20th century economy a tale of water, mining, casinos|date=2000-01-03|website=LasVegasSun.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> It was through millions of dollars in capital flowing into new casino resorts that laid the foundation for further economic growth.

In 1969, the Nevada State Legislature passed a law that made it easier for corporations to own casinos. This brought new investors to the local economy to buy casinos from the Mafia. The U.S. Congress passed the [[RICO Act]] a year later. This law gave more authority to law enforcement to pursue the Mafia for its illegal activities. There was a sharp decline in the mob involvement in Las Vegas in the 1980s.

He created the [[Five Families]], each of which would have a [[crime boss|boss]], [[underboss]], [[caporegime|capos]], [[soldato|soldiers]], and associates, would be composed of only full-blooded Italian Americans, while associates could come from any background.<ref name=\"A Chronicle of Bloodletting\">{{cite news|title=A Chronicle of Bloodletting|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,902999-1,00.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=July 12, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia|year=2010|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345523570|pages=384\u2013386}}</ref><ref name=\"FiveFamilies\"/> All inducted members of the Mafia are called [[Made man|\"made\" men]]. This signifies that they are untouchable in the criminal underworld and any harm brought to them will be met with retaliation. With the exception of associates, all mobsters are \"made\" official members of a crime family. The three highest positions make up the administration. Below the administration, there are factions each headed by a ''caporegime'' (captain), who lead a crew of soldiers and associates. They report to the administration and can be seen as equivalent to managers in a business. When a boss makes a decision, he rarely issues orders directly to workers who would carry it out, but instead passed instructions down through the [[chain of command]]. This way, the higher levels of the organization are insulated from law enforcement attention if the lower level members who actually commit the crime should be captured or investigated, providing [[plausible deniability]].\n\nThere are occasionally other positions in the family leadership. Frequently, ruling panels have been set up when a boss goes to jail to divide the responsibility of the family (these usually consist of three or five members). This also helps divert police attention from any one member. The family messenger and street boss were positions created by former Genovese family leader [[Vincent Gigante]].\n* '''Boss''' \u2013 The [[Crime boss|boss]] is the head of the family, usually reigning as a dictator, sometimes called the Don or \"Godfather\". The boss receives a cut of every operation. Operations are taken on by every member of the family and of the region's occupying family.<ref>Abadinsky, Howard. Organized Crime. 7th ed. Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2003.</ref> Depending on the family, the boss may be chosen by a vote from the caporegimes of the family. In the event of a tie, the underboss must vote. In the past, all the members of a family voted on the boss, but by the late 1950s, any gathering such as that usually attracted too much attention.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\">Capeci, Jerry. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia''. Indianapolis: Alpha Books, 2002</ref> In practice, many of these elections are seen as having an inevitable result, such as that of [[John Gotti]] in 1986. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], a meeting was held in a basement during which all capos were searched and Gotti's men stood ominously behind them. Gotti was then proclaimed boss.\n* '''Underboss''' \u2013 The [[underboss]], usually appointed by the boss, is the second in command of the family. The underboss often runs the day-to-day responsibilities of the family or oversees its most lucrative rackets. He usually gets a percentage of the family's income from the boss's cut. The underboss is usually first in line to become acting boss if the boss is imprisoned, and is also frequently seen as a logical successor.\n* '''Consigliere''' \u2013 The [[consigliere]] is an advisor to the family and sometimes seen as the boss's \"right-hand man\". He is used as a mediator of disputes and often acts as a representative or aide for the family in meetings with other families, rival criminal organizations, and important business associates. In practice, the consigliere is normally the third ranking member of the administration of a family and was traditionally a senior member carrying the utmost respect of the family and deeply familiar with the inner-workings of the organization. A boss will often appoint a trusted close friend or personal advisor as his official consigliere.\n* '''Caporegime''' (or capo) \u2013 A [[caporegime]] (also captain or skipper) is in charge of a crew, a group of soldiers who report directly to him. Each crew usually contains 10\u201320 soldiers and many more associates. A capo is appointed by the boss and reports to him or the underboss. A captain gives a percentage of his (and his underlings') earnings to the boss and is also responsible for any tasks assigned, including murder. In labor racketeering, it is usually a capo who controls the infiltration of union locals. If a capo becomes powerful enough, he can sometimes wield more power than some of his superiors. In cases like [[Anthony Corallo]] they might even bypass the normal Mafia structure and lead the family when the boss dies.\n* '''Soldier''' (Soldato in Italian) \u2013 A [[Soldato|soldier]] is a member of the family, and traditionally can only be of full Italian background (although today many families require men to be of only half Italian descent, on their father's side). Once a member is made he is untouchable, meaning permission from a soldier's boss must be given before he is murdered. When the books are open, meaning that a family is accepting new members, a made man may recommend an up-and-coming associate to be a new soldier. Soldiers are the main workers of the family, usually committing crimes like assault, murder, extortion, intimidation, etc. In return, they are given profitable rackets to run by their superiors and have full access to their family's connections and power.\n\n[[File:Meyer Lansky NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|Jewish associate [[Meyer Lansky]]'s (right) work with [[Lucky Luciano]] made him an important figure in developing the American Mafia.]]\n* '''Associate''' \u2013 An associate is not a member of the Mafia, but works for a crime family nonetheless. Associates can include a wide range of people who work for the family. An associate can have a wide range of duties from virtually carrying out the same duties as a soldier to being a simple errand boy. This is where prospective mobsters (\"connected guys\") start out to prove their worth. Once a crime family is accepting new members, the best associates are evaluated and picked to become soldiers. An associate can also be a criminal who serves as a go-between or sometimes deals in drugs to keep police attention off the actual members, or they can be people the family does business with (restaurant owners, etc.) In other cases, an associate might be a corrupt [[labor union]] delegate or businessman.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\"/> Non-Italians will never go any further than this, although many non-Italians like [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Bugsy Siegel]], [[Murray Humphreys]], [[Mickey Cohen]], [[Gus Alex]], [[Bumpy Johnson]], [[Frank Sheeran]], [[Gerard Ouimette]], and [[James Burke (gangster)|James Burke]] wielded extreme power within their respective crime families and carried the respect of actual Mafia members. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Rituals and customs==\nThe [[Mafia initiation ritual]] to become a [[made man]] in the Mafia emerged from various sources, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] confraternities and [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodges]] in mid-19th century Sicily.<ref name=\"initiation\">\"Mafia's arcane rituals, and much of the organization's structure, were based largely on those of the Catholic confraternities and even Freemasonry, colored by Sicilian familial traditions and even certain customs associated with military-religious orders of chivalry like the Order of Malta.\" [http://www.bestofsicily.com/mafia.htm The Mafia] from [http://www.bestofsicily.com bestofsicily.com]</ref> At the initiation ceremony, the inductee would have his finger pricked with a needle by the officiating member; a few drops of blood are spilled on a card bearing the likeness of a saint; the card is set on fire; finally, while the card is passed rapidly from hand to hand to avoid burns, the novice takes an oath of loyalty to the Mafia family.

The organization's name is derived from the original ''Mafia'' or ''Cosa nostra'', the [[Sicilian Mafia]], with \"American Mafia\" originally referring simply to Mafia groups from Sicily operating in America, as the organization originally emerged as an offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia; however, the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American [[gangster]]s and Italian crime groups (such as the [[Camorra in New York|American Camorra]]) living in the United States and Canada that were not of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] origin. It is often colloquially referred to as the '''Italian Mafia''' or '''Italian Mob''', though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime groups in Italy]].\n\nThe Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrant]] [[Little Italy|neighborhoods or ghettos]] in New York's [[East Harlem]] (or [[Italian Harlem]]), the [[Lower East Side]], and [[Brooklyn]]. It also emerged in other areas of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and several other major metropolitan areas (such as [[New Orleans]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Mike Dash|author-link=Mike Dash|year=2009|title=First Family|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfamilyterro00dash|url-access=registration}}</ref> and [[Chicago]]) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from [[Sicily]] and other regions of [[Southern Italy]]. It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States. [[Campania|Neapolitan]], [[Calabria]]n, and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S., as well as independent Italian-American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with [[Italian organized crime]] groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the [[Camorra]] of [[Naples]], and the [['Ndrangheta]] of [[Calabria]]. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a \"[[Crime family|family,]]\" as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known. Despite the name of \"family\" to describe the various units, they are not familial groupings.<ref>Roberto M.

It is also highly active in Chicago and other large Midwestern cities such as Kansas City, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and St. Louis, a smaller presence in places like New Orleans, Florida, Denver, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and with smaller families, associates, and crews in other parts of the country.<ref name=\"FBI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=Italian Organized Crime |website=Organized Crime |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010181124/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref> At the Mafia's peak, there were at least 26 cities around the United States with Cosa Nostra families, with many more offshoots and associates in other cities.

At its peak, the American Mafia dominated organized crime in the United States. Each crime family has its own territory (except for the Five Families) and operates independently, while nationwide coordination is overseen by [[The Commission (mafia)|the Commission]], which consists of the bosses of each of the strongest families.\n\nToday, most of the Mafia's activities are contained to the [[northeastern United States]] and Chicago, where they continue to dominate organized crime, despite the increasing numbers of other crime groups.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Barrett, Devlin|author2=Gardiner, Sean|title=Structure Keeps Mafia Atop Crime Heap|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704115404576096392318489246|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Gardiner, Sean|author2=Shallwani, Parvaiz|title=Mafia Is Down\u2014but Not Out|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304626804579363363092833756|work=Wall Street Journal|date=24 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==\n{{further|Sicilian Mafia#Etymology}}\n\nThe word ''mafia'' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8ma\u02d0fja|lang}}) derives from the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] adjective ''mafiusu'', which, roughly translated, means \"swagger\", but can also be translated as \"boldness\" or \"[[wikt:bravado|bravado]]\". In reference to a man, ''mafiusu'' (''mafioso'' in Italian) in 19th century [[Sicily]] signified \"fearless\", \"enterprising\", and \"proud\", according to scholar [[Diego Gambetta]].<ref name=\"mafiusu\">This etymology is based on the books ''Che cosa \u00e8 la mafia?'' by [[Gaetano Mosca]], ''Mafioso'' by Gaia Servadio, ''The Sicilian Mafia'' by Diego Gambetta, ''Mafia & Mafiosi'' by Henner Hess, and ''Cosa Nostra'' by John Dickie (see [[#Books|Books]] below).</ref> In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective ''mafiusa'' means 'beautiful' or 'attractive'.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins: The Black Hand===\n{{Main|Black Hand (extortion)}}\n[[File:Paul Kelly-2.jpg|thumb|Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli (also known as [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]]), founder of the [[Five Points Gang]]]]\nThe first published account of what became the Mafia in the United States dates to the spring of 1869. The ''[[Times-Picayune|New Orleans Times]]'' reported that the city's Second District had become overrun by \"well-known and notorious Sicilian murderers, counterfeiters and burglars, who, in the last month, have formed a sort of general co-partnership or stock company for the plunder and disturbance of the city.\" Emigration from southern Italy to the Americas was primarily to Brazil and Argentina, and New Orleans had a heavy volume of port traffic to and from both locales.\n\nMafia groups in the United States first became influential in the New York City area, gradually progressing from small neighborhood operations in poor [[Little Italy|Italian ghettos]] to citywide and eventually national organizations. The Black Hand was a name given to an [[extortion]] method used in Italian neighborhoods at the turn of the 20th century. It has been sometimes mistaken for the Mafia itself, which it is not. The Black Hand was a criminal society, but there were many small Black Hand gangs. Black Hand extortion was often (wrongly) viewed as the activity of a single organization because Black Hand criminals in Italian communities throughout the United States used the same methods of extortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/lippmanstudy/articles/Lombardo.pdf |title=Sagepub.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}</ref>\n\n[[Giuseppe Morello]] was the first known Mafia member to immigrate to the United States.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, and the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He was arrested in [[New Orleans]] in 1881 and extradited to Italy.<ref name=\"FBI\"/>\n\nNew Orleans was also the site of the first possible Mafia incident in the United States that received both national and international attention.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> On October 15, 1890, New Orleans Police Superintendent [[David Hennessy]] was murdered execution-style.

Kelly recruited some street hoodlums who later became some of the most famous crime bosses of the century such as [[Johnny Torrio]], [[Al Capone]], [[Lucky Luciano]] and [[Frankie Yale]]. They were often in conflict with the [[Eastman Gang|Jewish Eastmans]] of the same area. There was also an influential Mafia family in East Harlem. The Neapolitan [[Camorra]] was also very active in Brooklyn. In Chicago, the 19th Ward was an Italian neighborhood that became known as the \"Bloody Nineteenth\" due to the frequent violence in the ward, mostly as a result of Mafia activity, [[feud]]s, and vendettas.\n\n===Prohibition era===<!--pls do not change, [[The Mafia during Prohibition]] links to here -->\nOn January 16, 1919, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] began in the United States with the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] making it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell alcohol. Despite these bans, there was still a very high demand for it from the public. This created an atmosphere that tolerated crime as a means to provide liquor to the public, even among the police and city politicians. Not explicitly related to Mafia involvement the murder rate during the Prohibition Era rose from 6.8 per 100,000 individuals to 9.7 and within the first three months proceeding the Eighteenth Amendment, a half million dollars in bonded whiskey was stolen from government warehouses.<ref>Abadinsky, Howard.

The Mafia thrived by following a strict set of rules that originated in Sicily that called for an organized hierarchical structure and a [[code of silence]] that forbade its members from cooperating with the police ([[Omert\u00e0]]). Failure to follow any of these rules was punishable by death.\n\nThe rise of power that the Mafia acquired during Prohibition would continue long after alcohol was made legal again. Criminal empires which had expanded on bootleg money would find other avenues to continue making large sums of money.

More importantly, he revealed Mafia's existence to the law, which enabled the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] to begin an aggressive assault on the Mafia's National Crime Syndicate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/valachi/index_1.html |title=The Dying of the Light: The Joseph Valachi Story \u2014 Prologue \u2014 Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |accessdate=2011-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119192112/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/valachi/index_1.html |archive-date=2012-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following Valachi's testimony, the Mafia could no longer operate completely in the shadows. The FBI put a lot more effort and resources into organized crime actives nationwide and created the [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force]] in various cities. However, while all this created more pressure on the Mafia, it did little to curb their criminal activities. Success was made by the beginning of the 1980s, when the FBI was able to rid Las Vegas casinos of Mafia control and made a determined effort to loosen the Mafia's strong hold on labor unions.\n\n=== Mafia involvement in the US economy ===\n[[File:Carlo_Gambino.jpg|thumb|[[Carlo Gambino]], head of the Gambino crime family]]\nBy the late 1970s, the Mafia were involved in many industries,<ref name=\"FBI\"/> including betting on college sports.

They created schemes to keep the money that they owed in taxes after the sale of millions of dollars' worth of wholesale petroleum. This allowed them to sell more gasoline at even lower prices. [[Michael Franzese]], also known as the Yuppie Don, ran and organized a gas scandal and stole over $290 million in gasoline taxes by evading the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and shutting down the gas station before government officials could make him pay what he owed. Franzese was caught in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-03-26/news/8501110652_1_gas-tax-michael-franzese-colombo-crime-family|title=Gas-tax Fraud Tied To Mob Families|website=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Mafia-Aided Scheme Evades Millions in Gas Taxes|first=Selwyn|last=Raab|date=February 6, 1989|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/06/nyregion/mafia-aided-scheme-evades-millions-in-gas-taxes.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLabor racketeering helped the Mafia control many industries from a macroeconomic scale. This tactic helped them grow in power and influence in many cities with big labor unions such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and many others. Many members of the Mafia were enlisted in unions and even became union executives. [[La Cosa Nostra]] was a Mafia group that rose to [[economic power]] through their heavy involvement in unions. The Mafia has controlled unions all over the U.S. to extort money and resources out of big business, with recent indictments of corruption involving the New Jersey Waterfront Union, the Concrete Workers Union, and the [[Teamster Union|teamster union]].<ref>{{Cite news|ssrn=2002404|title=American Gangsters: RICO, Criminal Syndicates, and Conspiracy Law as Market Control|last=Levin|first=Benjamin|date=2013|work=periodical}}</ref>\n\nRestaurants were yet another powerful means by which the Mafia could gain economic power. A large concentration of Mafia owned restaurants were in New York City. Not only were they the setting of many killings and important meetings, but they were also an effective means of smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods. From 1985 to 1987, Sicilian Mafiosi in the U.S. imported an estimated $1.65 billion worth of heroin [[Pizza Connection Trial|through pizzerias]], hiding the cargo in various food products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/218555.pdf|title=United Nations Activities: La Cosa Nostra in the United States|last=Finckenauer|first=James O.|date=December 6, 2007|work=International Center National Institute of Justice|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref name=nyt030504>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/03/nyregion/gaetano-badalamenti-80-led-pizza-connection-ring.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Gaetano Badalamenti, 80; Led Pizza Connection Ring], The New York Times (Obituary), May 3, 2004</ref>\n\nAnother one of the areas of the economy that the Mafia was most influential was [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], beginning just after World War II with the opening of the first gambling resort \"[[Flamingo Las Vegas|The Flamingo]]\".<ref name=\"weebly\"/> Many credit the Mafia with being a big part of the city's development in the mid 20th Century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/03/nevadas-20th-century-economy-a-tale-of-water-minin/|title=Nevada's 20th century economy a tale of water, mining, casinos|date=2000-01-03|website=LasVegasSun.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> It was through millions of dollars in capital flowing into new casino resorts that laid the foundation for further economic growth. This capital didn't come from one Mafia family alone, but many throughout the country seeking to gain even more power and wealth.

Tourism in the city greatly increased through the 1960s and strengthened the local economy.\n\nHowever, the 1960s was also when the Mafia's influence in the Las Vegas economy began to dwindle.<ref name=\"weebly\"/> The Nevada State government and Federal government had been working to weaken Mafia activity on [[Las Vegas Strip|the Strip]]. In 1969, the Nevada State Legislature passed a law that made it easier for corporations to own casinos. This brought new investors to the local economy to buy casinos from the Mafia. The U.S. Congress passed the [[RICO Act]] a year later. This law gave more authority to law enforcement to pursue the Mafia for its illegal activities. There was a sharp decline in the mob involvement in Las Vegas in the 1980s. Through the RICO law, many in the Mafia were convicted and imprisoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/nevada-150/siegel-spilotro-mafia-influenced-gambling-regulation-las-vegas|title=From Siegel to Spilotro, Mafia influenced gambling, regulation in Las Vegas|last=REVIEW-JOURNAL|first=JEFF GERMAN LAS VEGAS|date=2014-03-09|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>\n\n===RICO Act===\n[[File:Sammy Gravano (arrest photo - 1990).jpg|thumb|[[Sammy Gravano]]]]\n\nWhen the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO Act) became federal law in 1970, it became a highly effective tool in prosecuting mobsters.

As a result, the Mafia has seen a major decline in its power and influence in organized crime since the 1990s.\n\nOn January 9, 2003, [[Bonanno crime family]] boss [[Joseph Massino]] was arrested and indicted, alongside [[Salvatore Vitale]], [[Frank Lino]] and capo Daniel Mongelli, in a comprehensive racketeering indictment.

While similar to its Sicilian origins, the American Mafia's modern organizational structure was created by Salvatore Maranzano in 1931. He created the [[Five Families]], each of which would have a [[crime boss|boss]], [[underboss]], [[caporegime|capos]], [[soldato|soldiers]], and associates, would be composed of only full-blooded Italian Americans, while associates could come from any background.<ref name=\"A Chronicle of Bloodletting\">{{cite news|title=A Chronicle of Bloodletting|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,902999-1,00.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=July 12, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia|year=2010|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345523570|pages=384\u2013386}}</ref><ref name=\"FiveFamilies\"/> All inducted members of the Mafia are called [[Made man|\"made\" men]]. This signifies that they are untouchable in the criminal underworld and any harm brought to them will be met with retaliation. With the exception of associates, all mobsters are \"made\" official members of a crime family. The three highest positions make up the administration. Below the administration, there are factions each headed by a ''caporegime'' (captain), who lead a crew of soldiers and associates. They report to the administration and can be seen as equivalent to managers in a business. When a boss makes a decision, he rarely issues orders directly to workers who would carry it out, but instead passed instructions down through the [[chain of command]]. This way, the higher levels of the organization are insulated from law enforcement attention if the lower level members who actually commit the crime should be captured or investigated, providing [[plausible deniability]].\n\nThere are occasionally other positions in the family leadership. Frequently, ruling panels have been set up when a boss goes to jail to divide the responsibility of the family (these usually consist of three or five members). This also helps divert police attention from any one member. The family messenger and street boss were positions created by former Genovese family leader [[Vincent Gigante]].\n* '''Boss''' \u2013 The [[Crime boss|boss]] is the head of the family, usually reigning as a dictator, sometimes called the Don or \"Godfather\". The boss receives a cut of every operation. Operations are taken on by every member of the family and of the region's occupying family.<ref>Abadinsky, Howard. Organized Crime. 7th ed. Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2003.</ref> Depending on the family, the boss may be chosen by a vote from the caporegimes of the family. In the event of a tie, the underboss must vote. In the past, all the members of a family voted on the boss, but by the late 1950s, any gathering such as that usually attracted too much attention.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\">Capeci, Jerry. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia''. Indianapolis: Alpha Books, 2002</ref> In practice, many of these elections are seen as having an inevitable result, such as that of [[John Gotti]] in 1986. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], a meeting was held in a basement during which all capos were searched and Gotti's men stood ominously behind them. Gotti was then proclaimed boss.\n* '''Underboss''' \u2013 The [[underboss]], usually appointed by the boss, is the second in command of the family. The underboss often runs the day-to-day responsibilities of the family or oversees its most lucrative rackets. He usually gets a percentage of the family's income from the boss's cut. The underboss is usually first in line to become acting boss if the boss is imprisoned, and is also frequently seen as a logical successor.\n* '''Consigliere''' \u2013 The [[consigliere]] is an advisor to the family and sometimes seen as the boss's \"right-hand man\". He is used as a mediator of disputes and often acts as a representative or aide for the family in meetings with other families, rival criminal organizations, and important business associates. In practice, the consigliere is normally the third ranking member of the administration of a family and was traditionally a senior member carrying the utmost respect of the family and deeply familiar with the inner-workings of the organization. A boss will often appoint a trusted close friend or personal advisor as his official consigliere.\n* '''Caporegime''' (or capo) \u2013 A [[caporegime]] (also captain or skipper) is in charge of a crew, a group of soldiers who report directly to him. Each crew usually contains 10\u201320 soldiers and many more associates. A capo is appointed by the boss and reports to him or the underboss. A captain gives a percentage of his (and his underlings') earnings to the boss and is also responsible for any tasks assigned, including murder. In labor racketeering, it is usually a capo who controls the infiltration of union locals. If a capo becomes powerful enough, he can sometimes wield more power than some of his superiors. In cases like [[Anthony Corallo]] they might even bypass the normal Mafia structure and lead the family when the boss dies.\n* '''Soldier''' (Soldato in Italian) \u2013 A [[Soldato|soldier]] is a member of the family, and traditionally can only be of full Italian background (although today many families require men to be of only half Italian descent, on their father's side). Once a member is made he is untouchable, meaning permission from a soldier's boss must be given before he is murdered. When the books are open, meaning that a family is accepting new members, a made man may recommend an up-and-coming associate to be a new soldier. Soldiers are the main workers of the family, usually committing crimes like assault, murder, extortion, intimidation, etc. In return, they are given profitable rackets to run by their superiors and have full access to their family's connections and power.\n\n[[File:Meyer Lansky NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|Jewish associate [[Meyer Lansky]]'s (right) work with [[Lucky Luciano]] made him an important figure in developing the American Mafia.]]\n* '''Associate''' \u2013 An associate is not a member of the Mafia, but works for a crime family nonetheless. Associates can include a wide range of people who work for the family. An associate can have a wide range of duties from virtually carrying out the same duties as a soldier to being a simple errand boy. This is where prospective mobsters (\"connected guys\") start out to prove their worth. Once a crime family is accepting new members, the best associates are evaluated and picked to become soldiers. An associate can also be a criminal who serves as a go-between or sometimes deals in drugs to keep police attention off the actual members, or they can be people the family does business with (restaurant owners, etc.) In other cases, an associate might be a corrupt [[labor union]] delegate or businessman.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\"/> Non-Italians will never go any further than this, although many non-Italians like [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Bugsy Siegel]], [[Murray Humphreys]], [[Mickey Cohen]], [[Gus Alex]], [[Bumpy Johnson]], [[Frank Sheeran]], [[Gerard Ouimette]], and [[James Burke (gangster)|James Burke]] wielded extreme power within their respective crime families and carried the respect of actual Mafia members. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Rituals and customs==\nThe [[Mafia initiation ritual]] to become a [[made man]] in the Mafia emerged from various sources, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] confraternities and [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodges]] in mid-19th century Sicily.<ref name=\"initiation\">\"Mafia's arcane rituals, and much of the organization's structure, were based largely on those of the Catholic confraternities and even Freemasonry, colored by Sicilian familial traditions and even certain customs associated with military-religious orders of chivalry like the Order of Malta.\" [http://www.bestofsicily.com/mafia.htm The Mafia] from [http://www.bestofsicily.com bestofsicily.com]</ref> At the initiation ceremony, the inductee would have his finger pricked with a needle by the officiating member; a few drops of blood are spilled on a card bearing the likeness of a saint; the card is set on fire; finally, while the card is passed rapidly from hand to hand to avoid burns, the novice takes an oath of loyalty to the Mafia family.

In some rare strict cases, conspiring to commit such a murder is punishable by death. Jewish mobster and Mafia associate [[Dutch Schultz]] was reportedly killed by his Italian peers out of fear that he would carry out a plan to kill [[New York City]] prosecutor [[Thomas Dewey]] and thus bring unprecedented police attention to the Mafia. However, the Mafia has carried out hits on law enforcement, especially in its earlier history. New York police officer [[Joe Petrosino]] was shot by Sicilian mobsters while on duty in Sicily. A statue of him was later erected across the street from a Lucchese hangout.<ref>''Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires''</ref>\n\n===Kefauver Committee===\nIn 1951, a U.S. Senate [[Select or special committee (United States Congress)|special committee]], chaired by Democratic Tennessee Senator [[Estes Kefauver]], determined that a \"sinister criminal organization\" known as the Mafia operated around the United States. The [[United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce]] (known as the \"Kefauver Hearings\"), televised nationwide, captured the attention of the American people and forced the FBI to recognize the existence of organized crime. In 1953, the FBI initiated the \"Top Hoodlum Program\". The purpose of the program was to have agents collect information on the mobsters in their territories and report it regularly to Washington to maintain a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/august07/mobintel080907.htm |title=FBI \u2014 Using Intel to Stop the Mob, Pt. 2 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=1963-10-01 |accessdate=2011-01-26
