It was written entirely in [[C++]] and trimmed to be low power consuming and use the available memory efficiently. Many applications were pre-installed in the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] of the Newton (making for quick start-up) and to save on [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and [[flash memory]] storage for user applications.\n\nIts use of ParaGraph's [[handwriting recognition]] engine has been noted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as a pioneering implementation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\n==Features==\nNewton OS features many interface elements that the [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh system software]] didn't have at the time, such as drawers and the \"poof\" animation. An animation similar to this is found in [[Mac OS X]], and parts of the Newton's handwriting recognition system have been implemented as [[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]] in Mac OS X.\n\n*Sound responsive \u2014 Clicking menus and icons makes a sound; this feature was later introduced in [[Mac OS 8]].\n*Icons - Similar to the Macintosh Desktop metaphor, Newton OS uses icons to open applications.\n*Tabbed documents \u2014 Similar to [[tab (GUI)|tabbed browsing]] in today's browsers and Apple's [[At Ease]] interface, documents titles appear in a small tab at the top right hand of the screen.\n*Screen rotation \u2014 In Newton 2.0, the screen can be rotated to be used for drawing or word processing.\n*File documents \u2014 Notes and Drawings can be categorized. E.g. Fun, Business, Personal, etc.\n*Print documents \u2014 Documents on the Newton can be printed.\n*Send documents \u2014 Documents can be sent to another Newton via Infrared technology or sent using the Internet by E-Mail, or faxed.\n*Menus \u2014 Similar to menus seen in Mac OS, but menu titles are instead presented at the bottom of the screen in small rectangles, making them similar to buttons with attached \"pop-up\" menus.\n\nMany features of the Newton are best appreciated in the context of the history of [[Pen computing]].<ref>[http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/penhist.html Notes on the (relatively unknown) History of Pen-based Computing]</ref><ref>[http://user.erols.com/rwservices/biblio.html Annotated Bibliography in Pen Computing]</ref><ref>{{YouTube|4xnqKdWMa_8|Notes on the History of Pen-based Computing}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\nShortly after the [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]]'s release in 1993, developers were not paying much attention to the new Newton OS API and were still more interested in developing for the Macintosh and Windows platforms.

It was written entirely in [[C++]] and trimmed to be low power consuming and use the available memory efficiently. Many applications were pre-installed in the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] of the Newton (making for quick start-up) and to save on [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and [[flash memory]] storage for user applications.\n\nIts use of ParaGraph's [[handwriting recognition]] engine has been noted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as a pioneering implementation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\n==Features==\nNewton OS features many interface elements that the [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh system software]] didn't have at the time, such as drawers and the \"poof\" animation. An animation similar to this is found in [[Mac OS X]], and parts of the Newton's handwriting recognition system have been implemented as [[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]] in Mac OS X.\n\n*Sound responsive \u2014 Clicking menus and icons makes a sound; this feature was later introduced in [[Mac OS 8]].\n*Icons - Similar to the Macintosh Desktop metaphor, Newton OS uses icons to open applications.\n*Tabbed documents \u2014 Similar to [[tab (GUI)|tabbed browsing]] in today's browsers and Apple's [[At Ease]] interface, documents titles appear in a small tab at the top right hand of the screen.\n*Screen rotation \u2014 In Newton 2.0, the screen can be rotated to be used for drawing or word processing.\n*File documents \u2014 Notes and Drawings can be categorized. E.g. Fun, Business, Personal, etc.\n*Print documents \u2014 Documents on the Newton can be printed.\n*Send documents \u2014 Documents can be sent to another Newton via Infrared technology or sent using the Internet by E-Mail, or faxed.\n*Menus \u2014 Similar to menus seen in Mac OS, but menu titles are instead presented at the bottom of the screen in small rectangles, making them similar to buttons with attached \"pop-up\" menus.\n\nMany features of the Newton are best appreciated in the context of the history of [[Pen computing]].<ref>[http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/penhist.html Notes on the (relatively unknown) History of Pen-based Computing]</ref><ref>[http://user.erols.com/rwservices/biblio.html Annotated Bibliography in Pen Computing]</ref><ref>{{YouTube|4xnqKdWMa_8|Notes on the History of Pen-based Computing}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\nShortly after the [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]]'s release in 1993, developers were not paying much attention to the new Newton OS API and were still more interested in developing for the Macintosh and Windows platforms.

It appears the gang's members may be passing messages to each other in Peterswood. Fatty's voice has broken, and this allows him to use a wide range of new adult disguises, including that of an old woman selling balloons. He also disguises himself to resemble an old man who spends his afternoons sitting on a bench in the middle of the village. The children discover the old man was being used by the gang to pass on messages. They learn the gang plans to meet at a waxworks hall, to discuss their next robbery. Fatty disguises himself as the waxwork of Napoleon so that he can listen in on the gang's meeting. Mr Goon, however, has the same idea and disguises himself as a policeman. During the gang's meeting, Mr. Goon sneezes, giving the game away - but Fatty is caught instead. Fatty is tied up and locked in a cupboard before the gang leaves to carry out another jewellery robbery. Mr Goon leaves Fatty locked in the cupboard to teach him a lesson, but Larry returns to the hall and frees him. The children believe that Mr Goon has solved the mystery before them, as the jewel thieves are arrested. However, a stolen pearl necklace is still missing. The necklace is then  found on the wax figure of Queen Elizabeth in the wax museum and the last member of the gang is arrested.\n\n{{Five Find-Outers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mystery of the Missing Necklace}}\n[[Category:Novels by Enid Blyton]]\n[[Category:1947 British novels]]\n[[Category:Methuen Publishing books]]\n[[Category:1947 children's books]]\n\n\n{{1940s-child-novel-stub}}\n", "name_user": "2601:283:4200:18d0:9d22:d2fe:1e6:3677", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePlot)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_the_Missing_Necklace"}

This includes football matches between the students and the teachers. \n* There is an annual Performance Evening, which is drama, dance, PE, music, and art. \n* In June 2009, an annual event was introduced called 'The FM Factor', a talent show featuring pupils from both Forest and Millais school (hosted at Forest) in which pupils perform dancing, singing, acting, and stand up comedy. In 2009, the contest was won by [[Michael Jackson]] Tribute Group \"The Thrillerz\", who performed a medley of Jacksons hits from the 1980s.\n* In July 2009, three pupils organised and choreographed a 'Teachers got Talent' show featuring musical performances from the staff - and featuring successful acts from the 2009 FM Factor. The event raised \u00a3500 which went towards a local school for children with disabilities. \n* In July 2010 the school collaborated with [[Millais School]] to produce a production of [[Billy Elliot the Musical|'Billy Elliot: The Musical']] in celebration of the shows 5th anniversary in the London West End. It was performed at The Capitol Theatre in Horsham and had three sell-out performances. \n* On the second to last night of the summer term the school held the second FM Factor, the winners being [[Tribal Gaffa Tape]] who performed The Tesco Song.\n* In April 2011 the school put on a production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat\". \n* The school is regular entrants to the [[Rock Challenge UK|UK Rock Challenge]].
