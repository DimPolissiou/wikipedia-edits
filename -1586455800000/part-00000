In [[Scottish Gaelic]] the word is {{lang|gd|'''seanchaidh'''}} ({{IPA-gd|\u02c8\u0283\u025bn\u032a\u02e0\u025bx\u026a|pron}}; plural {{lang|gd|seanchaidhean}}). The word is often [[anglicisation|anglicised]] as '''shanachie'''.\n\nThe word ''seancha\u00ed'', which was spelled ''seanchaidhe'' (plural ''seanchaidhthe'') before the [[Irish language|Irish-language]] spelling reform of 1948, means a bearer of \"old lore\" (''seanchas''). In the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture, long lyric poems which were recited by bards (''[[fili|fil\u00ed]]''), in a tradition echoed by the ''seanchaithe''.\n\n==Traditional art==\n''Seanchaithe'' were servants to the heads of the lineages and kept track of important information for them: laws, genealogies, annals, literature, etc. After the destruction of Gaelic civilization in the 1600s as a result of the English conquests, these more formal roles ceased to exist and the term ''seancha\u00ed'' came to be associated instead with traditional storytellers from the lower classes.\n\nThe ''seanchaithe'' made use of a range of storytelling conventions, styles of speech and gestures that were peculiar to the Irish folk tradition and characterized them as practitioners of their art. Although tales from literary sources found their way into the repertoires of the ''seanchaithe'', a traditional characteristic of their art was the way in which a large corpus of tales was passed from one practitioner to another without ever being written down. ''Seanchaithe'' passed information orally through storytelling from one generation to the next about Irish folklore, myth, history and legend, in medieval times.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/schools/11_16/storyteller/pdf/gen_notes_all.pdf Study Ireland:Storytelling, BBC Northern Ireland]</ref>\n\nThe distinctive role and craft of the ''seancha\u00ed'' is particularly associated with the [[Gaeltacht]] (the Irish-speaking areas of Ireland), although storytellers recognizable as ''seanchaithe'' were also to be found in rural areas throughout English-speaking Ireland. In their storytelling, some displayed archaic [[Hiberno-English]] idioms and vocabulary distinct from the style of ordinary conversation.\n\n==Modern times==\nMembers of the [[Celtic Revival|Irish Cultural Revival]] took a great interest in the art of the ''seancha\u00ed'', and through them the stories that they told were written down, published, and distributed to a global audience.\n\nAt events such as [[mummer]]s' festival in [[New Inn, County Galway]], and the [[All-Ireland]] [[Fleadh Ceoil]] storytellers who preserve the stories and oratory style of the ''seanchaithe'' continue to display their art and compete for awards.

In [[Scottish Gaelic]] the word is {{lang|gd|'''seanchaidh'''}} ({{IPA-gd|\u02c8\u0283\u025bn\u032a\u02e0\u025bx\u026a|pron}}; plural {{lang|gd|seanchaidhean}}). The word is often [[anglicisation|anglicised]] as '''shanachie'''.\n\nThe word ''seancha\u00ed'', which was spelled ''seanchaidhe'' (plural ''seanchaidhthe'') before the [[Irish language|Irish-language]] spelling reform of 1948, means a bearer of \"old lore\" (''seanchas''). In the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture, long lyric poems which were recited by bards (''[[fili|fil\u00ed]]''), in a tradition echoed by the ''seanchaithe''.\n\n==Traditional art==\n''Seanchaithe'' were servants to the heads of the lineages and kept track of important information for them: laws, genealogies, annals, literature, etc. After the destruction of Gaelic civilization in the 1600s as a result of the English conquests, these more formal roles ceased to exist and the term ''seancha\u00ed'' came to be associated instead with traditional storytellers from the lower classes.\n\nThe ''seanchaithe'' made use of a range of storytelling conventions, styles of speech and gestures that were peculiar to the Irish folk tradition and characterized them as practitioners of their art. Although tales from literary sources found their way into the repertoires of the ''seanchaithe'', a traditional characteristic of their art was the way in which a large corpus of tales was passed from one practitioner to another without ever being written down. ''Seanchaithe'' passed information orally through storytelling from one generation to the next about Irish folklore, myth, history and legend, in medieval times.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/schools/11_16/storyteller/pdf/gen_notes_all.pdf Study Ireland:Storytelling, BBC Northern Ireland]</ref>\n\nThe distinctive role and craft of the ''seancha\u00ed'' is particularly associated with the [[Gaeltacht]] (the Irish-speaking areas of Ireland), although storytellers recognizable as ''seanchaithe'' were also to be found in rural areas throughout English-speaking Ireland. In their storytelling, some displayed archaic [[Hiberno-English]] idioms and vocabulary distinct from the style of ordinary conversation.\n\n==Modern times==\nMembers of the [[Celtic Revival|Irish Cultural Revival]] took a great interest in the art of the ''seancha\u00ed'', and through them the stories that they told were written down, published, and distributed to a global audience.\n\nAt events such as [[mummer]]s' festival in [[New Inn, County Galway]], and the [[All-Ireland]] [[Fleadh Ceoil]] storytellers who preserve the stories and oratory style of the ''seanchaithe'' continue to display their art and compete for awards.

It is divided into two primary [[division (business)|divisions]], the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division, and as of 2008 had approximately 342 subsidiary companies.{{Sfn|Volkswagen AG|2009}} Volkswagen also has two major joint-ventures in China ([[FAW-Volkswagen]] and [[SAIC Volkswagen]]). The company has operations in approximately 150 countries and operates 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\n\nVolkswagen was founded in 1937, to manufacture the car which would become known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1965 it acquired [[Auto Union]], which subsequently produced the first post-war Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]]; the latter became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of \u0160koda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade with the country becoming its largest market. In June 2018, Volkswagen Trucks and Buses which comprises the MAN, Scania, and RIO truck brands are renamed to TRATON AG but the marques will not change, said by Andreas Renschler.\n\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], where it is a constituent of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]], and secondary listings on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]], [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. It has been traded in the United States via [[American depositary receipt]]s since 1988, currently on the [[OTC Markets Group|OTC Marketplace]].

It designs, manufactures and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines, and turbomachinery and offers related services including financing, leasing and fleet management. In 2016, it was the world's largest automaker by sales, overtaking [[Toyota]] and keeping this title in 2017, 2018 and 2019 selling 10.9 million vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://focus2move.com/world-car-group-ranking/|title=Focus2move&#124; World Car Group Ranking - the top 25 in the 2019|date=29 July 2019|access-date=24 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415143754/https://focus2move.com/world-car-group-ranking/|archive-date=15 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades.<ref name=\"ACEA2012\">{{cite web|title=NEW PASSENGER CAR REGISTRATIONS BY MANUFACTURER EUROPEAN UNION (EU)|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20130116_PRPC-FINAL-1212.xls|format=XLS|publisher=ACEA|date=16 January 2013|accessdate=15 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203181621/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20130116_PRPC-FINAL-1212.xls|archivedate=3 February 2013}}</ref> It ranked seventh in the 2018 [[Fortune Global 500]] list of the world's largest companies.<ref>fortune.com/global500/list/</ref>\nVolkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the [[Audi]], [[Bentley]], [[Bugatti Automobiles|Bugatti]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Porsche]], [[SEAT]], [[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]]  and the flagship [[Volkswagen]] marques; motorcycles under the [[Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.|Ducati]] brand; and [[TRATON]] (commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses) under the marques [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[Scania AB|Scania]], and [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]]. It is divided into two primary [[division (business)|divisions]], the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division, and as of 2008 had approximately 342 subsidiary companies.{{Sfn|Volkswagen AG|2009}} Volkswagen also has two major joint-ventures in China ([[FAW-Volkswagen]] and [[SAIC Volkswagen]]). The company has operations in approximately 150 countries and operates 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\n\nVolkswagen was founded in 1937, to manufacture the car which would become known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1965 it acquired [[Auto Union]], which subsequently produced the first post-war Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]]; the latter became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of \u0160koda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade with the country becoming its largest market. In June 2018, Volkswagen Trucks and Buses which comprises the MAN, Scania, and RIO truck brands are renamed to TRATON AG but the marques will not change, said by Andreas Renschler.\n\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], where it is a constituent of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]], and secondary listings on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]], [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. It has been traded in the United States via [[American depositary receipt]]s since 1988, currently on the [[OTC Markets Group|OTC Marketplace]].
