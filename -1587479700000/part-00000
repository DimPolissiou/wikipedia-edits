Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses,<ref>[[Most common words in English]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamu.si/polysemy_top_100|title=Polysemy in top 100 Oxford English Corpus words within Wiktionary|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> which makes the odds of a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'. Particularly \"tu\".|website=Reddit|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> Since its English reference material contains only \"you\" forms, it has difficulty translating a language with \"you all\" or formal \"you\" variations.\n\nDue to differences between languages in investment, research, and the extent of digital resources, the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some languages produce better results than others.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.\n\nIn its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.<ref name=\":52\" /> Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMoreover, like all machine translation programs, Google Translate struggles with [[polysemy]] (the multiple meanings a word may have)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#polysemy|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Polysemy|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> and [[multiword expression]]s (terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#party-terms|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Party Terms|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language.

Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses,<ref>[[Most common words in English]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamu.si/polysemy_top_100|title=Polysemy in top 100 Oxford English Corpus words within Wiktionary|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> which makes the odds of a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'. Particularly \"tu\".|website=Reddit|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> Since its English reference material contains only \"you\" forms, it has difficulty translating a language with \"you all\" or formal \"you\" variations.\n\nDue to differences between languages in investment, research, and the extent of digital resources, the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some languages produce better results than others. Most languages from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well-financed European languages, with Afrikaans and Chinese being the high-scoring exceptions from their continents.<ref name=\"Kamu.si\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freitas|first=Connor|last2=Liu|first2=Yudong|date=December 15, 2017|title=Exploring the Differences between Human and Machine Translation|url=https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=wwu_honors|journal=Western Washington University|volume=|pages=5|via=}}</ref> No languages indigenous to Australia or the Americas are included within Google Translate. Higher scores for European can be partially attributed to the [[Europarl Corpus]], a trove of documents from the [[European Parliament]] that have been professionally translated by the mandate of the [[European Union]] into as many as 21 languages.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.\n\nIn its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.<ref name=\":52\" /> Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMoreover, like all machine translation programs, Google Translate struggles with [[polysemy]] (the multiple meanings a word may have)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#polysemy|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Polysemy|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> and [[multiword expression]]s (terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#party-terms|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Party Terms|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language.

[[Munshi Abdullah]] (Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir), who lived from 1797 to 1854, is regarded as the father of Malay literature. ''Hikayat Abdullah'', his autobiography, is about everyday life at the time when British influence was spreading.

Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the \"[[Hari Merdeka]]\" (Independence Day), otherwise known as \"Merdeka\" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]]. This, as well as [[Labour Day]] (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>  [[Malaysia Day]], held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], and [[Sarawak]], although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/142747 |title=Independence again on Malaysia Day |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=16 September 1963 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nNew Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> [[Muslim holidays]] are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is ''Hari Raya Puasa'' (also called ''Hari Raya Aidilfitri''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/hrya_puasa.htm |title=Festival of Malaysia ~ Hari Raya Puasa |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> which is the Malay translation of [[Eid al-Fitr]]. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of [[Ramadan]], the fasting month. They also celebrate [[Hari Raya Haji]] (also called ''Hari Raya Aidiladha'', the translation of [[Eid ul-Adha]]), Awal Muharram ([[Islamic New Year]]) and [[Mawlid|Maulidur Rasul]] (Birthday of the Prophet).<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\n[[Malaysian Chinese]] typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. [[Chinese New Year]] is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate [[Deepavali]], the festival of light,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> while [[Thaipusam]] is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the [[Batu Caves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/thaipusam.htm |title=Festivals of Malaysia ~ Thaipusam Festival |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> [[Vesak|Wesak]] (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of [[Gawai Dayak|Gawai]] in Sarawak and [[Kaamatan]] in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.<ref name=\"goto1\">{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/holidays.htm |title=Malaysia&nbsp;\u2014 Holidays |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of ''Kongsi Raya'', which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term ''Kongsi Raya'' (which means \"sharing the celebration\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) was coined because of the similarity between the word ''kongsi'' and the Chinese New Year greeting of ''Gong xi fa cai''. Similarly, the portmanteau ''Deepa Raya'' was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf#page=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516014935/http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2011 |title=The English Teacher|publisher=Malaysian English Language Teaching Association|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nA practice known as \"open house\" (''rumah terbuka'') is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend.<ref name=\"matic1\"/> Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as ''balik kampung'' and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=New Straits Times|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010|title=Ripple effect of the festive rush|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914123615/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article|archivedate=14 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main article|Sport in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Man in a workshop making Waus; a purple wau with gold outlines hangs in front of him, as does an empty frame|A [[Wau bulan|wau]] workshop]]\nPopular sports in Malaysia include [[badminton]], [[bowling]], [[Association football|football]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], and [[field hockey]].<ref name=\"Tourism Malaysia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |title=Sports and recreation |work=[[Tourism Malaysia]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902094553/http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |archivedate=2 September 2009 }}</ref> Malaysia has small-scale traditional sports.

The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of [[Laila Majnun]] by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following [[World War II]], most films were directed by directors from [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, [[Permata di-Perlembahan]], was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.<ref name=\"Voices\">{{cite web|author=Hassan Muthalib |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=17 |title=Voices of Malaysian Cinema |publisher=Criticine |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the [[National Film Development Corporation Malaysia|National Film Development Corporation]] in 1981.<ref name=\"Voices\"/> Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.<ref>{{cite web|author=Khoo Gaik Cheng |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=20 |title=Art, Entertainment and Politics |publisher=Criticine |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Malaysia}}\n* [[Malaysian cultural outfits]]\n* [[Television in Malaysia]]\n* [[List of museums in Malaysia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101005111246/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/malaysia.html Malaysia \u2013 Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette]\n* For an informal and highly subjective overview of contemporary Malaysian culture and performing arts, see [https://platypusflatus.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/bolehland-a-cultural-overview/ BOLEHLAND: AN UPDATED CULTURAL OVERVIEW] by arts reviewer Antares\n\n{{Malaysia topics}}\n{{Southeast Asia topic|Culture of}}\n{{Culture of Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culture Of Malaysia}}\n[[Category:Malaysian culture| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=December 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2014}}\nThe '''culture of Malaysia''' draws on the varied cultures of the different people of [[Malaysia]]. The first people to live in the area were [[Orang Asal|indigenous tribes]] that still remain; they were followed by the [[Malay people|Malays]], who moved there from mainland Asia in ancient times. [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Indian Culture|Indian]] cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased with immigration to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include [[Persian culture|Persian]], [[Arabic culture|Arabic]], [[British culture|British]]. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover.\n\nArts and music have a long tradition in Malaysia, with Malay art dating back to the Malay sultanates. Traditional art was centred on fields such as carving, silversmithing, and weaving. [[Islam]]ic taboos restricted artwork depicting humans until the mid-20th century. Performing arts and shadow puppet shows are popular, and often show Indian influences. Various influences can be seen in architecture, from individual cultures in Malaysia and from other countries. Large modern structures have been built, including the tallest twin buildings in the world, the [[Petronas Twin Towers]]. Malaysian music has a variety of origins, and is largely based around percussion instruments. Much early Malaysian literature was based on Indian epics, which remained unchanged even as Malays converted to Islam; this has expanded in recent decades. English literature remained restricted to the higher class until the arrival of the printing press. Locally created Chinese and Indian literature appeared in the 19th century.\n\nCuisine is often divided along ethnic lines, but some dishes exist which have mixed foods from different ethnicities. Each major religious group has its major holy days declared as official holidays. Official holidays differ by state; the most widespread one is [[Hari Merdeka|Merdeka day]] which celebrates the independence of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. Although festivals often stem from a specific ethnic background, they are celebrated by all people in Malaysia. Traditional sports are popular in Malaysia, while it has become a powerhouse in international sports such as [[badminton]]. Malaysia hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1998, the first Commonwealth Games where the torch passed through more countries than England and the host.\n\nThe Malaysian government has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the \"1971 National Culture Policy\", which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. This especially affected language; only [[Malaysian language|Malay]] texts are considered official cultural texts. Government control over the media is strong, and most media outlets are related to the government in some way.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malaysia states named.png|thumb|600px|alt=Map of Malaysia with labels of each state and federal territory|[[Peninsular Malaysia]] (left) is 40% of [[Malaysia]]'s territory, and is predominately [[Islamic]]. The two states of [[East Malaysia]] are mostly [[Christians|Christian]]. The capital of Malaysia is [[Kuala Lumpur]].]]\n[[Malaysia]] consists of two distinct geographical regions: [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[East Malaysia]]. Malaysia was formed when the [[Federation of Malaya]] merged with [[North Borneo]] (today the province of [[Sabah]]), [[Sarawak]], and [[Singapore]] (seceded 1965) in 1963,<ref name=\"CIA Fact Book\"/> and cultural differences between Peninsular and East Malaysia remain. During the formation of Malaysia, executive power was vested in the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Perikatan]] (later the  [[Barisan Nasional]]) coalition of three racially based political parties, namely the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), and [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/35825-was-merdeka-taken-or-was-it-given |title=Was Merdeka taken or was it given? |publisher=Malaysia-today.net |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111112802/http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/35825-was-merdeka-taken-or-was-it-given |archivedate=11 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> UMNO has dominated the coalition from its inception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2777.htm |title=Malaysia |publisher=State.gov |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref> Although [[Islam]] is the official [[state religion]], the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] guarantees [[freedom of religion]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37973 |title=No Freedom of Worship for Muslims Says Court |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527203413/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37973 |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{see also|Demographics of Malaysia}}\n\nMalaysia is a multi\u2013ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society, and the many ethnic groups in Malaysia maintain separate cultural identities.<ref>{{cite book| last=Kahn| first=Joel S.| title=Southeast Asian Identities: Culture and the Politics of Representation in Indonesia, Malaysian, Singapore and Thailand| publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies| year=1998| location=Singapore| page=169| url=https://www.google.com/books?id=CtbQ2LRJ6YIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=981-3055-79-0}}</ref> The society of Malaysia has been described as \"Asia in miniature\".<ref>{{cite book| last1=Andaya| first1=Barbara Watson| last2=Andaya| first2=Leonard Y.| title=A History of Malaysia| publisher=MacMillan Press Ltd.| year=1982| location=London| page=xiii| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5GSBCcNn1fsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=0-333-27672-8}}</ref> The original culture of the area stemmed from its indigenous tribes, along with the [[Malay people|Malays]] who moved there in ancient times.

Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the \"[[Hari Merdeka]]\" (Independence Day), otherwise known as \"Merdeka\" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]]. This, as well as [[Labour Day]] (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>  [[Malaysia Day]], held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], and [[Sarawak]], although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/142747 |title=Independence again on Malaysia Day |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=16 September 1963 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nNew Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> [[Muslim holidays]] are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is ''Hari Raya Puasa'' (also called ''Hari Raya Aidilfitri''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/hrya_puasa.htm |title=Festival of Malaysia ~ Hari Raya Puasa |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> which is the Malay translation of [[Eid al-Fitr]]. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of [[Ramadan]], the fasting month. They also celebrate [[Hari Raya Haji]] (also called ''Hari Raya Aidiladha'', the translation of [[Eid ul-Adha]]), Awal Muharram ([[Islamic New Year]]) and [[Mawlid|Maulidur Rasul]] (Birthday of the Prophet).<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\n[[Malaysian Chinese]] typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. [[Chinese New Year]] is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate [[Deepavali]], the festival of light,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> while [[Thaipusam]] is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the [[Batu Caves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/thaipusam.htm |title=Festivals of Malaysia ~ Thaipusam Festival |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> [[Vesak|Wesak]] (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of [[Gawai Dayak|Gawai]] in Sarawak and [[Kaamatan]] in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.<ref name=\"goto1\">{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/holidays.htm |title=Malaysia&nbsp;\u2014 Holidays |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of ''Kongsi Raya'', which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term ''Kongsi Raya'' (which means \"sharing the celebration\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) was coined because of the similarity between the word ''kongsi'' and the Chinese New Year greeting of ''Gong xi fa cai''. Similarly, the portmanteau ''Deepa Raya'' was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf#page=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516014935/http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2011 |title=The English Teacher|publisher=Malaysian English Language Teaching Association|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nA practice known as \"open house\" (''rumah terbuka'') is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend.<ref name=\"matic1\"/> Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as ''balik kampung'' and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=New Straits Times|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010|title=Ripple effect of the festive rush|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914123615/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article|archivedate=14 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main article|Sport in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Man in a workshop making Waus; a purple wau with gold outlines hangs in front of him, as does an empty frame|A [[Wau bulan|wau]] workshop]]\nPopular sports in Malaysia include [[badminton]], [[bowling]], [[Association football|football]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], and [[field hockey]].<ref name=\"Tourism Malaysia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |title=Sports and recreation |work=[[Tourism Malaysia]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902094553/http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |archivedate=2 September 2009 }}</ref> Malaysia has small-scale traditional sports.

The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of [[Laila Majnun]] by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following [[World War II]], most films were directed by directors from [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, [[Permata di-Perlembahan]], was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.<ref name=\"Voices\">{{cite web|author=Hassan Muthalib |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=17 |title=Voices of Malaysian Cinema |publisher=Criticine |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the [[National Film Development Corporation Malaysia|National Film Development Corporation]] in 1981.<ref name=\"Voices\"/> Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.<ref>{{cite web|author=Khoo Gaik Cheng |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=20 |title=Art, Entertainment and Politics |publisher=Criticine |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Malaysia}}\n* [[Malaysian cultural outfits]]\n* [[Television in Malaysia]]\n* [[List of museums in Malaysia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101005111246/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/malaysia.html Malaysia \u2013 Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette]\n* For an informal and highly subjective overview of contemporary Malaysian culture and performing arts, see [https://platypusflatus.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/bolehland-a-cultural-overview/ BOLEHLAND: AN UPDATED CULTURAL OVERVIEW] by arts reviewer Antares\n\n{{Malaysia topics}}\n{{Southeast Asia topic|Culture of}}\n{{Culture of Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culture Of Malaysia}}\n[[Category:Malaysian culture| ]]\n", "name_user": "83.137.205.37", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Malaysia"}
