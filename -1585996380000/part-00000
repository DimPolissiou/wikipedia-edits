A 14th century writer of the ''Gesta'' (chronicle) of the [[Abbey of St Truiden]] said that the parents of Giselbert and Balderic were Count Otto of Loon (otherwise unknown) and his wife Lutgarde, daughter of Countess Ermengarde of Namur, who was supposedly a daughter of [[Otto, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Duke Otto of Lower Lotharingia]].<ref name=gesta/> However, there are doubts about the reliability of this much later source.

There are at least two such proposals:\n:*J.M. Winter proposed that Otto was a son of Rudolf.\n:*Jongbloed proposed that Otto was son of Nevelong's daughter Bertha.\n\nIn medieval records, Bishop Balderic II of Li\u00e8ge, about which more is written than his brothers, was said to be a kinsman of both [[Lambert I, Count of Louvain]] and Arnoul of Valenciennes, a grandson of Nevelong and his Regnarid wife.<ref>That bishop Balderic II of Li\u00e8ge had common ancestry with Count Arnoul, who modern historians believe to mean Arnoul of Valenciennes, grandson of Nevelong, is mentioned in his biography the ''Vita Balderici Ep.

More difficult to interpret, and also related to the same general northern river delta area, just before the [[Battle of Vlaardingen]], where Balderic died of sickness on campaign, he was accused of wanting to spare a blood-relative, which implies a close relationship to Count [[Dirk III of Holland]].<ref>''Vita Balderici'' [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000871_00750.html?sortIndex=010%3A050%3A0004%3A010%3A00%3A00&contextSort=sortKey&contextType=scan&contextOrder=descending&sort=score&order=desc&context=%22Gesta+episc.+Leod.%22&hl=false&fulltext=Anselme%2C+Gesta+episc.+Leod. p.735].</ref>\n\nGiselbert's brother Arnulf (or Arnoul, or Arnold) was apparently described in 1040 as count of a [[Counts of Hesbaye|county named Haspinga]], in the land of Haspingow, a reference which has caused many different interpretations.<ref>Latin: \"comitatum Arnoldi comitis nomine Haspinga in pago Haspingowi\", in a grant of this county by [[Emperor Henry III]] to [[Saint Lambert's Cathedral, Li\u00e8ge]].

In any case when the male line of the Counts died out, the Bishop claimed the county successfully.\n\n==Life==\nIt is not certain when Giselbert started his rule, but his brother Balderic became Bishop by 1008. The third continuation of the medieval chronicle kept at the nearby Abbey of St Truiden (''Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia'') states that Giselbert did not become count until about 1021, after his brother Bishop Balderic II died in 1018, and it says there were some years between his father's death and him taking up the position. Records from Li\u00e8ge on the other hand seem to indicate that Giselbert was already an adult and count during his brother's reign.<ref name=gesta>''Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia'': Camille de Bormans ed. and trans. ''[https://books.google.be/books?id=2BE8f14eLHQC Chronique de l'abbaye de Saint-Trond]''; Dutch translation by Lavigne, ''Kroniek van de abdij van Sint-Truiden''. (''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' edition, SS X, [https://www.dmgh.de/mgh_ss_10/index.htm#page/382 p.382]ff is less complete for these passages.)</ref>\n\nGiselbert apparently died around 1045, because in 1044 a charter of St. Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my of Li\u00e9ge mentions a count Giselbert, probably (but not certainly) him, and in May 1046 the next generation of counts, the brothers Emmo and Otto, appear as counts of Loon.<ref>The identification is for example doubted by Verhelst. The 1044 charter is analyzed in Bormans (1861)  \"Notice d'un manuscrit intitul\u00e9 Cartulaire de Van den Berch, conserv\u00e9 aux archives de l'\u00c9tat, \u00e0 Li\u00e8ge\" ''Bulletin de la Commission royale d'Histoire'' 3rd series 2 p.280 [http://www.persee.fr/doc/bcrh_0770-6707_1861_num_30_2_3013]. The 1046 charter is reproduced in Miraeus (Foppens ed.) ''Opera diplomatica et historica'' III [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433000039218?urlappend=%3Bseq=321 p.303]</ref>\n\nAs pointed out for example by Verhelst (1984), it is not certain that Giselbert of Loon was the father of the next counts of Loon, Emmo and Otto. There is no medieval source which confirms that relationship. \n\nGiselbert's county was based in [[Borgloon]], originally simply called Loon. The castle, probably built by his grandson, was a motte-and-bailey, with a hall and a chapel in the front court.<ref>Vaes p.129</ref> The area nearby forms the core of the modern town. The castle itself was destroyed some generations later and the hill on which it stood was excavated in the 19th century.\n\nGiselbert was the first known advocate (''voogd'', ''advocatus'') of the Saint-Jacobs-Abbey Liege, founded by his brother Balderic.\n\n==Succession==\n\nGiselbert was succeeded as Count of Loon by two brothers: \n*[[Emmo van Loon|Count Emmo]] (d. before 1078), possibly Giselbert's son. Ancestor of the counts of Loon.\n*[[Otto I, Count of Duras|Count Otto]], also described in contemporary records as a count \"of Loon\"; may have shared his brother's rule in some way. Ancestor of the [[County of Duras|counts of Duras]].\n\nNo wife is named for Giselbert in medieval records. A noblewoman named Erlende is sometimes mentioned in genealogies, including the ''[[Europaische Stammtafeln]]''. As explained by Baerten (1965 part I) this is no longer accepted. The ''Vita Arnulfi'' describes Lutgarde of Namur as mother of both Emmo Count of Loon, who was father of Count Arnulf of Loon and his sister Sophia, and also Otto, who was father of Count Gislebert of Duras. This Lutgarde is described as a sister of Count Albert of Namur. Her husband is not named there.<ref>''Vita Arnulfi Episcopi Suessioniensis'' I.3, MGH SS XV.2, [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000889_00316.html?sortIndex=010%3A050%3A0015%3A010%3A02%3A00&zoom=0.75 p. 879].</ref> But the ''Gesta'' of St Truiden appears to say that the same Lutgarde was the mother of Bishop Balderic II, the brother of Emmo's supposed father Gilbert.<ref>''Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia'' 1007, MGH SS X, [https://books.google.be/books?id=gRAaxM2uGjIC&pg=PA382 p.382]</ref> In short, these sources are in conflict with each other, and at least one of them seems to be misinterpreting the facts.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Baerten (1965), \"Les origines des comtes de Looz et la formation territoriale du comt\u00e9\", ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'', 43 (2): [http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/rbph_0035-0818_1965_num_43_2_2570.pdf link]\n*Baerten, Jean (1969), ''Het Graafschap Loon (11de - 14de eeuw)'' [http://www.shclimburg.nl/sites/shclimburg.nl/files/maaslandse-monografieen/MM%2009%20def.pdf link]\n*Jongbloed (2008), \"Flamenses in de elfde eeuw\", Bijdragen en Mededelingen Gelre\n*Kupper, Jean-Louis.

In any case when the male line of the Counts died out, the Bishop claimed the county successfully.\n\n==Life==\nIt is not certain when Giselbert started his rule, but his brother Balderic became Bishop by 1008. The third continuation of the medieval chronicle kept at the nearby Abbey of St Truiden (''Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia'') states that Giselbert did not become count until about 1021, after his brother Bishop Balderic II died in 1018, and it says there were some years between his father's death and him taking up the position. Records from Li\u00e8ge on the other hand seem to indicate that Giselbert was already an adult and count during his brother's reign.<ref name=gesta>''Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia'': Camille de Bormans ed. and trans. ''[https://books.google.be/books?id=2BE8f14eLHQC Chronique de l'abbaye de Saint-Trond]''; Dutch translation by Lavigne, ''Kroniek van de abdij van Sint-Truiden''. (''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' edition, SS X, [https://www.dmgh.de/mgh_ss_10/index.htm#page/382 p.382]ff is less complete for these passages.)</ref>\n\nGiselbert apparently died around 1045, because in 1044 a charter of St. Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my of Li\u00e9ge mentions a count Giselbert, probably (but not certainly) him, and in May 1046 the next generation of counts, the brothers Emmo and Otto, appear as counts of Loon.<ref>The identification is for example doubted by Verhelst.</ref> The 1044 charter is analyzed in Bormans (1861)  \"Notice d'un manuscrit intitul\u00e9 Cartulaire de Van den Berch, conserv\u00e9 aux archives de l'\u00c9tat, \u00e0 Li\u00e8ge\" ''Bulletin de la Commission royale d'Histoire'' 3rd series 2 p.280 [http://www.persee.fr/doc/bcrh_0770-6707_1861_num_30_2_3013].

''Opera diplomatica et historica'' III [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433000039218?urlappend=%3Bseq=321 p.303]</ref>\n\nAs pointed out for example by Verhelst (1984), it is not certain that Giselbert of Loon was the father of the next counts of Loon, Emmo and Otto. There is no medieval source which confirms that relationship. \n\nGiselbert's county was based in [[Borgloon]], originally simply called Loon. The castle, probably built by his grandson, was a motte-and-bailey, with a hall and a chapel in the front court.<ref>Vaes p.129</ref> The area nearby forms the core of the modern town. The castle itself was destroyed some generations later and the hill on which it stood was excavated in the 19th century.\n\nGiselbert was the first known advocate (''voogd'', ''advocatus'') of the Saint-Jacobs-Abbey Liege, founded by his brother Balderic.\n\n==Succession==\n\nGiselbert was succeeded as Count of Loon by two brothers: \n*[[Emmo van Loon|Count Emmo]] (d. before 1078), possibly Giselbert's son. Ancestor of the counts of Loon.\n*[[Otto I, Count of Duras|Count Otto]], also described in contemporary records as a count \"of Loon\"; may have shared his brother's rule in some way. Ancestor of the [[County of Duras|counts of Duras]].\n\nNo wife is named for Giselbert in medieval records. A noblewoman named Erlende is sometimes mentioned in genealogies, including the ''[[Europaische Stammtafeln]]''. As explained by Baerten (1965 part I) this is no longer accepted. The ''Vita Arnulfi'' describes Lutgarde of Namur as mother of both Emmo Count of Loon, who was father of Count Arnulf of Loon and his sister Sophia, and also Otto, who was father of Count Gislebert of Duras. This Lutgarde is described as a sister of Count Albert of Namur. Her husband is not named there.<ref>''Vita Arnulfi Episcopi Suessioniensis'' I.3, MGH SS XV.2, [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000889_00316.html?sortIndex=010%3A050%3A0015%3A010%3A02%3A00&zoom=0.75 p. 879].</ref> But the ''Gesta'' of St Truiden appears to say that the same Lutgarde was the mother of Bishop Balderic II, the brother of Emmo's supposed father Gilbert.<ref>''Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia'' 1007, MGH SS X, [https://books.google.be/books?id=gRAaxM2uGjIC&pg=PA382 p.382]</ref> In short, these sources are in conflict with each other, and at least one of them seems to be misinterpreting the facts.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Baerten (1965), \"Les origines des comtes de Looz et la formation territoriale du comt\u00e9\", ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'', 43 (2): [http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/rbph_0035-0818_1965_num_43_2_2570.pdf link]\n*Baerten, Jean (1969), ''Het Graafschap Loon (11de - 14de eeuw)'' [http://www.shclimburg.nl/sites/shclimburg.nl/files/maaslandse-monografieen/MM%2009%20def.pdf link]\n*Jongbloed (2008), \"Flamenses in de elfde eeuw\", Bijdragen en Mededelingen Gelre\n*Kupper, Jean-Louis.

The oldest known [[Japantown]] featuring a Japanese cemetery is in [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya District|Ayutthaya]], [[Thailand]], which was established in the 14th to 18th century. The oldest known Japanese national recorded by name and buried outside Japan is the early explorer [[Yamada Nagamasa]]. \n\nWars, particularly World War II, accounted for a large portion of Japanese burial places outside Japan. The cemetery of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in [[Malta]], various burial places of [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Japanese prisoners of war]] in [[Siberia]], and [[Pacific War]] sites including the [[Nanp\u014d Islands]], [[Philippines|the Philippines]], [[New Guinea]], and other [[Pacific Islands]] feature multiple Japanese cemeteries, cenotaphs, and [[Cadaver|remains]] despite soldiers' organizations and/or Japanese government efforts to recover them.\n\nVictims of the United States' internment of its citizens of Japanese ancestry are prevalent in the western United States. \n\n== Location, name of cemetery, cenotaph and tomb ==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n==== Bhutan ====\n* [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] - Burial place with the [[pagoda]] of botanist Keiji Nishioka ({{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u897f\u5ca1\u4eac\u6cbb|\u897f\u5ca1\u4eac\u6cbb]]}})\n\n==== Cambodia ====\n* [[Phnom Penh]] - Cenotaph, Haruyuki Takada ({{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u9ad8\u7530\u6674\u884c|\u9ad8\u7530 \u6674\u884c]]}}), police, [[Line of duty death]] participate in [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] \u2013 [[Phnom Penh]]\n* [[Siem Reap Province]] - Tomb, [[Taizo Ichinose]]\n* [[Kampong Thom City]], [[Kampong Thom Province]] - ''Atsu Elementary and junior high school'' and monument ''A'' in a garden bearing the name [[Atsuhito Nakata]].
