The town is on the [[River Kennet]], 24 miles (39&nbsp;km) north of Salisbury and 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Swindon]].\n\n==History==\nThe earliest sign of human habitation is the [[Marlborough Mound]], a {{convert|62|ft|m|-high|adj=mid}} prehistoric [[tumulus]] in the grounds of [[Marlborough College]]. Recent [[radiocarbon dating]] has found it to date from about 2400 BC.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-13604479 \"Marlborough Mound: 'Merlin's burial place' built in 2400 BC\" BBC News, 31 May 2011]</ref> It is of similar age to the larger [[Silbury Hill]] about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} west of the town.

More plausibly, the town's name possibly derives from the medieval term for chalky ground \"marl\"\u2014thus, \"town on chalk\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rees |first1=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Rees|title=The Cyclop\u00e6dia: Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature |url=https://archive.org/details/cyclopdiaoruniv01reesgoog |date=1819 |publisher=Longman |location=London |chapter=Marlborough}}</ref> However more recent research, from geographer [[John Everett-Heath]], identifies the original [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] place name as ''Merleberge'', with a derivation from either the personal name of ''M\u00e6rle'' combined with  ''[[:wikt:beorg|beorg]]'' (hill), or ''[[Gentian|meargealla]] beorg'': hill where gentian grows.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everett-Heath |first1=John |title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place Names |date=2000 |isbn=9780191751394 |edition=3 |chapter=Marlborough}}</ref> On [[John Speed]]'s map of [[Wiltshire]] (1611), the town's name is recorded as ''Marlinges boroe''. The town's motto is ''Ubi nunc sapientis ossa Merlini'' (\"Where now are the bones of wise Merlin\").\n\nFurther evidence of human occupation comes from the discovery in St Margaret's Mead of the Marlborough Bucket, an [[Iron Age]] burial bucket made of fir wood with three iron hoops, a top bar and two handles; it also has bronze bands decorated with human heads and mythical animals, and is now on display at the [[Wiltshire Museum]] in [[Devizes]].{{sfn|Pevsner|Cherry|1975|p=347}}\n\n[[Roman Britain|Roman]] remains and the large [[Cunetio Hoard|Mildenhall Hoard]] of coins have been found two miles to the east of Marlborough, at [[Mildenhall, Wiltshire|Mildenhall]] (Cunetio). A later [[Saxons|Saxon]] settlement grew up around The Green and two early river crossings were made at Isbury Lane and Stonebridge Lane.\n\nIn 1067 [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] assumed control of the Marlborough area and set about building a wooden [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte-and-bailey]] [[castle]], sited on the prehistoric mound. This was completed in around 1100. Stone was used to strengthen the castle in around 1175. The first written record of Marlborough dates from the [[Domesday Book]] in 1087. William also established a [[Mint (facility)|mint]] in Marlborough, which coined the William I and the early [[William II of England|William II]] silver pennies. The coins display the name of the town as Maerlebi or Maerleber.\n\nHe also established the neighbouring [[Savernake Forest]] as a favourite royal hunting ground<ref>[http://www.marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history History of Marlborough] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903134133/http://marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history |date=3 September 2009 }}</ref> and Marlborough castle became a royal residence. [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] observed Easter here in 1110. [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] stayed at Marlborough castle in talks with the King of Scotland. His son [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (\"Coeur de Lion\") gave the castle to his brother [[John of England|John]] in 1186. King John was married here and spent time in Marlborough, where he established a [[treasury]].\n\n[[File:Marlborough, Wilts - geograph.org.uk - 44036.jpg|thumb|right|Marlborough Market]]\nIn 1204 King John granted a charter to the borough which permitted an annual eight-day fair, commencing on 14 August, the vigil of the Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Our Lady]] (15 August), in which \"all might enjoy the liberties and quittances customary in the fair at [[Winchester]]\". He also established that weekly markets might be held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. These continue to this day.<ref>[http://www.marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history.htm Borough of Marlborough Charter of 1204]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nLater, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] was also married here.<ref>[http://www.marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history.htm History of Marlborough]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Henry III held [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] here, in 1267, when the [[Statute of Marlborough]] was passed; this gave rights and privileges to small land owners and limited the right of the King to take possession of land. This seven-hundred-year-old law states that no-one shall seize his neighbour's goods for alleged wrong without permission of the Court. Apart from Charters, it is the oldest [[statute]] in [[English law]] which has not yet been repealed.\n\n[[File:Marlborough St Peter.JPG|thumb|right|St Mary's parish church]]\nThe castle fell into disrepair by the end of the 14th century but remained Crown property. [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] then passed it to the [[Seymour family]], his mother's relatives. In 1498 [[Thomas Wolsey]] was ordained priest in (the now redundant) St Peter's church. He later rose to become a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] and [[Lord Chancellor]].\n\nIn 1642 Marlborough's peace was shattered by the [[English Civil War]]. The [[Seymour family|Seymours]] held the Castle for the [[Cavalier|King]] but the town was for [[Roundhead|Parliament]]. With his headquarters in nearby [[Oxford]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] had to deal with Marlborough. \"A Town the most notoriously disaffected of all that Country, otherwise, saving the obstinacy and malice of the inhabitants, in the situation of it very unfit for a garrison... this place the King saw would prove quickly an ill neighbour to him, not only as it was in the heart of a rich County, and so would straighten him, and even infest his quarters.\"\n\nThe King sent Lord [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Digby]] to take the town; he left Oxford at the head of four hundred horses on 24 November 1642. When he arrived, he chose to parley first, thus giving the inhabitants a chance to prepare defences and to recruit troops. They mustered about seven hundred poorly armed men. At this point, the town issued a reply to Digby: \"The King's Majesty, providing he were attended in Royal and not in war like wise, should be as welcome to that town as ever was Prince to People; but as to delivering up the good Town of Marlborough to such a traitor as Lord Digby ... they would sooner die.\" After some early skirmishes, royalist troops infiltrated the town down its small alleyways. The town was captured and looted and many buildings were set ablaze. One hundred and twenty prisoners were marched in chains to Oxford. The town was later abandoned by the king and took no further part in the war.\n\nOn 28 April 1653 the Great Fire of Marlborough started in a tanner's yard and spread quickly, eventually after four hours burning the Guildhall, [[St Mary's Church, Marlborough|St Mary's Church]], the County Armoury, and 244 houses<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/38/casestudy1.htm |last=Lund |first=Ian |title=(1) Fire Damage at Marlborough High Street |publisher=Institute of Historic Building Conservation |accessdate=}}</ref> to the ground.<ref>{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Stephen |year=1996 |title=The Great Fire of London |place=Stroud |publisher=[[The History Press|Alan Sutton Publishing]] |isbn=978-0750907781 |page=3}}</ref> During the rebuilding of the town after the Great Fire, the high street was widened and is often claimed to be the widest in England, though the actual widest is in [[Stockton-on-Tees]]. This wide street allows ample space for the local market. Fire swept through the town again in 1679 and again in 1690. This time, an [[Act of Parliament]] was passed \"to prohibit the covering of houses and other buildings with thatch in the Town of Marlborough\".{{sfn|Crowley|Baggs|Freeman|Stevenson|1983|pp=199\u2013229}}\n\nIn 1804 the [[Marlborough White Horse]] was cut by boys from Mr Greasley's Academy in the High Street.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1901 and 1934 the boundaries of the borough were extended to include the hamlet of [[Preshute]] (which was separated from Preshute civil parish) and the village of [[Manton, Wiltshire|Manton]], both to the west of the town.{{sfn|Crowley|Baggs|Freeman|Stevenson|1983|pp=199\u2013229}}\n \nIn 2004 Marlborough celebrated 800 years of its Town Charter.

More plausibly, the town's name possibly derives from the medieval term for chalky ground \"marl\"\u2014thus, \"town on chalk\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rees |first1=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Rees|title=The Cyclop\u00e6dia: Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature |url=https://archive.org/details/cyclopdiaoruniv01reesgoog |date=1819 |publisher=Longman |location=London |chapter=Marlborough}}</ref> However more recent research, from geographer [[John Everett-Heath]], identifies the original [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] place name as ''Merleberge'', with a derivation from either the personal name of ''M\u00e6rle'' combined with  ''[[:wikt:beorg|beorg]]'' (hill), or ''[[Gentian|meargealla]] beorg'': hill where gentian grows.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everett-Heath |first1=John |title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place Names |date=2000 |isbn=9780191751394 |edition=3 |chapter=Marlborough}}</ref> On [[John Speed]]'s map of [[Wiltshire]] (1611), the town's name is recorded as ''Marlinges boroe''. The town's motto is ''Ubi nunc sapientis ossa Merlini'' (\"Where now are the bones of wise Merlin\").\n\nFurther evidence of human occupation comes from the discovery in St Margaret's Mead of the Marlborough Bucket, an [[Iron Age]] burial bucket made of fir wood with three iron hoops, a top bar and two handles; it also has bronze bands decorated with human heads and mythical animals, and is now on display at the [[Wiltshire Museum]] in [[Devizes]].{{sfn|Pevsner|Cherry|1975|p=347}}\n\n[[Roman Britain|Roman]] remains and the large [[Cunetio Hoard|Mildenhall Hoard]] of coins have been found two miles to the east of Marlborough, at [[Mildenhall, Wiltshire|Mildenhall]] (Cunetio). A later [[Saxons|Saxon]] settlement grew up around The Green and two early river crossings were made at Isbury Lane and Stonebridge Lane.\n\nIn 1067 [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] assumed control of the Marlborough area and set about building a wooden [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte-and-bailey]] [[castle]], sited on the prehistoric mound. This was completed in around 1100. Stone was used to strengthen the castle in around 1175. The first written record of Marlborough dates from the [[Domesday Book]] in 1087. William also established a [[Mint (facility)|mint]] in Marlborough, which coined the William I and the early [[William II of England|William II]] silver pennies. The coins display the name of the town as Maerlebi or Maerleber.\n\nHe also established the neighbouring [[Savernake Forest]] as a favourite royal hunting ground<ref>[http://www.marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history History of Marlborough] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903134133/http://marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history |date=3 September 2009 }}</ref> and Marlborough castle became a royal residence. [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] observed Easter here in 1110. [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] stayed at Marlborough castle in talks with the King of Scotland. His son [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (\"Coeur de Lion\") gave the castle to his brother [[John of England|John]] in 1186. King John was married here and spent time in Marlborough, where he established a [[treasury]].\n\n[[File:Marlborough, Wilts - geograph.org.uk - 44036.jpg|thumb|right|Marlborough Market]]\nIn 1204 King John granted a charter to the borough which permitted an annual eight-day fair, commencing on 14 August, the vigil of the Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Our Lady]] (15 August), in which \"all might enjoy the liberties and quittances customary in the fair at [[Winchester]]\". He also established that weekly markets might be held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. These continue to this day.<ref>[http://www.marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history.htm Borough of Marlborough Charter of 1204]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nLater, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] was also married here.<ref>[http://www.marlboroughwilts.co.uk/history.htm History of Marlborough]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Henry III held [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] here, in 1267, when the [[Statute of Marlborough]] was passed; this gave rights and privileges to small land owners and limited the right of the King to take possession of land. This seven-hundred-year-old law states that no-one shall seize his neighbour's goods for alleged wrong without permission of the Court. Apart from Charters, it is the oldest [[statute]] in [[English law]] which has not yet been repealed.\n\n[[File:Marlborough St Peter.JPG|thumb|right|St Mary's parish church]]\nThe castle fell into disrepair by the end of the 14th century but remained Crown property. [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] then passed it to the [[Seymour family]], his mother's relatives. In 1498 [[Thomas Wolsey]] was ordained priest in (the now redundant) St Peter's church. He later rose to become a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] and [[Lord Chancellor]].\n\nIn 1642 Marlborough's peace was shattered by the [[English Civil War]]. The [[Seymour family|Seymours]] held the Castle for the [[Cavalier|King]] but the town was for [[Roundhead|Parliament]]. With his headquarters in nearby [[Oxford]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] had to deal with Marlborough. \"A Town the most notoriously disaffected of all that Country, otherwise, saving the obstinacy and malice of the inhabitants, in the situation of it very unfit for a garrison... this place the King saw would prove quickly an ill neighbour to him, not only as it was in the heart of a rich County, and so would straighten him, and even infest his quarters.\"\n\nThe King sent Lord [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Digby]] to take the town; he left Oxford at the head of four hundred horses on 24 November 1642. When he arrived, he chose to parley first, thus giving the inhabitants a chance to prepare defences and to recruit troops. They mustered about seven hundred poorly armed men. At this point, the town issued a reply to Digby: \"The King's Majesty, providing he were attended in Royal and not in war like wise, should be as welcome to that town as ever was Prince to People; but as to delivering up the good Town of Marlborough to such a traitor as Lord Digby ... they would sooner die.\" After some early skirmishes, royalist troops infiltrated the town down its small alleyways. The town was captured and looted and many buildings were set ablaze. One hundred and twenty prisoners were marched in chains to Oxford. The town was later abandoned by the king and took no further part in the war.\n\nOn 28 April 1653 the Great Fire of Marlborough started in a tanner's yard and spread quickly, eventually after four hours burning the Guildhall, [[St Mary's Church, Marlborough|St Mary's Church]], the County Armoury, and 244 houses<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/38/casestudy1.htm |last=Lund |first=Ian |title=(1) Fire Damage at Marlborough High Street |publisher=Institute of Historic Building Conservation |accessdate=}}</ref> to the ground.<ref>{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Stephen |year=1996 |title=The Great Fire of London |place=Stroud |publisher=[[The History Press|Alan Sutton Publishing]] |isbn=978-0750907781 |page=3}}</ref> During the rebuilding of the town after the Great Fire, the high street was widened and is often claimed to be the widest in England, though the actual widest is in [[Stockton-on-Tees]]. This wide street allows ample space for the local market. Fire swept through the town again in 1679 and again in 1690. This time, an [[Act of Parliament]] was passed \"to prohibit the covering of houses and other buildings with thatch in the Town of Marlborough\".{{sfn|Crowley|Baggs|Freeman|Stevenson|1983|pp=199\u2013229}}\n\nIn 1804 the [[Marlborough White Horse]] was cut by boys from Mr Greasley's Academy in the High Street.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1901 and 1934 the boundaries of the borough were extended to include the hamlet of [[Preshute]] (which was separated from Preshute civil parish) and the village of [[Manton, Wiltshire|Manton]], both to the west of the town.{{sfn|Crowley|Baggs|Freeman|Stevenson|1983|pp=199\u2013229}}\n \nIn 2004 Marlborough celebrated 800 years of its Town Charter.

Initially assaulted by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and the [[Serbian Volunteer Guard]] (SDG), the town was encircled by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) in May 1992, starting a brutal siege which was to last for the majority of the Bosnian War. In June 1995, the commander of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) in the enclave, [[Naser Ori\u0107]], left Srebrenica and fled to the town of [[Tuzla]]. He was subsequently replaced by his deputy, Major [[Ramiz Be\u0107irovi\u0107]].\n\nIn July 1995, Srebrenica fell to the combined forces of the [[Republika Srpska]] and numerous paramilitary formations which included hundreds of [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Russia]]n volunteers in what was codenamed '''Operation Krivaja '95''' ({{lang-sh|Operacija Krivaja '95}}, \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0458\u0430 '95). The subsequent [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]] of the town's male population led to the deaths of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, and is considered the largest act of [[mass murder]] in Europe since the end of [[World War II]]. It was judged to have been a crime of [[genocide]] by international criminal courts. As a result, VRS General [[Radislav Krsti\u0107]] was found guilty by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) of murder, persecution and aiding and abetting genocide, while VRS General [[Zdravko Tolimir]] was also convicted of genocide. Both men were sentenced to life imprisonment. One of the indictments against [[Ratko Mladi\u0107]], the commander of the VRS during the war, is for the massacre in Srebrenica. The commander of Bosniak forces in the enclave, Naser Ori\u0107, was found guilty of failing to prevent the mistreatment of VRS prisoners held in Srebrenica between September 1992 and March 1993. However, his conviction was overturned in 2008.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Srebrenica]] is a small [[mining town]] in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] about fifteen kilometers from the Serbian border.{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}}{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|2005|p=601}} According to a census held in 1991, 36,000 people lived in the municipality of Srebrenica, including 25,000 [[Bosnian Muslims]] (or Bosniaks) and 8,500 [[Serbs]].{{sfn|Nalepa|2012|p=334}} This figure shows that about 75 percent of the municipal population was Bosniak and about 25 percent was Serb.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=178}} The town of Srebrenica itself was inhabited by 9,000 people when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1992.{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} That January, a Bosnian Serb state was declared, ahead of the 29 February\u20131 March referendum on independence.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=382}} Later renamed the [[Republika Srpska]],{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=428}} it developed its own military as the JNA withdrew from [[Croatia]] and handed over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops to the newly created Bosnian Serb army.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=382}} By 1 March, Bosnian Serb forces set up barricades in [[Sarajevo]] and elsewhere and later that month Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling the town of [[Bosanski Brod]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=427}} By 4 April, Sarajevo was shelled.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=428}} In May 1992, the ground forces of Bosnian Serb state officially became known as the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] ({{lang-sr|Vojska Republike Srpske}}, VRS).{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=429}} By the end of 1992, the VRS held seventy percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=433}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, eastern Bosnia, a Bosniak-majority territory before the war,{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=125}} was subjected to [[ethnic cleansing]] operations and numerous atrocities involving murder, rape on a massive scale, plundering, and forced relocation by Serb forces and paramilitary gangs.{{sfn|Leydesdorff|2011|p=xi}}{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} Taking place throughout the municipalities of Srebrenica, [[Vlasenica]], [[Rogatica]], [[Bratunac]], [[Vi\u0161egrad]], [[Zvornik]] and [[Fo\u010da]],{{sfn|Nowak|1998|p=107}} the purpose of these operations was to create in eastern Bosnia a contiguous Serb-controlled land having a common border with Serbia.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=178}} Located in the heart of what Bosnian Serbs considered their territory, Srebrenica was seized by the paramilitary [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] ({{lang-sr|Srpska dobrovolja\u010dka garda}}, or SDG){{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} on 18 April 1992. According to a witness, \"organized killings of the Muslim population began\" on 21 April. On 6 May, a two-day battle between Serb and Muslim forces erupted in the town.{{sfn|Yamashita|2004|p=87}} [[Naser Ori\u0107]], a one-time member of the Serbian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] and former bodyguard of Serbian [[President of Serbia|President]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], then assumed control of Srebrenica after helping local Bosniak forces drive the SDG and other Serb paramilitary units from the town{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=217}} by 8 May. Goran Zeki\u0107, the leader of the Serb population in the municipality, was killed in the fighting. In June, the Muslim population of Srebrenica established a local \"war council\". By December 1992, they had managed to gain control of up to 95 percent of the Srebrenica municipality and half of the neighbouring Bratunac municipality.{{sfn|Yamashita|2004|p=87}} By this time, Ori\u0107's forces had established a sixty-kilometer-long Bosniak enclave which stretched from [[\u017depa]] in the south to the village of Kamenica in the north,{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=217}} however only to be surrounded and in dire need of food by February 1993{{sfn|Proctor|Smith|2013|p=125}} while the population of the enclave grew to almost 40,000 as refugees from the surrounding ethnically cleansed towns and villages sought refuge in the town.{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} Indeed, most of the enclave's residents were not originally from Srebrenica, but from all around eastern Bosnia or [[Podrinje]].{{sfn|Acquaviva|Whiting|Cassese|Fan|2011|p=206}}\n\n== Siege ==\nIn the words of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY):{{sfn|ICTY|30 June 2006|p=39}}\n{{quote|Between April 1992 and March 1993, the town of Srebrenica and the villages in the area held by Bosniaks were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft. Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosniak village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance, and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosniak settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.}}\n\nIn his ICTY testimony, VRS Intelligence Chief [[Momir Nikoli\u0107]] recounted how Bosnian Serb forces were instructed to make life in Srebrenica unbearable in order to induce its civilian population to \"leave ''en masse'' as soon as possible, realizing they cannot survive there.\" As part of this, Nikoli\u0107 conceded that civilians were targeted and humanitarian aid blocked while fuel, food and other supplies for UN peacekeepers were halted so that \"they could not be ready for combat\".{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}}\n\nWhile the Bosnian Serbs enjoyed military superiority, they were outnumbered by the Bosniaks who adopted a type of guerrilla warfare, which in the second half of 1992 and up to early 1993 was quite successful.{{sfn|ICTY|30 June 2006|p=39}} In an attempt to press outward,{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|2005|p=601}} Ori\u0107 and his men conducted a series of raids against outlying Serb villages, or from which Bosniaks had formerly been expelled, ostensibly to seize food, weapons, ammunition and military equipment, but also to exact punishment on the local Serb population for the VRS's harassment of the enclave.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|ICTY|30 June 2006|p=39}} During these events, Bosniak forces committed apparent violations of [[humanitarian law]] against the Bosnian Serb inhabitants, especially from May 1992 to January 1993.{{sfn|Acquaviva|Whiting|Cassese|Fan|2011|p=218}} The most notable of these violations occurred on 7 January 1993, when Ori\u0107's men attacked the Serb village of [[Kravica]], which bordered the Srebrenica enclave. Forty-three Serbs were killed in the attack, including 13 civilians. Ori\u0107's forces destroyed many of the villages that fell into their hands during the siege, killing perhaps 1,000 Serb soldiers and civilians{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|pp=217\u2013218}}: while the number of Serb soldier fatalities is unknown, the [[Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo|Research and Documentation Center]] (RDC), an organisation that compiled the most comprehensive record of deaths during the Bosnian War, established that 158 Serb civilians died in the Srebrenica municipality during the war, while a further 127 died in the Bratunac municipality.{{sfn|RDC|2013}} In an earlier report, it concluded that 119 Serb civilians and 424 soldiers were killed in the Bratunac municipality.<ref name=\"Myth of Bratunac\">{{cite web|url=http://www.idc.org.ba/project/the_myth_of_bratunac.html |title=The Myth of Bratunac: A Blatant Numbers Game |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508095038/http://www.idc.org.ba/project/the_myth_of_bratunac.html |archivedate=8 May 2009 |publisher=Research and Documentation Center}}</ref> Thousands of others were displaced by such attacks, which resulted in the destruction of at least 50 Serb settlements, according to the ICTY.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=128}} In addition, the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was shelled by the ARBiH.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|pp=217\u2013218}}  \n\nIn January 1993, ARBiH soldiers [[Skelani Massacre|machine-gunned]] dozens of Serb civilians fleeing the village of [[Skelani]].{{sfn|Shawcross|2002|p=97}} In February 1993, a Srebrenica delegation visiting [[Sarajevo]] proposed that one [[Serbs of Sarajevo|Sarajevan Serb]] be killed for every Bosniak killed in Srebrenica.{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|1999|p=179}} At this time, the Srebrenica enclave had reached its peak size of 900 square kilometers, although it was never linked to the main area of Bosnian-held land in the west and remained \"a vulnerable island amid Serb-controlled territory.\"{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|2005|p=601}} In response, the VRS launched numerous operations against the town.{{sfn|Acquaviva|Whiting|Cassese|Fan|2011|p=218}} In March 1993, General [[Ratko Mladi\u0107]] of the VRS ordered the Bosnian Serb forces besieging the town to launch a large-scale counterattack. The attack resulted in the Bosnian Serbs capturing 80 percent of the territory of the Srebrenica enclave once held by the 28th Division of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH).{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} However, the VRS was forced to stop its offensive after the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[Resolution 819]], which called for talks between the Bosniak and Bosnian Serb military leadership and the de-militarization of Srebrenica which was declared a \"[[United Nations Safe Areas|safe-area]]\". However, because of differing interpretations of the resolution, Srebrenica was never disarmed.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=180}} Instead, it was surrounded by a force of approximately 2,000 men from the VRS Drina Corps, which continued its stranglehold of the enclave.{{sfn|Nettelfield|2010|p=78}}\n[[File:Bosnia areas of control Sep 94.jpg|thumb|left|Areas of military control in Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 1994; eastern Bosnian enclaves near the Serbian border]]\nThe VRS shelled Srebrenica on 12 April 1993, killing at least 56 people and wounding 73.{{sfn|Yamashita|2004|p=88}} Within weeks, the town's population swelled from 9,000 to 40,000 as Bosniak refugees fled from the surrounding countryside.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} However, neither this counterattack nor the [[United Nation]]'s designation of the town as a \"safe area\" ended Ori\u0107's raids against neighbouring Serb villages, which persisted at a rate of 3\u20134 per week as Bosniak forces searched for food to steal from the surrounding countryside. As a result, the VRS warned the UN peacekeeping units in Srebrenica that Bosnian Serb forces would retaliate against the town's civilian population if Bosniak forces continued attacking Serb villages.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} The situation in Srebrenica subsequently worsened, with the refugees and townspeople running out of food and water. Despite this, the VRS only occasionally permitted humanitarian aid to the besieged town.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=179}} In one instance, the VRS permitted the evacuation of about 5,000 Bosniak women and children from Srebrenica. During these evacuations, six children were crushed to death while clambering to board a bus destined for Tuzla.{{sfn|Rohde|1998|p=46}} Afterwards, the VRS made an offer that would allow the UN to send in any number of trucks and buses into the enclave to evacuate its Bosniak population. However, this offer was rejected by many in the United Nations, the [[United States]] and the Bosnian government, who claimed that arranging an evacuation would \"assist the process of ethnic cleansing.\" {{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=179}}{{sfn|Rohde|1998|p=46}}\n\nIn 1994, the [[Canada|Canadian]] peacekeeping battalion (CANBAT) in Srebrenica was replaced by a battalion of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] peacekeepers (DUTCHBAT).{{sfn|Nettelfield|2010|p=80}} With the VRS outnumbered and overextended countrywide in the winter of 1994, Mladi\u0107 reasoned that it would be necessary to consolidate Bosnian Serb forces by eliminating one or more of the UN \"safe areas\" and the ARBiH garrisons located within them. Although attacking them would violate UN resolutions, Mladi\u0107 believed that international forces would not confront the VRS as long as [[UNPROFOR]] units were vulnerable to suffering heavy casualties and hostage takings.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=216}} A subsequent hostage crisis in which UN personnel were seized and used as human shields to prevent [[NATO]] airstrikes destroyed the credibility of UN deterrence in [[Biha\u0107]] and Sarajevo. Mladi\u0107 then turned his attention to Srebrenica, [[Gora\u017ede]] and \u017depa, whose seizure would release considerable VRS forces for redeployment against an expected [[Croatian Army]]\u2013ARBiH offensive in western Bosnia, while strengthening the Bosnian Serb claim to the entire Drina valley in case of a future peace settlement. Due their location, Srebrenica and \u017depa were the most vulnerable of the UN \"safe areas\" in Bosnia, in stark contrast to Gora\u017ede, where UN forces had resisted the VRS before being enforced by the ARBiH.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\nBosniak raids from the town intensified in the beginning of 1995, with Ori\u0107's forces being ordered by the ARBiH to \"reconnoiter, disrupt, divert and demoralize\" VRS soldiers, who subsequently retaliated with counterattacks of their own.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} In March 1995, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, President of the Republika Srpska, issued Directive 7, setting out the long term strategy for VRS forces surrounding Srebrenica and \u017depa. The aim of the VRS was to be to \"complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from \u017depa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves.

On the other hand, the few thousand remaining Bosniak soldiers of Srebrenica offered little resistance as their best-trained units had already abandoned the town.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=219}} To make matters worse, Dutch peacekeepers had confiscated their weapons. When the Bosniaks demanded that their weapons be returned to them, the Dutch refused.{{sfn|BBC|17 May 2012}} As a result, Bosniak troops attempted to block the Dutch withdrawal in the face of the Bosnian Serb onslaught{{sfn|Naimark|2011|p=3}} and more than 100 Dutch soldiers were taken hostage by the Bosniaks in a desperate attempt to stop them from leaving.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=219}} Subsequently, a Dutch peacekeeper was killed after a [[hand grenade]] was thrown at his [[Armored Personnel Carrier|APC]] by a Bosniak soldier.

DutchBat personnel who attempted to follow them were seized by the VRS, together with their UN vehicles and some uniforms, weapons and other equipment.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|pp=219-220}} Whereas Mladi\u0107 had expected the ARBiH 28th Division to regroup near Poto\u010dari, the men of this division chose instead to flee to Bosnian-held territory. On 12 July the Serbs learned that the majority of the town's men had indeed fled the enclave, with 700\u2013900 fleeing east to Serbia, 300\u2013850 fleeing south to \u017depa, and 10,000\u201315,000 fleeing north to Tuzla. Of these 10,000\u201315,000, approximately 6,000 were fleeing Bosniak soldiers, of whom 1,000\u20131,500 were armed. By the time the VRS had been redeployed, about 3,000 soldiers of the column's better-armed vanguard had successfully escaped to Tuzla. The 9,000\u201312,000 Bosniaks who remained were encircled by VRS units and attacked by artillery, armor and small arms fire. The relatively few who survived the experience recounted how many panic-stricken Bosniak men committed suicide, killed each other in the dark, or drowned while attempting to cross the Jadar river, but by far the greatest portion of the men surrendered, some unwittingly to VRS soldiers equipped with stolen UN vehicles, helmets and uniforms.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\nAt midday on 11 July, Dutch NATO planes arrived from [[Italy]] and struck a Bosnian Serb tank,{{sfn|Naimark|2011|p=4}} before being forced to cease operations after General Mladi\u0107 threatened to \"destroy\" both the Dutch soldiers and the Bosniak population of Srebrenica unless airstrikes were called off.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=181}} That afternoon, Mladi\u0107, accompanied by General \u017divanovi\u0107 (then Commander of the Drina Corps), General Krsti\u0107 (then Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps) and other Bosnian Serb officers, took a triumphant walk through the deserted streets of the town of Srebrenica. The moment was captured on film by Serbian journalist [[Zoran Petrovi\u0107 Piro\u0107anac]].{{sfn|Dobbs|24 January 2012}} Mladi\u0107 posed for television cameras, before declaring that Srebrenica had been \"returned forever to the Serbs.\" Later, [[Thom Karremans]], the commander of the Dutch troops in the town, drank a toast with Mladi\u0107 which was filmed for Serb television. Off-camera, however, Mladi\u0107 warned Karremans that the UN compound in Poto\u010dari, where thousands of Bosniak refugees had gathered, would be shelled by the VRS if NATO planes reappeared.{{sfn|Naimark|2011|p=3}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Srebrenica massacre ===\n{{Main article|Srebrenica massacre}}\n[[File:Srebrenica Massacre - Massacre Victim 2 - Potocari 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Skull of a victim of the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

The ICTY Trial Chamber was satisfied that the total number executed was likely to have been within the range of 7,000 to 8,000. The bodies were disposed of in unmarked mass graves which were subsequently reopened and the contents mingled and relocated. The killings and their concealment, carried out in an organised and systematic manner, were subsequently confirmed by the ICTY to have been a crime of genocide pursuant to the United Nations [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].{{sfn|ICTY|Radislav Krsti\u0107 CIS}}\n\nFor example, on 14 July 1995, prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to a school in the village of Pilica, north of [[Zvornik]]. As at other detention facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school for two nights. On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot systematically.{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}}\n\nOne of the survivors recalled:\n\n{{quotation|When they opened fire, I threw myself on the ground&nbsp;...

Erdemovi\u0107 appeared as a prosecution witness and testified: \"The men in front of us were ordered to turn their backs. When those men turned their backs to us, we shot at them. We were given orders to shoot.\"{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}}\n\nErdemovi\u0107 said that all but one of the victims wore civilian clothes and that, except for one person who tried to escape, they offered no resistance before being shot. Sometimes the executioners were particularly cruel. When some of the soldiers recognised acquaintances from Srebrenica, they beat and humiliated them before killing them. Erdemovi\u0107 had to persuade his fellow soldiers to stop using a machine gun for the killings; while it mortally wounded the prisoners it did not cause death immediately and prolonged their suffering.{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}} Between 1,000 and 1,200 men were killed in the course of that day at this execution site.{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}} Aerial photographs, taken on 17 July 1995, of an area around the Branjevo Military Farm, show a large number of bodies lying in the field near the farm, as well as traces of the excavator that collected the bodies from the field.{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}} Erdemovi\u0107 testified that, at around 15:00 hours on 16 July 1995, after he and his fellow soldiers from the 10th Sabotage Detachment had finished executing the prisoners at the Branjevo Military Farm, they were told that there was a group of 500 Bosniak prisoners from Srebrenica trying to break out of a nearby Dom Kultura club. Erdemovi\u0107 and the other members of his unit refused to carry out any more killings. They were then told to attend a meeting with a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] at a caf\u00e9 in Pilica. Erdemovi\u0107 and his fellow-soldiers travelled to the caf\u00e9 as requested and, as they waited, they could hear shots and grenades being detonated. The sounds lasted for approximately 15\u201320 minutes after which a soldier from Bratunac entered the caf\u00e9 to inform those present that \"everything was over\".{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}}\n\nThere were no survivors to explain exactly what had happened in the Dom Kultura.{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}} Over a year later, it was still possible to find physical evidence of this atrocity. As in Kravica, many traces of blood, hair and body tissue were found in the building, with cartridges and shells littered throughout the two storeys.{{sfn|ICTY|2 August 2001}} It could also be established that explosives and machine guns had been used.

Initially assaulted by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and the [[Serbian Volunteer Guard]] (SDG), the town was encircled by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) in May 1992, starting a brutal siege which was to last for the majority of the Bosnian War. In June 1995, the commander of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) in the enclave, [[Naser Ori\u0107]], left Srebrenica and fled to the town of [[Tuzla]]. He was subsequently replaced by his deputy, Major [[Ramiz Be\u0107irovi\u0107]].\n\nIn July 1995, Srebrenica fell to the combined forces of the [[Republika Srpska]] and numerous paramilitary formations which included hundreds of [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Russia]]n volunteers in what was codenamed '''Operation Krivaja '95''' ({{lang-sh|Operacija Krivaja '95}}, \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0458\u0430 '95). The subsequent [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]] of the town's male population led to the deaths of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, and is considered the largest act of [[mass murder]] in Europe since the end of [[World War II]]. It was judged to have been a crime of [[genocide]] by international criminal courts. As a result, VRS General [[Radislav Krsti\u0107]] was found guilty by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) of murder, persecution and aiding and abetting genocide, while VRS General [[Zdravko Tolimir]] was also convicted of genocide. Both men were sentenced to life imprisonment. One of the indictments against [[Ratko Mladi\u0107]], the commander of the VRS during the war, is for the massacre in Srebrenica. The commander of Bosniak forces in the enclave, Naser Ori\u0107, was found guilty of failing to prevent the mistreatment of VRS prisoners held in Srebrenica between September 1992 and March 1993. However, his conviction was overturned in 2008.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Srebrenica]] is a small [[mining town]] in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] about fifteen kilometers from the Serbian border.{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}}{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|2005|p=601}} According to a census held in 1991, 36,000 people lived in the municipality of Srebrenica, including 25,000 [[Bosnian Muslims]] (or Bosniaks) and 8,500 [[Serbs]].{{sfn|Nalepa|2012|p=334}} This figure shows that about 75 percent of the municipal population was Bosniak and about 25 percent was Serb.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=178}} The town of Srebrenica itself was inhabited by 9,000 people when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1992.{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} That January, a Bosnian Serb state was declared, ahead of the 29 February\u20131 March referendum on independence.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=382}} Later renamed the [[Republika Srpska]],{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=428}} it developed its own military as the JNA withdrew from [[Croatia]] and handed over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops to the newly created Bosnian Serb army.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=382}} By 1 March, Bosnian Serb forces set up barricades in [[Sarajevo]] and elsewhere and later that month Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling the town of [[Bosanski Brod]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=427}} By 4 April, Sarajevo was shelled.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=428}} In May 1992, the ground forces of Bosnian Serb state officially became known as the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] ({{lang-sr|Vojska Republike Srpske}}, VRS).{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=429}} By the end of 1992, the VRS held seventy percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=433}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, eastern Bosnia, a Bosniak-majority territory before the war,{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=125}} was subjected to [[ethnic cleansing]] operations and numerous atrocities involving murder, rape on a massive scale, plundering, and forced relocation by Serb forces and paramilitary gangs.{{sfn|Leydesdorff|2011|p=xi}}{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} Taking place throughout the municipalities of Srebrenica, [[Vlasenica]], [[Rogatica]], [[Bratunac]], [[Vi\u0161egrad]], [[Zvornik]] and [[Fo\u010da]],{{sfn|Nowak|1998|p=107}} the purpose of these operations was to create in eastern Bosnia a contiguous Serb-controlled land having a common border with Serbia.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=178}} Located in the heart of what Bosnian Serbs considered their territory, Srebrenica was seized by the paramilitary [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] ({{lang-sr|Srpska dobrovolja\u010dka garda}}, or SDG){{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} on 18 April 1992. According to a witness, \"organized killings of the Muslim population began\" on 21 April. On 6 May, a two-day battle between Serb and Muslim forces erupted in the town.{{sfn|Yamashita|2004|p=87}} [[Naser Ori\u0107]], a one-time member of the Serbian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] and former bodyguard of Serbian [[President of Serbia|President]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], then assumed control of Srebrenica after helping local Bosniak forces drive the SDG and other Serb paramilitary units from the town{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=217}} by 8 May. Goran Zeki\u0107, the leader of the Serb population in the municipality, was killed in the fighting. In June, the Muslim population of Srebrenica established a local \"war council\". By December 1992, they had managed to gain control of up to 95 percent of the Srebrenica municipality and half of the neighbouring Bratunac municipality.{{sfn|Yamashita|2004|p=87}} By this time, Ori\u0107's forces had established a sixty-kilometer-long Bosniak enclave which stretched from [[\u017depa]] in the south to the village of Kamenica in the north,{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=217}} however only to be surrounded and in dire need of food by February 1993{{sfn|Proctor|Smith|2013|p=125}} while the population of the enclave grew to almost 40,000 as refugees from the surrounding ethnically cleansed towns and villages sought refuge in the town.{{sfn|Alvarez|2010|p=141}} Indeed, most of the enclave's residents were not originally from Srebrenica, but from all around eastern Bosnia or [[Podrinje]].{{sfn|Acquaviva|Whiting|Cassese|Fan|2011|p=206}}\n\n== Siege ==\nIn the words of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY):{{sfn|ICTY|30 June 2006|p=39}}\n{{quote|Between April 1992 and March 1993, the town of Srebrenica and the villages in the area held by Bosniaks were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft. Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosniak village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance, and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosniak settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.}}\n\nIn his ICTY testimony, VRS Intelligence Chief [[Momir Nikoli\u0107]] recounted how Bosnian Serb forces were instructed to make life in Srebrenica unbearable in order to induce its civilian population to \"leave ''en masse'' as soon as possible, realizing they cannot survive there.\" As part of this, Nikoli\u0107 conceded that civilians were targeted and humanitarian aid blocked while fuel, food and other supplies for UN peacekeepers were halted so that \"they could not be ready for combat\".{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}}\n\nWhile the Bosnian Serbs enjoyed military superiority, they were outnumbered by the Bosniaks who adopted a type of guerrilla warfare, which in the second half of 1992 and up to early 1993 was quite successful.{{sfn|ICTY|30 June 2006|p=39}} In an attempt to press outward,{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|2005|p=601}} Ori\u0107 and his men conducted a series of raids against outlying Serb villages, or from which Bosniaks had formerly been expelled, ostensibly to seize food, weapons, ammunition and military equipment, but also to exact punishment on the local Serb population for the VRS's harassment of the enclave.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|ICTY|30 June 2006|p=39}} During these events, Bosniak forces committed apparent violations of [[humanitarian law]] against the Bosnian Serb inhabitants, especially from May 1992 to January 1993.{{sfn|Acquaviva|Whiting|Cassese|Fan|2011|p=218}} The most notable of these violations occurred on 7 January 1993, when Ori\u0107's men attacked the Serb village of [[Kravica]], which bordered the Srebrenica enclave.

The attack resulted in the Bosnian Serbs capturing 80 percent of the territory of the Srebrenica enclave once held by the 28th Division of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH).{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} However, the VRS was forced to stop its offensive after the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[Resolution 819]], which called for talks between the Bosniak and Bosnian Serb military leadership and the de-militarization of Srebrenica which was declared a \"[[United Nations Safe Areas|safe-area]]\". However, because of differing interpretations of the resolution, Srebrenica was never disarmed.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=180}} Instead, it was surrounded by a force of approximately 2,000 men from the VRS Drina Corps, which continued its stranglehold of the enclave.{{sfn|Nettelfield|2010|p=78}}\n[[File:Bosnia areas of control Sep 94.jpg|thumb|left|Areas of military control in Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 1994; eastern Bosnian enclaves near the Serbian border]]\nThe VRS shelled Srebrenica on 12 April 1993, killing at least 56 people and wounding 73.{{sfn|Yamashita|2004|p=88}} Within weeks, the town's population swelled from 9,000 to 40,000 as Bosniak refugees fled from the surrounding countryside.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} However, neither this counterattack nor the [[United Nation]]'s designation of the town as a \"safe area\" ended Ori\u0107's raids against neighbouring Serb villages, which persisted at a rate of 3\u20134 per week as Bosniak forces searched for food to steal from the surrounding countryside. As a result, the VRS warned the UN peacekeeping units in Srebrenica that Bosnian Serb forces would retaliate against the town's civilian population if Bosniak forces continued attacking Serb villages.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} The situation in Srebrenica subsequently worsened, with the refugees and townspeople running out of food and water. Despite this, the VRS only occasionally permitted humanitarian aid to the besieged town.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=179}} In one instance, the VRS permitted the evacuation of about 5,000 Bosniak women and children from Srebrenica. During these evacuations, six children were crushed to death while clambering to board a bus destined for Tuzla.{{sfn|Rohde|1998|p=46}} Afterwards, the VRS made an offer that would allow the UN to send in any number of trucks and buses into the enclave to evacuate its Bosniak population.

Although attacking them would violate UN resolutions, Mladi\u0107 believed that international forces would not confront the VRS as long as [[UNPROFOR]] units were vulnerable to suffering heavy casualties and hostage takings.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=216}} A subsequent hostage crisis in which UN personnel were seized and used as human shields to prevent [[NATO]] airstrikes destroyed the credibility of UN deterrence in [[Biha\u0107]] and Sarajevo.

Due their location, Srebrenica and \u017depa were the most vulnerable of the UN \"safe areas\" in Bosnia, in stark contrast to Gora\u017ede, where UN forces had resisted the VRS before being enforced by the ARBiH.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\nBosniak raids from the town intensified in the beginning of 1995, with Ori\u0107's forces being ordered by the ARBiH to \"reconnoiter, disrupt, divert and demoralize\" VRS soldiers, who subsequently retaliated with counterattacks of their own.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} In March 1995, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, President of the Republika Srpska, issued Directive 7, setting out the long term strategy for VRS forces surrounding Srebrenica and \u017depa. The aim of the VRS was to be to \"complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from \u017depa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves.

Erdemovi\u0107 and the other members of his unit refused to carry out any more killings. They were then told to attend a meeting with a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] at a caf\u00e9 in Pilica. Erdemovi\u0107 and his fellow-soldiers travelled to the caf\u00e9 as requested and, as they waited, they could hear shots and grenades being detonated.

The ICTY found Krsti\u0107 guilty of participating in two criminal plans, initially to ethnically cleanse the Srebrenica enclave of all Bosniak civilians and later to kill the military-aged men of Srebrenica.

It was intended to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] with similar formations from other parts of [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nCreated in July 1941, the Walloon Legion was created by the [[Rexist Party]] as a means of demonstrating its loyalty and indispensability in German-occupied Belgium where it had been largely ignored since the [[Battle of Belgium|invasion of May 1940]]. A similar formation had already been created by Flemish collaborators. The Walloon Legion, initially part of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht]], was joined by the Rexist leader [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]] but remained no larger than a [[battalion]]. It participated in fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from February 1942 but the heavy losses experienced by the unit proved difficult to replace in Belgium. \n\nIt became part of the [[Waffen-SS]] in June 1943 and was almost destroyed by Soviet forces in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944. It expanded slightly after the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944 as Belgian, French, and Spanish soldiers were drafted in and was upgraded to the notional status of a [[division]]. After heavy losses and desertions, its remaining personnel surrendered to British forces in April 1945.\n\n==Origins==\n===Rexist Party and collaboration===\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion]] in May 1940, Belgium had several political parties that were broadly sympathetic to the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[anti-democratic]] ideals represented by [[Nazi Germany]]. In [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], the largest of these groups was the [[Rexist Party]], led by [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]]. This had originated as a faction of the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Block]], but split in 1935 to form an independent [[populism|populist]] party. Ideologically, Rex supported [[Belgian nationalism]], but its support for [[corporatism]] and [[anti-communism]] made it sympathetic towards aspects of [[Nazi ideology]]. It achieved some early success, peaking [[1936 Belgian general election|at the elections of 1936]] in which it received 11.5 percent of the national vote, but experienced a decline in the following years before the German invasion and remained marginal.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=261}}\n\nAfter the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, a German [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Administration]] was created to govern the occupied  territory. Preferring a strategy of [[indirect rule]], the administration preferred to work with established Belgian political and social elites, largely ignoring fringe political groups such as the Rexists.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=262\u2013263}}\n\n===Creation of the Walloon Legion===\n[[File:You defend Belgium....jpg|thumb|Recruitment poster for the Walloon Legion, appealing to [[Belgian nationalism|Belgian nationalist]] sentiments. The caption reads \"You defend Belgium... by fighting on the Eastern Front\".]]\nIn order to acquire more influence and German support, Rex attempted to bring itself closer to the occupation authorities. On 1 January 1941, Degrelle announced Rex's total support for the occupation authorities and for the policy of collaborationism. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, it embraced the idea of raising a military unit, seen as \"a political opportunity to increase the importance of their movements and eliminate political competition\".{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} At the same time, the [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]] (VNV), a [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalist]] and rival authoritarian party in Flanders, also announced its intention to form a \"[[Flemish Legion]]\" to fight in the German Army in the [[Soviet Union]]. This move, combined with the Germans' favourable stance towards the VNV, meant that it would not be possible to realise Rex's preferred option of a national \"Belgian Legion\" on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=243}}\n\nIn July 1941, Rex announced that it would raise a unit of volunteers of its own, dubbed the Walloon Legion (''L\u00e9gion Wallonie''). The unit would form part of the [[Wehrmacht]] because Walloons were not considered sufficiently \"Germanic\" by [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial theorists]] to enlist in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} Recruitment initially met with little success, leading Degrelle personally to volunteer for the unit as a private. In total, some 850 men (mostly Rexist [[Cadre (politics)|cadres]]) had volunteered by August 1941, bringing the unit up to the strength of an [[infantry battalion]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=267}} Officially designated as Infantry Battalion 373 (''Infanterie Bataillon 373''), it was sent for training in [[Kreis Meseritz|Meseritz]], Germany. As part of Degrelle's ideal of an expanded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian-style Belgium]], the unit adopted the [[Cross of Burgundy|Burgundian cross]] as its insignia.\n\nInitially, most of the volunteers came from the cadres of Rex and in particular its paramilitary militia, the ''Formations de Combat''. In propaganda, Rex emphasised the anti-communist nature of the conflict and argued that collaboration was compatible with Belgian nationalism.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=266\u2013268}} Initially, the unit encountered various internal problems with some volunteers being unwilling to swear allegiance to [[Adolf Hitler]] and others being classed as medically unfit: almost a third of the volunteers were repatriated before October 1941.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=270}} Over the winter of 1941\u20131942, it participated in training and [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operations]] near [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]].{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=244}}\n\n==Eastern Front==\n===In the Wehrmacht, 1942\u20131943===\nThe Walloon Legion fought its first engagement against Soviet forces at Gromowaja-Balka, near Donetsk, on 28 February 1942 as part of the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]]. It suffered heavy losses, both from disease and combat, and was reduced to 150 men within its first months.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=100}} It continued to encounter \"enormous losses\" throughout 1942.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} Its record in combat, however, was widely exploited in propaganda and increased Degrelle's legitimacy in the eyes of the German leadership, especially [[Heinrich Himmler]] who commanded the SS. In late 1942, Himmler declared the Walloons to be a Germanic race, paving the way for the unit's incorporation into the Waffen-SS on 1 June 1943. The Walloon Legion was re-organised into an SS [[brigade]]-sized unit of 2,000 men, known as the SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia (''SS- Sturmbrigade Wallonien'').{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=272}}\n\nThe high attrition rate within the Walloon Legion required increasing focus on recruitment. A second recruitment drive was started in February 1942, recruiting 450 new volunteers of whom many came from Rex's small youth wing. A third \"frantic\" campaign in November 1942 raised a further 1,700 men. These recruitment drives weakened many Rexist institutions by diverting manpower away from projects in Belgium. Attempts to recruit from [[Belgian prisoners of war in World War II|Belgian prisoners of war]] proved a failure.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=101}} However, Degrelle became increasingly keen on the political potential of the Walloon Legion which he saw as a more effective political tool than the Rexist Party in Belgium.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} As the war continued and the pool of Rexist members fell, the volunteers became \"largely non-political 'adventurers' or desperate men\", often drawn from the urban working class and the unemployed.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=286}}\n\n===In the Waffen-SS, 1943\u20131945===\n[[File:L\u00e9on Degrelle \u00e0 Charleroi - 02.jpg|thumb|[[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of Rex and member of the Walloon Legion, pictured in [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Degrelle saw the Legion as a political tool to gain German support]]\nIn November 1943, the new SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia was deployed for the first time to the Ukraine in response to the Soviet [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. There, the brigade fought as part of the [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|SS ''Wiking'' Panzer Division]] in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944 and suffered 70 percent casualties.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} Among those killed was the unit's commander Lucien Lippert.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} A detachment also fought at the [[Battle of Tannenberg Line|Tannenberg Line]] in [[Estonia]] in June 1944, also suffering heavy losses. Degrelle, however, was widely celebrated for his role in the battle at Cherkassy and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]], becoming \"the poster boy for all European collaborators\" and being featured in ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} The remnants of the unit returned to Belgium where parades were held in [[Brussels]] and [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Ahead of its return, largely to encourage more enlistments, the unit was even loaned armoured vehicles by other German units to make it seem more prestigious.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944, Degrelle managed to get the brigade upgraded to [[division (military)|division]]-status, after drafting Rexist refugees fleeing the Allied advance and Walloon volunteers from the paramilitary [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK). The new 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division \"Wallonia\" (''28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division Wallonien'') was created in October 1944.

It was intended to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] with similar formations from other parts of [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nCreated in July 1941, the Walloon Legion was created by the [[Rexist Party]] as a means of demonstrating its loyalty and indispensability in German-occupied Belgium where it had been largely ignored since the [[Battle of Belgium|invasion of May 1940]]. A similar formation had already been created by Flemish collaborators. The Walloon Legion, initially part of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht]], was joined by the Rexist leader [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]] but remained no larger than a [[battalion]]. It participated in fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from February 1942 but the heavy losses experienced by the unit proved difficult to replace in Belgium. \n\nIt became part of the [[Waffen-SS]] in June 1943 and was almost destroyed by Soviet forces in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944. It expanded slightly after the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944 as Belgian, French, and Spanish soldiers were drafted in and was upgraded to the notional status of a [[division]]. After heavy losses and desertions, its remaining personnel surrendered to British forces in April 1945.\n\n==Origins==\n===Rexist Party and collaboration===\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion]] in May 1940, Belgium had several political parties that were broadly sympathetic to the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[anti-democratic]] ideals represented by [[Nazi Germany]]. In [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], the largest of these groups was the [[Rexist Party]], led by [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]]. This had originated as a faction of the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Block]], but split in 1935 to form an independent [[populism|populist]] party. Ideologically, Rex supported [[Belgian nationalism]], but its support for [[corporatism]] and [[anti-communism]] made it sympathetic towards aspects of [[Nazi ideology]]. It achieved some early success, peaking [[1936 Belgian general election|at the elections of 1936]] in which it received 11.5 percent of the national vote, but experienced a decline in the following years before the German invasion and remained marginal.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=261}}\n\nAfter the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, a German [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Administration]] was created to govern the occupied  territory. Preferring a strategy of [[indirect rule]], the administration preferred to work with established Belgian political and social elites, largely ignoring fringe political groups such as the Rexists.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=262\u2013263}}\n\n===Creation of the Walloon Legion===\n[[File:You defend Belgium....jpg|thumb|Recruitment poster for the Walloon Legion, appealing to [[Belgian nationalism|Belgian nationalist]] sentiments. The caption reads \"You defend Belgium... by fighting on the Eastern Front\".]]\nIn order to acquire more influence and German support, Rex attempted to bring itself closer to the occupation authorities. On 1 January 1941, Degrelle announced Rex's total support for the occupation authorities and for the policy of collaborationism. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, it embraced the idea of raising a military unit, seen as \"a political opportunity to increase the importance of their movements and eliminate political competition\".{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} At the same time, the [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]] (VNV), a [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalist]] and rival authoritarian party in Flanders, also announced its intention to form a \"[[Flemish Legion]]\" to fight in the German Army in the [[Soviet Union]]. This move, combined with the Germans' favourable stance towards the VNV, meant that it would not be possible to realise Rex's preferred option of a national \"Belgian Legion\" on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=243}}\n\nIn July 1941, Rex announced that it would raise a unit of volunteers of its own, dubbed the Walloon Legion (''L\u00e9gion Wallonie''). The unit would form part of the [[Wehrmacht]] because Walloons were not considered sufficiently \"Germanic\" by [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial theorists]] to enlist in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} Recruitment initially met with little success, leading Degrelle personally to volunteer for the unit as a private. In total, some 850 men (mostly Rexist [[Cadre (politics)|cadres]]) had volunteered by August 1941, bringing the unit up to the strength of an [[infantry battalion]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=267}} Officially designated as Infantry Battalion 373 (''Infanterie Bataillon 373''), it was sent for training in [[Kreis Meseritz|Meseritz]], Germany. As part of Degrelle's ideal of an expanded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian-style Belgium]], the unit adopted the [[Cross of Burgundy|Burgundian cross]] as its insignia.\n\nInitially, most of the volunteers came from the cadres of Rex and in particular its paramilitary militia, the ''Formations de Combat''. In propaganda, Rex emphasised the anti-communist nature of the conflict and argued that collaboration was compatible with Belgian nationalism.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=266\u2013268}} Initially, the unit encountered various internal problems with some volunteers being unwilling to swear allegiance to [[Adolf Hitler]] and others being classed as medically unfit: almost a third of the volunteers were repatriated before October 1941.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=270}} Over the winter of 1941\u20131942, it participated in training and [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operations]] near [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]].{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=244}}\n\n==Eastern Front==\n===In the Wehrmacht, 1942\u20131943===\nThe Walloon Legion fought its first engagement against Soviet forces at Gromowaja-Balka, near Donetsk, on 28 February 1942 as part of the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]]. It suffered heavy losses, both from disease and combat, and was reduced to 150 men within its first months.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=100}} It continued to encounter \"enormous losses\" throughout 1942.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} Its record in combat, however, was widely exploited in propaganda and increased Degrelle's legitimacy in the eyes of the German leadership, especially [[Heinrich Himmler]] who commanded the SS. In late 1942, Himmler declared the Walloons to be a Germanic race, paving the way for the unit's incorporation into the Waffen-SS on 1 June 1943. The Walloon Legion was re-organised into an SS [[brigade]]-sized unit of 2,000 men, known as the SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia (''SS- Sturmbrigade Wallonien'').{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=272}}\n\nThe high attrition rate within the Walloon Legion required increasing focus on recruitment. A second recruitment drive was started in February 1942, recruiting 450 new volunteers of whom many came from Rex's small youth wing. A third \"frantic\" campaign in November 1942 raised a further 1,700 men. These recruitment drives weakened many Rexist institutions by diverting manpower away from projects in Belgium. Attempts to recruit from [[Belgian prisoners of war in World War II|Belgian prisoners of war]] proved a failure.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=101}} However, Degrelle became increasingly keen on the political potential of the Walloon Legion which he saw as a more effective political tool than the Rexist Party in Belgium.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} As the war continued and the pool of Rexist members fell, the volunteers became \"largely non-political 'adventurers' or desperate men\", often drawn from the urban working class and the unemployed.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=286}}\n\n===In the Waffen-SS, 1943\u20131945===\n[[File:L\u00e9on Degrelle \u00e0 Charleroi - 02.jpg|thumb|[[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of Rex and member of the Walloon Legion, pictured in [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Degrelle saw the Legion as a political tool to gain German support]]\nIn November 1943, the new SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia was deployed for the first time to the Ukraine in response to the Soviet [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. There, the brigade fought as part of the [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|SS ''Wiking'' Panzer Division]] in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944 and suffered 70 percent casualties.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} Among those killed was the unit's commander Lucien Lippert.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} A detachment also fought at the [[Battle of Tannenberg Line|Tannenberg Line]] in [[Estonia]] in June 1944, also suffering heavy losses. Degrelle, however, was widely celebrated for his role in the battle at Cherkassy and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]], becoming \"the poster boy for all European collaborators\" and being featured in ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} The remnants of the unit returned to Belgium where parades were held in [[Brussels]] and [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Ahead of its return, largely to encourage more enlistments, the unit was even loaned armoured vehicles by other German units to make it seem more prestigious.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944, Degrelle managed to get the brigade upgraded to [[division (military)|division]]-status, after drafting Rexist refugees fleeing the Allied advance and Walloon volunteers from the paramilitary [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK). The new 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division \"Wallonia\" (''28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division Wallonien'') was created in October 1944.

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres.

I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.\"{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=70}} His grandson [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] has said that there is \"no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement\".{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=71}} Critics of Rastafari have used this as evidence that Rasta theological beliefs are incorrect,{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}} however for some Rastas, Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God, based on their reading of the [[Gospel of Luke]] 14:11.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=108|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=511}}\n\n===Afrocentrism, Babylon, and Zion===\n\n[[File:Ethiopia (Africa orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|The eastern African nation of Ethiopia is given great prominence in Rasta doctrine]]\nAccording to Clarke, Rastafari is \"concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica while creating a new identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}} Its emphasis is on purging any belief in the inferiority of black people, and the superiority of white people, from the minds of its followers.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=864}} Rastafari is therefore Afrocentric,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2006|1p=882|2a1=Wittmann|2y=2011|2p=152}} equating blackness with the African continent,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} and thus endorsing a form of Pan-Africanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Soumahoro|1y=2007|1p=39|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2p=311}}\n\nPractitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient [[Israelites]]\u2014God's [[chosen people]] in the Old Testament\u2014and believe that black Africans broadly or Rastas more specifically are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=168|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=129|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=17|4a1=Barrett|4y=1997|4p=111|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=38}} This is similar to beliefs in [[Judaism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} although many Rastas believe that modern Jews' claims to be the descendants of the ancient Israelites are false.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1969|p=240}} Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's chosen people, meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=81|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=885}} Rastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of any feelings of inferiority.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}\n\nThere is no uniform Rasta view on race.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Many Rastas endorse [[black supremacy]], believing in [[Scientific racism|the existence of a distinct black African race]] that is superior to other racial groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=169|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=191|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=113|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=504}} This has opened the religion up to accusations of [[racism]] from its critics, including black Jamaicans.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=149|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=81}} Cashmore noted that there was an \"implicit potential\" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not \"intrinsic\" to the religion.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=150}} Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European can ever be a legitimate Rasta.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Others believe that an \"African\" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African \"attitude\" or \"spirit\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}}\n\n====Babylon and Zion====\n\nRastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in \"Babylon\", a term applied to [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eyre|1y=1985|1p=145|2a1=Pereira|2y=1998|2p=31|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=40}} For Rastas, European [[colonialism]] and global [[capitalism]] are regarded as manifestations of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=38\u201340}} while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=175\u2013176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=40}} The term \"Babylon\" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas compare the exile of the Israelites in Mesopotamia with the exile of the African diaspora outside Africa.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In the [[New Testament]], \"Babylon\" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}\n\nRastas regard Babylon as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} They perceive the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term \"suffering\" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism \"Chant down Babylon\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, regarding this as a Babylonian development,{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} and are often hostile to Western resource extraction from the continent.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Rastas often expect white-dominant society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens they see it as confirmation of the correctness of their faith.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia - Location Map (2013) - ETH - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|left|A map of Ethiopia, the \"Zion\" of the Rastas]]\n\nRastas view \"[[Zion]]\" as an ideal to which they aspire.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} As with \"Babylon\", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas usually use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse;{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=77|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=41}} many Rastas use the term \"Ethiopia\" synonymously with \"Africa\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=163}} Other Rastas apply the term \"Zion\" to Jamaica or use it to describe a state of mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change was influenced by observation of the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=294}}

may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of \"Ethiopia\"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within \"Ethiopia\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}\n\n====Salvation and

paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11, 70}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to undergo [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=75|3a1=Barnett|3y=2005|3p=72}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional

Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}}\n\nRastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political

activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while

Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in

By the 8th century, Arab traders had introduced cannabis to Central and Southern Africa.{{sfn|Hamid|2002|p=xxxii}} In the 19th century, enslaved [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] people arrived in Jamaica, where they established the religion of [[Kumina]].

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism;

The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=98\u201399|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=19\u201320}} One of the most prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}}\n\n===International spread and decline: 1970\u2013present===\n[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rasta vendor plies his wares in the U.S. city of [[Washington D.C.]] in 2013]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, reggae's international popularity exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=1998|2p=41|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=91\u201392|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n===Mansions of Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of

\"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta

mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the

Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2,000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}\n\nBy the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}} Rastafari groups have also appeared in Zimbabwe,{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}} and in South Africa;{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=220}} in 2008, there were at least 12,000 Rastas in the country.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|p=234}} At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=225}}\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Benjamin Zephaniah University of Hull.jpg|thumb|right|The poet [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] is a prominent British Rasta]]\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Rastas were among the [[British African-Caribbean people|thousands of Caribbean migrants settling in the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=72}} In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in [[Brixton]], South London,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=54}} and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture;

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways. Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of [[African nationalism]] and [[Pan-Africanism]], some have seen Rastafari as a political movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=502|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=4|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=218|4a1=Williams|4y=2017|4p=477}} a \"politico-religious\" movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=189|3a1=Ifekwe|3y=2008|3p=106}} or a protest movement.{{sfn|Watson|1974|p=329}} It has alternatively been labelled a [[social movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Watson|1y=1973|1p=189|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=501|3a1=King|3y=2002|3p=136}} or more specifically as a [[new social movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the idea of Rastafari as a \"movement\".{{sfn|Lake|1994|p=253}} In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that\u2014for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]\u2014Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158\u2013160}}\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} it is neither monolithic nor homogenous.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=240|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=77|3a1=Hansing|3y=2006|3pp=62\u201363}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history,{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=75}} It is not a unified movement,{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=291}} and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastas.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=881}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=961}} Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of \"a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''\" displaying a \"shifting eclecticism\",{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} while William F. Lewis commented that the movement's diversity \"has produced a complexity which is overwhelming to the observer\".{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=14}}\n\nThe term \"Rastafari\" derives from the pre-regnal title of [[Haile Selassie]], \"Ras Tafari Makonnen\"; the term \"Ras\" means a duke or prince, while \"Tafari Makonen\" was his name.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Ifekwe|2y=2008|2p=111|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=32|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=217}} It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name as the basis of their religion's name.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} As well as being the religion's name, it is also used for the religion's practitioners themselves.{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=218}} Many commentators\u2014including some academic sources{{sfnm|1a1=Forsythe|1y=1980|1p=64|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=2, 103|4a1=King|4y=1998|4p=51|5a1=Middleton|5y=2006|5p=152|6a1=Glazier|6y=2012|6p=614|7a1=Chawane|7y=2014|7p=218}}\u2014refer to the movement as \"Rastafarianism\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=8}} This term has also been used by some practitioners.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=187}} However, the term \"Rastafarianism\" is considered embarrassing by many Rastas, who believe it has connotations of doctrine and organisation which they wish to avoid.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=8|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=218}} Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as \"insensitive\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n==Beliefs==\n\n[[File:Liberty Bell Temple 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The Liberty Bell Temple in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States|US]] was established by the American Rasta [[Ed Forchion]]]]\nRastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as \"Rastalogy\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} Edmonds described Rastafari as having \"a fairly cohesive worldview\";{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} however, Cashmore thought that its beliefs were \"fluid and open to interpretation\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=v}} Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a [[catechism]] or [[creed]] within the movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}}\n\nRastas place great emphasis on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=49\u201350, 63}} No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and which are [[heterodox]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}} The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma \"is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma\", according to Clarke.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}}\n\nRastafari is deeply influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Warner-Lewis|1y=1993|1p=108|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=183}} and shares many commonalities with Christianity.{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=231}} Michael Barnett noted that its theology is \"essentially Judeo-Christian\", representing \"an Afrocentralized blend of Christianity and Judaism\".{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=882}} Some Rastas openly describe themselves as Christians.{{sfn|Bedasse|2013|p=302}} It accords the [[Bible]] a central place in its belief system, regarding it as a holy book,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=14|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=74|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=184|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=232}} and adopts a [[Biblical literalism|literalist interpretation]] of its contents.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} According to the anthropologist [[Stephen D.

In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas compare the exile of the Israelites in Mesopotamia with the exile of the African diaspora outside Africa.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In the [[New Testament]], \"Babylon\" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman

which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen

in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term \"suffering\" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism \"Chant down Babylon\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, regarding this as a Babylonian development,{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} and are often hostile to Western resource extraction from the continent.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Rastas often

mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas

the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the

Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues,

upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human

in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was

it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom. Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41\u201342}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}\n\nA rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \"look to Africa\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38\u201339}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was \"legendary\".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as \"a great coward\" who rules a \"country where black men are chained and flogged.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem,{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} with many regarding him as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7|3a1=Semaj|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=221}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}\n\n===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930\u20131949===\n\nHaile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Jamaica's Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2\u20135; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132|3a1=Loadenthal|3y=2013|3p=10}} Over the following years, a number of street preachers\u2014most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]\u2014began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=2|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=81|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=9}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=2}} Clarke stated that \"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=46}}\n\n[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by many Rastas to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.]]\n\nHowell has been described as the \"leading figure\" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85\u201386|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary

prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George

exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile

employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international

Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Rubenstein|2a2=Suarez|2y=1994|2p=4}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America.

Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems;

{"title_page": "Transformer (machine learning model)", "text_new": "The '''Transformer''' is a [[Deep learning|deep]] [[machine learning]] model introduced in 2017, used primarily in the field of [[natural language processing]] (NLP).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite arxiv|last=Polosukhin|first=Illia|last2=Kaiser|first2=Lukasz|last3=Gomez|first3=Aidan N.|last4=Jones|first4=Llion|last5=Uszkoreit|first5=Jakob|last6=Parmar|first6=Niki|last7=Shazeer|first7=Noam|last8=Vaswani|first8=Ashish|date=2017-06-12|title=Attention Is All You Need|eprint=1706.03762|class=cs.CL}}</ref> Like [[recurrent neural networks]] (RNNs), Transformers are designed to handle ordered sequences of data, such as natural language, for various tasks such as [[Statistical machine translation|machine translation]] and [[Automatic summarization|text summarization]]. However, unlike RNNs, Transformers do not require that the sequence be processed in order. So, if the data in question is natural language, the Transformer does not need to process the beginning of a sentence before it processes the end.

The group meet outside a Boston warehouse with intermediary Justine ([[Brie Larson]]), and a representative, Ord ([[Armie Hammer]]), leads them inside. The group is there to buy guns from arms dealer Vernon ([[Sharlto Copley]]) and his associates, Martin ([[Babou Ceesay]]), Harry ([[Jack Reynor]]) and Gordon ([[Noah Taylor]]). Despite tensions between the two groups and the fact that Vernon supplied the wrong rifles, the weapons are unloaded from a van and Chris\u2019 group hands over the money in a briefcase.\n\nStevo realizes that Harry was the one who beat him up the day before, and refuses to go near him, irritating Frank. Harry eventually notices and lashes out at Stevo, furthering the tensions between the groups. Stevo seemingly apologises, but then brags about what he did to Harry's cousin. Infuriated, Harry shoots Stevo in the shoulder. Both groups split off and begin shooting at each other. Martin, who was holding the briefcase, is grazed by a bullet in the head. The briefcase now lies in the open, with Vernon attempting to coerce his men to get it.\n\nBernie is shot in the back by Vernon and dies. Soon, two men with rifles begin shooting at both groups. One of them, Jimmy ([[Mark Monero]]), is killed, and the other is recognised by Ord as Howie ([[Patrick Bergin]]), who explains that he was hired to kill everyone and take the money. Before Howie can reveal who hired him, he is shot dead by Chris's group. Chris, defending Justine, requests that Vernon's group let her go. Gordon crawls after her, intent on killing her.\n\nAs the shooting continues, a telephone rings in one of the offices. Realising that they can call for backup, Chris sends the wounded Frank to the office, pursued by a wounded Vernon. Gordon chases Justine to the warehouse entrance, but she manages to kill him. As Chris, Ord, Stevo and Harry engage in another shootout, Vernon is severely burned by a trap set by Frank but kills him as he reaches the phone.\n\nMartin regains consciousness, and begins deliriously shooting at his own group. He reveals that he planned to double-cross Vernon and hired Howie and Jimmy to kill the others. Martin gets the briefcase, but dies from his injuries. After getting past Ord and Harry, Chris reaches the office and kills Vernon. Using the phone to call his associates, Chris is cut off by Ord while Harry distracts Stevo. Returning to the warehouse, Justine takes Jimmy's rifle but passes out.\n\nOne of Chris's associates, Leary ([[Tom Davis (British actor)|Tom Davis]]), arrives at the warehouse in search of his IRA comrades, but is killed by Harry. Taking the briefcase, Harry attempts to escape in the van, fired at by Stevo and Ord. Harry runs over Stevo, killing him, but not before Stevo shoots him dead. The fire Frank caused spreads and the sprinklers come on. Exhausted and out of bullets, Ord and Chris agree to stop fighting, take the money, and attempt to escape before the inevitable arrival of the police.\n\nJustine shoots Ord in the head and Chris in the stomach. Lying on the ground, Chris tells Justine he regrets not having known her better as he begins to succumb to his wounds, and Justine reveals she was in on the double-cross with Martin. As Justine limps to the warehouse entrance with the money, the sound of sirens grows louder. When red and blue flashing lights appear under the bottom of the exit, Justine realizes although she survived, she will not escape.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Chris\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Ord\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Justine\n* [[Sharlto Copley]] as Vernon\n* [[Jack Reynor]] as Harry\n* [[Babou Ceesay]] as Martin\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as Bernie\n* [[Sam Riley]] as Stevo\n* [[Michael Smiley]] as Frank\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Gordon\n* [[Patrick Bergin]] as Howie\n* [[Tom Davis (British actor)|Tom Davis]] as Leary\n* [[Mark Monero]] as Jimmy\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn October 2014, [[Olivia Wilde]], [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]], [[Armie Hammer]], [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Michael Smiley]] joined the cast of the film, with [[Ben Wheatley]] set to direct from a screenplay he wrote with Amy Jump.

The group meet outside a Boston warehouse with intermediary Justine ([[Brie Larson]]), and a representative, Ord ([[Armie Hammer]]), leads them inside. The group is there to buy guns from arms dealer Vernon ([[Sharlto Copley]]) and his associates, Martin ([[Babou Ceesay]]), Harry ([[Jack Reynor]]) and Gordon ([[Noah Taylor]]). Despite tensions between the two groups and the fact that Vernon supplied the wrong rifles, the weapons are unloaded from a van and Chris\u2019 group hands over the money in a briefcase.\n\nStevo realizes that Harry was the one who beat him up the day before, and refuses to go near him, irritating Frank. Harry eventually notices and lashes out at Stevo, furthering the tensions between the groups. Stevo seemingly apologises, but then brags about what he did to Harry's cousin. Infuriated, Harry shoots Stevo in the shoulder. Both groups split off and begin shooting at each other. Martin, who was holding the briefcase, is grazed by a bullet in the head. The briefcase now lies in the open, with Vernon attempting to coerce his men to get it.\n\nBernie is shot in the back by Vernon and dies. Soon, two men with rifles begin shooting at both groups. One of them, Jimmy ([[Mark Monero]]), is killed, and the other is recognised by Ord as Howie ([[Patrick Bergin]]), who explains that he was hired to kill everyone and take the money. Before Howie can reveal who hired him, he is shot dead by Chris's group. Chris, defending Justine, requests that Vernon's group let her go. Gordon crawls after her, intent on killing her.\n\nAs the shooting continues, a telephone rings in one of the offices. Realising that they can call for backup, Chris sends the wounded Frank to the office, pursued by a wounded Vernon. Gordon chases Justine to the warehouse entrance, but she manages to kill him. As Chris, Ord, Stevo and Harry engage in another shootout, Vernon is severely burned by a trap set by Frank but kills him as he reaches the phone.\n\nMartin regains consciousness, and begins deliriously shooting at his own group.

After getting past Ord and Harry, Chris reaches the office and kills Vernon. Using the phone to call his associates, Chris is cut off by Ord while Harry distracts Stevo. Returning to the warehouse, Justine takes Jimmy's rifle but passes out.\n\nOne of Chris's associates, Leary ([[Tom Davis (British actor)|Tom Davis]]), arrives at the warehouse in search of his IRA comrades, but is killed by Harry. Taking the briefcase, Harry attempts to escape in the van, fired at by Stevo and Ord. Harry runs over Stevo, killing him, but not before Stevo shoots him dead.
