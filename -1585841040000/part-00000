Most often the term is used to describe a [[liquid]]'s tendency to [[evaporate]].  It is a measure of the tendency of [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s to escape from a liquid or a [[solid]]. A liquid's atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the [[normal boiling point]].\n\nThe higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid.\n\nThe vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids.<ref>{{cite book|author=Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W. (Editors)|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn= 978-0-07-049841-9|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}}</ref> As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.\n\nFor example, at any given temperature, [[methyl chloride]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (-24.2&nbsp;\u00b0C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure. Note that at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level, so boiling points of liquids are reduced. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm, so by using the graph, the boiling point of [[Diethyl ether]] would be approximately 7.5&nbsp;\u00b0C versus 34.6&nbsp;\u00b0C at sea level (1 atm).\n\n==Equilibrium constants of reactions involving gas mixtures==\nIt is possible to work out the [[equilibrium constant]] for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula. For a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products, such as:\n:<math>a\\,A + b\\,B \\leftrightarrow c\\,C + d\\,D</math>\n\nthe equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:\n:<math>K_p = \\frac{p_C^c\\, p_D^d} {p_A^a\\, p_B^b}</math>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|<math>K_p</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the equilibrium constant of the reaction\n|-\n!align=right|<math>a</math>  \n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of reactant <math>A</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>b</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of reactant <math>B</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>c</math>  \n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of product <math>C</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>d</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of product <math>D</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_C^c</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>C</math> raised to the power of <math>c</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_D^d</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>D</math> raised to the power of <math>d</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_A^a</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>A</math> raised to the power of <math>a</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_B^b</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>B</math> raised to the power of <math>b</math>\n|}\n\nFor reversible reactions, changes in the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]. However, the [[Chemical kinetics|reaction kinetics]] may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.\n\n==Henry's law and the solubility of gases==\n{{main|Henry's law}}\n\nGases will [[solvation|dissolve]] in [[liquid]]s to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid (called the ''[[solvent]]'').<ref name=RolfeSander>[http://www.henrys-law.org An extensive list of Henry's law constants, and a conversion tool]</ref> The equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is:\n\n:(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; <math>k = \\frac {p_x}{C_x}</math>\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|<math>k</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the equilibrium constant for the [[solvation]] process\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_x</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;partial pressure of gas <math>x</math> in equilibrium with a [[solution]] containing some of the gas \n|-\n!align=right|<math>C_x</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the concentration of gas <math>x</math> in the liquid solution\n|}\n\nThe form of the equilibrium constant shows that '''the concentration of a [[solution|solute]] gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution'''.

[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] and sudden unconsciousness becomes a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.16 bar absolute.  [[Oxygen toxicity]], involving convulsions, becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high.  The [[NOAA]] Diving Manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 1.6 bar absolute, of 120 minutes at 1.5 bar absolute, of 150 minutes at 1.4 bar absolute, of 180 minutes at 1.3 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 1.2 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded. The partial pressure of oxygen determines the [[maximum operating depth]] of a gas mixture.\n\n[[Nitrogen narcosis|Narcosis]] is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure. Typically, the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for [[technical diving]] may be around 4.5&nbsp;bar absolute, based on an [[equivalent narcotic depth]] of {{convert|35|m|ft}}.\n\nThe effect of a toxic contaminant such as [[carbon monoxide]] in breathing gas is also related to the partial pressure when breathed. A mixture which may be relatively safe at the surface could be dangerously toxic at the maximum depth of a dive, or a tolerable level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the breathing loop of a diving [[rebreather]] may become intolerable within seconds during descent when the partial pressure rapidly increases, and could lead to panic or incapacitation of the diver.\n\n==In medicine==\nThe partial pressures of particularly oxygen (<math>p_{{\\mathrm{O}}_2}</math>) and carbon dioxide (<math>p_{{\\mathrm{CO}}_2}</math>) are important parameters in tests of [[arterial blood gas]]es, but can also be measured in, for example, [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. {{why?|date=October 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=700px\n|+[[Reference range]]s for <math>p_{{\\mathrm{O}}_2}</math> and <math>p_{{\\mathrm{CO}}_2}</math>\n!  !!

Most often the term is used to describe a [[liquid]]'s tendency to [[evaporate]].  It is a measure of the tendency of [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s to escape from a liquid or a [[solid]]. A liquid's atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the '''[[normal boiling point]]'''.\n\nThe higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid.\n\nThe vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids.<ref>{{cite book|author=Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W. (Editors)|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn= 978-0-07-049841-9|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}}</ref> As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.\n\nFor example, at any given temperature, [[methyl chloride]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (-24.2&nbsp;\u00b0C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure. Note that at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level, so boiling points of liquids are reduced. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm, so by using the graph, the boiling point of [[Diethyl ether]] would be approximately 7.5&nbsp;\u00b0C versus 34.6&nbsp;\u00b0C at sea level (1 atm).\n\n==Equilibrium constants of reactions involving gas mixtures==\nIt is possible to work out the [[equilibrium constant]] for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula. For a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products, such as:\n:<math>a\\,A + b\\,B \\leftrightarrow c\\,C + d\\,D</math>\n\nthe equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:\n:<math>K_p = \\frac{p_C^c\\, p_D^d} {p_A^a\\, p_B^b}</math>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|<math>K_p</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the equilibrium constant of the reaction\n|-\n!align=right|<math>a</math>  \n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of reactant <math>A</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>b</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of reactant <math>B</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>c</math>  \n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of product <math>C</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>d</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;coefficient of product <math>D</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_C^c</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>C</math> raised to the power of <math>c</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_D^d</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>D</math> raised to the power of <math>d</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_A^a</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>A</math> raised to the power of <math>a</math>\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_B^b</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the partial pressure of <math>B</math> raised to the power of <math>b</math>\n|}\n\nFor reversible reactions, changes in the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]. However, the [[Chemical kinetics|reaction kinetics]] may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.\n\n==Henry's law and the solubility of gases==\n{{main|Henry's law}}\n\nGases will [[solvation|dissolve]] in [[liquid]]s to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid (called the ''[[solvent]]'').<ref name=RolfeSander>[http://www.henrys-law.org An extensive list of Henry's law constants, and a conversion tool]</ref> The equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is:\n\n:(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; <math>k = \\frac {p_x}{C_x}</math>\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|<math>k</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the equilibrium constant for the [[solvation]] process\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_x</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;partial pressure of gas <math>x</math> in equilibrium with a [[solution]] containing some of the gas \n|-\n!align=right|<math>C_x</math>\n|align=left|= &nbsp;the concentration of gas <math>x</math> in the liquid solution\n|}\n\nThe form of the equilibrium constant shows that '''the concentration of a [[solution|solute]] gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution'''. This statement is known as [[Henry's law]] and the equilibrium constant <math>k</math> is quite often referred to as the Henry's law constant.<ref name=RolfeSander/><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Francis L.

Since both may be referred to as the Henry's law constant, readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the Henry's law equation is being used.\n\nHenry's law is an approximation that only applies for dilute, ideal solutions and for solutions where the liquid solvent does not [[chemical reaction|react chemically]] with the gas being dissolved.\n\n==In diving breathing gases==\nIn [[underwater diving]] the physiological effects of individual component gases of [[breathing gas]]es is a function of partial pressure.\n\nUsing diving terms, partial pressure is calculated as:\n:'''partial pressure = (total absolute pressure) \u00d7 (volume fraction of gas component)'''\n\nFor the component gas \"i\":\n:'''p<sub>i</sub> = P \u00d7 F<sub>i</sub>'''\n\nFor example, at {{convert|50|m|ft|0}} underwater, the total absolute pressure is {{convert|6|bar|kPa|abbr=on}} (i.e., 1 bar of [[atmospheric pressure]] + 5 bar of water pressure) and the partial pressures of the main components of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[oxygen]] 21% by volume and [[nitrogen]] approximately 79% by volume are:\n:'''pN<sub>2</sub>''' = 6 bar \u00d7 0.79 = 4.7 bar absolute\n:'''pO<sub>2</sub>''' = 6 bar \u00d7 0.21 = 1.3 bar absolute\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|p<sub>i</sub>  \n|align=left|= partial pressure of gas component i &nbsp;= <math>P_{\\mathrm{i}}</math> in the terms used in this article\n|-\n!align=right|P\n|align=left|= total pressure = <math>P</math> in the terms used in this article\n|-\n!align=right|F<sub>i</sub> \n|align=left|= volume fraction of gas component i &nbsp;= &nbsp;mole fraction, <math>x_{\\mathrm{i}}</math>, in the terms used in this article\n|-\n!align=right|pN<sub>2</sub>\n|align=left|= partial pressure of nitrogen&nbsp; = <math>P_{{\\mathrm{N}}_2}</math> in the terms used in this article\n|-\n!align=right|pO<sub>2</sub> \n|align=left|= partial pressure of oxygen&nbsp; = <math>P_{{\\mathrm{O}}_2}</math> in the terms used in this article\n|}\n\nThe minimum safe lower limit for the partial pressures of oxygen in a gas mixture is {{convert|0.16|bar|kPa}} absolute. [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] and sudden unconsciousness becomes a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.16 bar absolute.  [[Oxygen toxicity]], involving convulsions, becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high.  The [[NOAA]] Diving Manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 1.6 bar absolute, of 120 minutes at 1.5 bar absolute, of 150 minutes at 1.4 bar absolute, of 180 minutes at 1.3 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 1.2 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded. The partial pressure of oxygen determines the [[maximum operating depth]] of a gas mixture.\n\n[[Nitrogen narcosis|Narcosis]] is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure. Typically, the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for [[technical diving]] may be around 4.5&nbsp;bar absolute, based on an [[equivalent narcotic depth]] of {{convert|35|m|ft}}.\n\nThe effect of a toxic contaminant such as [[carbon monoxide]] in breathing gas is also related to the partial pressure when breathed. A mixture which may be relatively safe at the surface could be dangerously toxic at the maximum depth of a dive, or a tolerable level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the breathing loop of a diving [[rebreather]] may become intolerable within seconds during descent when the partial pressure rapidly increases, and could lead to panic or incapacitation of the diver.\n\n==In medicine==\nThe partial pressures of particularly oxygen (<math>p_{{\\mathrm{O}}_2}</math>) and carbon dioxide (<math>p_{{\\mathrm{CO}}_2}</math>) are important parameters in tests of [[arterial blood gas]]es, but can also be measured in, for example, [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. {{why?|date=October 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=700px\n|+[[Reference range]]s for <math>p_{{\\mathrm{O}}_2}</math> and <math>p_{{\\mathrm{CO}}_2}</math>\n!  !!

[[Federal Aviation Administration]] data says it had 4,348 passenger boardings (enplanements) in [[calendar year]] 2013, a decrease of 30.5% from 6,254 enplanements in 2012.\n\n== History ==\nDuring World War II, the airfield was used by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a [[Second Air Force]] cold weather bomber training base as an auxiliary to [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], and by Air Proving Ground Command.\n\n[[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] units underwent advanced training before going overseas. One unit that trained here was the [[702d Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[445th Bombardment Group]].<ref name=\"B-24Mike\">Michael Simpson, History of the 445th Bomb Group, Revised Edition</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThe airport covers 919 [[acre]]s (372 [[hectare|ha]]) at an elevation of 1,749 feet (533 m). It has two runways: 12/30 is 6,898 by 100 feet (2,102 x 30 m) concrete and 17/35 is 6,893 by 100 feet (2,100 x 30 m) concrete.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nIn 2013 the airport had 15,200 aircraft operations, an average 42<!--{{#expr:15200/365 round 0}}--> per day: 72<!--{{#expr:11000/15200*100 round 0}}-->% [[general aviation]], 18<!--{{#expr:2700/15200*100 round 0}}-->% [[air carrier]], and 10<!--{{#expr:1500/15200*100 round 0}}-->% [[air taxi]].

The upgrades included an overhaul of the interior design and an expanded [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] inspection area. The airport has no [[jet bridge]], as the turboprop planes that served the airport did not work with them. With the introduction of jet service to the airport in 2016 and the discussion of a possible new terminal building in coming years, the airport could acquire a jet bridge in the near future. Watertown is the only commercial airport in South Dakota without a jet bridge.\n\nThe airport has free parking.\n\n== Notable visitors ==\n[[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] landed at the airport twice, first in 2008 during his presidential campaign, and on May 8, 2015, to address the graduating class of 2015 from [[Lake Area Technical Institute]]. Both times, President Obama has arrived on a [[Boeing 757]], during his campaign, on a chartered [[North American Airlines]] 757, and as president, using a smaller version of [[Air Force One]] (the [[Boeing C-32]]).\n\n==Airline and destinations==\n\nAir service to Watertown is provided by [[SkyWest Airlines]] using 50-seat [[Canadair Regional Jet 200]]s operating as United Express, with daily flights to [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]] and [[Denver International Airport|Denver]].  $3.24 million (or $44.44 per seat) of annual funding from the [[Essential_Air_Service|Essential Air Service]] program for flights to Denver is currently scheduled to end April 30, 2021.  <ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.transportation.gov/office-policy/aviation-policy/essential-air-service-reports | publisher = U.S. Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n{{Airport destination list\n| [[United Express]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]]\n}}\n\n====Destinations====\n{| class=\"collapsible\" style=\"border:2px #aaa solid; width:500px; margin:0.2em auto;\"\n|-\n|-\n|{{Location map+ |United_States |width=600 |float=center\n|caption=Passenger destinations from Watertown <br /> ({{font color | red | Red}}) = Year-round Destination <br /> ({{font color | blue | Blue }}) = Future Destination <br /> ({{font color | pink | Pink }}) = Destination being terminated\n|places=\n{{Location map~ |United_States |lat=44.8994 |long=-97.1151 |position=right |label=<small>'''{{nowrap|Watertown}}'''</small>|caption=|mark=Airplane_silhouette.svg |marksize=20}}\n{{Location map~ |United_States |lat=39.861667 |long=-104.673056 |position=left |label=<small>'''{{nowrap|[[Denver International Airport|Denver]]}}'''</small>|label_size=100 |marksize=10}}\n{{Location map~ |United_States |lat=41.974186|long=-87.907783|position=left|label='''<small>[[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]]</small>'''|label_size=90 |marksize=10 }}\n}}\n|}\n\n===Former service===\n\nAirline flights at Watertown started about 1938; Braniff left in 1959. North Central arrived in 1957 and successor Republic left in 1985. The first jet flights were North Central DC9s in 1968.\n\n[[Mesaba Airlines]], operating as [[Northwest Airlink]], and later, [[Delta Connection]], served Watertown for years, with daily [[Saab 340]]s to [[Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport|Minneapolis/St. Paul]]. When [[Delta Airlines|Delta]] quit using the Saab 340 in December 2011, and announced the end of air service to Watertown, flights from Minneapolis temporarily used Delta's [[Canadair Regional Jet 200]], until [[Great Lakes Airlines]] took over 4 months later.\n\nGreat Lakes Airlines offered daily non-stop 19-seat (later 9-seat) [[Beechcraft 1900D]]s to Minneapolis/St. Paul, until city officials voted to end the service, citing unreliability of the airline.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://flygreatlakes.com/time_table/doc_files/time_table.pdf | title = Timetable | format = PDF | publisher = Great Lakes Airlines | date = March 23, 2015}}</ref> [[Great Lakes Airlines|Great Lakes]] ended service to the airport on September 30, 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Aerodynamics, Inc. (later [[California Pacific Airlines]]) began flying to Watertown with daily service to Denver, via Pierre. However, the airline suspended all operations nationwide and ended flights to Pierre and Watertown on January 17, 2019.\n\nAir service to Watertown resumed on April 3, 2019 with SkyWest Airlines operating as United Express.\n\n[[Sun Country Airlines]] flew several seasonal charter [[Boeing 737-800]]s to [[Laughlin/Bullhead City International Airport]] in [[Arizona]], known as \"casino or gamblers' flights,\" in coordination with travel agencies in [[Watertown, South Dakota|Watertown]].

[[Federal Aviation Administration]] data says it had 4,348 passenger boardings (enplanements) in [[calendar year]] 2013, a decrease of 30.5% from 6,254 enplanements in 2012.\n\n== History ==\nDuring World War II, the airfield was used by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a [[Second Air Force]] cold weather bomber training base as an auxiliary to [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], and by Air Proving Ground Command.\n\n[[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] units underwent advanced training before going overseas. One unit that trained here was the [[702d Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[445th Bombardment Group]].<ref name=\"B-24Mike\">Michael Simpson, History of the 445th Bomb Group, Revised Edition</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThe airport covers 919 [[acre]]s (372 [[hectare|ha]]) at an elevation of 1,749 feet (533 m). It has two runways: 12/30 is 6,898 by 100 feet (2,102 x 30 m) concrete and 17/35 is 6,893 by 100 feet (2,100 x 30 m) concrete.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nIn 2013 the airport had 15,200 aircraft operations, an average 42<!--{{#expr:15200/365 round 0}}--> per day: 72<!--{{#expr:11000/15200*100 round 0}}-->% [[general aviation]], 18<!--{{#expr:2700/15200*100 round 0}}-->% [[air carrier]], and 10<!--{{#expr:1500/15200*100 round 0}}-->% [[air taxi]].

The upgrades included an overhaul of the interior design and an expanded [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] inspection area. The airport has no [[jet bridge]], as the turboprop planes that served the airport did not work with them. With the introduction of jet service to the airport in 2016 and the discussion of a possible new terminal building in coming years, the airport could acquire a jet bridge in the near future. Watertown is the only commercial airport in South Dakota without a jet bridge.\n\nThe airport has free parking.\n\n== Notable visitors ==\n[[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] landed at the airport twice, first in 2008 during his presidential campaign, and on May 8, 2015, to address the graduating class of 2015 from [[Lake Area Technical Institute]]. Both times, President Obama has arrived on a [[Boeing 757]], during his campaign, on a chartered [[North American Airlines]] 757, and as president, using a smaller version of [[Air Force One]] (the [[Boeing C-32]]).\n\n==Airline and destinations==\n\nAir service to Watertown is provided by [[SkyWest Airlines]] using 50-seat [[Canadair Regional Jet 200]]s operating as United Express, with daily flights to [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]] and [[Denver International Airport|Denver]].\n\n{{Airport destination list\n| [[United Express]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]]\n}}\n\n====Destinations====\n{| class=\"collapsible\" style=\"border:2px #aaa solid; width:500px; margin:0.2em auto;\"\n|-\n|-\n|{{Location map+ |United_States |width=600 |float=center\n|caption=Passenger destinations from Watertown <br /> ({{font color | red | Red}}) = Year-round Destination <br /> ({{font color | blue | Blue }}) = Future Destination <br /> ({{font color | pink | Pink }}) = Destination being terminated\n|places=\n{{Location map~ |United_States |lat=44.8994 |long=-97.1151 |position=right |label=<small>'''{{nowrap|Watertown}}'''</small>|caption=|mark=Airplane_silhouette.svg |marksize=20}}\n{{Location map~ |United_States |lat=39.861667 |long=-104.673056 |position=left |label=<small>'''{{nowrap|[[Denver International Airport|Denver]]}}'''</small>|label_size=100 |marksize=10}}\n{{Location map~ |United_States |lat=41.974186|long=-87.907783|position=left|label='''<small>[[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]]</small>'''|label_size=90 |marksize=10 }}\n}}\n|}\n\n===Former service===\n\nAirline flights at Watertown started about 1938; Braniff left in 1959. North Central arrived in 1957 and successor Republic left in 1985. The first jet flights were North Central DC9s in 1968.\n\n[[Mesaba Airlines]], operating as [[Northwest Airlink]], and later, [[Delta Connection]], served Watertown for years, with daily [[Saab 340]]s to [[Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport|Minneapolis/St. Paul]]. When [[Delta Airlines|Delta]] quit using the Saab 340 in December 2011, and announced the end of air service to Watertown, flights from Minneapolis temporarily used Delta's [[Canadair Regional Jet 200]], until [[Great Lakes Airlines]] took over 4 months later.\n\nGreat Lakes Airlines offered daily non-stop 19-seat (later 9-seat) [[Beechcraft 1900D]]s to Minneapolis/St. Paul, until city officials voted to end the service, citing unreliability of the airline.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://flygreatlakes.com/time_table/doc_files/time_table.pdf | title = Timetable | format = PDF | publisher = Great Lakes Airlines | date = March 23, 2015}}</ref> [[Great Lakes Airlines|Great Lakes]] ended service to the airport on September 30, 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Aerodynamics, Inc. (later [[California Pacific Airlines]]) began flying to Watertown with daily service to Denver, via Pierre. However, the airline suspended all operations nationwide and ended flights to Pierre and Watertown on January 17, 2019.\n\nAir service to Watertown resumed on April 3, 2019 with SkyWest Airlines operating as United Express.\n\n[[Sun Country Airlines]] flew several seasonal charter [[Boeing 737-800]]s to [[Laughlin/Bullhead City International Airport]] in [[Arizona]], known as \"casino or gamblers' flights,\" in coordination with travel agencies in [[Watertown, South Dakota|Watertown]].

A  prominent Roman Catholic, he was a leading supporter of the cause of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. He was at the same time a loyalist who  played a leading role in suppressing the Rebellion of 1798.\n\n==Family==\nHe was the eldest son of Arthur James Plunkett, 7th Earl of Fingall and his wife Henrietta Wollascot of [[Woolhampton]], [[Berkshire]].

In 1807 he obtained an interview with the [[1st Duke of Wellington]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], who explained that Catholic Emancipation was not at that time practical politics, but that the remaining [[Penal Laws]] would be enforced with all possible moderation.<ref>[[Longford, Elizabeth]]  ''Wellington-the Years of the Sword''  Panther Books 1971</ref> As one of the leaders of the [[Catholic Association]] in its original form, which the Government maintained was illegal, he was briefly arrested, but never prosecuted.
