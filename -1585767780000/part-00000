He named the new printing office the \"Museum\" (like Valvasor before him), and printed the first books in [[Latin]] and in [[Croatian language|Croatian]].\n\nThe printing house was in operation between 1695 and 1706, and his best known work ''[[Croatia Rediviva]]'' (\"Croatia Revived\") was printed there in 1700.

Often this causes the stapes to adhere to the oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of [[conductive hearing loss]]. Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Menger|first=D.J.|author2=Tange, R.A. |title=The aetiology of otosclerosis: a review of the literature|journal=Clinical Otolaryngology and Allied Sciences|date=April 2003|volume=28|issue=2|pages=112\u2013120|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2273.2003.00675.x}}</ref> Two common treatments are [[stapedectomy]], the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and [[Stapedectomy#Stapedotomy|stapedotomy]], the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Arthur C.
