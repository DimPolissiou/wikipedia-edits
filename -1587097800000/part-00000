The college was founded in 1916 and is one of only 31 colleges of veterinary medicine in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is consistently ranked as one of the top 5 vet schools in the country, according to [[U.S. News]].<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php U.S. News Rankings]</ref> The college offers an undergraduate program in Biomedical Sciences, a professional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, and numerous graduate programs relating to veterinary medicine and epidemiology.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://www.cvm.tamu.edu/currentStudents.html Programs, Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first record of an attempt to teach veterinary science at the Agricultural & Mechanical College (as Texas A&M University was called at the time) was made in the third session of the college in 1878-79 when the college surgeon, D. Port Smythe, M.D., was also listed on the faculty as professor of anatomy, physiology and hygiene.  No course is described, however, and no further record is available to indicate that such a course was actually given.\n\nThe catalog of the fourth session also mentions proposed lectures in veterinary science, concerned mainly with domestic animals, but again no formal record exists of any actual courses given at the time.\n\nIn April 1888, the college received a state appropriation of $2500 for equipping and operating a Department of Veterinary Science, and on June 6, 1888, Dr. Mark Francis received his formal appointment to the faculty.  This marked the real beginning of professional veterinary medicine in Texas; Francis was the first trained veterinarian at the college and would become one of the most distinguished men in United States veterinary medicine.\n\n===Chronological history===\n*1888 - Department of Veterinary Science formally started.\n*1902 - Erection of the Chemistry and Veterinary Building.\n*1903 - First Veterinary Association in Texas organized at Fort Worth.

The college was founded in 1916 and is one of only 31 colleges of veterinary medicine in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is consistently ranked as one of the top 5 vet schools in the country, according to [[U.S. News]].<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php U.S. News Rankings]</ref> The college offers an undergraduate program in Biomedical Sciences, a professional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, and numerous graduate programs relating to veterinary medicine and epidemiology.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://www.cvm.tamu.edu/currentStudents.html Programs, Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first record of an attempt to teach veterinary science at the Agricultural & Mechanical College (as Texas A&M University was called at the time) was made in the third session of the college in 1878-79 when the college surgeon, D. Port Smythe, M.D., was also listed on the faculty as professor of anatomy, physiology and hygiene.  No course is described, however, and no further record is available to indicate that such a course was actually given.\n\nThe catalog of the fourth session also mentions proposed lectures in veterinary science, concerned mainly with domestic animals, but again no formal record exists of any actual courses given at the time.\n\nIn April 1888, the college received a state appropriation of $2500 for equipping and operating a Department of Veterinary Science, and on June 6, 1888, Dr. Mark Francis received his formal appointment to the faculty.  This marked the real beginning of professional veterinary medicine in Texas; Francis was the first trained veterinarian at the college and would become one of the most distinguished men in United States veterinary medicine.\n\n===Chronological history===\n*1888 - Department of Veterinary Science formally started.\n*1902 - Erection of the Chemistry and Veterinary Building.\n*1903 - First Veterinary Association in Texas organized at Fort Worth.

From 1999 until 2017 he was treasurer of the [[Democratic National Committee]].\n\n==Education==\nTobias graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1968 with a BA in [[Slavic languages]] and literature. In 1972, he obtained his [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from [[Harvard Business School]].\n\n== Writing ==\n[[File:Andrew Tobias (right) (1894086735).jpg|thumb|Tobias (right) in 1999]]\nWhile in business school, he wrote for ''[[New York Magazine]]'', and after graduation became a [[contributing editor]].\n\nIn 1973, Tobias wrote ''The Best Little Boy in the World'', an autobiography in which he spoke of his experiences as a gay boy and young man.
