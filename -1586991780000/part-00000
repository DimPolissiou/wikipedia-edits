In their [[Cinema of the Philippines|cinema]], dela Cruz's starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) was bought by the largest number of [[Film distributor|film distributors]] worldwide. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[primordial dwarfism]], dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions. With them dela Cruz started an acting career, and received his pseudonym Weng Weng. Dela Cruz's early film appearances includes his top billing shared with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978), and played in the supporting cast of three of [[Dolphy]]'s [[Comedy film|comedies]]. Dela Cruz's first lead in ''Agent OO'' (1981) launched two sequels and became his most well known role. \n\nThe sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), gave him brief international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success. Shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]] and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon and an online sensation. A lot of information published about dela Cruz was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor.

Celing added that dela Cruz was abandoned by the Caballes when they had a career change, became completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed after his first stroke and the only thing that was provided beyond this point was dela Cruz's casket paid by Peter, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother, and that [[Lotis Key]] was the only celebrity to attend.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Celing said he was never fully paid what he was owed as according to him the Caballes promised their mother that they buy them a house. Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes too possessive. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, who was a former actor and stuntman for a company named SOS Daredevils, had doubt due to dela Cruz's limitations and went on to say that dela Cruz didn't know how to read a script. Prior the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) for the rest of his career dela Cruz received his training by Nicart who trained his the same way he was. Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his comic timing and martial arts skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt.<ref name=\":5\" />  Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side.\n\nDela Cruz's has several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends. When they shared company, dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried.

In their [[Cinema of the Philippines|cinema]], dela Cruz's starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) was bought by the largest number of [[Film distributor|film distributors]] worldwide. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[primordial dwarfism]], dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions. With them dela Cruz started an acting career, and received his pseudonym Weng Weng. Dela Cruz's early film appearances includes his top billing shared with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978), and played in the supporting cast of three of [[Dolphy]]'s [[Comedy film|comedies]]. Dela Cruz's first lead in ''Agent OO'' (1981) launched two sequels and became his most well known role. \n\nThe sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), gave him brief international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success. Shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]] and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon and an online sensation. A lot of information published about dela Cruz was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor.

As described by his brother on that morning dela Cruz, who was already bedstricken due to a previous heart attack, fell from his bed and was found unconscious. Dela Cruz was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The official cause is heart attack due to hypertension.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Personal ==\nCeling and Filipino actor Franco Guerrero said that dela Cruz never had any romantic relationships. Guerrero said that dela Cruz said he would brag about sexual exploit but never saw his actual girlfriends. Director Dante Pangilinan said that dela Cruz had his first kiss on the set of ''Sila... Sa bawat bangketa'' (1977) after he asked Pangilinan if he could get an onscreen kiss, who said yes. According to him dela Cruz was  both delighted and nervous. Yehlen Catral, who played the damsel-in-distress a dela Cruz film, said she helped him introduce himself to women.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=219-239|chapter=An interview with Yehlen Catral}}</ref> According to director Eddie Nicart if dela Cruz would get free from the set, he would immediately go where there is drinks and women, and would consistently ask their whereabouts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nProducer Peter and Cora Caballes published account of their relationship with dela Cruz at the time of his prime went as followed. They said that they adopted dela Cruz ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. Contemporary action film star [[Rez Cortez]], Franco Guerrero, and Nelson Anderson, who are critical of the couple, have asserted that with the Caballes dela Cruz was provided shelter, received a per diem that was higher than most salaries considering where dela Cruz from and travelled the world. Countries visited by dela Cruz includes [[France]], and [[United States]]. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> Aside from Vinarao's account, those of Cortez, Guerrero, Anderson, as well as [[Roland Dantes]], Busty Santos, and director Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz's by the Caballes appalling. According to the filmmakers of the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]],'' by the time they tracked down the couple down to be interviewed that Peter had passed away in 2007, while Cora never responded on the matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=205-217|chapter=The search continues}}</ref>\n\nCeling denies Peter and Cora Caballes's account on his adoption and said that they just borrowed him when needed as if dela Cruz would go on a holiday with them. Celing added that dela Cruz was abandoned by the Caballes when they had a career change, became completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed after his first stroke and the only thing that was provided beyond this point was dela Cruz's casket paid by Peter, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother, and that [[Lotis Key]] was the only celebrity to attend.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Celing said he was never fully paid what he was owed as according to him the Caballes promised their mother that they buy them a house. Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes too possessive. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, who was a former actor and stuntman for a company named SOS Daredevils, had doubt due to dela Cruz's limitations and went on to say that dela Cruz didn't know how to read a script. Prior the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) for the rest of his career dela Cruz received his training by Nicart who trained his the same way he was. Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his comic timing and martial arts skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt.<ref name=\":5\" />  Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side.\n\nDela Cruz's has several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends. When they shared company, dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, the Caballes separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref> Catral stated she had some affection for dela Cruz, would prefer to hang with him instead of other crew member, and when she stopped acting to go to law school she made sure to say goodbye to only two actors, dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

In 2010, [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' a documentary film that dealt with the Filipino movie exploitation craze of the 1970s and 1980s, paid a special homage to dela Cruz's movie career. The basis of the first film was the 2007 rough cut of Andrew Leavolds's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' released in 2013, about discovering dela Cruz's life.\n\nDela Cruz's real voice as rarely been heard outside of Philippines, since the original dubs of his films have never been available outside of his home country.\n\nDela Cruz is the first Filipino actor to have a documentary and a book written about him published in western countries.\n\nAcademic Dr. [[Tilman Baumg\u00e4rtel]] expressed discomfort watching Weng Weng films saying they are pre-modern, reminding him of the Medieval times where royalties would have a handicap, a dwarf act as a jester, and would be already funny based on that.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz's image is very controversial within Philippines' local film industry, with some auteur cineaste an academic feeling that it is an uncomfortable image of the country, especially at a time where they had no international figures. However directors [[Bobby A. Suarez]] and [[Tikoy Aguiluz]] felt that dela Cruz's success was glorious and couldn't be happier since according them it left the right people upset.

When dela Cruz trained with him with the stuntmen's organisation SOS Daredevils, like everyone else he had to start back in Karate from white belt and gradually go to black, while teaching dela Cruz how to jump and perform stunts from tall heights.

He concluded that dela Cruz became a real black belt in [[Karate]] with them and a first rate stuntmen who performed all of his own stunts fearlessly.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Mythos, mythicism, and religion. ==\nWhile dela Cruz's life was barely documented many rumors surrounded him while some was true others were debunked.\n\nIn so far dela Cruz was falsely rumored to have been a comedian, a [[dentistry]] student, [[customs officer]], to have live bestselling bootleg recording of him singing [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"My Way\" with former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]], and real life secret agent.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blackbeltmag.com/arts/history-philosophy/filipino-martial-artist-showcased-in-quirky-film-tilted-the-search-for-weng-weng|title=Filipino Martial Artist Showcased In Quirky Film Titled \"The Search For Weng Weng\" {{!}} Black Belt Magazine|date=2015-01-20|website=blackbeltmag.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nDela Cruz was official made an official secret agent by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].

Both his common collaborator actor [[Dolphy]], and director Dante Pangilinan said that casting dela Cruz would bring luck to a film project.

A devout but apolitical Roman Catholic and an electrician by profession, Schmid was conscripted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]] and later into the ''Wehrmacht'' during [[World War II]]. Put in charge of an office to return stranded German soldiers to their units in late August 1941, he began to help Jews after being approached by two pleading for his intercession. Schmid hid Jews in his apartment, obtained work permits to save Jews from the [[Ponary massacre]], transferred Jews in ''Wehrmacht'' trucks to safer locations, and aided the [[Vilna Ghetto]] underground. It is estimated that he saved as many as 300 Jews before his arrest in January 1942. He was executed on 13 April.\n\nAfter the war, Schmid was recognized as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to help Jews and was seen as a symbol of the few Germans who defied their government's extermination program. His reception was more conflicted in Germany and Austria, where he was still viewed as a traitor. The first official commemoration of him in Germany did not occur until 2000, but he is now hailed as an example of [[civil courage]] for ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' soldiers to follow.\n\n== Early life ==\nAnton Schmid was born in [[Vienna]], then [[Austria-Hungary]], on 9 January 1900. His father was a baker, and both of his parents were devout [[Roman Catholic]]s from [[Nikolsburg]], [[Moravia]] (now Mikulov, [[Czech Republic]]). They had Schmid baptized and educated him in a Catholic elementary school. After graduation, he apprenticed as an electrician.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=74}} Schmid was drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1918{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=74}} and survived intense battles during the [[Italian Front (World War I)|retreat from Italy]] in the final months of [[World War I]]. He became an electrician and opened a small radio shop on {{illm|Klosterneuburger Stra\u00dfe|de|Klosterneuburger_Stra\u00dfe|de|Liste_der_Stra\u00dfennamen_von_Wien/Brigittenau#K|display=1|vertical-align=sup|}}, [[Brigittenau]], Vienna where he employed two Jews. Allegedly, as a young man he was in love with a Jewish girl.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=501}}{{sfn|Kurier|2013}} Schmid, who was married and had one daughter,{{sfn|Jeanrond|2013|p=1}} did not belong to any organizations besides the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=501}}\n\nGerman historian [[Wolfram Wette]] describes him as a non-[[ideological]] [[humanitarian]] whose [[Antifascism|opposition to Nazism]] stemmed purely from his respect for human life. According to {{illm|Hermann Adler (writer)|de|Hermann_Adler_(Schriftsteller)|fr|Hermann_Adler_(\u00e9crivain)|lt=Hermann Adler}}, one of the Jews who Schmid rescued, he was a \"simple sergeant\" and \"a socially awkward man in thought and speech\" who did not read newspapers or books. Little is known about Schmid's life before [[World War II]].{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=74}} After the [[Anschluss|German annexation of Austria]] in 1938, Schmid made a [[citizen's arrest]] of a man who broke the window of a Jewish neighbor and helped some Jewish friends escape into nearby [[Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=501}}{{sfn|Kurier|2013}} After the outbreak of war upon the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, he was drafted into the [[Heer (Wehrmacht)|German army]], but was not expected to serve on the front lines due to his age. According to Wette, he was a \"civilian in uniform\" who did not conform to military culture.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|pp=501\u2013502}}{{sfn|Bartrop|2016|pp=246\u2013247}} At first he was stationed in Poland and Belarus.{{sfn|Priemel|2008|p=391}}\n\n==Rescue actions in Vilnius==\n{{further|The Holocaust in Lithuania|Vilna Ghetto}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B10160, Wilna, Juden, litauischer Polizist.jpg|thumb|right|Lithuanian collaborator with Jewish prisoners, July 1941]]\n\nIn late August 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], he was transferred to the ''Landeswehr'' Battalion 898 in [[Vilnius]], then part of the [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] German occupation zone. Schmid was reassigned to an office called Feldkommandantur 814, whose personnel were charged with collecting German soldiers who had been separated from their units and reassigning them.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=75}}{{sfn|Priemel|2008|p=391}} Although Schmid interrogated the soldiers strictly, he sympathized with them\u2014many were in fact suffering from [[combat fatigue]]\u2014and avoided charging them with military offenses such as desertion or cowardice in the face of the enemy, which could have resulted in a death sentence.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=76}}\n\nDuring the first week of September alone, 3,700 Jews were rounded up and murdered, most at the [[Ponary massacre|Ponary killing pits]] outside of town. Schmid could see the collection point outside the window and witnessed scenes of great brutality. The first Jew who he helped was Max Salinger, a [[Polish Jew]] from [[Bielsko Biala]] fluent in Polish and German; most likely Salinger approached Schmid. Schmid gave Salinger the paybook of Private Max Huppert, a ''Wehrmacht'' soldier who had been killed, and employed him as a typewriter in the office. Salinger survived the war.{{sfn|Wette|2014|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}} The second Jew who Schmid rescued was a 23-year-old [[Lithuanian Jewish]] woman named Luisa Emaitisaite. Emaitisaite had managed to dodge the roundups one day but was caught outside the ghetto after curfew, which was punishable by death. Hiding in a doorway, she saw Schmid walking past and begged for his help. Schmid hid her in his apartment temporarily and later hired her for the office, where her knowledge of several languages and stenography was helpful. Her work permit protected her and she also survived the war.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=76}} These examples show that Schmid did not set out to help Jews, but instead that his rescue actions were driven by their appeals for help.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=75}}\n\n{{quotebox|align=right|width=25em|I want to tell you how this all came about.

Due to the lack of willing, skilled Lithuanian workers, many Jews were employed.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}{{sfn|Priemel|2008|pp=391\u2013392}} In October 1941, many permits were cancelled with a view to murdering many of the Jews in the ghetto. Schmid's office, with 150 Jewish workers at the time, was only allocated 15 permits, which covered 60 Jews including holders and family members.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=77}} The Jews called these certificates \"leave from death papers\" because they usually prevented the police and SS from rounding up and murdering the holders.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}} The other 90 Jews begged Schmid to drive them in ''Wehrmacht'' trucks to the nearby town of [[Lida]], Belarus, where they believed that they would be safer. Schmid did so, temporarily saving them from death at Ponary, and made several trips to Lida with other Jews.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=77}} Later, Schmid managed to obtain more of these life-saving permits and eventually employed 103 Jews in various jobs.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}{{sfn|Priemel|2008|pp=392\u2013393}} According to testimony, Schmid treated his workers\u2014both Jews and [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet prisoners of war]]{{sfn|Wette|2014|pp=76\u201377}}\u2014humanely and even managed to rescue some who had been taken to [[Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison]] for execution.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}\n\nFrom November 1941 until his arrest in January, Schmid hid Hermann Adler, a Bratislava-born Jewish resistance member, and his wife Anita under false papers in Schmid's apartment in Vilnius.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=281}}{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|pp=503\u2013504}}{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=77}} Adler introduced Schmid to key figures in the Vilna Ghetto resistance movement, including [[Mordechai Tenenbaum]], the leader of the 1943 [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto uprising]], and [[Haika Grossman|Chaika Grossman]]. Schmid's apartment was used as a meeting place for Jewish partisans; during a meeting on New Year's Eve 1941, Tenenbaum made Schmid an honorary member of the Vilna Zionist Organization. Schmid, Adler, and Tenenbaum devised a plan to rescue Jews from the Vilna Ghetto by transporting them to [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto|Bia\u0142ystok]], Lida, and [[Grodno Ghetto|Grodno]], considered to be safer. Under the pretext that he was moving necessary Jewish workers to the places where they were most needed, he transported some 300 Jews from Vilna. Although Schmid did aid the Jewish resistance movement where he could, the partisans in the Vilna Ghetto did not have weapons at this time, so Schmid did not help armed Jewish rebels.{{sfn|Wette|2014|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\n{{quotebox|align=left|width=24em|We all must die.

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] arranged for Schmid to travel to Vilnius with her daughter and son-in-law despite Communist travel restrictions and funded a new gravestone with the inscription \"Here Rests A Man Who Thought It Was More Important To Help His Fellow Man Than To Live\".{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=505}} On 11 December 1990, a memorial plaque was erected outside his home in Vienna and unveiled by Mayor [[Helmut Zilk]]. A street in Vienna was named after him in March 2003,{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=504}} and ''[[Kurier]]'' described him as \"Austria's [[Oskar Schindler]]\".{{sfn|Kurier|2013}}\n\nIn January 2020 the [[Rossauer Barracks]] has been renamed to [[Robert Bernardis|Bernardis]]-Schmid-Kaserne.<ref>https://science.orf.at/stories/2997923</ref>\n\n=== Israel ===\n{{quotebox|width=30em|align=left|During the few minutes it took Kovner to tell of the help that had come from a German sergeant, a hush settled over the courtroom; it was as though the crowd had spontaneously decided to observe the usual two minutes of silence in honor of the man named Anton Schmid.

In an indication of how disobedience to Nazi authorities was still a sensitive subject in Germany, he added that: \"We are not free to choose our history, but we can choose the examples we take from that history.\" The commanding officer protested the removal of R\u00fcdel's name and refused to attend.{{sfn|Cohen|2000}}{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=505}} American historian [[Fritz Stern]] wrote that honoring Schmid \"strengthens our democratic spirit\" and is a repudiation of postwar attitudes in which German resistance was taboo.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|pp=505\u2013506}} The barracks was closed down in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spurensuche/Feldwebel-Schmid-Kaserne |url=https://www.oksh.de/mitmachen/lernen/medienkompetenz-mk-fuer-schule/spurensuche/spurensucheortsliste/spurensuchefeldwebel-schmid-kaserne/ |website=Offener Kanal Schleswig-Holstein |accessdate=20 October 2018 |language=de}}</ref> On 22 June 2016 the Bundeswehr barracks in [[Blankenburg (Harz)]] were named after Schmid.{{sfn|Scheidl|2016}}\n\nAccording to Schoeps, Schmid is \"probably the most remarkable\" of all the ''Wehrmacht'' rescuers in Vilnius, because he not only helped Jewish refugees but furthered Jewish resistance. Other ''Wehrmacht'' rescuers, such as Major [[Karl Plagge]], worked within the system to save Jews.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=501}} Wolfram Wette described Schmid as \"one of the gold grains hidden under the heap of rubble\"{{efn|{{lang-de|zu den Goldk\u00f6rnen geh\u00f6rt, die unter dem grossen Schutthaufen}}}} in the history of Nazi Germany, as there were so few Germans willing to risk their lives to help Jews.

A devout but apolitical Roman Catholic and an electrician by profession, Schmid was conscripted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]] and later into the ''Wehrmacht'' during [[World War II]]. Put in charge of an office to return stranded German soldiers to their units in late August 1941, he began to help Jews after being approached by two pleading for his intercession. Schmid hid Jews in his apartment, obtained work permits to save Jews from the [[Ponary massacre]], transferred Jews in ''Wehrmacht'' trucks to safer locations, and aided the [[Vilna Ghetto]] underground. It is estimated that he saved as many as 300 Jews before his arrest in January 1942. He was executed on 13 April.\n\nAfter the war, Schmid was recognized as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to help Jews and was seen as a symbol of the few Germans who defied their government's extermination program. His reception was more conflicted in Germany and Austria, where he was still viewed as a traitor. The first official commemoration of him in Germany did not occur until 2000, but he is now hailed as an example of [[civil courage]] for ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' soldiers to follow.\n\n== Early life ==\nAnton Schmid was born in [[Vienna]], then [[Austria-Hungary]], on 9 January 1900. His father was a baker, and both of his parents were devout [[Roman Catholic]]s from [[Nikolsburg]], [[Moravia]] (now Mikulov, [[Czech Republic]]). They had Schmid baptized and educated him in a Catholic elementary school. After graduation, he apprenticed as an electrician.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=74}} Schmid was drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1918{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=74}} and survived intense battles during the [[Italian Front (World War I)|retreat from Italy]] in the final months of [[World War I]]. He became an electrician and opened a small radio shop on {{illm|Klosterneuburger Stra\u00dfe|de|Klosterneuburger_Stra\u00dfe|de|Liste_der_Stra\u00dfennamen_von_Wien/Brigittenau#K|display=1|vertical-align=sup|}}, [[Brigittenau]], Vienna where he employed two Jews. Allegedly, as a young man he was in love with a Jewish girl.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=501}}{{sfn|Kurier|2013}} Schmid, who was married and had one daughter,{{sfn|Jeanrond|2013|p=1}} did not belong to any organizations besides the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=501}}\n\nGerman historian [[Wolfram Wette]] describes him as a non-[[ideological]] [[humanitarian]] whose [[Antifascism|opposition to Nazism]] stemmed purely from his respect for human life. According to {{illm|Hermann Adler (writer)|de|Hermann_Adler_(Schriftsteller)|fr|Hermann_Adler_(\u00e9crivain)|lt=Hermann Adler}}, one of the Jews who Schmid rescued, he was a \"simple sergeant\" and \"a socially awkward man in thought and speech\" who did not read newspapers or books. Little is known about Schmid's life before [[World War II]].{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=74}} After the [[Anschluss|German annexation of Austria]] in 1938, Schmid made a [[citizen's arrest]] of a man who broke the window of a Jewish neighbor and helped some Jewish friends escape into nearby [[Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=501}}{{sfn|Kurier|2013}} After the outbreak of war upon the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, he was drafted into the [[Heer (Wehrmacht)|German army]], but was not expected to serve on the front lines due to his age. According to Wette, he was a \"civilian in uniform\" who did not conform to military culture.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|pp=501\u2013502}}{{sfn|Bartrop|2016|pp=246\u2013247}} At first he was stationed in Poland and Belarus.{{sfn|Priemel|2008|p=391}}\n\n==Rescue actions in Vilnius==\n{{further|The Holocaust in Lithuania|Vilna Ghetto}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B10160, Wilna, Juden, litauischer Polizist.jpg|thumb|right|Lithuanian collaborator with Jewish prisoners, July 1941]]\n\nIn late August 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], he was transferred to the ''Landeswehr'' Battalion 898 in [[Vilnius]], then part of the [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] German occupation zone. Schmid was reassigned to an office called Feldkommandantur 814, whose personnel were charged with collecting German soldiers who had been separated from their units and reassigning them.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=75}}{{sfn|Priemel|2008|p=391}} Although Schmid interrogated the soldiers strictly, he sympathized with them\u2014many were in fact suffering from [[combat fatigue]]\u2014and avoided charging them with military offenses such as desertion or cowardice in the face of the enemy, which could have resulted in a death sentence.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=76}}\n\nDuring the first week of September alone, 3,700 Jews were rounded up and murdered, most at the [[Ponary massacre|Ponary killing pits]] outside of town. Schmid could see the collection point outside the window and witnessed scenes of great brutality. The first Jew who he helped was Max Salinger, a [[Polish Jew]] from [[Bielsko Biala]] fluent in Polish and German; most likely Salinger approached Schmid. Schmid gave Salinger the paybook of Private Max Huppert, a ''Wehrmacht'' soldier who had been killed, and employed him as a typewriter in the office. Salinger survived the war.{{sfn|Wette|2014|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}} The second Jew who Schmid rescued was a 23-year-old [[Lithuanian Jewish]] woman named Luisa Emaitisaite. Emaitisaite had managed to dodge the roundups one day but was caught outside the ghetto after curfew, which was punishable by death. Hiding in a doorway, she saw Schmid walking past and begged for his help. Schmid hid her in his apartment temporarily and later hired her for the office, where her knowledge of several languages and stenography was helpful. Her work permit protected her and she also survived the war.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=76}} These examples show that Schmid did not set out to help Jews, but instead that his rescue actions were driven by their appeals for help.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=75}}\n\n{{quotebox|align=right|width=25em|I want to tell you how this all came about.

Due to the lack of willing, skilled Lithuanian workers, many Jews were employed.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}{{sfn|Priemel|2008|pp=391\u2013392}} In October 1941, many permits were cancelled with a view to murdering many of the Jews in the ghetto. Schmid's office, with 150 Jewish workers at the time, was only allocated 15 permits, which covered 60 Jews including holders and family members.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=77}} The Jews called these certificates \"leave from death papers\" because they usually prevented the police and SS from rounding up and murdering the holders.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}} The other 90 Jews begged Schmid to drive them in ''Wehrmacht'' trucks to the nearby town of [[Lida]], Belarus, where they believed that they would be safer. Schmid did so, temporarily saving them from death at Ponary, and made several trips to Lida with other Jews.{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=77}} Later, Schmid managed to obtain more of these life-saving permits and eventually employed 103 Jews in various jobs.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}{{sfn|Priemel|2008|pp=392\u2013393}} According to testimony, Schmid treated his workers\u2014both Jews and [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet prisoners of war]]{{sfn|Wette|2014|pp=76\u201377}}\u2014humanely and even managed to rescue some who had been taken to [[Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison]] for execution.{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=502}}\n\nFrom November 1941 until his arrest in January, Schmid hid Hermann Adler, a Bratislava-born Jewish resistance member, and his wife Anita under false papers in Schmid's apartment in Vilnius.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=281}}{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|pp=503\u2013504}}{{sfn|Wette|2014|p=77}} Adler introduced Schmid to key figures in the Vilna Ghetto resistance movement, including [[Mordechai Tenenbaum]], the leader of the 1943 [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto uprising]], and [[Haika Grossman|Chaika Grossman]]. Schmid's apartment was used as a meeting place for Jewish partisans; during a meeting on New Year's Eve 1941, Tenenbaum made Schmid an honorary member of the Vilna Zionist Organization. Schmid, Adler, and Tenenbaum devised a plan to rescue Jews from the Vilna Ghetto by transporting them to [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto|Bia\u0142ystok]], Lida, and [[Grodno Ghetto|Grodno]], considered to be safer. Under the pretext that he was moving necessary Jewish workers to the places where they were most needed, he transported some 300 Jews from Vilna. Although Schmid did aid the Jewish resistance movement where he could, the partisans in the Vilna Ghetto did not have weapons at this time, so Schmid did not help armed Jewish rebels.{{sfn|Wette|2014|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\n{{quotebox|align=left|width=24em|We all must die.

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] arranged for Schmid to travel to Vilnius with her daughter and son-in-law despite Communist travel restrictions and funded a new gravestone with the inscription \"Here Rests A Man Who Thought It Was More Important To Help His Fellow Man Than To Live\".{{sfn|Schoeps|2008|p=505}} On 11 December 1990, a memorial plaque was erected outside his home in Vienna and unveiled by Mayor [[Helmut Zilk]].

Its official name was the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions. This objective was substantially achieved in 1838 under the terms of the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. \n\nA successor organisation, the [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], was formed in 1839 to fight for global abolition. After the end of slavery in the United States, the British organisation re-focussed. Through mergers and name changes, it is now known as [[Anti-Slavery International]].\n\n==Precursors==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\nThe elimination of [[slavery]] throughout the world was frequently in the mind of early [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]]. The committee which established the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1787 campaigned for an end to the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] from [[Western Africa]] to [[the New World]], a trade then dominated by Britain.\n\nThe [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] made the trade illegal in the British Empire, but brought no change to the condition of enslaved people. Following this, British abolitionists turned their attention to abolishing slavery itself, first in [[British colonies]], and later in the US and the colonies of other European powers (e.g., in South America), and in parts of the world where it had long been legal, such as in the Middle East, Africa, and China.\n\n==The Anti-Slavery Society of 1823==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe first British organisation to refer to itself as the Anti-Slavery Society began in 1823. Founding members included [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Clarkson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/shelves/slavery/ |title=Slavery and abolition |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}</ref> Its official name was the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions.\n\nIts work included supporting the first [[slave narrative]] to be published by a Black woman, [[Mary Prince]], ''The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave'' (1831). The publishers were sued by the family from which she had escaped. The book was much sought after, running into three editions in the year of its publication.\n\nA wide range of views emerged among the members. Broadly, there were abolitionists who insisted on the full working out of the gradual process of abolition and amelioration (which had its successes), and the generally younger, more radical members, whose moral outlook regarded slavery as a mortal sin to be ended forthwith. [[Elizabeth Heyrick]]'s 1824 pamphlet \"Immediate, not Gradual, Abolition\" gave the tone to the argument.\n\nThe latter group, including [[Joseph Sturge]] and many others, publicly campaigned throughout Britain. The idea was to engender public pressure for a new parliamentary act to outlaw slavery, rather than continue the gradualism of Whitehall's negotiations, mainly with colonial governments. In 1831 [[George Stephen (abolitionist)|George Stephen]] and Joseph Sturge formed a [[ginger group]] within the Anti-Slavery Society, the Agency Committee, to campaign for this new act of Parliament. This campaign, and public pressure, led to the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] of 1833, though it contained compromises which they disliked.\n\nJamaican mixed-race campaigners such as [[Louis Celeste Lecesne]] and [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)]] were also members of the Anti-Slavery Society.\n\nThe [[indentured labour]] schemes were particularly opposed by Sturge and the Agency Committee; the full working out of the Act would take several years, with slavery eventually being abolished throughout the British West Indies on 1 August 1838. In response to the new legislation, other members of the Anti-Slavery Society considered their work over. The original purpose, as reflected in the name of the society (abolition in the British dominions), had, they thought, been achieved.\n\n==The Anti-Slavery Society of 1839==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\nWith abolition of slavery throughout the British dominions achieved, British abolitionists in the Agency Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society considered that a successor organisation was needed to tackle slavery worldwide. Largely under the guidance of Joseph Sturge, the committee duly formed a new society, [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]] on 17 April 1839.<ref>[http://www.antislavery.org/english/what_we_do/antislavery_international_today/frequently_asked_questions.aspx About Anti-Slavery International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626074739/http://www.antislavery.org/english/what_we_do/antislavery_international_today/frequently_asked_questions.aspx |date=26 June 2010 }} antislavery.org</ref><ref>Patricia Hollis (1974).

Along with the founding committee, which included the Anglican [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet|Thomas Fowell Buxton]], the Quaker [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]], and the Congregationalist [[Josiah Conder (editor and author)|Josiah Conder]], they organised the first [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London in 1840. [[Thomas Clarkson]] was the key speaker, and the Convention attracted people from nations around the world where slavery was practiced. In 1944, a Journalist [[James Ewing Ritchie]] issued a paper to the society on sugar trade and slavery.<ref>Ritchie, James Ewing. 1944. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/52820/52820-h/52820-h.htm Thoughts on Slavery and Cheap Sugar, a Letter to The Members and Friends of The British And Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.]''</ref>\n\nThe convention had been advertised as a \"whole world\" convention, but the delegates representing anti-slavery societies in the United States included several women, among them [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who later were instrumental in the movement for women's rights. Convention leaders refused to seat the women delegates from America, and prominent male abolitionists such as Thomas Knight were outraged. He went on to form his own society. \n\nIn the 1850s, under Louis Chamerovzow, the society helped [[John Brown (fugitive slave)|John Brown]] write and publish his autobiography a decade before the [[American Civil War]] ended slavery in the United States.\n\nThe second secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, appointed under the honorary secretaries [[Joseph Cooper (abolitionist|Joseph Cooper]] and [[Edmund Sturge]], was the Rev. Aaron Buzacott (1829\u201381), the son of a South Seas missionary also named [[Aaron Buzacott]]. With American slavery abolished in 1865, Buzacott worked closely with Joseph Cooper in researching and publishing work designed to help abolish slavery in elsewhere, particularly in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa.\n\n==Twentieth century and now==\nIn 1909, the society merged with the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]] to form the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society, whose prominent member was [[Kathleen Simon, Viscountess Simon]].

The original purpose, as reflected in the name of the society (abolition in the British dominions), had, they thought, been achieved.\n\n==The Anti-Slavery Society of 1839==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\nWith abolition of slavery throughout the British dominions achieved, British abolitionists in the Agency Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society considered that a successor organisation was needed to tackle slavery worldwide. Largely under the guidance of Joseph Sturge, the committee duly formed a new society, [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]] on 17 April 1839.<ref>[http://www.antislavery.org/english/what_we_do/antislavery_international_today/frequently_asked_questions.aspx About Anti-Slavery International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626074739/http://www.antislavery.org/english/what_we_do/antislavery_international_today/frequently_asked_questions.aspx |date=26 June 2010 }} antislavery.org</ref><ref>Patricia Hollis (1974). Pressure from without in early Victorian England. p.39.</ref> It became widely known as the Anti-Slavery Society, as had the earlier society.\n\nThe first secretary was [[John Harfield Tredgold]], the first treasurer, [[George William Alexander]] of [[Stoke Newington]]. Along with the founding committee, which included the Anglican [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet|Thomas Fowell Buxton]], the Quaker [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]], and the Congregationalist [[Josiah Conder (editor and author)|Josiah Conder]], they organised the first [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London in 1840. [[Thomas Clarkson]] was the key speaker, and the Convention attracted people from nations around the world where slavery was practiced. In 1944, a Journalist [[James Ewing Ritchie]] issued a paper to the society on sugar trade and slavery<ref>Ritchie, James Ewing. 1944. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/52820/52820-h/52820-h.htm Thoughts on Slavery and Cheap Sugar, a Letter to The Members and Friends of The British And Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.]''</ref>.\n\nThe convention had been advertised as a \"whole world\" convention, but the delegates representing anti-slavery societies in the United States included several women, among them [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who later were instrumental in the movement for women's rights. Convention leaders refused to seat the women delegates from America, and prominent male abolitionists such as Thomas Knight were outraged. He went on to form his own society. \n\nIn the 1850s, under Louis Chamerovzow, the society helped [[John Brown (fugitive slave)|John Brown]] write and publish his autobiography a decade before the [[American Civil War]] ended slavery in the United States.\n\nThe second secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, appointed under the honorary secretaries [[Joseph Cooper (abolitionist|Joseph Cooper]] and [[Edmund Sturge]], was the Rev. Aaron Buzacott (1829\u201381), the son of a South Seas missionary also named [[Aaron Buzacott]]. With American slavery abolished in 1865, Buzacott worked closely with Joseph Cooper in researching and publishing work designed to help abolish slavery in elsewhere, particularly in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa.\n\n==Twentieth century and now==\nIn 1909, the society merged with the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]] to form the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society, whose prominent member was [[Kathleen Simon, Viscountess Simon]]. In 1990 the name was changed to [[Anti-Slavery International]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[American Anti-Slavery Group]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.antislavery.org Anti-Slavery International]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930194208/http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sp&sText=Anti-Slavery+Society&rNo=0 Anti-Slavery Society Convention 1840]\n*[http://www.anti-slaverysociety.org Anti-Slavery Society]\n\n[[Category:Abolitionism in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Abolitionist organizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1839]]\n[[Category:1823 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1839 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Slavery_Society"}

Hubert, who was following Boschung closely and had no view of what had happened to Alesi, moved right to avoid Boschung's slowing car, clipping Boschung's right rear wheel with his front wing.

As payment, his house\u2014marked by a [[panthera|panther]] skin over the door\u2014was spared during the sack of the city.{{sfn|''EB''|1878}}\n\nHis subsequent fate varied across the authors. He was said to have rebuilt a city on the site of [[Troy]]; to have settled at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]];{{sfn|''EB''|1878}} or to have founded [[Patavium]] (modern [[Padua]]),<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book I, l. 242.</ref><ref>[[Livy]]. ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|History of Rome]]'', Vol.&nbsp;I, Ch.&nbsp;I.</ref> [[Kor\u010dula]],{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} or other cities in eastern Italy.{{sfn|''EB''|1878}}\n\n==In literature==\n\n* Antenor appears briefly in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. In Book 3 he is present when Helen identifies for Priam each of the Greek warriors from the wall of Troy; when she describes Odysseus, Antenor criticizes her, saying how he entertained Odysseus and Menelaus and got to know both. In Book 7, as mentioned above, he advises the Trojans to give Helen back, but [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] refuses to yield.\n* Antenor is mentioned in [[Vergil]]'s [[Aeneid]] in book 1, line 243, when Venus tells Jupiter that Antenor had escaped from the fall of [[Troy]] and founded Patavium, modern Padua.\n* In [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', Antenor appears as a minor, non-speaking, character who has been taken prisoner by the Greeks but is returned by them in exchange for [[Criseyde]].\n* The circle ''Antenora'' is named after him in the poem ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. It is located in [[Hell]]'s Circle of Treachery which is reserved for traitors of cities, countries, and political parties.\n\n==Eponym==\nThe [[minor planet]] [[2207 Antenor]], discovered in 1977 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]], is named after him.{{sfn|Schmadel|2003|p=293}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Antenor (1.) |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=102 }}\n* {{citation |last=Cheetham |first=Erica |year=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/furtherprophecie00chee/page/76 76] |title=The Prophecies of Nostradamus |publisher=Perigee Books (a division of Putnam Pub.

As payment, his house\u2014marked by a [[panthera|panther]] skin over the door\u2014was spared during the sack of the city.{{sfn|''EB''|1878}}\n\nHis subsequent fate varied across the authors. He was said to have rebuilt a city on the site of [[Troy]]; to have settled at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]];{{sfn|''EB''|1878}} or to have founded [[Patavium]] (modern [[Padua]]),<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book I, l. 242.</ref><ref>[[Livy]].

In Book 3 he is present when Helen identifies for Priam each of the Greek warriors from the wall of Troy; when she describes Odysseus, Antenor criticizes her, saying how he entertained Odysseus and Menelaus and got to know both. In Book 7, as mentioned above, he advises the Trojans to give Helen back, but [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] refuses to yield.\n* Antenor is mentioned in [[Vergil]]'s [[Aeneid]] in book 1, line 243, when Venus tells Jupiter that Antenor had escaped from the fall of [[Troy]] and founded Patavium, modern Padua.\n* In [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', Antenor appears as a minor, non-speaking, character who has been taken prisoner by the Greeks but is returned by them in exchange for [[Criseyde]].\n* The circle ''Antenora'' is named after him in the poem ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. It is located in [[Hell]]'s Circle of Treachery which is reserved for traitors of cities, countries, and political parties.\n\n==Eponym==\nThe [[minor planet]] [[2207 Antenor]], discovered in 1977 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]], is named after him.{{sfn|Schmadel|2003|p=293}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Antenor (1.) |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=102 }}\n* {{citation |last=Cheetham |first=Erica |year=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/furtherprophecie00chee/page/76 76] |title=The Prophecies of Nostradamus |publisher=Perigee Books (a division of Putnam Pub.

When his father said to him, \"\u02bfAntarah, fight with the warriors\", he replied that \"the slave doesn't know how to invade or how to defend, but is only good for milking goats and serving his masters\". His father answered him: \"Defend your tribe, O \u02bfAntar, and you are free\". After defeating the invaders, he sought to gain permission to [[cousin marriage|marry his cousin]].

It formerly acted as the guardians of the [[Church of the Nativity]].\n\nThe Russian composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] wrote his Symphony No. 2 based on the legend of \u02bfAntar.

Ibn Doreid has him slain by Wasr-ben-Jaber{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} or in battle against the Tai,{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}, while according to Abu Obeida he died a natural death in old age.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}\n\n\u02bfAntarah's poetry is well preserved and often talks of [[chivalry|chivalrous]] values, courage and heroism in battle as well as his love for \u02bfAbla. It was immortalized when one of his poems was included in the [[Mu'allaqat]], the collection of poems legendarily said to have been suspended in the [[Kaaba]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}  His poetry's historical and cultural importance stems from its detailed descriptions of battles, armour, weapons, horses, desert and other themes from his time.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Antarah bin shadad old manuscript.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A painting on glass of Antara ibn Shaddad.]]\n\nThe story of \u02bfAntar and \u02bfAbla was embroidered into a poetic saga traditionally credited to [[al-Asma\u02bfi]], a poet in the court of [[H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} It is still recited by traditional story-tellers in Arab coffee houses. Its importance has been compared with [[English literature]]'s [[Arthurian romance]]s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} His house and his stable were particularly legendary.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} One of the seven clans of [[Bethlehem]] is called the ''Anatreh'', named after  \u02bfAntarah. It formerly acted as the guardians of the [[Church of the Nativity]].\n\nThe Russian composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] wrote his Symphony No. 2 based on the legend of \u02bfAntar. In 1898 the French painter [[\u00c9tienne Dinet]] published<ref name=\"Pouillon\">Pouillon, Francois (1997), ''Les deux vies d'\u00c9tienne Dinet, peintre en Islam: L'Algerie et l'heritage colonial'', Paris: Editions Balland.</ref> his translation of a 13th-century epic Arab poem ''Antar'', which brought Antar bin Shaddad to European notice.<ref name=\"Pouillon\"/>  It has been followed by a number of [[derivative work]]s such as Diana Richmond's ''Antar and Abla''<ref>Richmond, Diana (1978), ''Antar and Abla: a Bedouin romance'', London: Quartet Books, {{ISBN|0-7043-2162-9}}.</ref> which furthered [[Western world|western]] exposure to the Antar bin Shaddad legends. \"Antar\" is the title of the first Palestinian opera, composed by the Palestinian musician Mustapha al-Kurd in 1988.\n\nLebanese painter [[Rafic Charaf]] developed from the 1960s a series of paintings depicting the epics of Antar and Abla. These works that show interest on popular the region are considered as a keystone in the artist's oeuvre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mokbelartcollection.com/rcartist.htm |title= Rafic Charaf |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher=The Mokbel Art Collection |accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nAntara's poems are published in [[Wilhelm Ahlwardt]]'s ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001338280 The Divans of the six ancient Arabic poets]'' (London, 1870); they have also been published separately at Beir\u00fbt (1888).
