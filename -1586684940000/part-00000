It was founded in 1812, by many of the leading [[naturalist]]s of the young American republic with an expressed mission of \"the encouragement and cultivation of the sciences\". For over two centuries of continuous operations, the Academy has sponsored expeditions, conducted original environmental and [[systematics]] research, and amassed [[natural history]] collections containing more than 17 million specimens. The Academy also has a long tradition of public exhibits and educational programs for both schools and the general public.\n\n==History==\nDuring the first decades of the United States, [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] was the cultural capital and one of the country's commercial centers. Two of the city's institutions, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia|Library Company]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]], were centers of enlightened thought and scientific inquiry.\n\nThe increasing sophistication of the earth and life sciences, combined with a growing awareness of the great variety of life and landscape in the American wilderness waiting to be discovered, led a small group of naturalists to establish the Academy of Natural Sciences in the winter of 1812. The academy was meant to foster a gathering of fellow naturalists, and nurture the growth and credibility of American science. They frequently looked to their European counterparts for inspiration and expertise and longed to be regarded as equals.\n\nOn 25 April 1817 they were incorporated into the society under the title of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by the legislature of Pennsylvania. By 1 January 1818, eight members were published.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGY7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA385&q=Academy+of+Natural+Sciences+1817|title=The Annals of Philosophy|date=4 November 2017|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy.|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nWithin a decade of its founding, the Academy became the undisputed center of natural sciences in the United States. Academy members were frequently enlisted to participate in national surveys of the western territories and other major expeditions. Several of its earliest members, including [[William Bartram]], John Godman, [[Richard Harlan]], [[Angelo Heilprin]], [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]], [[William Maclure]], [[Titian Peale]], [[Charles Pickering (naturalist)|Charles Pickering]], [[Thomas Say]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] were among the pioneers or recognized authorities in their respective areas of study. [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[John Edwards Holbrook]] of South Carolina, [[Thomas Nuttall]] and  [[Richard Owen]] of the United Kingdom, [[Georges Cuvier]] of France, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] of Prussia were among the corresponding members (members who lived far from Philadelphia) of the Academy's first decades.\n\nLater during the 19th century, other notable naturalists and scientists,<ref>Distinctions between who is a naturalist and who is a scientist varies and can be elusive. One can make the distinction that naturalists are amateurs interested in the natural sciences, whereas scientists are professionals. This distinction, however, is confounded by history and circumstance. Most of the participants in American science during the 19th century were not professionals, although some of their contributions are of the highest order.</ref> including [[John James Audubon]], Charles S. Boyer, [[John Cassin]], [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Ezra Townsend Cresson]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V. Hayden]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[John Lawrence LeConte]], [[Joseph Leidy]],<ref>Joseph Leidy, the man who first studied ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', is considered the \"father\" of American paleontology and American [[Parasitology]] and was a leading teacher and authority on microscopy and comparative anatomy. He is widely regarded to have been the leading expert on the natural sciences during the 19th century. More about Leidy can be found on the Academy's [http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy online exhibit on Joseph Leidy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ |date=2008-04-14 }}</ref> [[Samuel George Morton]], [[George Ord]], and James Rehn were also members. Corresponding members included such luminaries as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Asa Gray]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].\n\nFor much of its history, new members had to be nominated by two current members and then elected by the remaining members. These requirements were dropped in 1924. Notable 20th-century scientists include James B\u00f6hlke, [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Henry Weed Fowler]], [[Ruth Patrick]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]], and [[Witmer Stone]].\n\nIn 2011, the Academy became affiliated with nearby [[Drexel University]] and changed its name to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.<ref>{{cite web|year=2011 |title=The Academy of Natural Sciences and Drexel University Announce a Historic Affiliation |url=http://www.ansp.org/about/academy-drexel-affiliation.php |publisher=Academy of Natural Science |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=2011-05-19 |title=Academy of Natural Sciences to become Drexel subsidiary |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2011/05/19/academy-of-natural-sciences-to-become.html |first=Peter Van |last=Allen |work=Philadelphia Business Journal |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Collections and research==\n{{advert section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:JVBA Mosasaur 6-09-2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 43 ft.

The size and scope of its collections have grown substantially since the early years. Currently, there are over 18 million biological specimens, and hundreds of thousands of volumes, journals, [[Biological illustration|illustrations]], photographs, and archival items in its library. These collections grew through a combination of means, including the donation or purchase of existing collections or individual items, the collection activities of Academy-sponsored expeditions, or those of individual scientists, whether or not they work at the Academy. Sometimes the Academy is also enlisted to house and care for collections originally gathered by other institutions. For example, a number of the natural history collections at the American Philosophical Society were relocated to the Academy by the end of the 19th century.\n\nThese collections provide a library of [[biodiversity]]. Traditionally, researchers at natural science (or natural history) institutions such as the Academy engaged in [[Alpha taxonomy|biological taxonomy]], the science of discovering, describing, naming, and classifying species. In recent decades, research has shifted in emphasis to the science of [[systematics]], the study of the evolutionary relationships among these species.\n\nEither way, the collections are invaluable. They provide the [[Biological type|type specimens]], the reference material that helps establish a species' identity. They also provide raw materials with which scientists can investigate the nature of these species, their relationships with other species, their evolutionary history, or their conservation status. New questions and new technology illustrate the importance of these collections. [[Titian Peale]] (1799\u20131885) may not have been interested in the conservation biology of the butterflies he collected while [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]] (1862\u20131957) probably did not consider comparing the DNA of his snails. Yet, modern scientists have such options because these specimens are part of the collections.\n\n===Biological systematics===\nThe most common science currently conducted in natural history museums is [[Systematics|biological systematics]]. It is also the science with which current natural history collections are most intimately associated.  The Academy's collections and systematics research are presented below.\n\n[[File:Hosta lancifolia leaves.JPG|928 KB, MIME type: image/jpegpx|thumb|Hosta 'lancifolia']]\n\n====Botany====\n[[Botany]]  is study of plants. \"Plants,\" to most people, means a wide range of living organisms from the smallest bacteria to the largest living things - the giant sequoia trees. By this definition plants include: algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants.\nCollections at the Academy, which are housed in the Philadelphia [[Herbarium]] (PH), include some of the oldest and most important botanical collections in the Americas. Notable early collectors include [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque|Constatine Rafinesque]], [[Thomas Meehan (botanist)|Thomas Meehan]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], and [[Frederick Traugott Pursh|Fredrick Pursh]]. The current curator, Tatyana Livshultz, studies the systematics of and the [[Plant evolutionary developmental biology|development of flowers]] in  the [[Apocynaceae]] (milkweed or dogbane family). The herbarium contains approximately 1.5 million specimens of [[vascular plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[lichen]]s, [[algae]], and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. It also contains some special collections, including the plants collected by [[Johann Reinhold Forster|Johann]] and [[Georg Forster]] during the voyages of [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]], and by [[Meriwether Lewis]] during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark expedition (Corps of Discovery)]].\n\n====Diatoms====\nThe Academy's [[Diatoms|Diatom]] [[Herbarium]], the largest in the Americas and the second largest in the world, contains approximately 220,000 slides of these microscopic algae. The herbarium contains many specimens contributed by notable collectors, a diversity of fossil diatoms, and diatoms collected as part of numerous freshwater environmental surveys in the United States. The Diatom Herbarium also provides collections and taxonomic services for the [[#Phycology|Phycology Section]] of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Former curators of note include Charles S. Boyer, [[Ruth Patrick]], and Charles Reimer.\n\n====Entomology====\n[[Entomology]] has been important to the Academy since its founding. Two of its earliest members include [[Thomas Say]], regarded as the father of American entomology, and [[Titian Peale]], a leading natural history illustrator and the chief naturalist on the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842|United States Exploring Expedition]] (1834\u20131842). The entomology collection currently contains more than 3.5 million specimens and includes the remarkable Titian Peale Moth and Butterfly Collection, the oldest entomology collection in the United States. Curator Emeritus, [[Dan Otte|Daniel Otte]], an expert on [[Orthoptera]] (crickets, grasshoppers, and their relatives) is a pioneer of presenting biological data on the internet through the creation of the [http://osf2.orthoptera.org/HomePage.aspx Orthoptera Species File]. Curator and Entomology Department Chair, Jon Gelhaus is a world expert on [[Crane fly|crane flies]] and manages the [[#Mongolian_Aquatic_Insect_Survey|Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey]].\n\n====Ichthyology====\n[[Ichthyology]] has also been a part of Academy collections and research since its beginnings, but the size of the collection was relatively modest until acquisition of [[Edward Drinker Cope]]'s personal collections in 1898. A few years later, [[Henry Weed Fowler]] began his remarkable tenure at the Academy, during which he systematized the collections and described 1,408 species. [[James Edwin B\u00f6hlke]], William Saul, and William Smith-Vaniz are among the notable scientist who followed Fowler. The current curator, John Lundberg, an expert in [[catfish]]es, pioneered deep channel collecting in large tropical rivers and is the lead author of a seminal scientific paper on the biological and [[Paleogeography|geographic history]] of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon River Basin]]. The Ichthyology collection, which currently houses nearly 1.2 million specimens and nearly 3,000 types, is one of the most important such collections in the United States. The department also hosts the [http://silurus.ansp.org/ All Catfish Species Inventory] (a comprehensive online resource on catfish) and [http://catfishbone.ansp.org/ Catfish Bones] (an online digital atlas of catfish morphology), and is a participant in [http://www.neodat.org/ Neodat II] (an online resource of [[Neotropics|Neotropic]] ichthyology collections).\n\n====Malacology====\nTwo of the early members of the Academy, [[Thomas Say]] and [[Isaac Lea]], were [[Malacology|malacologists]] (see also [[Conchology|conchologists]]). [[R. Tucker Abbott]], [[Samuel Stehman Haldeman]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry A. Pilsbry]], and [[George W. Tryon, Jr.]] were other noted malacologists who worked at the Academy. The Academy's malacology collection is the oldest such collection in the United States and is the 3rd largest in the world. It currently contains over 10 million specimens, including types erected by more than 400 authors. Curator [[Gary Rosenberg]], an expert on Jamaican land snails, is a leader in moving museum collections and research data online. Research websites include the [http://clade.ansp.org/malacology/georef/ Malacology Georeferencing Project] an online database of [http://www.malacolog.org/ Western Atlantic Marine Mollusca (Malacolog)], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080327102600/http://data.acnatsci.org/obis/ OBIS Indo-Pacific Mollusc] database.  Research associate and former curator Daniel L. Graf, an expert on [[Unionidae]] (freshwater mussels), maintains the [http://clade.acnatsci.org/mussel/ MUSSEL Project] web site.\n\n====Ornithology====\nJust about any ornithologist active in the United States during the first half of the 19th century, including [[John James Audubon]], [[William Bartram]], [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]], [[John Cassin]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], [[George Ord]], [[John Kirk Townsend]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] (the \"father\" of American [[ornithology]]), either operated out of or worked closely with The Academy of Natural Sciences. Later notable Academy ornithologists include [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]], [[Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee]], Pete Myers, Fred Sheldon, and [[Witmer Stone]]. With nearly 200,000 specimens representing over 9,000 species, the Ornithology collection is one of the largest and most taxonomically complete bird collections in the world. The [[Delaware Valley Ornithological Club]] (DVOC) has held regular meetings at the Academy since 1890.\n\n====Vertebrate paleontology====\n[[Vertebrate Paleontology|Vertebrate paleontology]] in the United States originated in Philadelphia through the efforts of naturalists and scientists associated with the [[American Philosophical Society]] (APS) during the first decade of the 19th century and at The Academy of Natural Sciences thereafter. By the end of the 19th century, the holdings from the APS, including the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905164059/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/ Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection], had been transferred to the Academy for safekeeping. Currently, the collection contains more than 22,000 specimens, including many types. [[Richard Harlan]] was an early member who introduced many American naturalists to the groundbreaking works of [[Georges Cuvier]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ Joseph Leidy], who described ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' and alerted the scientific world to the paleontological treasures of the American West, is considered the \"father\" of American vertebrate paleontology. [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who also worked extensively on other vertebrates, is best known for his rivalry with [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] during the infamous [[Bone Wars]]. Curator Edward B. Daeschler is currently studying the evolution of [[Devonian]] [[tetrapod]]s. He is a co-discoverer of the transitional \"fishapod\" ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]'' from the Canadian Arctic and the discoverer of two tetrapods, ''[[Hynerpeton]]'' and ''Densignathus'' from the [[Catskill Formation]] in Pennsylvania.\n\n====Other collections====\nThe Academy houses several collections of smaller size yet historical and scientific importance. The general [[invertebrate]] collection contains about 22,600 specimens, while the [[invertebrate paleontology]] collection contains about 105,000 lots. Both contain numerous type specimens. Generally, 21,500 specimens are gaunt, 13,500 are affiliated skins, and 1,700 are wet-preserved specimens.<ref name=\"Academy of Natural Sciences\">{{cite web|title=Mammalogy|url=http://www.ansp.org/research/systematics-evolution/collections/mammalogy/|publisher=Department of Vertebrate Zoology|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref>  The Frank J. Myers Rotifer Collection is the most comprehensive collection of [[rotifer]]s on microslides. The [[herpetology]] collection contains about 40,000 specimens, including more than 500 type specimens. The [[mammalogy]] collection contains about 36,000 specimens and 180 [[holotype]]s. Among the naturalists and scientists associated with these collections are Timothy Conrad, [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[John Edwards Holbrook]], [[Henry Charles Lea]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[Joseph Leidy]], [[Samuel George Morton]], and [[Thomas Say]].\n\n===Patrick Center for Environmental Research===\nFormerly the [[Limnology]] Department, the Patrick Center for Environmental Research concerns itself with [[applied ecology]]. Founded in 1947 by [[Ruth Patrick]], formerly of the [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], it was one of the earliest U.S. environmental consulting concerns. Its attachment to the Academy led it to become the first to employ [[interdisciplinary]] teams of scientists to study [[freshwater]] systems and the first to regard [[biodiversity]] as a central criterion of [[water quality]].\n\nIts 1948 biological survey of the Conestoga River Basin in Pennsylvania, a milestone in [[Environmental science|environmental research]], led to similar surveys and studies throughout much of the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Characteristically, these earlier projects were joint projects of the Limnology Department and private industry. Since the rise of the [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmental movement]] in the 1960s and 1970s and the resulting increases in [[United States environmental law|governmental regulation]] of [[water pollution]], the environmental assessments pioneered at the Academy are increasingly conducted by private [[Environmental consulting|environmental consulting firms]].\n\n{{as of|2013}}, much of the research at the Patrick Center is conducted with regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, in fields such as diatom autecology,<ref>Autecology is the study the interaction of an individual organism or individual species with its physical, chemical and biological environment.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Particulars may include such measures as temperature preferences, pollution tolerance, light requirements, and ability to recover after disturbance.</ref> [[environmental chemistry]] and [[Aquatic toxicology|toxicology]], [[Restoration ecology|habitat restoration]], long-term environmental trends, species conservation, and [[watershed management]]. Some of the work employs most of the center's expertise and capabilities, such as recent studies on the [[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|ecological effects of small dams]] or the ecological benefits of [[Riparian zone|riparian reforestation]].\n\nOther studies may involve only one or a couple of the research programs. For example, a current project sampling [[Core sample|sediment cores]] in [[tidal marsh]]es throughout the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] [[Estuary]].<ref>The Sediment Core work in the Delaware Estuary is being conducted in collaboration with the [[University of Delaware]].</ref> This undertaking, possibly the most comprehensive core sampling in any estuary, relies extensively on the center's expertise in [[biogeochemistry]] and [[phycology]]. Once the sampling is completed, scientist will be able to investigate historical trends in marsh development, [[Carbon cycle|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycling]], [[water pollution]], salinity variations, and [[Global warming|climatic change]] by analyzing the core's sediments, chemistry, and diatom assemblages.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n====Biogeochemistry====\nThe [[Biogeochemistry]] Section of the Patrick Center is concerned with the influence of aquatic organisms on the sources, fate and transport of [[Environmental chemistry|chemicals in aquatic systems]]. Studies frequently deal with the carbon and nutrient cycling as well as those of [[Trace metals|trace elements]] (e.g., lead, copper, mercury, and zinc) and organic contaminants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs). The section regularly provides water, sediment and tissue analyses for government, intergovernmental agencies, and private companies from around the country. In addition to the sediment core project mentioned above, it has recently studied the effects of small dams on sediment contaminants, photochemical transformation of marsh-derived [[dissolved organic matter]], and sedimentation and [[eutrophication]] in [[salt marsh]]es.\n\n====Ecological Modeling====\nThe [[Ecosystem model|Ecological Modeling]] Section employs sophisticated and rigorous mathematical modeling techniques to address a variety of questions in basic and applied research. Examples include [[Watershed management|watershed-scale]] modeling and [[risk assessment]]; nonlinear [[Population modeling|population models]] structured by age, body size, or space; particle transport in [[Fluid dynamics|turbulent aquatic systems]]; and the ecology and control of [[Introduced species|exotic invasive]] plants in urban parks.\n\n====Fisheries====\nThe Fisheries Section of the Patrick Center conducts research into the ecology, [[Wildlife management|conservation]], and [[Fisheries management|management]] of [[Lotic system ecology|lotic]] and [[estuarine fish]]es. Studies may range from the analysis of fish tissues for contaminants, monitoring fish populations for environmental assessments, to investigating the life histories of individual species. Recent and ongoing work include, glass eel (the larvae of freshwater or [[American eel]]s) recruitment in the Delaware River basin, the ecology and genetics of bridal shiner (a fish that's endangered in Pennsylvania), and the impacts of flow management ([[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|dam releases]]) in the Upper [[Delaware River]] to native and [[Introduced species|introduced fish]] populations.\n\n====Macroinvertebrates====\nBenthic macroinvertebrates (primarily [[aquatic insect]]s, crustaceans, and mollusks) are useful for biological monitoring programs. Their varied life spans, ranging from weeks to years, are long enough to reveal intermittent and continuous pollutants, yet short enough respond to worsening or improving water quality. The Macroinvertebrate Section at the Patrick Center has extensive experience in bioassessment, biomonitoring, and inventorying of freshwater habitats throughout the United States.\n\n====Phycology====\nBecause of their great diversity and specific ecological requirements, [[algae]], particularly [[diatom]]s, make excellent [[Indicator species|indicators of water quality]]. Moreover, diatoms are readily preserved in sediments, which make them ideal organisms for studying [[paleolimnology]] (the long-term trends of streams and lakes). Because of their expertise and their close working relationship with the Academy's [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], the [[Phycology]] Section of the Patrick Center is able to provide algal analyses for governmental and other agencies interested in both assessing [[water quality]] and long-term environmental trends. One such undertaking is the analyses of diatom assemblages in lake sediments ([[Core sample|sediment cores]]) throughout the eastern United States. This work, part of a large project managed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], will try to establish reference (pre-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]) conditions  for lakes throughout the country.\n\nIn addition to these research efforts, the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center has developed a set of [http://diatom.ansp.org online resources] for using algae in environmental research. These include an algal image database, autecology datasets for freshwater algae, algae research with the [[USGS]] National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program, and a diatom paleolimnology database.\n\n===Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology===\nFor most of its history, biological [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] and [[systematics]] were conducted using [[Comparative anatomy|comparative morphology]]. In recent decades, however, advances in [[molecular biology]] and computational technologies have opened [[Molecular systematics|new possibilities]] for studying the diversity and history of life through the use of [[cladistics]] and [[computational phylogenetics]]. These technologies also offer new opportunities for [[molecular ecology]] and [[conservation genetics]].\n\nAcademy scientists have been early adapters of [[molecular biology]] techniques. [[Allozymes]], [[DNA-DNA hybridization]], [[immunoelectrophoresis]], restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA and [[serology]] were used extensively since the late 1960s. Recent molecular work mainly employs [[DNA sequencing]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s, and AFLP ([[amplified fragment length polymorphism]]). In 2004, the Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology (LMSE) was formed as a shared, multi-user facility to improve access to and provide training for the use of molecular data in systematic and ecological research. In addition to supporting staff, the lab offers research opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellowships.\n\n===Asia Center===\nThe Asia Center is a new initiative to develop programs and partnerships for research and capacity building throughout Asia. Clyde Goulden is the director of the Asia Center. It is modeled on a series of successful programs conducted in Mongolia since 1995 under the auspices of the Academy's Institute for Mongolian Biodiversity and Ecological Studies (IMBES). The main activities of IMBES occur in the vicinity of Lake Hovsgol in northern Mongolia, but a separate program, the Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey, extends to other parts of the country. More recently, the Asia Center has undertaken joint-projects with [[Nanjing University]], Nanjing Paleontological Museum and Zhejiang Ocean University in China and the Institute of the Biological Problems of the North in the Russian Far East.\n\n====Hovsgol====\nThe Academy's work in [[Mongolia]] started with the realization of the unique research opportunities available at [[Lake Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l|Lake Hovsgol]] (Hovsgol Nuur). This large lake and its watershed were remarkably pristine and relatively unknown, especially in comparison to its sister lake in Russia, [[Lake Baikal]]. In 1995, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the Academy, as well as from other American institutions, Mongolia, Russia, and Japan started a multi-year study of the lake's [[biodiversity]], [[limnology]], and watershed.<ref>The findings of this research were published in \n{{cite book\n  | last = Goulden\n  | first = C.E.\n  |editor1=T. Sitnikova |editor2=J. Gelhaus |editor3=B. Boldgiv\n  | title = The Geology, Biodiversity and Ecology of Lake H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l (Mongolia)\n  | publisher = Backhuys Publ.\n  | year = 2006\n  | location = Leiden\n  | isbn = 90-5782-162-1}}\n</ref>\n\nAlthough this research was scientifically rewarding, it was apparent that issues concerning environmental protection and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic development]] needed addressing.<ref>[[Mongolia]], recently freed from Soviet domination, was experiencing severe economic disruption and increasing pressures through [[globalization]] to exploit its [[Natural resource management|natural resources]]. Mongolians, committed to preserving their natural heritage, needed assistance in developing their scientific and conservation infrastructure.</ref> Consequently, work at Hovsgol shifted to [[Ecosystem ecology|ecosystem studies]] and [[capacity building]].<ref>[[Capacity building]] (the development of local expertise and infrastructure) is implemented in part through the inclusion of scientists and students from the [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National University of Mongolia]] in research projects, conferences, and workshops. The Academy has also sponsored the training of Mongolian students in Philadelphia.</ref> One early undertaking was the enhancement of the operational and physical infrastructure at Hovsgol National Park.<ref>Hovsgol National Park, which includes the lake and its entire watershed, was created in 1992. Improvements took the form of improving park management, improving physical facilities, staff training and developing park-community relationships.</ref> Long-term ecological monitoring of several [[Drainage basin|tributary watersheds]] began in 1997 and soon the site would be adopted into the \n[http://www.lternet.edu/ International Long Term Ecological Research Network].<ref>Long-term ecological work at Hovsgol has been supported by the [[Global Environmental Facility]]from 2002-2006.</ref>\n\nRecent work at Hovsgol is focusing on the consequences of and sustainable responses to [[global warming|climate change]]. The region lies in a transitional zone between the [[Semiarid|semi-arid]] Eurasian [[Steppe]] (grasslands) to the south and the Eurasian [[Taiga]] (boreal forest) to the north. As such, it is an ideal mid-continental site at which to monitor the ecological effects of climate change.<ref>Substantial increases in annual mean temperatures and growing season length in this semiarid landscape have resulted in [[permafrost]] loss, drier soils, and reduced plant cover in the steppe. Shifts in the seasonal pattern in precipitation are disruptive to grassland plant reproduction and the incidence of extreme weather also appears to be increasing. Changes in the forests are less demonstrable, but increased [[Wildfire|fire frequency]] and pest insect outbreaks are suggestive.</ref> In addition, changes in livestock herding practices<ref>Traditional [[pastoralism]], or animal herding, has existed in Mongolia for millennia, but recent trends in livestock production and practices may be unsustainable. The herds are larger and cashmere goats, which can be particularly damaging to vegetation, are accounting for a greater percentage of the total. Moreover, much of the traditional herder expertise was lost during the Soviet era. Consequently, herders risk seriously [[overgrazing]] the steppe, which, because of [[global warming]], is increasingly vulnerable to [[desertification]].</ref> raise concerns about [[overgrazing]] and [[desertification]]. In response, the team at Hovsgol created and distributed a ''Herder Handbook''<ref>An English version of the Herder Handbook can be [http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=41&Itemid=2 downloaded] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215023907/http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=41&Itemid=2 |date=2008-02-15 }} from the Hovsgol Ecology website.</ref> and continues to conduct research and work with nomadic herders to develop sustainable practices.<ref>Current work at Hovsgol is funded by the [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12819 National Science Foundation PIRE program], and is a partnership of the Academy's Asia Center, [http://mongolia.bio.upenn.edu/index.html The University of Pennsylvania], the [http://www.must.edu.mn/ Mongolian Academy of Sciences], the [http://must.edu.mn/ Mongolian University of Science and Technology], and the [http://web.num.edu.mn/eng/ National University of Mongolia]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Information on earlier applied work at Hovsgol can be found at [http://hovsgolecology.org hovsgolecology.org].</ref>\n\n====Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey====\nThe Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clade.ansp.org/entomology/mongolia/|title=Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey: Splash|website=clade.ansp.org}}</ref> is a multi-year [[biodiversity]] survey, [[Water quality|environmental monitoring]] and [[capacity building]] project managed by Jon Gelhaus of the Academy's [[#Entomology|Entomology Department]].  A total of 217 sites from the [[Selenge River]] Basin, the most populous and most extensive drainage in Mongolia, were surveyed from 2003 to 2006. Most of these sites are in rivers or streams, but some are in freshwater and saltwater lakes, hot and cold springs, and marsh wetlands. Additional sites from the remote drainage systems in western Mongolia will be sampled in 2008.\n\nThe survey has yielded numerous new species and hundreds of geographic records for known [[aquatic insect]]s, provided an extensive dataset for ongoing environmental monitoring, and has helped develop research and technical infrastructures in Mongolia. This capacity building includes, in collaboration with the Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, the building of the first research laboratory in Mongolia dedicated to the study of aquatic invertebrates. It also includes training of Mongolian scientists and students.\n\n===Center for Environmental Policy===\nThe Center for Environmental Policy informs and engages various constituents, promotes solutions, and builds public and professional awareness on important environmental topics. Much of its activities focus on public programs and working groups.\n\nThe center hosts or participates in a number of public programs that are free and open to the public. Urban Sustainability Forums feature panels of local and national experts discussing environmental and sustainability topics as they relate to the Philadelphia region. Town Square, which may feature a panel or an individual, addresses a variety of topics relating to the environment or public science. The center also hosts candidate forums, conferences and workshops.\n\nThe center acts as a logistical hub for a number of Working Groups organized around sustainability issues. Currently active groups one for condominium and building co-op owners, a network of faith-based environmental groups, and a forum of senior executives in the private sector.\n\n===Ewell Sale Stewart Library===\nThe Library and Archives were established at the Academy's founding meeting in 1812 for the purpose of supporting its natural science research. The library provides online access, services, collections, imaging, and shared resources with other libraries.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe library houses nearly 200,000 volumes ranging from works published in the 16th century to current journals and books. Its holdings also include  illustrated works from as early as the 15th century, including [[Conrad Gessner|Konrad Gessner's]] ''Historia animalium'', [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]'s ''Insects of Surinam'', [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Psittacidae or Parrots'', and a double elephant folio of [[John James Audubon]]'s ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421170703/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |archive-date=2008-04-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Scientific publications===\nThe ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' was the first peer-reviewed publication in the United States devoted to the natural sciences. The first volume was published in 1817.  By 1842, it had been superseded by the ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences''. The ''Proceedings'' have been published continuously since 1841. The ''Journal'' was reborn in 1847 as a larger-format publication that could accommodate longer articles and [[monograph]]s. The last volume was issued in 1918.<ref>The volumes of the ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' published from 1817 to 1842 are referred to as the First Series. The Second Series was published from 1847 to 1918.</ref>\n\nThe Academy publishes three other series. The occasional series ''Notulae Naturae'' began in 1939 as a means to quickly publish short items, usually not longer than 16 pages on subject areas such as zoology, botany, ecology, geology and paleontology. The ''Monographs'' series, which began in 1935, is composed principally of larger systematic reviews of selected taxonomic groups. The ''Special Publications'' series, begun in 1922, includes works such as biography, taxonomy, historical reviews, and collections surveys.\n\n===VIREO===\n[http://vireo.ansp.org/ VIREO] (VIsual REsource for [[Ornithology]]) is the most comprehensive collection of bird [[Stock photography|images]] in the world. Started in 1979, the collection contains over 140,000 photographs representing more than 7,000 species. The collection contains work by some of the world's most talented photographers. VIREO licenses bird images for a wide variety of commercial and non-profit uses.\n\n==Exhibits and public programs==\n\n===Public exhibits===\n[[File:Mummy PANS.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A mummy on display at the Academy]]\nThe Academy first opened its collections to the public in 1828. The popularity of its exhibits soared in 1868 with the debut of the world's first mounted dinosaur skeleton, ''[[Hadrosaurus]]''.  In fact, the size of the crowds flocking to this display prompted the Academy to relocate to its present-and roomier-location in 1876.\n\n====Collections and the public====\nAs with most museums in the 19th century, there was little separation of the Academy's collections, which were vital to scientific work, and the public spaces. Not only did this subject the collections to extra wear and tear, but visitors were typically confronted with a bewildering assemblage of specimens with little in the way of supplemental information. Over time, however, museums such as the Academy started to showcase their more popular specimens while sequestering the bulk of the collections. In addition, they spent more effort interpreting their public displays. Museums started to play a more active role in educating the public.<ref>The [[Wagner Free Institute of Science]] is an early example of an organized public display of natural history collections. Founded in 1855 to offer free lectures on the natural sciences, the Wagner appointed Joseph Leidy in 1885 to organize its growing collections. Leidy's design is still largely intact, and the Wagner is effectively a museum of a museum.</ref>\n\n====Dioramas====\nOne expression of this transformation was the rise of that icon of natural history museums, the [[diorama]]. These three-dimensional displays were the virtual reality of their time, providing generations of museum visitors with their only opportunity to experience distant places and exotic wildlife. By presenting the wilderness to the public, dioramas nurtured an appreciation of our natural heritage, which, in turn, contributed to the growth of the [[Conservation movement|Conservation Movement]] in the United States. The Academy currently has 37 dioramas, most of which were installed in the 1930s and 1940s. They feature a variety of animals from Africa, Asia, and North America. Some of these, such as the [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[lion]], and [[plains zebra]] are familiar and relatively common, but others, such as the [[Desert Bighorn Sheep|desert bighorn]], [[kiang]], [[Kodiak bear]], [[panda]], and [[passenger pigeon]], are threatened, [[Endangered species|endangered]], or [[Extinction|extinct]].\n\n====Dinosaurs====\n[[File:Hadro bones.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A display of casts of the 35 bones of the Hadrosaurus]]\nAnother icon of natural history museums is the [[dinosaur]] skeleton. The first of these, the ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' mount created by noted natural history artist [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]], made its debut at the Academy in 1868. ''Hadrosaurus'' mounts also found their way into other public venues, including [[Princeton University]], the [[Royal Museum|Royal Scottish Museum]], the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], and the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 American Centennial Exposition]]. A special exhibit on the history of ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'' ran from November 22, 2008 to April 19, 2009.\n[[File:T-rex exhibit Philadelphia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A complete ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' fossil cast on display with other dinosaur specimens.]]\nA skeletal mount of a related dinosaur, ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', served as the centerpiece of the Academy's \"Hall of Earth History\" during the middle of the 20th century. In 1986, the Academy opened a new exhibit, \"Discovering Dinosaurs.\" This was the first large-scale exhibit to incorporate the findings of the \"[[dinosaur renaissance]].\" Instead of cold-blooded and lumbering reptiles, dinosaurs were conceived as active-and possibly warm-blooded-animals more akin to birds than reptiles.\n\nIn 1979, another type of dinosaur was the subject of an exhibition at the academy when it featured [[Jim Gary|Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs]] and found that it was an enormous success with the public. This unconventional exhibition for a museum of science that featured contemporary sculpture, which focused upon the subjects of intense scientific inquiry, began a trend among its peer institutions, who then began to invite Gary and several other artists who specialized in scientific topics and subjects to museums that always had shied away from anything identified as \"contemporary art\" as exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Twentieth_Century_Dinosaurs_Return_to_Tallahassee_Museum_128476873.html?storySection=story|title=Twentieth Century Dinosaurs Return to Tallahassee Museum|first=Tallahassee Museum|last=Release|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Other exhibits====\nIn 1979, the academy also opened \"Outside-In\", a hands-on children's nature museum. In 1995, it pioneered the hands-on simulation of a dinosaur dig, with its \"The Big Dig.\" Other permanent exhibits include \"Butterflies!\", a live butterfly zoo, and  \"Science at the Academy\", which showcases current Academy research.\n\nThe museum also has special, changing exhibits. Recent changing exhibits include \"Amazon Voyage: Vicious Fishes and Other Riches\", \"Frogs: a Chorus of Colors\", \"The Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Exhibition\", and \"The Scoop on Poop: The Science of What Animals Leave Behind.\"\n\n===Public programs===\n\n====Festivals====\nFour weekend festivals organized around scientific disciplines, are held during the year. Paleopalooza, held in mid-February, features fossil collections and talks by leading paleontologists. Earth Day Festival, held in mid-April, features scientists from the Academy's Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Bug Fest, held in mid August, features entomologists, insect collections and live insects. The Philadelphia Shell Show, held in mid-October, features an international shell market and competitive shell displays.\n\n====Programs for adults====\nThe Academy began offering lectures to the public as early as the 1820s. Current offerings include natural history author talks, lectures by scientists, workshops and classes. In addition, the Center for Environmental Policy produces public programs on environmental issues.\n\n====Programs for families and children====\nSince its Nature Club in the 1930s, the Academy has offered programming just for children. Several programs appropriate for different age groups are currently offered. Safari Overnight sleepovers (camp-ins) are held on selected weekends during Fall, Winter, and Spring. [[Scouts BSA (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting|Girl Scouts]] can participate in day workshops and sleepovers to fulfill badge and pin requirements. Tiny Tot Explorers is a program for toddlers. A new series of Family Workshops designed for both adults and children was launched in early 2010.\n\n\"Wild Weekends\", held on selected weekends throughout the year, offer a variety of children's programs, including hands-on exploration of museum specimens, crafts and live animal shows with mammals, birds and reptiles. Live animal shows are also presented at regular times on other days and featured prominently in the educational programs.\n\n===Educational programs===\n\n====Field trips and outreach====\n[[Field trip]]s to the Academy are available throughout the year for schools, summer camps and other groups. Optional directed programs include Discovery Lessons for younger age groups (pre-K and higher) and Science Explorers for older children (grades 7 through 9). \"Academy on the Go\" is an educational outreach program that visits schools, camps, and community centers.\n\n====Women in Natural Sciences====\nWINS (Women in Natural Sciences) is an innovative and successful science enrichment program conducted by The Academy of Natural Sciences in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia. Since its founding in 1982, WINS has been providing female public school students with hands-on science classes, [[scientific literacy]] and skill-building activities, and opportunities for personal growth in a uniquely nurturing setting.\n\n====Other programs====\nAcademy Explorers Camp is a day camp program offered during Spring Break and the Summer. The George Washington Carver Science Fair is held in February or March. [[Science fair]] participants are eligible for the George Washington Carver Scholars summer program, which is also held at the Academy. Educator workshops are held throughout the year. The most recent series covered the integration of science and literacy skills. Self-guided workbooks tailored for younger children are available for some of the museum exhibits.\n\n==Awards and research opportunities==\n\n===Hayden Memorial Geological Award===\nThe [[Hayden Memorial Geological Award]] is given to prominent scientists working in geology or paleontology. It was established in 1888 in memory of [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V. Hayden]], a distinguished American geologist and pioneering surveyor of the American West who had extensive ties to the Academy.\n\n===Gold Medal for Distinction in Natural History Art===\nEstablished in 1980, the Gold Medal for Distinction in Natural History Art is awarded to people whose artistic endeavors and life's work have contributed to our understanding and appreciation of living things.\n\nThe recipients {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are:<ref name=\"PANSP\">{{cite journal|date=June 2007|title=The Four Awards Bestowed by The Academy of Natural Sciences and Their Recipients|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|publisher=The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia |volume=156 |issue=1 |pages=403\u2013404 |doi=10.1635/0097-3157(2007)156[403:TFABBT]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>\n* 1980: [[Roger Tory Peterson]]\n* 1981: [[Ansel Adams]]\n* 1982: Sir [[Peter Scott]]\n* 1983: [[Eliot Porter]]\n* 1984: [[Peter Matthiessen]]\n* 1987: [[BBC Natural History Unit]]\n* 1992: [[William T.

It was founded in 1812, by many of the leading [[naturalist]]s of the young American republic with an expressed mission of \"the encouragement and cultivation of the sciences\". For over two centuries of continuous operations, the Academy has sponsored expeditions, conducted original environmental and [[systematics]] research, and amassed [[natural history]] collections containing more than 17 million specimens. The Academy also has a long tradition of public exhibits and educational programs for both schools and the general public.\n\n==History==\nDuring the first decades of the United States, [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] was the cultural capital and one of the country's commercial centers. Two of the city's institutions, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia|Library Company]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]], were centers of enlightened thought and scientific inquiry.\n\nThe increasing sophistication of the earth and life sciences, combined with a growing awareness of the great variety of life and landscape in the American wilderness waiting to be discovered, led a small group of naturalists to establish the Academy of Natural Sciences in the winter of 1812. The academy was meant to foster a gathering of fellow naturalists, and nurture the growth and credibility of American science. They frequently looked to their European counterparts for inspiration and expertise and longed to be regarded as equals.\n\nOn 25 April 1817 they were incorporated into the society under the title of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by the legislature of Pennsylvania. By 1 January 1818, eight members were published.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGY7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA385&q=Academy+of+Natural+Sciences+1817|title=The Annals of Philosophy|date=4 November 2017|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy.|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nWithin a decade of its founding, the Academy became the undisputed center of natural sciences in the United States. Academy members were frequently enlisted to participate in national surveys of the western territories and other major expeditions. Several of its earliest members, including [[William Bartram]], John Godman, [[Richard Harlan]], [[Angelo Heilprin]], [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]], [[William Maclure]], [[Titian Peale]], [[Charles Pickering (naturalist)|Charles Pickering]], [[Thomas Say]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] were among the pioneers or recognized authorities in their respective areas of study. [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[John Edwards Holbrook]] of South Carolina, [[Thomas Nuttall]] and  [[Richard Owen]] of the United Kingdom, [[Georges Cuvier]] of France, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] of Prussia were among the corresponding members (members who lived far from Philadelphia) of the Academy's first decades.\n\nLater during the 19th century, other notable naturalists and scientists,<ref>Distinctions between who is a naturalist and who is a scientist varies and can be elusive. One can make the distinction that naturalists are amateurs interested in the natural sciences, whereas scientists are professionals. This distinction, however, is confounded by history and circumstance. Most of the participants in American science during the 19th century were not professionals, although some of their contributions are of the highest order.</ref> including [[John James Audubon]], Charles S. Boyer, [[John Cassin]], [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Ezra Townsend Cresson]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V. Hayden]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[John Lawrence LeConte]], [[Joseph Leidy]],<ref>Joseph Leidy, the man who first studied ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', is considered the \"father\" of American paleontology and American [[Parasitology]] and was a leading teacher and authority on microscopy and comparative anatomy. He is widely regarded to have been the leading expert on the natural sciences during the 19th century. More about Leidy can be found on the Academy's [http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy online exhibit on Joseph Leidy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ |date=2008-04-14 }}</ref> [[Samuel George Morton]], [[George Ord]], and James Rehn were also members. Corresponding members included such luminaries as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Asa Gray]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].\n\nFor much of its history, new members had to be nominated by two current members and then elected by the remaining members. These requirements were dropped in 1924. Notable 20th-century scientists include James B\u00f6hlke, [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Henry Weed Fowler]], [[Ruth Patrick]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]], and [[Witmer Stone]].\n\nIn 2011, the Academy became affiliated with nearby [[Drexel University]] and changed its name to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.<ref>{{cite web|year=2011 |title=The Academy of Natural Sciences and Drexel University Announce a Historic Affiliation |url=http://www.ansp.org/about/academy-drexel-affiliation.php |publisher=Academy of Natural Science |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=2011-05-19 |title=Academy of Natural Sciences to become Drexel subsidiary |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2011/05/19/academy-of-natural-sciences-to-become.html |first=Peter Van |last=Allen |work=Philadelphia Business Journal |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Collections and research==\n{{advert section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:JVBA Mosasaur 6-09-2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 43 ft.

The size and scope of its collections have grown substantially since the early years. Currently, there are over 18 million biological specimens, and hundreds of thousands of volumes, journals, [[Biological illustration|illustrations]], photographs, and archival items in its library. These collections grew through a combination of means, including the donation or purchase of existing collections or individual items, the collection activities of Academy-sponsored expeditions, or those of individual scientists, whether or not they work at the Academy. Sometimes the Academy is also enlisted to house and care for collections originally gathered by other institutions. For example, a number of the natural history collections at the American Philosophical Society were relocated to the Academy by the end of the 19th century.\n\nThese collections provide a library of [[biodiversity]]. Traditionally, researchers at natural science (or natural history) institutions such as the Academy engaged in [[Alpha taxonomy|biological taxonomy]], the science of discovering, describing, naming, and classifying species. In recent decades, research has shifted in emphasis to the science of [[systematics]], the study of the evolutionary relationships among these species.\n\nEither way, the collections are invaluable. They provide the [[Biological type|type specimens]], the reference material that helps establish a species' identity. They also provide raw materials with which scientists can investigate the nature of these species, their relationships with other species, their evolutionary history, or their conservation status. New questions and new technology illustrate the importance of these collections. [[Titian Peale]] (1799\u20131885) may not have been interested in the conservation biology of the butterflies he collected while [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]] (1862\u20131957) probably did not consider comparing the DNA of his snails. Yet, modern scientists have such options because these specimens are part of the collections.\n\n===Biological systematics===\nThe most common science currently conducted in natural history museums is [[Systematics|biological systematics]]. It is also the science with which current natural history collections are most intimately associated.  The Academy's collections and systematics research are presented below.\n\n[[File:Hosta lancifolia leaves.JPG|928 KB, MIME type: image/jpegpx|thumb|Hosta 'lancifolia']]\n\n====Botany====\n[[Botany]]  is study of plants. \"Plants,\" to most people, means a wide range of living organisms from the smallest bacteria to the largest living things - the giant sequoia trees. By this definition plants include: algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants.\nCollections at the Academy, which are housed in the Philadelphia [[Herbarium]] (PH), include some of the oldest and most important botanical collections in the Americas. Notable early collectors include [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque|Constatine Rafinesque]], [[Thomas Meehan (botanist)|Thomas Meehan]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], and [[Frederick Traugott Pursh|Fredrick Pursh]]. The current curator, Tatyana Livshultz, studies the systematics of and the [[Plant evolutionary developmental biology|development of flowers]] in  the [[Apocynaceae]] (milkweed or dogbane family). The herbarium contains approximately 1.5 million specimens of [[vascular plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[lichen]]s, [[algae]], and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. It also contains some special collections, including the plants collected by [[Johann Reinhold Forster|Johann]] and [[Georg Forster]] during the voyages of [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]], and by [[Meriwether Lewis]] during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark expedition (Corps of Discovery)]].\n\n====Diatoms====\nThe Academy's [[Diatoms|Diatom]] [[Herbarium]], the largest in the Americas and the second largest in the world, contains approximately 220,000 slides of these microscopic algae. The herbarium contains many specimens contributed by notable collectors, a diversity of fossil diatoms, and diatoms collected as part of numerous freshwater environmental surveys in the United States. The Diatom Herbarium also provides collections and taxonomic services for the [[#Phycology|Phycology Section]] of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Former curators of note include Charles S. Boyer, [[Ruth Patrick]], and Charles Reimer.\n\n====Entomology====\n[[Entomology]] has been important to the Academy since its founding. Two of its earliest members include [[Thomas Say]], regarded as the father of American entomology, and [[Titian Peale]], a leading natural history illustrator and the chief naturalist on the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842|United States Exploring Expedition]] (1834\u20131842). The entomology collection currently contains more than 3.5 million specimens and includes the remarkable Titian Peale Moth and Butterfly Collection, the oldest entomology collection in the United States. Curator Emeritus, [[Dan Otte|Daniel Otte]], an expert on [[Orthoptera]] (crickets, grasshoppers, and their relatives) is a pioneer of presenting biological data on the internet through the creation of the [http://osf2.orthoptera.org/HomePage.aspx Orthoptera Species File]. Curator and Entomology Department Chair, Jon Gelhaus is a world expert on [[Crane fly|crane flies]] and manages the [[#Mongolian_Aquatic_Insect_Survey|Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey]].\n\n====Ichthyology====\n[[Ichthyology]] has also been a part of Academy collections and research since its beginnings, but the size of the collection was relatively modest until acquisition of [[Edward Drinker Cope]]'s personal collections in 1898. A few years later, [[Henry Weed Fowler]] began his remarkable tenure at the Academy, during which he systematized the collections and described 1,408 species. [[James Edwin B\u00f6hlke]], William Saul, and William Smith-Vaniz are among the notable scientist who followed Fowler. The current curator, John Lundberg, an expert in [[catfish]]es, pioneered deep channel collecting in large tropical rivers and is the lead author of a seminal scientific paper on the biological and [[Paleogeography|geographic history]] of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon River Basin]]. The Ichthyology collection, which currently houses nearly 1.2 million specimens and nearly 3,000 types, is one of the most important such collections in the United States. The department also hosts the [http://silurus.ansp.org/ All Catfish Species Inventory] (a comprehensive online resource on catfish) and [http://catfishbone.ansp.org/ Catfish Bones] (an online digital atlas of catfish morphology), and is a participant in [http://www.neodat.org/ Neodat II] (an online resource of [[Neotropics|Neotropic]] ichthyology collections).\n\n====Malacology====\nTwo of the early members of the Academy, [[Thomas Say]] and [[Isaac Lea]], were [[Malacology|malacologists]] (see also [[Conchology|conchologists]]). [[R. Tucker Abbott]], [[Samuel Stehman Haldeman]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry A. Pilsbry]], and [[George W. Tryon, Jr.]] were other noted malacologists who worked at the Academy. The Academy's malacology collection is the oldest such collection in the United States and is the 3rd largest in the world. It currently contains over 10 million specimens, including types erected by more than 400 authors. Curator [[Gary Rosenberg]], an expert on Jamaican land snails, is a leader in moving museum collections and research data online. Research websites include the [http://clade.ansp.org/malacology/georef/ Malacology Georeferencing Project] an online database of [http://www.malacolog.org/ Western Atlantic Marine Mollusca (Malacolog)], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080327102600/http://data.acnatsci.org/obis/ OBIS Indo-Pacific Mollusc] database.  Research associate and former curator Daniel L. Graf, an expert on [[Unionidae]] (freshwater mussels), maintains the [http://clade.acnatsci.org/mussel/ MUSSEL Project] web site.\n\n====Ornithology====\nJust about any ornithologist active in the United States during the first half of the 19th century, including [[John James Audubon]], [[William Bartram]], [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]], [[John Cassin]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], [[George Ord]], [[John Kirk Townsend]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] (the \"father\" of American [[ornithology]]), either operated out of or worked closely with The Academy of Natural Sciences. Later notable Academy ornithologists include [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]], [[Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee]], Pete Myers, Fred Sheldon, and [[Witmer Stone]]. With nearly 200,000 specimens representing over 9,000 species, the Ornithology collection is one of the largest and most taxonomically complete bird collections in the world. The [[Delaware Valley Ornithological Club]] (DVOC) has held regular meetings at the Academy since 1890.\n\n====Vertebrate paleontology====\n[[Vertebrate Paleontology|Vertebrate paleontology]] in the United States originated in Philadelphia through the efforts of naturalists and scientists associated with the [[American Philosophical Society]] (APS) during the first decade of the 19th century and at The Academy of Natural Sciences thereafter. By the end of the 19th century, the holdings from the APS, including the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905164059/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/ Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection], had been transferred to the Academy for safekeeping. Currently, the collection contains more than 22,000 specimens, including many types. [[Richard Harlan]] was an early member who introduced many American naturalists to the groundbreaking works of [[Georges Cuvier]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ Joseph Leidy], who described ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' and alerted the scientific world to the paleontological treasures of the American West, is considered the \"father\" of American vertebrate paleontology. [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who also worked extensively on other vertebrates, is best known for his rivalry with [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] during the infamous [[Bone Wars]]. Curator Edward B. Daeschler is currently studying the evolution of [[Devonian]] [[tetrapod]]s. He is a co-discoverer of the transitional \"fishapod\" ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]'' from the Canadian Arctic and the discoverer of two tetrapods, ''[[Hynerpeton]]'' and ''Densignathus'' from the [[Catskill Formation]] in Pennsylvania.\n\n====Other collections====\nThe Academy houses several collections of smaller size yet historical and scientific importance. The general [[invertebrate]] collection contains about 22,600 specimens, while the [[invertebrate paleontology]] collection contains about 105,000 lots. Both contain numerous type specimens. Generally, 21,500 specimens are gaunt, 13,500 are affiliated skins, and 1,700 are wet-preserved specimens.<ref name=\"Academy of Natural Sciences\">{{cite web|title=Mammalogy|url=http://www.ansp.org/research/systematics-evolution/collections/mammalogy/|publisher=Department of Vertebrate Zoology|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref>  The Frank J. Myers Rotifer Collection is the most comprehensive collection of [[rotifer]]s on microslides. The [[herpetology]] collection contains about 40,000 specimens, including more than 500 type specimens. The [[mammalogy]] collection contains about 36,000 specimens and 180 [[holotype]]s. Among the naturalists and scientists associated with these collections are Timothy Conrad, [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[John Edwards Holbrook]], [[Henry Charles Lea]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[Joseph Leidy]], [[Samuel George Morton]], and [[Thomas Say]].\n\n===Patrick Center for Environmental Research===\nFormerly the [[Limnology]] Department, the Patrick Center for Environmental Research concerns itself with [[applied ecology]]. Founded in 1947 by [[Ruth Patrick]], formerly of the [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], it was one of the earliest U.S. environmental consulting concerns. Its attachment to the Academy led it to become the first to employ [[interdisciplinary]] teams of scientists to study [[freshwater]] systems and the first to regard [[biodiversity]] as a central criterion of [[water quality]].\n\nIts 1948 biological survey of the Conestoga River Basin in Pennsylvania, a milestone in [[Environmental science|environmental research]], led to similar surveys and studies throughout much of the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Characteristically, these earlier projects were joint projects of the Limnology Department and private industry. Since the rise of the [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmental movement]] in the 1960s and 1970s and the resulting increases in [[United States environmental law|governmental regulation]] of [[water pollution]], the environmental assessments pioneered at the Academy are increasingly conducted by private [[Environmental consulting|environmental consulting firms]].\n\n{{as of|2013}}, much of the research at the Patrick Center is conducted with regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, in fields such as diatom autecology,<ref>Autecology is the study the interaction of an individual organism or individual species with its physical, chemical and biological environment.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Particulars may include such measures as temperature preferences, pollution tolerance, light requirements, and ability to recover after disturbance.</ref> [[environmental chemistry]] and [[Aquatic toxicology|toxicology]], [[Restoration ecology|habitat restoration]], long-term environmental trends, species conservation, and [[watershed management]]. Some of the work employs most of the center's expertise and capabilities, such as recent studies on the [[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|ecological effects of small dams]] or the ecological benefits of [[Riparian zone|riparian reforestation]].\n\nOther studies may involve only one or a couple of the research programs. For example, a current project sampling [[Core sample|sediment cores]] in [[tidal marsh]]es throughout the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] [[Estuary]].<ref>The Sediment Core work in the Delaware Estuary is being conducted in collaboration with the [[University of Delaware]].</ref> This undertaking, possibly the most comprehensive core sampling in any estuary, relies extensively on the center's expertise in [[biogeochemistry]] and [[phycology]]. Once the sampling is completed, scientist will be able to investigate historical trends in marsh development, [[Carbon cycle|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycling]], [[water pollution]], salinity variations, and [[Global warming|climatic change]] by analyzing the core's sediments, chemistry, and diatom assemblages.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n====Biogeochemistry====\nThe [[Biogeochemistry]] Section of the Patrick Center is concerned with the influence of aquatic organisms on the sources, fate and transport of [[Environmental chemistry|chemicals in aquatic systems]]. Studies frequently deal with the carbon and nutrient cycling as well as those of [[Trace metals|trace elements]] (e.g., lead, copper, mercury, and zinc) and organic contaminants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs). The section regularly provides water, sediment and tissue analyses for government, intergovernmental agencies, and private companies from around the country. In addition to the sediment core project mentioned above, it has recently studied the effects of small dams on sediment contaminants, photochemical transformation of marsh-derived [[dissolved organic matter]], and sedimentation and [[eutrophication]] in [[salt marsh]]es.\n\n====Ecological Modeling====\nThe [[Ecosystem model|Ecological Modeling]] Section employs sophisticated and rigorous mathematical modeling techniques to address a variety of questions in basic and applied research. Examples include [[Watershed management|watershed-scale]] modeling and [[risk assessment]]; nonlinear [[Population modeling|population models]] structured by age, body size, or space; particle transport in [[Fluid dynamics|turbulent aquatic systems]]; and the ecology and control of [[Introduced species|exotic invasive]] plants in urban parks.\n\n====Fisheries====\nThe Fisheries Section of the Patrick Center conducts research into the ecology, [[Wildlife management|conservation]], and [[Fisheries management|management]] of [[Lotic system ecology|lotic]] and [[estuarine fish]]es. Studies may range from the analysis of fish tissues for contaminants, monitoring fish populations for environmental assessments, to investigating the life histories of individual species. Recent and ongoing work include, glass eel (the larvae of freshwater or [[American eel]]s) recruitment in the Delaware River basin, the ecology and genetics of bridal shiner (a fish that's endangered in Pennsylvania), and the impacts of flow management ([[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|dam releases]]) in the Upper [[Delaware River]] to native and [[Introduced species|introduced fish]] populations.\n\n====Macroinvertebrates====\nBenthic macroinvertebrates (primarily [[aquatic insect]]s, crustaceans, and mollusks) are useful for biological monitoring programs. Their varied life spans, ranging from weeks to years, are long enough to reveal intermittent and continuous pollutants, yet short enough respond to worsening or improving water quality. The Macroinvertebrate Section at the Patrick Center has extensive experience in bioassessment, biomonitoring, and inventorying of freshwater habitats throughout the United States.\n\n====Phycology====\nBecause of their great diversity and specific ecological requirements, [[algae]], particularly [[diatom]]s, make excellent [[Indicator species|indicators of water quality]]. Moreover, diatoms are readily preserved in sediments, which make them ideal organisms for studying [[paleolimnology]] (the long-term trends of streams and lakes). Because of their expertise and their close working relationship with the Academy's [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], the [[Phycology]] Section of the Patrick Center is able to provide algal analyses for governmental and other agencies interested in both assessing [[water quality]] and long-term environmental trends. One such undertaking is the analyses of diatom assemblages in lake sediments ([[Core sample|sediment cores]]) throughout the eastern United States. This work, part of a large project managed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], will try to establish reference (pre-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]) conditions  for lakes throughout the country.\n\nIn addition to these research efforts, the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center has developed a set of [http://diatom.ansp.org online resources] for using algae in environmental research. These include an algal image database, autecology datasets for freshwater algae, algae research with the [[USGS]] National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program, and a diatom paleolimnology database.\n\n===Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology===\nFor most of its history, biological [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] and [[systematics]] were conducted using [[Comparative anatomy|comparative morphology]]. In recent decades, however, advances in [[molecular biology]] and computational technologies have opened [[Molecular systematics|new possibilities]] for studying the diversity and history of life through the use of [[cladistics]] and [[computational phylogenetics]]. These technologies also offer new opportunities for [[molecular ecology]] and [[conservation genetics]].\n\nAcademy scientists have been early adapters of [[molecular biology]] techniques. [[Allozymes]], [[DNA-DNA hybridization]], [[immunoelectrophoresis]], restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA and [[serology]] were used extensively since the late 1960s. Recent molecular work mainly employs [[DNA sequencing]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s, and AFLP ([[amplified fragment length polymorphism]]). In 2004, the Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology (LMSE) was formed as a shared, multi-user facility to improve access to and provide training for the use of molecular data in systematic and ecological research. In addition to supporting staff, the lab offers research opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellowships.\n\n===Asia Center===\nThe Asia Center is a new initiative to develop programs and partnerships for research and capacity building throughout Asia. Clyde Goulden is the director of the Asia Center. It is modeled on a series of successful programs conducted in Mongolia since 1995 under the auspices of the Academy's Institute for Mongolian Biodiversity and Ecological Studies (IMBES). The main activities of IMBES occur in the vicinity of Lake Hovsgol in northern Mongolia, but a separate program, the Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey, extends to other parts of the country. More recently, the Asia Center has undertaken joint-projects with [[Nanjing University]], Nanjing Paleontological Museum and Zhejiang Ocean University in China and the Institute of the Biological Problems of the North in the Russian Far East.\n\n====Hovsgol====\nThe Academy's work in [[Mongolia]] started with the realization of the unique research opportunities available at [[Lake Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l|Lake Hovsgol]] (Hovsgol Nuur). This large lake and its watershed were remarkably pristine and relatively unknown, especially in comparison to its sister lake in Russia, [[Lake Baikal]]. In 1995, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the Academy, as well as from other American institutions, Mongolia, Russia, and Japan started a multi-year study of the lake's [[biodiversity]], [[limnology]], and watershed.<ref>The findings of this research were published in \n{{cite book\n  | last = Goulden\n  | first = C.E.\n  |editor1=T. Sitnikova |editor2=J. Gelhaus |editor3=B. Boldgiv\n  | title = The Geology, Biodiversity and Ecology of Lake H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l (Mongolia)\n  | publisher = Backhuys Publ.\n  | year = 2006\n  | location = Leiden\n  | isbn = 90-5782-162-1}}\n</ref>\n\nAlthough this research was scientifically rewarding, it was apparent that issues concerning environmental protection and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic development]] needed addressing.<ref>[[Mongolia]], recently freed from Soviet domination, was experiencing severe economic disruption and increasing pressures through [[globalization]] to exploit its [[Natural resource management|natural resources]]. Mongolians, committed to preserving their natural heritage, needed assistance in developing their scientific and conservation infrastructure.</ref> Consequently, work at Hovsgol shifted to [[Ecosystem ecology|ecosystem studies]] and [[capacity building]].<ref>[[Capacity building]] (the development of local expertise and infrastructure) is implemented in part through the inclusion of scientists and students from the [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National University of Mongolia]] in research projects, conferences, and workshops. The Academy has also sponsored the training of Mongolian students in Philadelphia.</ref> One early undertaking was the enhancement of the operational and physical infrastructure at Hovsgol National Park.<ref>Hovsgol National Park, which includes the lake and its entire watershed, was created in 1992. Improvements took the form of improving park management, improving physical facilities, staff training and developing park-community relationships.</ref> Long-term ecological monitoring of several [[Drainage basin|tributary watersheds]] began in 1997 and soon the site would be adopted into the \n[http://www.lternet.edu/ International Long Term Ecological Research Network].<ref>Long-term ecological work at Hovsgol has been supported by the [[Global Environmental Facility]]from 2002-2006.</ref>\n\nRecent work at Hovsgol is focusing on the consequences of and sustainable responses to [[global warming|climate change]]. The region lies in a transitional zone between the [[Semiarid|semi-arid]] Eurasian [[Steppe]] (grasslands) to the south and the Eurasian [[Taiga]] (boreal forest) to the north. As such, it is an ideal mid-continental site at which to monitor the ecological effects of climate change.<ref>Substantial increases in annual mean temperatures and growing season length in this semiarid landscape have resulted in [[permafrost]] loss, drier soils, and reduced plant cover in the steppe. Shifts in the seasonal pattern in precipitation are disruptive to grassland plant reproduction and the incidence of extreme weather also appears to be increasing. Changes in the forests are less demonstrable, but increased [[Wildfire|fire frequency]] and pest insect outbreaks are suggestive.</ref> In addition, changes in livestock herding practices<ref>Traditional [[pastoralism]], or animal herding, has existed in Mongolia for millennia, but recent trends in livestock production and practices may be unsustainable. The herds are larger and cashmere goats, which can be particularly damaging to vegetation, are accounting for a greater percentage of the total. Moreover, much of the traditional herder expertise was lost during the Soviet era. Consequently, herders risk seriously [[overgrazing]] the steppe, which, because of [[global warming]], is increasingly vulnerable to [[desertification]].</ref> raise concerns about [[overgrazing]] and [[desertification]]. In response, the team at Hovsgol created and distributed a ''Herder Handbook''<ref>An English version of the Herder Handbook can be [http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=41&Itemid=2 downloaded] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215023907/http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=41&Itemid=2 |date=2008-02-15 }} from the Hovsgol Ecology website.</ref> and continues to conduct research and work with nomadic herders to develop sustainable practices.<ref>Current work at Hovsgol is funded by the [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12819 National Science Foundation PIRE program], and is a partnership of the Academy's Asia Center, [http://mongolia.bio.upenn.edu/index.html The University of Pennsylvania], the [http://www.must.edu.mn/ Mongolian Academy of Sciences], the [http://must.edu.mn/ Mongolian University of Science and Technology], and the [http://web.num.edu.mn/eng/ National University of Mongolia]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Information on earlier applied work at Hovsgol can be found at [http://hovsgolecology.org hovsgolecology.org].</ref>\n\n====Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey====\nThe Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clade.ansp.org/entomology/mongolia/|title=Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey: Splash|website=clade.ansp.org}}</ref> is a multi-year [[biodiversity]] survey, [[Water quality|environmental monitoring]] and [[capacity building]] project managed by Jon Gelhaus of the Academy's [[#Entomology|Entomology Department]].  A total of 217 sites from the [[Selenge River]] Basin, the most populous and most extensive drainage in Mongolia, were surveyed from 2003 to 2006. Most of these sites are in rivers or streams, but some are in freshwater and saltwater lakes, hot and cold springs, and marsh wetlands. Additional sites from the remote drainage systems in western Mongolia will be sampled in 2008.\n\nThe survey has yielded numerous new species and hundreds of geographic records for known [[aquatic insect]]s, provided an extensive dataset for ongoing environmental monitoring, and has helped develop research and technical infrastructures in Mongolia. This capacity building includes, in collaboration with the Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, the building of the first research laboratory in Mongolia dedicated to the study of aquatic invertebrates. It also includes training of Mongolian scientists and students.\n\n===Center for Environmental Policy===\nThe Center for Environmental Policy informs and engages various constituents, promotes solutions, and builds public and professional awareness on important environmental topics. Much of its activities focus on public programs and working groups.\n\nThe center hosts or participates in a number of public programs that are free and open to the public. Urban Sustainability Forums feature panels of local and national experts discussing environmental and sustainability topics as they relate to the Philadelphia region. Town Square, which may feature a panel or an individual, addresses a variety of topics relating to the environment or public science. The center also hosts candidate forums, conferences and workshops.\n\nThe center acts as a logistical hub for a number of Working Groups organized around sustainability issues. Currently active groups one for condominium and building co-op owners, a network of faith-based environmental groups, and a forum of senior executives in the private sector.\n\n===Ewell Sale Stewart Library===\nThe Library and Archives were established at the Academy's founding meeting in 1812 for the purpose of supporting its natural science research. The library provides online access, services, collections, imaging, and shared resources with other libraries.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe library houses nearly 200,000 volumes ranging from works published in the 16th century to current journals and books. Its holdings also include  illustrated works from as early as the 15th century, including [[Conrad Gessner|Konrad Gessner's]] ''Historia animalium'', [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]'s ''Insects of Surinam'', [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Psittacidae or Parrots'', and a double elephant folio of [[John James Audubon]]'s ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421170703/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |archive-date=2008-04-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Scientific publications===\nThe ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' was the first peer-reviewed publication in the United States devoted to the natural sciences. The first volume was published in 1817.  By 1842, it had been superseded by the ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences''. The ''Proceedings'' have been published continuously since 1841. The ''Journal'' was reborn in 1847 as a larger-format publication that could accommodate longer articles and [[monograph]]s. The last volume was issued in 1918.<ref>The volumes of the ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' published from 1817 to 1842 are referred to as the First Series. The Second Series was published from 1847 to 1918.</ref>\n\nThe Academy publishes three other series. The occasional series ''Notulae Naturae'' began in 1939 as a means to quickly publish short items, usually not longer than 16 pages on subject areas such as zoology, botany, ecology, geology and paleontology. The ''Monographs'' series, which began in 1935, is composed principally of larger systematic reviews of selected taxonomic groups. The ''Special Publications'' series, begun in 1922, includes works such as biography, taxonomy, historical reviews, and collections surveys.\n\n===VIREO===\n[http://vireo.ansp.org/ VIREO] (VIsual REsource for [[Ornithology]]) is the most comprehensive collection of bird [[Stock photography|images]] in the world. Started in 1979, the collection contains over 140,000 photographs representing more than 7,000 species. The collection contains work by some of the world's most talented photographers. VIREO licenses bird images for a wide variety of commercial and non-profit uses.\n\n==Exhibits and public programs==\n\n===Public exhibits===\n[[File:Mummy PANS.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A mummy on display at the Academy]]\nThe Academy first opened its collections to the public in 1828. The popularity of its exhibits soared in 1868 with the debut of the world's first mounted dinosaur skeleton, ''[[Hadrosaurus]]''.  In fact, the size of the crowds flocking to this display prompted the Academy to relocate to its present-and roomier-location in 1876.\n\n====Collections and the public====\nAs with most museums in the 19th century, there was little separation of the Academy's collections, which were vital to scientific work, and the public spaces. Not only did this subject the collections to extra wear and tear, but visitors were typically confronted with a bewildering assemblage of specimens with little in the way of supplemental information. Over time, however, museums such as the Academy started to showcase their more popular specimens while sequestering the bulk of the collections. In addition, they spent more effort interpreting their public displays. Museums started to play a more active role in educating the public.<ref>The [[Wagner Free Institute of Science]] is an early example of an organized public display of natural history collections. Founded in 1855 to offer free lectures on the natural sciences, the Wagner appointed Joseph Leidy in 1885 to organize its growing collections. Leidy's design is still largely intact, and the Wagner is effectively a museum of a museum.</ref>\n\n====Dioramas====\nOne expression of this transformation was the rise of that icon of natural history museums, the [[diorama]]. These three-dimensional displays were the virtual reality of their time, providing generations of museum visitors with their only opportunity to experience distant places and exotic wildlife. By presenting the wilderness to the public, dioramas nurtured an appreciation of our natural heritage, which, in turn, contributed to the growth of the [[Conservation movement|Conservation Movement]] in the United States. The Academy currently has 37 dioramas, most of which were installed in the 1930s and 1940s. They feature a variety of animals from Africa, Asia, and North America. Some of these, such as the [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[lion]], and [[plains zebra]] are familiar and relatively common, but others, such as the [[Desert Bighorn Sheep|desert bighorn]], [[kiang]], [[Kodiak bear]], [[panda]], and [[passenger pigeon]], are threatened, [[Endangered species|endangered]], or [[Extinction|extinct]].\n\n====Dinosaurs====\n[[File:Hadro bones.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A display of casts of the 35 bones of the Hadrosaurus]]\nAnother icon of natural history museums is the [[dinosaur]] skeleton. The first of these, the ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' mount created by noted natural history artist [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]], made its debut at the Academy in 1868. ''Hadrosaurus'' mounts also found their way into other public venues, including [[Princeton University]], the [[Royal Museum|Royal Scottish Museum]], the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], and the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 American Centennial Exposition]]. A special exhibit on the history of ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'' ran from November 22, 2008 to April 19, 2009.\n[[File:T-rex exhibit Philadelphia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A complete ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' fossil cast on display with other dinosaur specimens.]]\nA skeletal mount of a related dinosaur, ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', served as the centerpiece of the Academy's \"Hall of Earth History\" during the middle of the 20th century. In 1986, the Academy opened a new exhibit, \"Discovering Dinosaurs.\" This was the first large-scale exhibit to incorporate the findings of the \"[[dinosaur renaissance]].\" Instead of cold-blooded and lumbering reptiles, dinosaurs were conceived as active-and possibly warm-blooded-animals more akin to birds than reptiles.\n\nIn 1979, another type of dinosaur was the subject of an exhibition at the academy when it featured [[Jim Gary|Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs]] and found that it was an enormous success with the public. This unconventional exhibition for a museum of science that featured contemporary sculpture, which focused upon the subjects of intense scientific inquiry, began a trend among its peer institutions, who then began to invite Gary and several other artists who specialized in scientific topics and subjects to museums that always had shied away from anything identified as \"contemporary art\" as exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Twentieth_Century_Dinosaurs_Return_to_Tallahassee_Museum_128476873.html?storySection=story|title=Twentieth Century Dinosaurs Return to Tallahassee Museum|first=Tallahassee Museum|last=Release|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Other exhibits====\nIn 1979, the academy also opened \"Outside-In\", a hands-on children's nature museum. In 1995, it pioneered the hands-on simulation of a dinosaur dig, with its \"The Big Dig.\" Other permanent exhibits include \"Butterflies!\", a live butterfly zoo, and  \"Science at the Academy\", which showcases current Academy research.\n\nThe museum also has special, changing exhibits. Recent changing exhibits include \"Amazon Voyage: Vicious Fishes and Other Riches\", \"Frogs: a Chorus of Colors\", \"The Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Exhibition\", and \"The Scoop on Poop: The Science of What Animals Leave Behind.\"\n\n===Public programs===\n\n====Festivals====\nFour weekend festivals organized around scientific disciplines, are held during the year. Paleopalooza, held in mid-February, features fossil collections and talks by leading paleontologists. Earth Day Festival, held in mid-April, features scientists from the Academy's Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Bug Fest, held in mid August, features entomologists, insect collections and live insects. The Philadelphia Shell Show, held in mid-October, features an international shell market and competitive shell displays.\n\n====Programs for adults====\nThe Academy began offering lectures to the public as early as the 1820s. Current offerings include natural history author talks, lectures by scientists, workshops and classes. In addition, the Center for Environmental Policy produces public programs on environmental issues.\n\n====Programs for families and children====\nSince its Nature Club in the 1930s, the Academy has offered programming just for children. Several programs appropriate for different age groups are currently offered. Safari Overnight sleepovers (camp-ins) are held on selected weekends during Fall, Winter, and Spring. [[Scouts BSA (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting|Girl Scouts]] can participate in day workshops and sleepovers to fulfill badge and pin requirements. Tiny Tot Explorers is a program for toddlers. A new series of Family Workshops designed for both adults and children was launched in early 2010.\n\n\"Wild Weekends\", held on selected weekends throughout the year, offer a variety of children's programs, including hands-on exploration of museum specimens, crafts and live animal shows with mammals, birds and reptiles. Live animal shows are also presented at regular times on other days and featured prominently in the educational programs.\n\n===Educational programs===\n\n====Field trips and outreach====\n[[Field trip]]s to the Academy are available throughout the year for schools, summer camps and other groups. Optional directed programs include Discovery Lessons for younger age groups (pre-K and higher) and Science Explorers for older children (grades 7 through 9). \"Academy on the Go\" is an educational outreach program that visits schools, camps, and community centers.\n\n====Women in Natural Sciences====\nWINS (Women in Natural Sciences) is an innovative and successful science enrichment program conducted by The Academy of Natural Sciences in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia. Since its founding in 1982, WINS has been providing female public school students with hands-on science classes, [[scientific literacy]] and skill-building activities, and opportunities for personal growth in a uniquely nurturing setting.\n\n====Other programs====\nAcademy Explorers Camp is a day camp program offered during Spring Break and the Summer. The George Washington Carver Science Fair is held in February or March. [[Science fair]] participants are eligible for the George Washington Carver Scholars summer program, which is also held at the Academy. Educator workshops are held throughout the year. The most recent series covered the integration of science and literacy skills. Self-guided workbooks tailored for younger children are available for some of the museum exhibits.\n\n==Awards and research opportunities==\n\n===Hayden Memorial Geological Award===\nThe [[Hayden Memorial Geological Award]] is given to prominent scientists working in geology or paleontology. It was established in 1888 in memory of [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V.

He was in radio for over 60 years and was honored by the Nevada Broadcasters in 2005, when he was inducted into their Hall Of Fame.\n\n==Early life and radio career==\nBorn in Oklahoma City, Quillin moved to [[El Paso]], Texas where he finished high school and attended the Texas College of Mines and Metallurgy (now the [[University of Texas at El Paso]]). During this time, while still in high school Ted started his broadcast career at KEPO, an ABC station in El Paso. He started as a \u2018gofer\u2019 on a morning show from 6 to 7 AM, before he went to school. He graduated to staff announcer. After that he took a job in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], at [[KSIX (AM)|KSIX]]. The program director from [[KXYZ]] in Houston heard him, and hired him as a staff announcer. From there he went to [[KCLE|WACO]] in [[Waco, Texas.]] Ted moved to KELP-El Paso which was a Gordon McClendon station, doing top 40. This is where he met Chuck Blore and when Chuck got the call to Hollywood he took Ted with him and Ted became one of the original \"Seven Swingin\u2019 Gentlemen\", who took Rock and Roll into its first major market, at KFWB. His listeners became known as the \"Quiverin' Quillin Clan.\"\n\n== Later radio career ==\nQuillin's years in radio include: KFWB\u2013Hollywood, 1958-61; [[KRLA]]\u2013Pasadena, 1962-64; [[KRLV (AM)|KORK]]\u2013Las Vegas, 1964-66, [[KFI]]\u2013L.A, 1969; [[KDAY|KFOX]]\u2013Long Beach 1969-71; XPRS-1972, and, finally, back to KORK in 1972, when he became a permanent resident of Las Vegas. Ted was at KORK for several years and later opened an advertising agency in the city. During the days at his agency he did months and sometime years of DJ work on several local radio stations, including [[KLAV]]. People in broadcasting in Vegas knew Ted and would call him when they got in a \u2018pinch\u2019 to fill in for them, and sometimes this \u2018fill-in\u2019 would last for a year or more. During this period he taught a class on communications at Las Vegas City College.\n\nTed did a show for [[Armed Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio & Television Network]] for many years and was heard on 530 radio stations worldwide. This show was broadcast while he was in Hollywood as well as after he moved permanently to Las Vegas. Years later the Armed Forces Network was re-broadcasting Quillin's shows on their radio stations.\n\nIn his later years Quillin still kept his hand in broadcasting with a Classic Country show which he did for [[KDSS]] in Ely, NV and a show on the Internet on Rock-it Radio.<ref>http://www.palmsradio.com/rockittext.htm Rockit Radio</ref>  Ted always signed off any of his radio programs with his trademark slogan \u201cBlue Skies and Green Lights.\u201d  Quillin died April 20, 2011, in Las Vegas.\n\n==Awards==\nTed was rated #1 Personality Disc Jockey nationally, by the C. E. Hooper Audience Corp. while at KFWB. In 2005 Ted was inducted into the [[Nevada Broadcasters Association|Broadcasters' Hall of Fame]] in Nevada. He received a standing ovation when he was called to accept his trophy.

His listeners became known as the \"Quiverin' Quillin Clan.\"\n\n== Later radio career ==\nQuillin's years in radio include: KFWB\u2013Hollywood, 1958-61; [[KRLA]]\u2013Pasadena, 1962-64; [[KRLV (AM)|KORK]]\u2013Las Vegas, 1964-66, [[KFI]]\u2013L.A, 1969; [[KDAY|KFOX]]\u2013Long Beach 1969-71; XPRS-1972, and, finally, back to KORK in 1972, when he became a permanent resident of Las Vegas. Ted was at KORK for several years and later opened an advertising agency in the city. During the days at his agency he did months and sometime years of DJ work on several local radio stations, including [[KLAV]]. People in broadcasting in Vegas knew Ted and would call him when they got in a \u2018pinch\u2019 to fill in for them, and sometimes this \u2018fill-in\u2019 would last for a year or more. During this period he taught a class on communications at Las Vegas City College.\n\nTed did a show for [[Armed Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio & Television Network]] for many years and was heard on 530 radio stations worldwide. This show was broadcast while he was in Hollywood as well as after he moved permanently to Las Vegas. Years later the Armed Forces Network was re-broadcasting Quillin's shows on their radio stations.\n\nIn his later years Quillin still kept his hand in broadcasting with a Classic Country show which he did for [[KDSS]] in Ely, NV and a show on the Internet on Rock-it Radio.<ref>http://www.palmsradio.com/rockittext.htm Rockit Radio</ref>  Ted always signed off any of his radio programs with his trademark slogan \u201cBlue Skies and Green Lights.\u201d  Quillin died April 20, 2011, in Las Vegas.\n\n==Awards==\nTed was rated #1 Personality Disc Jockey nationally, by the C. E. Hooper Audience Corp. while at KFWB. In 2005 Ted was inducted into the [[Nevada Broadcasters Association|Broadcasters' Hall of Fame]] in Nevada. He received a standing ovation when he was called to accept his trophy. He was revered and respected by his peers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Don Imus]] spoke of him with admiration on his show.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==Fictional portrayals==\nQuillin was portrayed in the film ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'' by [[Rick Dees]]. During the late 1950s he became something of a mentor and advisor to the young Ritchie Valens.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quillin, Ted}}\n[[Category:American radio personalities]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:2011 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Oklahoma City]]\n[[Category:University of Texas at El Paso alumni]]\n[[Category:American Forces Network]]\n[[Category:Radio personalities from Oklahoma]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Quillin"}
