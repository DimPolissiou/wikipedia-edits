The explosion killed Angela Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers injuring himself and an officer. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|left|A Holden Commodore, like the one used in the Russell Street bombing]]\nThe explosion was caused by a [[car bomb]] hidden in a stolen 1979 [[Holden Commodore]], (bearing Victoria [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | registration plate]]; AVQ-508). The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police.<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>\n\nA week after the bombing, on 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner, [[Mick Miller (police officer) |Mick Miller]], stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the footage. The caller contacted Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact again, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the caller's price as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986 and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] at 3:00pm on the day of the bombing in which the Commodore was used to [[Ram-raiding |ram-raid]] the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\nDuring the surveillance, the surveillance team observed Reed pulling into driveway of a house of a associate on Haros Street in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka, while Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed who visited Zelinka on multiple occasions.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka admitted that he knew Peter Reed through his association with Craig Minogue, Zelinka also admitted that he saw Craig Minogue pulling into the garage of Zelinka's home in a Commodore identical to the bomb car. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home. Zelinka then admitted that Craig Minogue had told him to grab the lid of Zelinka's metal rubbish bin and put it on the a pile in the trailer. When the detectives asked about the pile in the trailer, Zelinka admitted that the Minogue Brothers took the pile in the trailer to a rubbish tip.   \n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to the late 1940s. Taylor first became known to the authorities at the age of 8 when he was arrested for truancy and spent two years in the Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] where he was subjected to abuse from the other inmates and staff and was introduced to a life of crime. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been in and out of jail on criminal charges relating to theft of motorcycles and burglary. In 1961, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his 1965 escape but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge only to be recaptured five days later during which, he committed seven bank robberies.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers injuring himself and an officer. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|left|A Holden Commodore, like the one used in the Russell Street bombing]]\nThe explosion was caused by a [[car bomb]] hidden in a stolen 1979 [[Holden Commodore]], (bearing Victoria [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | registration plate]]; AVQ-508). The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood. On 25 March 1986, a Commodore was stolen. Both crimes were later found to provide equipment needed for the construction of the bomb.{{cn|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn the course of the investigation, a group of people, including [[Craig Minogue]], Rodney Minogue, Stanley Brian Taylor and Peter Reed, were apprehended. The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police.<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>\n\nA week after the bombing, on 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner, [[Mick Miller (police officer) |Mick Miller]], stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the footage. The caller contacted Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact again, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the caller's price as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986 and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] at 3:00pm on the day of the bombing in which the Commodore was used to [[Ram-raiding |ram-raid]] the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\nDuring the surveillance, the surveillance team observed Reed pulling into driveway of a house of a associate on Haros Street in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka, while Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed who visited Zelinka on multiple occasions.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka admitted that he knew Peter Reed through his association with Craig Minogue, Zelinka also admitted that he saw Craig Minogue pulling into the garage of Zelinka's home in a Commodore identical to the bomb car. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home. Zelinka then admitted that Craig Minogue had told him to grab the lid of Zelinka's metal rubbish bin and put it on the a pile in the trailer. When the detectives asked about the pile in the trailer, Zelinka admitted that the Minogue Brothers took the pile in the trailer to a rubbish tip.   \n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to the late 1940s. Taylor first became known to the authorities at the age of 8 when he was arrested for truancy and spent two years in the Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] where he was subjected to abuse from the other inmates and staff and was introduced to a life of crime. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been in and out of jail on criminal charges relating to theft of motorcycles and burglary. In 1961, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his 1965 escape but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge only to be recaptured five days later during which, he committed seven bank robberies.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

{"title_page": "Grimm's law", "text_new": "{{short description|Sound shift in the Germanic languages}}\n{{Contains PIE words}}\n'''Grimm's law''' (also known as the '''First Germanic Sound Shift''') is a set of statements named after [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Rasmus Rask]] describing the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stop consonants as they developed in [[Proto-Germanic]] (the common ancestor of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family) in the 1st millennium BC. It establishes a set of regular correspondences between early Germanic stops, [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]s and the [[stop consonant]]s of certain other [[Centum and satem languages|centum Indo-European languages]] (Grimm used mostly Latin and Greek for illustration).\n\n==History==\n\nGrimm's law was the first discovery of a systematic sound change, and it led to the creation of historical phonology as a separate discipline of [[historical linguistics]]. The correspondence between Latin ''p'' and Germanic ''f'' was first noted by [[Friedrich von Schlegel]] in 1806. In 1818, Rasmus Rask extended the correspondences to other Indo-European languages such as Sanskrit and Greek, and to the full range of consonants involved. In 1822, Jacob Grimm put forth the rule in his book ''Deutsche Grammatik'' and extended it to include standard German. He noticed that there were many words which had different consonants from what his law predicted, and these exceptions defied linguists for a few decades, but they eventually received explanation from Danish linguist [[Karl Verner]] in the form of [[Verner's law]].\n\n==Overview==\nGrimm's law consists of three parts which form consecutive phases in the sense of a [[chain shift]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |title=Historical linguistics | edition=2nd |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |isbn=0-262-53267-0 |pages=49}}</ref> The phases are usually constructed as follows:\n\n# Proto-Indo-European voiceless [[stop consonant|stop]]s change into [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[fricatives]].\n# Proto-Indo-European voiced stops become [[Voicelessness#Lack_of_voicing_contrast_in_obstruents|voiceless stops]].\n# Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops become voiced stops or fricatives (as [[allophone]]s).\n\nThis chain shift (in the order 3,2,1) can be abstractly represented as:\n\n* {{PIE|b\u02b0}} > {{PIE|b}} > {{PIE|p}} > {{PIE|\u0278}}\n* {{PIE|d\u02b0}} > {{PIE|d}} > {{PIE|t}} > {{PIE|\u03b8}}\n* {{PIE|g\u02b0}} > {{PIE|g}} > {{PIE|k}} > {{PIE|x}}\n* {{PIE|g\u02b7\u02b0}} > {{PIE|g\u02b7}} > {{PIE|k\u02b7}} > {{PIE|x\u02b7}}\n\nHere each sound moves one position to the right to take on its new sound value. Note that within Proto-Germanic, the sounds denoted by {{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|d}}, {{angbr|g}} and {{angbr|gw}} were stops in some environments and fricatives in others, so {{PIE|b\u02b0}} > {{PIE|b}} should be understood here as {{PIE|b\u02b0}} > {{PIE|b/\u03b2}}, and likewise for the others. The voiceless fricatives are customarily spelled {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|\u00fe}}, {{angbr|h}} and {{angbr|hw}} in the context of Germanic.\n\nThe exact details of the shift are unknown, and it may have progressed in a variety of ways before arriving at the final situation. The three stages listed above show the progression of a \"pull chain\", in which each change leaves a \"gap\" in the phonological system that \"pulls\" other phonemes into it to fill the gap. But it is also conceivable that the shift happened as a push chain, where the changes happened in reverse order, with each change \"pushing\" the next forward to avoid merging the phonemes.\n\nThe steps could also have occurred somewhat differently. Another possible sequence of events could have been:\n\n# Voiceless stops are allophonically aspirated under most conditions.\n# Voiced stops become unaspirated voiceless stops.\n# All aspirated stops become fricatives.\n\nThis sequence would lead to the same end result. This variety of Grimm's law is often suggested in the context of the [[glottalic theory]] of Proto-Indo-European, which is followed by a minority of linguists. This theoretical framework assumes that \"voiced stops\" in PIE were actually voiceless to begin with, so that the second phase did not actually exist as such, or was not actually devoicing but a loss of some other articulatory feature such as [[glottalization]] or [[ejective]]ness. This alternative sequence also accounts for the phonetics of [[Verner's law]] (see below), which are easier to explain within the glottalic theory framework when Grimm's law is formulated in this manner. Additionally, a change from aspirated stops to fricatives is known to have happened in the transition between Proto-Indo-European and [[Proto-Italic]], so represents a plausible potential change from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic.\n\n==Further changes==\n\nOnce the changes described by Grimm's law had taken place, there was only one type of voiced consonant, with no distinction between voiced stops and voiced fricatives. They eventually became stops at the beginning of a word (for the most part), as well as after a nasal consonant, but fricatives elsewhere. Whether they were plosives or fricatives at first is therefore not clear. The voiced aspirated stops may have first become voiced fricatives, before hardening to stops under certain conditions. But they may also have become stops at first, softening to fricatives in most positions later.\n\nAround the same time as the Grimm's law adjustments took place, another change occurred known as [[Verner's law]]. Verner's law caused, under certain conditions, the voicing of the voiceless fricatives that resulted from the Grimm's law changes, creating apparent exceptions to the rule. For example:\n\n* Proto-Indo-European ''*b\u02b0r\u00e9h\u2082t\u0113r'' (\"brother\") > Proto-Germanic ''*br\u014d\u00fe\u0113r'' (Old English ''bro\u00feor'', Old High German ''bruothar''/''bruodar'')\n* Proto-Indo-European ''*ph\u2082t\u1e17r'' (\"father\") > Proto-Germanic ''*fad\u0113r'' (Old English ''f\u00e6der'', Old High German ''fatar'')\n\nHere, the same sound ''*t'' appears as ''*\u00fe'' {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} in one word (following Grimm's law), but as ''*d'' {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} in another (apparently violating Grimm's law). See the [[Verner's law]] article for a more detailed explanation of this discrepancy.\n\nThe early Germanic ''*gw'' that had arisen from Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|''*g\u02b7\u02b0''}} (and from {{IPA|''*k\u02b7''}} through Verner's law) underwent further changes of various sorts:\n\n* After ''*n'' it was preserved as a labiovelar stop ''*gw'', but later changed to a plain velar ''*g'' in [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]].\n* Following vowels, it seems to have become ''*w'', presumably through a fricative stage ''*\u0263\u02b7''.\n* Word-initially, the most plausible reflex is a labiovelar stop ''*g\u02b7'' at first, but the further development is unclear. In that position, it became either ''*w'', ''*g'' or ''*b'' during late Proto-Germanic.\n* The regular reflex next to ''*u'' would likely have been ''*g'', due to loss of the labial element before a labial vowel in Proto-Indo-European, which continued to act as a [[surface filter]]. (See [[bouk\u00f3los rule]])\n\nPerhaps the usual reflex was ''*b'' (as suggested by the connection of ''bid'' < ''*bidjan\u0105'' and Old Irish ''guidid''), but ''*w'' appears in certain cases (possibly through dissimilation when another labial consonant followed?), such as in ''warm'' and ''wife'' (provided that the proposed explanations are correct). Proto-Germanic ''*hw'' voiced by Verner's law fell together with this sound and developed identically, compare the words for 'she-wolf': from Middle High German ''w\u00fclbe''{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Old Norse ''ylgr'', one can reconstruct Proto-Germanic nominative singular ''*wulb\u012b'', genitive singular ''*wulgij\u014dz'', from earlier ''*wulgw\u012b'', ''*wulgwij\u014dz''.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Gothic 'bagms' and Old Icelandic 'ylgr' | journal =  NOWELE | year = 1995 | first = F.

The latter change was frequent in suffixes, and became a phonotactic restriction known as the [[Germanic spirant law]]. This rule remained productive throughout the Proto-Germanic period.

For example, Germanic (word-initial) *b- corresponds regularly to Latin ''*f-'', Greek ''{{PIE|p\u02b0-}}'', [[Sanskrit]] ''{{PIE|b\u02b0-}}'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''b-'', etc., while Germanic ''*f-'' corresponds to Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Slavic and Baltic ''p-'' and to zero (no initial consonant) in Celtic. The former set goes back to PIE *{{PIE|b\u02b0-}} (faithfully reflected in Sanskrit and modified in various ways elsewhere), and the latter set to PIE *p- (shifted in Germanic, lost in Celtic, but preserved in the other groups mentioned here).\n\nOne of the more conspicuous present surface correspondences is the English [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[wh (digraph)|wh]]'' and the corresponding Latin and Romance digraph ''[[qu (digraph)|qu]]'', notably found in [[interrogative word]]s ([[wh-word|''wh''-words]]) such as the [[five Ws]]. These both come from {{PIE|k\u02b7}}. The present pronunciations have undergone further sound changes, such as [[wh-cluster reductions|''wh''-cluster reductions]] in many varieties of English, though the spellings reflect the history more; see [[Interrogative word#Etymology|Interrogative word: Etymology]] for details.\n\n==See also==\n* [[High German consonant shift]]\n* [[Glottalic theory]]\n* The [[Tuscan gorgia]], a similar evolution differentiating the [[Tuscan dialect]]s from [[Italian language|Standard Italian]].\n* The [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] [[Hungarian language]] was also affected by a similar process, leading to a high frequency of ''f'' and ''h'', and can be compared to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which did not change this way.\n* [[Armenian language|Armenian]], another Indo-European language, has experienced a similar evolution.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Germanic philology}}\n\n{{Brothers Grimm}}\n\n[[Category:History of the Dutch language]]\n[[Category:Sound laws]]\n[[Category:History of the German language]]\n\n[[de:Erste Lautverschiebung]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sound shift in the Germanic languages}}\n{{Contains PIE words}}\n'''Grimm's law''' (also known as the '''First Germanic Sound Shift''') is a set of statements named after [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Rasmus Rask]] describing the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stop consonants as they developed in [[Proto-Germanic]] (the common ancestor of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family) in the 1st millennium BC. It establishes a set of regular correspondences between early Germanic stops, [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]s and the [[stop consonant]]s of certain other [[Centum and satem languages|centum Indo-European languages]] (Grimm used mostly Latin and Greek for illustration).\n\n==History==\n\nGrimm's law was the first discovery of a systematic sound change, and it led to the creation of historical phonology as a separate discipline of historical linguistics. The correspondence between Latin ''p'' and Germanic ''f'' was first noted by [[Friedrich von Schlegel]] in 1806. In 1818, Rasmus Rask extended the correspondences to other Indo-European languages such as Sanskrit and Greek, and to the full range of consonants involved. In 1822, Jacob Grimm put forth the rule in his book ''Deutsche Grammatik'' and extended it to include standard German. He noticed that there were many words which had different consonants from what his law predicted, and these exceptions defied linguists for a few decades, but they eventually received explanation from Danish linguist [[Karl Verner]] in the form of [[Verner's law]].\n\n==Overview==\nGrimm's law consists of three parts which form consecutive phases in the sense of a [[chain shift]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |title=Historical linguistics | edition=2nd |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |isbn=0-262-53267-0 |pages=49}}</ref> The phases are usually constructed as follows:\n\n# Proto-Indo-European voiceless [[stop consonant|stop]]s change into [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[fricatives]].\n# Proto-Indo-European voiced stops become [[Voicelessness#Lack_of_voicing_contrast_in_obstruents|voiceless stops]].\n# Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops become voiced stops or fricatives (as [[allophone]]s).\n\nThis chain shift (in the order 3,2,1) can be abstractly represented as:\n\n* {{PIE|b\u02b0}} > {{PIE|b}} > {{PIE|p}} > {{PIE|\u0278}}\n* {{PIE|d\u02b0}} > {{PIE|d}} > {{PIE|t}} > {{PIE|\u03b8}}\n* {{PIE|g\u02b0}} > {{PIE|g}} > {{PIE|k}} > {{PIE|x}}\n* {{PIE|g\u02b7\u02b0}} > {{PIE|g\u02b7}} > {{PIE|k\u02b7}} > {{PIE|x\u02b7}}\n\nHere each sound moves one position to the right to take on its new sound value. Note that within Proto-Germanic, the sounds denoted by {{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|d}}, {{angbr|g}} and {{angbr|gw}} were stops in some environments and fricatives in others, so {{PIE|b\u02b0}} > {{PIE|b}} should be understood here as {{PIE|b\u02b0}} > {{PIE|b/\u03b2}}, and likewise for the others. The voiceless fricatives are customarily spelled {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|\u00fe}}, {{angbr|h}} and {{angbr|hw}} in the context of Germanic.\n\nThe exact details of the shift are unknown, and it may have progressed in a variety of ways before arriving at the final situation. The three stages listed above show the progression of a \"pull chain\", in which each change leaves a \"gap\" in the phonological system that \"pulls\" other phonemes into it to fill the gap. But it is also conceivable that the shift happened as a push chain, where the changes happened in reverse order, with each change \"pushing\" the next forward to avoid merging the phonemes.\n\nThe steps could also have occurred somewhat differently. Another possible sequence of events could have been:\n\n# Voiceless stops are allophonically aspirated under most conditions.\n# Voiced stops become unaspirated voiceless stops.\n# All aspirated stops become fricatives.\n\nThis sequence would lead to the same end result. This variety of Grimm's law is often suggested in the context of the [[glottalic theory]] of Proto-Indo-European, which is followed by a minority of linguists. This theoretical framework assumes that \"voiced stops\" in PIE were actually voiceless to begin with, so that the second phase did not actually exist as such, or was not actually devoicing but a loss of some other articulatory feature such as [[glottalization]] or [[ejective]]ness. This alternative sequence also accounts for the phonetics of [[Verner's law]] (see below), which are easier to explain within the glottalic theory framework when Grimm's law is formulated in this manner. Additionally, a change from aspirated stops to fricatives is known to have happened in the transition between Proto-Indo-European and [[Proto-Italic]], so represents a plausible potential change from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic.\n\n==Further changes==\n\nOnce the changes described by Grimm's law had taken place, there was only one type of voiced consonant, with no distinction between voiced stops and voiced fricatives. They eventually became stops at the beginning of a word (for the most part), as well as after a nasal consonant, but fricatives elsewhere. Whether they were plosives or fricatives at first is therefore not clear. The voiced aspirated stops may have first become voiced fricatives, before hardening to stops under certain conditions. But they may also have become stops at first, softening to fricatives in most positions later.\n\nAround the same time as the Grimm's law adjustments took place, another change occurred known as [[Verner's law]]. Verner's law caused, under certain conditions, the voicing of the voiceless fricatives that resulted from the Grimm's law changes, creating apparent exceptions to the rule. For example:\n\n* Proto-Indo-European ''*b\u02b0r\u00e9h\u2082t\u0113r'' (\"brother\") > Proto-Germanic ''*br\u014d\u00fe\u0113r'' (Old English ''bro\u00feor'', Old High German ''bruothar''/''bruodar'')\n* Proto-Indo-European ''*ph\u2082t\u1e17r'' (\"father\") > Proto-Germanic ''*fad\u0113r'' (Old English ''f\u00e6der'', Old High German ''fatar'')\n\nHere, the same sound ''*t'' appears as ''*\u00fe'' {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} in one word (following Grimm's law), but as ''*d'' {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} in another (apparently violating Grimm's law). See the [[Verner's law]] article for a more detailed explanation of this discrepancy.\n\nThe early Germanic ''*gw'' that had arisen from Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|''*g\u02b7\u02b0''}} (and from {{IPA|''*k\u02b7''}} through Verner's law) underwent further changes of various sorts:\n\n* After ''*n'' it was preserved as a labiovelar stop ''*gw'', but later changed to a plain velar ''*g'' in [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]].\n* Following vowels, it seems to have become ''*w'', presumably through a fricative stage ''*\u0263\u02b7''.\n* Word-initially, the most plausible reflex is a labiovelar stop ''*g\u02b7'' at first, but the further development is unclear. In that position, it became either ''*w'', ''*g'' or ''*b'' during late Proto-Germanic.\n* The regular reflex next to ''*u'' would likely have been ''*g'', due to loss of the labial element before a labial vowel in Proto-Indo-European, which continued to act as a [[surface filter]]. (See [[bouk\u00f3los rule]])\n\nPerhaps the usual reflex was ''*b'' (as suggested by the connection of ''bid'' < ''*bidjan\u0105'' and Old Irish ''guidid''), but ''*w'' appears in certain cases (possibly through dissimilation when another labial consonant followed?), such as in ''warm'' and ''wife'' (provided that the proposed explanations are correct). Proto-Germanic ''*hw'' voiced by Verner's law fell together with this sound and developed identically, compare the words for 'she-wolf': from Middle High German ''w\u00fclbe''{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Old Norse ''ylgr'', one can reconstruct Proto-Germanic nominative singular ''*wulb\u012b'', genitive singular ''*wulgij\u014dz'', from earlier ''*wulgw\u012b'', ''*wulgwij\u014dz''.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Gothic 'bagms' and Old Icelandic 'ylgr' | journal =  NOWELE | year = 1995 | first = F.

The first phase left the phoneme repertoire of the language without voiceless stops, the second phase filled this gap, but created a new one, and so on until the chain had run its course.\n\n==Behaviour in consonant clusters==\n\nWhen two obstruents occurred in a pair, the first was changed according to Grimm's law, if possible, while the second was not. If either of the two was voiceless, the whole cluster was devoiced, and the first obstruent also lost its labialisation, if it was present.\n\nMost examples of this occurred with obstruents preceded by *s (resulting in *sp, *st, *sk, *sk\u02b7), or obstruents followed by *t (giving *ft, *ss, *ht, *ht) or *s (giving *fs, *ss, *hs, *hs). The latter change was frequent in suffixes, and became a phonotactic restriction known as the [[Germanic spirant law]]. This rule remained productive throughout the Proto-Germanic period. The cluster *tt became *ss (as in many Indo-European daughter languages), but this was often restored analogically to *st later on.\n\nExamples with preceding *s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The former set goes back to PIE *{{PIE|b\u02b0-}} (faithfully reflected in Sanskrit and modified in various ways elsewhere), and the latter set to PIE *p- (shifted in Germanic, lost in Celtic, but preserved in the other groups mentioned here).\n\nOne of the more conspicuous present surface correspondences is the English [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[wh (digraph)|wh]]'' and the corresponding Latin and Romance digraph ''[[qu (digraph)|qu]]'', notably found in [[interrogative word]]s ([[wh-word|''wh''-words]]) such as the [[five Ws]]. These both come from {{PIE|k\u02b7}}. The present pronunciations have undergone further sound changes, such as [[wh-cluster reductions|''wh''-cluster reductions]] in many varieties of English, though the spellings reflect the history more; see [[Interrogative word#Etymology|Interrogative word: Etymology]] for details.\n\n==See also==\n* [[High German consonant shift]]\n* [[Glottalic theory]]\n* The [[Tuscan gorgia]], a similar evolution differentiating the [[Tuscan dialect]]s from [[Italian language|Standard Italian]].\n* The [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] [[Hungarian language]] was also affected by a similar process, leading to a high frequency of ''f'' and ''h'', and can be compared to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which did not change this way.\n* [[Armenian language|Armenian]], another Indo-European language, has experienced a similar evolution.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Germanic philology}}\n\n{{Brothers Grimm}}\n\n[[Category:History of the Dutch language]]\n[[Category:Sound laws]]\n[[Category:History of the German language]]\n\n[[de:Erste Lautverschiebung]]\n", "name_user": "Josiah Rowe", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added link tohistorical linguistics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law"}

Republic of China]]. It is located on the southern estuary of the [[Yangtze]], with the [[Huangpu River]] flowing through it. With a population of 24.28 million {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, it is the [[List of cities in China by population and built-up area|most populous urban area in China]] and the second [[List of largest cities|most populous city proper]] in the world. Shanghai is a global center for finance, [[Science and technology in China|innovation]] and [[Transport in China|transportation]] and the [[Port of Shanghai]] is the [[world's busiest container port]].\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five [[treaty ports]] forced open to foreign trade after the [[First Opium War]]. The [[Shanghai International Settlement]] and the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in the 1930s. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the city was the site of the major [[Battle of Shanghai]]. After the war, with the [[Chinese Civil War|CPC takeover of mainland China]] in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] introduced by [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the [[Pudong]] district, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], one of the [[List of stock exchanges|largest stock exchanges in the world]] by market capitalization and the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]], the first [[free-trade zone]] in China.\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming [[economy of China]]. Featuring several architecture styles such as [[Art Deco]] and [[shikumen]], the city is renowned for its [[Lujiazui]] [[List of tallest buildings in Shanghai|skyline]], museums and historic buildings\u2014including the [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]], [[Yu Garden]], the [[China Pavilion]] and buildings along [[the Bund]]. Shanghai is also known for its [[Shanghai cuisine|sugary cuisine]], [[Shanghainese|distinctive dialect]] and vibrant international flair.

Republic of China]]. It is located on the southern estuary of the [[Yangtze]], with the [[Huangpu River]] flowing through it. With a population of 24.28 million {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, it is the [[List of cities in China by population and built-up area|most populous urban area in China]] and the second [[List of largest cities|most populous city proper]] in the world. Shanghai is a global center for finance, [[Science and technology in China|innovation]] and [[Transport in China|transportation]] and the [[Port of Shanghai]] is the [[world's busiest container port]].\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five [[treaty ports]] forced open to foreign trade after the [[First Opium War]]. The [[Shanghai International Settlement]] and the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in the 1930s. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the city was the site of the major [[Battle of Shanghai]]. After the war, with the [[Chinese Civil War|CPC takeover of mainland China]] in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] introduced by [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the [[Pudong]] district, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], one of the [[List of stock exchanges|largest stock exchanges in the world]] by market capitalization and the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]], the first [[free-trade zone]] in China.\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming [[economy of China]]. Featuring several architecture styles such as [[Art Deco]] and [[shikumen]], the city is renowned for its [[Lujiazui]] [[List of tallest buildings in Shanghai|skyline]], museums and historic buildings\u2014including the [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]], [[Yu Garden]], the [[China Pavilion]] and buildings along [[the Bund]]. Shanghai is also known for its [[Shanghai cuisine|sugary cuisine]], [[Shanghainese|distinctive dialect]] and vibrant international flair. Every year, the city hosts numerous national and international events, including [[Shanghai Fashion Week]], the [[Chinese Grand Prix]] and [[ChinaJoy]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe two [[Chinese character]]s in the city's name are {{zh|c={{linktext|\u4e0a}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|sh\u00e0ng}}/''zan'', \"upon\") and {{zh|c={{linktext|\u6d77}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|h\u01cei}}/''hae'', \"sea\"), together meaning \"Upon the Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century [[Song dynasty]], when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the [[Tang dynasty]], the area of modern-day Shanghai was under the sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea\".<ref name=\"Danielson, Eric N. 2004, pp.8-9\">Danielson, Eric N., ''Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta'', 2004, pp.&nbsp;8\u20139.</ref>\nShanghai is officially abbreviated {{zh|s={{linktext|\u6caa}} |labels=no}}{{efn|Traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-hant|\u6eec}}<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u91cd\u7de8\u570b\u8a9e\u8fad\u5178\u4fee\u8a02\u672c|url=http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/cbdic/gsweb.cgi?ccd=jhLPR1&o=e0&sec=sec1&op=v&view=1-1|accessdate=29 September 2019|author=National Academy for Educational Research|date=|format=|work=dict.revised.moe.edu.tw|publisher=|language=zh|author-link = National Academy for Educational Research}}</ref>}} ({{transl|zh|H\u00f9}}/''Vu''<sup>2</sup>) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a contraction of {{zh|s={{linktext|\u6caa\u6e0e}} |labels=no}}{{efn|Traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-hant|\u6eec\u7006}}<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=zh:\u6eec\u7006\u8a5e\u8a9e\u89e3\u91cb / \u6eec\u7006\u662f\u4ec0\u9ebd\u610f\u601d|url=http://www.chinesewords.org/dict/178009-179.html|accessdate=29 September 2019|author=|date=|format=|work=www.chinesewords.org|publisher=\u6f22\u8a9e\u7db2|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929063643/http://www.chinesewords.org/dict/178009-179.html|archive-date=29 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} ({{transl|zh|H\u00f9 D\u00fa}}/''Vu Doh'', \"[[Harpoon]] Ditch\"), a 4th- or {{nowrap|5th-century}} [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] name for the mouth of [[Suzhou Creek]] when it was the main conduit into the ocean.<ref name=\"Shenhu Origin\">{{cite web |url = http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node2314/node3766/node3767/node3768/index.html |script-title=zh:\"\u7533\",\"\u6caa\"\u7684\u7531\u6765 |publisher=Shanghai Municipal People's Government |language=zh-Hans |access-date=11 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416003831/http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node2314/node3766/node3767/node3768/index.html |archive-date=16 April 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgs.gzjd.gov.cn/nsyycms/u/cms/www/201310/141301475hqv.pdf|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u673a\u52a8\u8f66\u53f7\u724c|trans-title=License plate of motor vehicle of the People's Republic of China|date=28 September 2007|access-date=29 September 2019|publisher=[[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]]|language=zh-cn|page=14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503024552/http://www.gzjd.gov.cn/nsyycms/u/cms/www/201310/141301475hqv.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n=== Alternative names ===\n{{zh|c={{linktext|\u7533}} |labels=no}} (''Sh\u0113n'') or {{zh|c={{linktext|\u7533|\u57ce}} |labels=no}} (''Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng'', \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from [[Lord Chunshen]], a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]], whose [[fief]] included modern Shanghai.<ref name=\"Shenhu Origin\" /> Shanghainese sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as [[Shanghai Shenhua F.C.]] and ''[[Shen Bao]]''.\n\n{{zh|s={{linktext|\u534e|\u4ead}} |labels=no}}{{Efn|{{zh|t=\u83ef\u4ead}}|name=|group=}} (''Hu\u00e1t\u00edng'') was another early name for Shanghai.
