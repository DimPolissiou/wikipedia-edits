The engagement took place from 5 February to 1 April 1941, between a mixed Italian army of regular and colonial troops and British troops (mostly from Sudan and British India) and [[Free French]] forces. The town of [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], in the colony of [[Italian East Africa]], was of tactical importance to both sides in 1941. The road and railway through Keren were the main routes to the colonial capital at [[Asmara]] and the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Massawa]], which surrendered to the British after the battle.\n\n==Background==\n===Eritrea===\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|[[Italian East Africa]], May 1940, before the conquest of [[British Somaliland]]]]\nColonised by the Italians in 1885, [[Italian Eritrea]] was used as a staging ground for Italian invasions of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the First and Second Italo-Abyssinian Wars. The second invasion began in 1935 and Ethiopia fell in 1936. Ethiopia, [[Italian Somaliland]] and Eritrea were combined to form [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'') part of the [[Italian Empire]]. Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] ordered his troops to capture the [[British Somaliland]] and border towns in the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[British Kenya|Kenya]].\n\nEritrea has three climate zones, a coastal region, with a sandy plain and low scrub running inland for {{cvt|10|\u2013|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} in the east with elevations of up to {{cvt|1650|ft|m|disp=flip}}, which is hot and humid for most of the year, with June, September and October the hottest months.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=17}}\n\nAt Massawa the average temperature is {{cvt|31|C}} and in summer can reach {{cvt|49|C}} in the shade. Most rain falls in the summer monsoon, with occasional showers in the winter. In the escarpments and valleys, the climate is temperate with only summer monsoon rains, except close to the coast, where there is some winter rain; May is the hottest month. Towards the high plateau, the elevation rises steeply to {{cvt|6000|ft|m|disp=flip}}, with some peaks {{cvt|10000|ft|m|disp=flip}} high and the ground declines to the west. It is cooler, with the monsoon from June to September and light rain in April and May. The temperature is highest during the dry season from November to April and above {{cvt|8500|ft|m|disp=flip}}, sub-alpine temperatures are found.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=17}} The high ground continues into Northern Ethiopia, where the mountains and ravines make ideal defensive terrain.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=173}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n{{main|Middle East Command}}\n\nThe British responded by building up a force of more than two [[division (military)|divisions]] in Sudan and three in Kenya by early February 1941. The Sudan-based forces\u2014commanded by Lieutenant-General [[William Platt]] and under the command of General [[Archibald Wavell]] (Commander-in-Chief British [[Middle East Command]])\u2014had invaded Eritrea through [[Kassala]] on 18 January and by 1 February had captured [[Agordat]] about {{cvt|100|mi|km|disp=flip}} further east.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=148\u2013162}}\n\n===Italian Invasion of Sudan===\n{{main|Capture of Kassala}}\n\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan shared a {{cvt|1000|mi|km|disp=flip}} border with the AOI, and on 4 July 1940, was invaded by an Italian force of about {{nowrap|6,500 men}} from Eritrea, which advanced on a railway junction at [[Kassala]] and forced the British garrison of {{nowrap|320 men}} of the SDF and some local police to retire, after inflicting casualties of {{nowrap|43 killed}} and {{nowrap|114 wounded}} for ten casualties.{{sfn|Schreiber|1995|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=72}} The Italians also drove a platoon of No 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps (EAC) of the SDF, from the small fort at [[Gallabat]], just over the border from [[Metemma]], about {{cvt|320|km}} south of Kassala and took the villages of [[Qays\u0101n, Q\u0113ssan|Qays\u0101n]], [[Kurmuk]] and Dumbode on the [[Blue Nile]]. From there the Italians ventured no further into Sudan, owing to lack of fuel. They proceeded to fortify Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strong-points, later establishing a brigade-strong garrison. The Italians were disappointed to find no strong anti-British sentiment among the native population.{{sfn|Schreiber|1995|p=295}}{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===Keren===\n[[File:Map Eritrean Campaign 1941-en.svg|thumb|The advance of Platt's forces into Eritrea]]\n[[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] was not [[fortification|fortified]] but it is surrounded on most sides by a jumble of steep granite mountains and sharp ridges which gave the defending forces on the high ground a distinct advantage. ontrol of the mountains provided the Italian artillery with [[Forward observer|perfect observation]] of an attack. The narrow Dongolaas Gorge at {{coord|15|45|34|N|38|25|16.8|E|name=Dongolaas Gorge|type:landmark}} through which the road and railway from Agordat to Keren passed was dominated on the south eastern side by the [[massif]] of Mount Zeban and Mount Falestoh on which stood the imposing defences of Fort Dologorodoc at {{coord|15|45|14.9|N|38|25|30.6|E|name=Fort Dologorodoc|type:landmark}}. The other side of the gorge was commanded by the mass of Mount Sanchil with a saddle of secondary summits, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and Flat Top stretching north-westwards toward Mount Sammana. In front of the Sanchil feature on its south western side was a secondary ridge, feature 1616, which became known as Cameron Ridge, overlooking the Ascidera Valley and the railway line.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=53}}\n\n===Northern front===\nThe 5th Indian Infantry Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940 and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade was placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade ([[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]]) were sent to Gedaref with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of {{cvt|320|km}}. [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Gazelle Force]] (Colonel [[Frank Messervy]]) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=160}} Late on 30 January, Gazelle Force was ordered to make pursuit of the enemy retreating down the road to Keren.\n\nAs the British forces approached Keren, Brigadier-General [[Nicolangelo Carnimeo]], commander of the [[Italian 2nd Eritrean Division|2nd Eritrean Division]] and the X Territorial Defence Command, drew in his 5th and 44th Colonial Brigades from positions to the north. 42nd Brigade had reached Keren from Agordat almost intact, and the 2nd Brigade\u2014which had suffered greater casualties there\u2014was reforming. The 11th Regiment of the Savoia Grenadiers and the Alpini battalion of the 10th Savoia Grenadiers had just arrived after a three-day non-stop truck journey from Addis Ababa while the 11th Colonial Brigade was also in place, having previously been called from reserve in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, the 6th Brigade\u2014having relinquished its responsibilities at Metemma\u2014was also making its way to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n==Battle==\n{{see also|Order of battle, Keren 1941}}\n\n===5\u20138 February===\n[[File:BattleofKerenMap1941-en.svg|thumb|Sketch map of the Keren battlefield (not to scale)]]\nAt 08:00 on 1 February 1941, ''Gazelle Force'' was held up in crossing the [[Barka River|Baraka River]] about {{cvt|60|km|mi|-1}} from Keren, where the ''Ponte Mussolini'' had been blown and the approaches to the river mined.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=52}} By noon on 2 February, they were across the river and winding up the Ascidera Valley, until brought to a halt at the Dongolaas Gorge, about {{cvt|6|km|mi|0}} from Keren, where the road had been blocked by the Italians, who blew down the overhanging crags, to fill the gorge with boulders and rocks.\n\nThe [[11th Indian Infantry Brigade]], (4th Indian Division) arrived on 3 February, [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the next day and attacked on the left of the gorge on 5 February. The 2nd [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] fought their way to the top of the ridge called feature 1616, in front of Sanchil and on the night of 6/7 February, the 3/[[14th Punjab Regiment]] passed through and advanced onto Brig's Peak. The Indians were counter-attacked by elements of the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division \"Granatieri di Savoia\"]] (Grenadiers of Savoy) who forced them back towards Cameron Ridge, which was being consolidated by [[104th Wellesley's Rifles|(Wellesley's)]] the 1st Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]]. The ridge was overlooked in front by Sanchil, to the left by Mount Sammana and from behind by other mountains along the Ascidera Valley. The Cameron Highlanders and Rajputana Rifles clung on, despite frequent attacks and having to carry food, water and ammunition up hill for {{cvt|500|m|ft|-2}}, across exposed terrain.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nBy 6 February, the [[5th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (4th Indian Division) had arrived and next day, attacked the Dologorodoc feature east of the gorge, looping right through the Scescilembi Valley (known as Happy Valley) and then attacking from the south-east toward Acqua [[Col]] joining Mount Zelele and Mount Falestoh. On the night of 7 February, a company of [[123rd Outram's Rifles|(Outram's)]] the 4th Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]] took the col until 4:30&nbsp;am, when they ran out of ammunition and were driven back to a lower feature. On 8 February, having spent most of the day under heavy artillery and mortar fire, they withdrew to their jumping-off positions.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n===10\u201313 February===\nOn the afternoon of 10 February, 3/[[1st Punjab Regiment]] attacked Brig's Peak and by the morning of 11 February were on top of Sanchil. The need for men to handle and carry supplies, ammunition and wounded meant there were only two [[platoon]]s to hold the feature.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}} Having endured heavy shelling and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire throughout the day, they were forced off Sanchil and Brig's Peak with heavy casualties by a determined counter-attack from the Savoia Grenadiers. Once again the attackers were thrown onto desperate defence on Cameron Ridge. Despite the failure by the Punjabis to hold the important observation posts on Sanchil, the renewed attack on Acqua Col\u2014planned for 12 February\u2014went ahead. The [[29th Indian Infantry Brigade]] of the [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] was brought up from Barentu and put under command of Major-General [[Beresford-Peirse]] (4th Indian Infantry Division) and held in readiness to exploit a break-through. At 05:30, supported by an intensive artillery barrage, the 4/6th Rajputana Rifles once again led the way. [[Richhpal Ram]] was less fortunate and having gained the crest, had a foot blown off and shortly thereafter was mortally wounded. He was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]] for his exploits on the Col. The 4/[[11th Sikh Regiment]] were pushing up around the side of Acqua Col but the attack could not be carried through, lacking the extra impact that might have come from the 2/[[5th Mahratta Light Infantry]] which had been diverted to reinforce the hard-pressed defences on Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}}\n\nPlatt decided to pause, regroup and train before making a further attempt at Keren. To release road transport to bring forward supplies for a new attack, the 5th Indian Infantry Division returned to Kessala where it could be maintained by the railhead for a period of intensive training until preparations were complete and the division could be brought forward again for the offensive. [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|Skinners Horse]] and most of the Motor Machine Gun companies assembled in front of Arressa and Adi Ugri to pose a threat to the Italian line of reinforcement to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=42}} From the north, [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Briggsforce]], comprising two battalions from the [[7th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Harold Briggs]]) of the 4th Indian Infantry Division and two [[Free French]] battalions. After crossing the border into Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, Briggsforce had captured Karora and then moved south to take Kubkub. In late February, Marching Battalion n\u00ba 3 of the Free French Orient Brigade captured Kubkub, becoming the first French unit to engage in combat against Axis forces since the Fall of France. On 1 March, Briggsforce had broken through the Mescelit pass some {{cvt|24|km}} north-east of Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=43}} Briggsforce provided a third potential direction of attack to occupy the Keren defenders and created a threat to [[Massawa]] on the coast, pinning valuable reserves there.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}\n\n====Plan of attack====\n[[File:Vickers Wellesley Mk I of No. 47 Squadron on a bombing mission to Keren, Eritrea, 2 April 1941.

The Keren defences had been reinforced with the arrival of 6th Colonial Brigade from Metemma and also the 11th Blackshirt Battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers. The defenders now totalled 25,000 facing an attacking force which had grown to more than 13,000.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}} Beresford-Pierce would launch the 11th Indian Brigade, expanded to five battalions under command, against the peaks of the Sanchil mass and 5th Brigade against Mount Sammana on the left of his front. On the 5th Division front, the Italian reinforcements on Dologorodoc meant Happy Valley was dominated by the defenders and the attackers' artillery had had to be withdrawn from their forward positions in the valley to safer locations. Without the artillery, it was no longer considered practical to continue the [[flanking manoeuvre|flanking attack]] through Acqua Col to threaten the Dologorodoc [[supply lines|lines of supply]]. Instead, Major-General [[Lewis Heath]] determined that Fort Dologorodoc would be the key objective for his Indian 5th Infantry Division. Gaining the fort would not only give the attacking forces the artillery observation post to direct fire on both sides of the gorge but would expose the reverse slopes of the Dologorodoc mass (which had been immune to his artillery fire and so a haven to the defenders for supplies and reserves) to direct fire from the fort.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}}\n\nThe two offensives were planned to take place one after the other on 15 March so that the full force's artillery could be employed for the preliminary bombardment of them both. At the final meeting on 14 March with his commanders Platt said,\n\n{{quote|Do not let anybody think this is going to be a walkover. It is not.

That night, the battle ebbed and flowed with attack and counter-attack inflicting very heavy casualties on both sides.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=57}} On the right, 5th Indian Infantry Division launched its attack on the Dologorodoc feature at 10:30 on 15 March. The 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] led the attack on the lower features (\"Pimple\" and \"Pinnacle\") but made no progress in the daylight because of fire from the overlooking Sanchil peak, where the Italian defenders had defeated the 11th Brigade assault. They were [[pinned down]], suffering casualties and without supply until darkness provided the opportunity to withdraw.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}} By moonlight that evening, the attack on Dologorodoc was taken up by 9th Brigade, now commanded by the recently promoted Brigadier Messervy. Heath and Messervy planned a near two battalion attack on ''Pimple'' and ''Pinnacle'', with a third battalion ready to pass through and attack the fort. The capture of Pinnacle that night by the 3/5th Mahratta Light Infantry led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Denys Whitehorn Reid|Denys Reid]] (with the 3/[[12th Frontier Force Regiment]] less two companies under command to take ''Pimple''),\n\n{{quote|one of the outstanding small actions of World War II, decisive in its results and formidable in its achievement...

The defences at the fort were depleted and during the counter-attack, the 2nd [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] made their way over a seemingly impossible knife-edge to surprise the defenders of the fort. The fort was captured after a determined defence by 06:30 with 40 prisoners taken.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}} Finally, Platt had the artillery observation point so greatly needed.\n\nThrough 16 March, the Italians counter-attacked while the 29th Brigade made an unsuccessful attack in the evening to Falestoh and Zeban, which was abandoned after dark on 17 March after a day exposed to blistering heat, fierce fighting and no supply.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}} For the next ten days, the 5th Indian Division position at Fort Dologorodoc\u2014exposed to the enemy on three sides\u2014was subject to intense fighting, as the Italians threw in more new units but failed to regain the position.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}}\n\nOn the Sanchil feature, the 4th Indian Division, with the [[10th Indian Infantry Brigade]] under command, continued to batter away to no avail. On the night of 17/18 March, having suffered many casualties, they withdrew from the slopes of Sanchil and Brig's Peak and the 10th Brigade returned to the 5th Indian Division to reform. The 4th Indian Division continued to hold Hog's Back and Flat Top. Over the next three days, the Italian forces continued to counter-attacks on both sides of the gorge involving desperate, often hand to hand, fighting.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=60}}\n\n[[File:Indian-field-gun-keren.jpg|thumb|British [[QF 18-pounder gun#Second World War|18-pounder]] gun in action at the Battle of Keren]]\n\nPlatt decided to regroup and concentrate his forces before attacking again and disbanded Gazelle Force (with Messervy taking over the 9th Indian Brigade) and brought the 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had been mopping up at Agordat) to the front. On 1 March his command was expanded by the arrival of Briggs Force from the north. Although it lacked the artillery for a big attack, Briggs Force drew off a significant part of the Keren garrison. This aided Platt's main offensive, which was being launched from the south-west. Briggs Force also menaced Massawa to the east, obliging the Italians to maintain a reserve on the coast.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=433\u2013437}}\n\nPlatt and his commanders decided that the supreme attack should be made through the Dongolaas Gorge. Heath felt that, because of its physical defensive advantages, the Italians might have neglected its defence. On the nights of 16/17 and 17/18 March, escorted engineers reconnoitred the road block and attempted to make a start to clear it. This failed because of fire from the Italian lines. The information led Heath to decide that the key to the gorge was not Sanchil but two smaller features (the ''Railway Bumps'') which overlooked the roadblock and could be approached, with much less opposition, along the railway line from the tunnel below Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}\n\nAn attack on the defenders at the head of the gorge was planned to give the [[sapper]]s and miners the 48 hours they needed, free of interference from mortar and [[machine gun]] fire, to clear the road. Heath had to wait until the 10th Indian Brigade had refitted after its mauling on the Sanchil feature. The plan was for the 10th Indian Brigade to advance into the gorge while the 9th Indian Brigade (which was holding the Fort Dologorodoc positions) would move down to take three smaller hills overlooking the far end of the gorge; The 29th Brigade would then attack to take Mount Zeban and Mount Canabai, beyond it to the east, which looked down on Keren and guarded the road to Asmara. [[Thomas Wynford Rees|Thomas \"Pete\" Rees]] was appointed to command the 10th Indian Brigade and his predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Bernard Campbell Fletcher|Bernard Fletcher]] was released to form ''Fletcher Force'', a mobile force comprising the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|Central India Horse]] and six [[Matilda II]] tanks, which would be used to exploit the break-through in the gorge and move rapidly into the defenders' rear position to attack their reserves.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}\n\nOn 24 March, diversionary attacks were made on Sanchil and just before midnight, the West Yorkshires and the 3/5th Mahrattas in Fort Dologorodoc moved down to take the lower hills overlooking the gorge. The West Yorkshires were able to take their hill unopposed but the Mahrattas met dug-in Italian opposition. By 07:30 the three hills were taken and the defences on the south eastern side of the gorge silenced.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}\n\nAt 03:00 on 25 March, the 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] and the 4/[[10th Baluch Regiment]] on their right, advanced from the shelter of the railway tunnel, previously cleared by the sappers and miners, up the gorge. A hundred-gun artillery bombardment was raining down on the ridge on Sanchil above (to suppress any defensive fire from this dominating height) and the attack in the gorge achieved surprise, the defenders concentrating on Sanchil. The 3/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] then advanced between the Baluchis and the West Yorkshires to clear the gorge. By 05:30, the railway bumps and most of the objectives were captured and the defenders no longer held positions from which to direct fire into the gorge below.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}}\n\nThe sappers and miners laboured on the road while the battles on the Sanchil and Dologorodoc features continued. By midday on 26 March, they had repaired the road through the gorge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}} In the early hours of 27 March, the British artillery turned onto Zeban and Falstoh. The 29th Brigade passed through the 9th Indian Brigade to attack at 04:30 but found the defenders had withdrawn and were able to occupy Falestoh Ridge and the two Zeban summits unopposed.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}} The Italian position was untenable and by first light the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was reporting their withdrawal along the road from Keren to Asmara. The defenders on the Sanchil ridge were less fortunate and the Savoia Grenadiers and Bersaglieri were cut off and with no option but surrender. ''Fletcher Force'' was in Keren by 10:30 and was then sent in pursuit along the Asmara road.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Keren Battlefield 008.jpg|thumb|right|Graves of unknown [[Eritrean Ascari]]s killed in 1941 during the Battle of Keren]]\n\n[[File:Ethiopian camel troops.jpg|thumb|Ethiopians transporting supplies by camel through vegetation, 22 January 1941 (Photographer: FE Palmer, No 1 Army Film & Photographic Unit).]]\n\nFrom 27 March 1941, the route to Asmara and Massawa was open and Wavell was able to order the 4th Indian Division move to Port Sudan for transport back to [[Egypt]].

In front of the Sanchil feature on its south western side was a secondary ridge, feature 1616, which became known as Cameron Ridge, overlooking the Ascidera Valley and the railway line.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=53}}\n\n===Northern front===\nThe 5th Indian Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940 and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade was placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade ([[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]]) were sent to Gedaref with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of {{cvt|320|km}}. [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Gazelle Force]] (Colonel [[Frank Messervy]]) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=160}} Late on 30 January, Gazelle Force was ordered to make pursuit of the enemy retreating down the road to Keren.\n\nAs the British forces approached Keren, Brigadier-General [[Nicolangelo Carnimeo]], commander of the [[Italian 2nd Eritrean Division|2nd Eritrean Division]] and the X Territorial Defence Command, drew in his 5th and 44th Colonial Brigades from positions to the north. 42nd Brigade had reached Keren from Agordat almost intact, and the 2nd Brigade\u2014which had suffered greater casualties there\u2014was reforming. The 11th Regiment of the Savoia Grenadiers and the Alpini battalion of the 10th Savoia Grenadiers had just arrived after a three-day non-stop truck journey from Addis Ababa while the 11th Colonial Brigade was also in place, having previously been called from reserve in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, the 6th Brigade\u2014having relinquished its responsibilities at Metemma\u2014was also making its way to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n==Battle==\n{{see also|Order of battle, Keren 1941}}\n\n===5\u20138 February===\n[[File:BattleofKerenMap1941-en.svg|thumb|Sketch map of the Keren battlefield (not to scale)]]\nAt 08:00 on 1 February 1941, ''Gazelle Force'' was held up in crossing the [[Barka River|Baraka River]] about {{cvt|60|km|mi|-1}} from Keren, where the ''Ponte Mussolini'' had been blown and the approaches to the river mined.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=52}} By noon on 2 February, they were across the river and winding up the Ascidera Valley, until brought to a halt at the Dongolaas Gorge, about {{cvt|6|km|mi|0}} from Keren, where the road had been blocked by the Italians, who blew down the overhanging crags, to fill the gorge with boulders and rocks.\n\nThe [[11th Indian Infantry Brigade]], (4th Indian Division) arrived on 3 February, [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the next day and attacked on the left of the gorge on 5 February. The 2nd [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] fought their way to the top of the ridge called feature 1616, in front of Sanchil and on the night of 6/7 February, the 3/[[14th Punjab Regiment]] passed through and advanced onto Brig's Peak. The Indians were counter-attacked by elements of the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] (Grenadiers of Savoy) who forced them back towards Cameron Ridge, which was being consolidated by [[104th Wellesley's Rifles|(Wellesley's)]] the 1st Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]]. The ridge was overlooked in front by Sanchil, to the left by Mount Sammana and from behind by other mountains along the Ascidera Valley. The Cameron Highlanders and Rajputana Rifles clung on, despite frequent attacks and having to carry food, water and ammunition up hill for {{cvt|500|m|ft|-2}}, across exposed terrain.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nBy 6 February, the [[5th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (4th Indian Division) had arrived and next day, attacked the Dologorodoc feature east of the gorge, looping right through the Scescilembi Valley (known as Happy Valley) and then attacking from the south-east toward Acqua [[Col]] joining Mount Zelele and Mount Falestoh. On the night of 7 February, a company of [[123rd Outram's Rifles|(Outram's)]] the 4th Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]] took the col until 4:30&nbsp;am, when they ran out of ammunition and were driven back to a lower feature.

The need for men to handle and carry supplies, ammunition and wounded meant there were only two [[platoon]]s to hold the feature.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}} Having endured heavy shelling and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire throughout the day, they were forced off Sanchil and Brig's Peak with heavy casualties by a determined counter-attack from the Savoia Grenadiers. Once again the attackers were thrown onto desperate defence on Cameron Ridge. Despite the failure by the Punjabis to hold the important observation posts on Sanchil, the renewed attack on Acqua Col\u2014planned for 12 February\u2014went ahead. The [[29th Indian Infantry Brigade]] of the [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] was brought up from Barentu and put under command of Major-General [[Beresford-Peirse]] (4th Indian Infantry Division) and held in readiness to exploit a break-through. At 05:30, supported by an intensive artillery barrage, the 4/6th Rajputana Rifles once again led the way. [[Richhpal Ram]] was less fortunate and having gained the crest, had a foot blown off and shortly thereafter was mortally wounded. He was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]] for his exploits on the Col. The 4/[[11th Sikh Regiment]] were pushing up around the side of Acqua Col but the attack could not be carried through, lacking the extra impact that might have come from the 2/[[5th Mahratta Light Infantry]] which had been diverted to reinforce the hard-pressed defences on Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}}\n\nPlatt decided to pause, regroup and train before making a further attempt at Keren. To release road transport to bring forward supplies for a new attack, the 5th Indian Infantry Division returned to Kessala where it could be maintained by the railhead for a period of intensive training until preparations were complete and the division could be brought forward again for the offensive. [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|Skinners Horse]] and most of the Motor Machine Gun companies assembled in front of Arressa and Adi Ugri to pose a threat to the Italian line of reinforcement to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=42}} From the north, [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Briggsforce]], comprising two battalions from the [[7th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Harold Briggs]]) of the 4th Indian Infantry Division and two [[Free French]] battalions. After crossing the border into Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, Briggsforce had captured Karora and then moved south to take Kubkub. In late February, Marching Battalion n\u00ba 3 of the Free French Orient Brigade captured Kubkub, becoming the first French unit to engage in combat against Axis forces since the Fall of France. On 1 March, Briggsforce had broken through the Mescelit pass some {{cvt|24|km}} north-east of Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=43}} Briggsforce provided a third potential direction of attack to occupy the Keren defenders and created a threat to [[Massawa]] on the coast, pinning valuable reserves there.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}\n\n====Plan of attack====\n[[File:Vickers Wellesley Mk I of No. 47 Squadron on a bombing mission to Keren, Eritrea, 2 April 1941.

The Keren defences had been reinforced with the arrival of 6th Colonial Brigade from Metemma and also the 11th Blackshirt Battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers. The defenders now totalled 25,000 facing an attacking force which had grown to more than 13,000.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}} Beresford-Pierce would launch the 11th Indian Brigade, expanded to five battalions under command, against the peaks of the Sanchil mass and 5th Brigade against Mount Sammana on the left of his front. On the 5th Division front, the Italian reinforcements on Dologorodoc meant Happy Valley was dominated by the defenders and the attackers' artillery had had to be withdrawn from their forward positions in the valley to safer locations. Without the artillery, it was no longer considered practical to continue the [[flanking manoeuvre|flanking attack]] through Acqua Col to threaten the Dologorodoc [[supply lines|lines of supply]]. Instead, Major-General [[Lewis Heath]] determined that Fort Dologorodoc would be the key objective for his Indian 5th Infantry Division. Gaining the fort would not only give the attacking forces the artillery observation post to direct fire on both sides of the gorge but would expose the reverse slopes of the Dologorodoc mass (which had been immune to his artillery fire and so a haven to the defenders for supplies and reserves) to direct fire from the fort.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}}\n\nThe two offensives were planned to take place one after the other on 15 March so that the full force's artillery could be employed for the preliminary bombardment of them both. At the final meeting on 14 March with his commanders Platt said,\n\n{{quote|Do not let anybody think this is going to be a walkover. It is not. It is going to be a bloody battle: a bloody battle against both enemy and ground. It will be won by the side which lasts longest. I know you will last longer than they do.

That night, the battle ebbed and flowed with attack and counter-attack inflicting very heavy casualties on both sides.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=57}} On the right, 5th Indian Infantry Division launched its attack on the Dologorodoc feature at 10:30 on 15 March. The 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] led the attack on the lower features (\"Pimple\" and \"Pinnacle\") but made no progress in the daylight because of fire from the overlooking Sanchil peak, where the Italian defenders had defeated the 11th Brigade assault. They were [[pinned down]], suffering casualties and without supply until darkness provided the opportunity to withdraw.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}} By moonlight that evening, the attack on Dologorodoc was taken up by 9th Brigade, now commanded by the recently promoted Brigadier Messervy. Heath and Messervy planned a near two battalion attack on ''Pimple'' and ''Pinnacle'', with a third battalion ready to pass through and attack the fort. The capture of Pinnacle that night by the 3/5th Mahratta Light Infantry led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Denys Whitehorn Reid|Denys Reid]] (with the 3/[[12th Frontier Force Regiment]] less two companies under command to take ''Pimple''),\n\n{{quote|one of the outstanding small actions of World War II, decisive in its results and formidable in its achievement...

At the top, when he saw the victors, he was overcome by the splendour of their feat and his combative amber eyes filled with tears.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=58}}}}\n\nIn the early hours of 16 March, the defenders of Fort Dologorodoc counter-attacked ''Pinnacle'' and ''Pimple'' for several hours. The defences at the fort were depleted and during the counter-attack, the 2nd [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] made their way over a seemingly impossible knife-edge to surprise the defenders of the fort. The fort was captured after a determined defence by 06:30 with 40 prisoners taken.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}} Finally, Platt had the artillery observation point so greatly needed.\n\nThrough 16 March, the Italians counter-attacked while the 29th Brigade made an unsuccessful attack in the evening to Falestoh and Zeban, which was abandoned after dark on 17 March after a day exposed to blistering heat, fierce fighting and no supply.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a74}} For the next ten days, the 5th Indian Division position at Fort Dologorodoc\u2014exposed to the enemy on three sides\u2014was subject to intense fighting, as the Italians threw in more new units but failed to regain the position.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}}\n\nOn the Sanchil feature, the 4th Indian Division, with the [[10th Indian Infantry Brigade]] under command, continued to batter away to no avail. On the night of 17/18 March, having suffered many casualties, they withdrew from the slopes of Sanchil and Brig's Peak and the 10th Brigade returned to the 5th Indian Division to reform. The 4th Indian Division continued to hold Hog's Back and Flat Top. Over the next three days, the Italian forces continued to counter-attacks on both sides of the gorge involving desperate, often hand to hand, fighting.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=60}}\n\n[[File:Indian-field-gun-keren.jpg|thumb|British [[QF 18-pounder gun#Second World War|18-pounder]] gun in action at the Battle of Keren]]\n\nPlatt decided to regroup and concentrate his forces before attacking again and disbanded Gazelle Force (with Messervy taking over the 9th Indian Brigade) and brought the 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had been mopping up at Agordat) to the front. On 1 March his command was expanded by the arrival of Briggs Force from the north. Although it lacked the artillery for a big attack, Briggs Force drew off a significant part of the Keren garrison. This aided Platt's main offensive, which was being launched from the south-west. Briggs Force also menaced Massawa to the east, obliging the Italians to maintain a reserve on the coast.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=433\u2013437}}\n\nPlatt and his commanders decided that the supreme attack should be made through the Dongolaas Gorge. Heath felt that, because of its physical defensive advantages, the Italians might have neglected its defence. On the nights of 16/17 and 17/18 March, escorted engineers reconnoitred the road block and attempted to make a start to clear it. This failed because of fire from the Italian lines. The information led Heath to decide that the key to the gorge was not Sanchil but two smaller features (the ''Railway Bumps'') which overlooked the roadblock and could be approached, with much less opposition, along the railway line from the tunnel below Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}\n\nAn attack on the defenders at the head of the gorge was planned to give the [[sapper]]s and miners the 48 hours they needed, free of interference from mortar and [[machine gun]] fire, to clear the road. Heath had to wait until the 10th Indian Brigade had refitted after its mauling on the Sanchil feature. The plan was for the 10th Indian Brigade to advance into the gorge while the 9th Indian Brigade (which was holding the Fort Dologorodoc positions) would move down to take three smaller hills overlooking the far end of the gorge; The 29th Brigade would then attack to take Mount Zeban and Mount Canabai, beyond it to the east, which looked down on Keren and guarded the road to Asmara. [[Thomas Wynford Rees|Thomas \"Pete\" Rees]] was appointed to command the 10th Indian Brigade and his predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Bernard Campbell Fletcher|Bernard Fletcher]] was released to form ''Fletcher Force'', a mobile force comprising the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|Central India Horse]] and six [[Matilda II]] tanks, which would be used to exploit the break-through in the gorge and move rapidly into the defenders' rear position to attack their reserves.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}\n\nOn 24 March, diversionary attacks were made on Sanchil and just before midnight, the West Yorkshires and the 3/5th Mahrattas in Fort Dologorodoc moved down to take the lower hills overlooking the gorge. The West Yorkshires were able to take their hill unopposed but the Mahrattas met dug-in Italian opposition. By 07:30 the three hills were taken and the defences on the south eastern side of the gorge silenced.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}\n\nAt 03:00 on 25 March, the 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] and the 4/[[10th Baluch Regiment]] on their right, advanced from the shelter of the railway tunnel, previously cleared by the sappers and miners, up the gorge. A hundred-gun artillery bombardment was raining down on the ridge on Sanchil above (to suppress any defensive fire from this dominating height) and the attack in the gorge achieved surprise, the defenders concentrating on Sanchil. The 3/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] then advanced between the Baluchis and the West Yorkshires to clear the gorge. By 05:30, the railway bumps and most of the objectives were captured and the defenders no longer held positions from which to direct fire into the gorge below.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}}\n\nThe sappers and miners laboured on the road while the battles on the Sanchil and Dologorodoc features continued. By midday on 26 March, they had repaired the road through the gorge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}} In the early hours of 27 March, the British artillery turned onto Zeban and Falstoh. The 29th Brigade passed through the 9th Indian Brigade to attack at 04:30 but found the defenders had withdrawn and were able to occupy Falestoh Ridge and the two Zeban summits unopposed.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=\u00a75}} The Italian position was untenable and by first light the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was reporting their withdrawal along the road from Keren to Asmara. The defenders on the Sanchil ridge were less fortunate and the Savoia Grenadiers and Bersaglieri were cut off and with no option but surrender.

The French army and the Chadian army fought armed Salafist jihadist groups led by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Ansar Dine. After being defeated in January in the [[Battle of Konna]] and the [[Battle of Diabaly]] , the jihadists abandoned Timbuktu and retreated into the Adrar Tigharghar, a mountain of the Adrar of Ifoghas in northeastern Mali, which has been their sanctuary for years. The French started quickly a pursuit, and they took control of the towns of [[Tessalit]] and [[Aguelhok]] and begun the [[Operation Panther (2013)|operation Panther]] in the Tigharghar. The first clashes erupt on February 18 and are mainly concentrated in the Ametettai Valley. It is caught between two armored columns, one French to the west and another Chadian to the east, while the paratroopers manage to surprise the jihadists by attacking on foot from the north. The valley is taken on March 3 and jihadists begin to gradually abandon the Tigharghar. Excavation missions and some skirmishes, however, continue to take place the following days. The operations cease on March 31. The battle was a turning point in the war, as with the capture of the Tigharghar, the jihadists lose their main sanctuary in the Sahel as well as most of their military arsenal, taken from the Malian army or Libya .<ref name=\"lemonde1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/02/28/dans-les-roches-de-l-adrar-de-tigharghar-une-bataille-cruciale-est-engagee_1840262_3212.html |title=Dans les roches de l\u2019Adrar de Tighargh\u00e2r, une bataille cruciale est engag\u00e9e |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref name=\"lemonde1\"/><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, Paris, Tallandier, 2014, 650 p.</ref><ref name=\"la-croix1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/Monde/La-bataille-de-l-Ametettai-du-general-Barrera-au-Mali-2013-05-28-965781|title=La bataille de l\u2019Ametettai du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Barrera au Mali|first=|last=La-Croix.com|date=28 May 2013|website=La Croix|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Deployment of Franco-Chadian forces in the Kidal region==\nThe evening of January 29, 2013, two Tiger helicopters, a Gazelle and four Puma reach Kidal airport and disembark 30 French soldiers of the CPA-10 and the Penfentenyo commando against MNLA pick-ups. They are followed by three planes landing men of 1 RPIMa and Commando de Montfort. The officer in charge of the French special forces then meets Colonel Mohamed Ag Najem, commander-in-chief of the MNLA's military wing. The French then settle in one of the two military camps of the city and begin their cohabitation with the Tuareg rebels, but unlike [[Gao]], [[Timbuktu]] , and the southern cities where they had been celebrated as liberators, in Kidal the French are seen as the vanguard of the Malian army and the reception of the population is much colder.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 368.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 347-350.</ref> But the goal of the French army, at that time, remains the Tigharghar . From the end of January, the surroundings of the Adrar are bombarded by Rafale. Then on the evening of February 2, a first mass air raid struck the interior of the mountain; four Mirage and four Rafale destroy twelve objectives, supported by three Atlantic, a Harfang drone, an AWACS and Tiger helicopters. The raid mainly targets the area known as the \"Garage\", west of Ametettai, where two BMP-1 armored vehicles have been located, as well as an anti-aircraft battery that was probably inoperative.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 373.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 374-375.</ref> On 1 February, a column of fifteen vehicles of the MNLA and thirty men from the French Special Forces leave Kidal to conduct a joint operation towards the Adrar Tigharghar . The night of 2 to 3, the French and the Tuaregs separate. The first pursued towards the valley of Assamalmal, targeted a few hours earlier by the air strikes. On the spot, the balance sheet is rather thin, no body nor destroyed vehicle is discovered, only a stock of gasoline and some motorcycles were swept by the bombs. The Touareg rebels, meanwhile, take control of the town of Aguelhok where the French come back from Assamalmal to join them. The population, strongly hostile to jihadists, welcomes newcomers. The MNLA captured some suspects and discovered several hundred kilos of ammunition, which he then handed over to the French forces as a sign of goodwill.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 375-377.</ref> France was also seeking the help of Chad's President [[Idriss D\u00e9by]]. He agreed to deploy his army in the Adrar of Ifoghas. On February 3, the first Chadian soldiers arrived in Kidal.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 379-380.</ref> On the night of February 7 to 8, the French special forces lead Operation Takouba on Tessalit. Thirty men from the 13 th RDP, CPA-10, a marine CTLO and the ESNO are parachuted near the airport. They spot a piece of runway where two C-160 Transall can land and land four vehicles and a few more men. From Aguel'hoc, the 30 soldiers - mainly from the 1st RPIMa - who had led the reconnaissance mission in the Assamalmal valley are also moving on Tessalit. In the morning, the special forces make their junction and enter the city without encountering any resistance. A few hours later, from Kidal, the Chadians of General Deby arrived on their turn after passing through Aguel'hoc. Then, 54 soldiers of the 1st RCP are deposited by a third plane. Finally, a sub-GTIA party from Gao, consisting mainly of soldiers from 1 RIMa and forming a column of 90 vehicles, arrives at the scene and invests the military camp of Amachach.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 383-393.</ref> On February 13, the Special Forces made a first foray into the Tigharghar during Operation Tazidert, whose goal is to find a record of the Western hostages held by AQIM. They infiltrate the \"camp of the sands\" and the \"camp of the rocks\", but find no trace of the hostages, or - to their surprise - jihadists. The operation ends on February 16.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 416-419</ref> At the same time, GTIA 4 unfolds in the far north. 400 French soldiers are present in Tessalit on February 12.

On the other hand, Mohamed Lemine Ould El-Hassen, emir of the katiba \"al-Fourghan\", was killed on 24 February by the French special forces during the [[Battle of Timetrine]].<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 451.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/06/16/aqmi-confirme-la-mort-d-abou-zeid_3430983_3212.html |title=AQMI confirme la mort d'Abou Zeid |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Benjamin Roger |url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/167651/politique/visuel-interactif-le-nouvel-organigramme-d-aqmi/ |title=Visuel interactif : le nouvel organigramme d\u2019Aqmi \u2013 |publisher=Jeuneafrique.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lematindz.net/news/11327-iyad-ag-ghaly-lemir-dansar-dine-combat-au-cote-daqmi.html |title=Iyad Ag Ghaly, l\u2019\u00e9mir d\u2019Ansar Dine, combat au c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019AQMI &#124; Actualit\u00e9 |publisher=Lematindz.net |date= |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref> In their radio communications, Islamist insurgents routinely nicknamed the French \"dogs\" and Chadians or helicopters as \"flies\". Excellent fighters with light weapons and with real military training, jihadists were much less skilled with heavy weapons, they include guns, SA-7 ground-to-air missiles or RPG -rocket launcher 29 which they do not know how to use. In comparison with the [[Taliban]] , which the French also faced in [[Afghanistan]], the jihadists of Mali were considered better organized and more tenacious, able to sacrifice themselves while the Afghan insurgents used to flee to limit the losses. In contrast, FDIs were at this time less used than in Afghanistan and were generally poorly manufactured. Some fighters, including child soldiers, have also used drugs to support the shock of fighting, bags will be found near corpses including [[ketamine]], an anesthetic that inhibits fear and erases pain.<ref name=\"autogenerated181\">Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 181.</ref><ref name=\"nouvelobs1\"/><ref>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gout, Lib\u00e9rez Tombouctou !

It included five Puma, three Gazelle and two Tiger helicopters based at Tessalit.\n\nOn the side of the air force, eight Rafale based in N'Djamena and six Mirage 2000D based in Bamako take turns bombing the Tigharghar. For the aerial reconnaissance, Operation Serval mobilized five Atlantique 2 and two Mirage F1 CRs. It also has a Harfang drone 108.\n\nFor the vehicles, 22 AMX-10 RC tanks are engaged in the battle 109 and for the two Caesar artillery of the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment ( 11th RAMa) are deployed and supported by an intelligence battery of 68 African Artillery Regiment ( 68th RAA).\n\nSupply between Gao and Tessalit is provided by a logistic detachment of the 511th Train Regiment ( 511 th RT). The 9th Advanced Surgical Antenna, initially based in S\u00e9var\u00e9 , is deployed in Tessalit. The command of the land operations is assured by Brigadier General Bernard Barrera. A forward command post is established in Tessalit on 12 February . This staff, called the G08, is under the leadership of Colonel Laurent de Bertier de Sauvigny and Xavier Vanden Neste and is made up of about forty to fifty people from the 11th Parachute Brigade, a few officers of the 3rd Light Armored Brigade were soon amalgamated to form a centralized command post. The special forces and the DGSE set up in Kidal where they have a helicopter base, their mission being to locate the jihadist leaders and the hostages. The special forces are autonomous, they act without coordinating with the Serval brigade and do not come under the command of General Barrera. 1,200 French soldiers take part initially in the operation Panth\u00e8re, at the end of the fighting their number is 1,400 . The majority of French soldiers engaged in battle have combat experience, most of them participated in the Afghanistan war, some even in the Gulf War . In addition to Afghanistan, the air forces also took part in Operation Harmattan in Libya . Many infantry have already experienced extreme heat similar to that of Tighargh\u00e2r in the FFDj [[Djibouti]].<ref>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gout, Lib\u00e9rez Tombouctou !

Their numbers changed during the fighting. In February, 800 men took part in the offensive on the Ametettai Valley, in mid-March 1,400 to 1,500 Chadian soldiers were deployed in the Adrar Tighargh\u00e2r. They had more than a hundred armored vehicles, including about ten BMP-1s 128. The elite troops of the presidential guard form the spearhead of this force, 500 of its members have been integrated into the contingent deployed in Mali. Troops of the National Guard and Nomad of Chad (GNNT) and the Close Action Detachment (DAR) were also engaged in the Adrar. Chadian forces in Mali were commanded by General Oumar Bikimo. The second command, initially ensured by General Abderrahmane Youssouf Me\u00efri, passes from mid-February to General Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by Itno, son of President Idriss D\u00e9by. From 2005 to 2010, the Chadian army fought hard during the [[Chadian Civil War (2005\u201310)|Chadian civil war]]. Its soldiers, most of whom are of Zaghawa ethnicity, are accustomed to the climate and fighting in the desert and are considered to be by far the most experienced and seasoned African forces deployed in Mali.<ref name=\"lavoixdunord1\">{{cite web|url=http://defense.blogs.lavoixdunord.fr/archive/2013/03/05/au-mali-le-tchad-montre-son-ambition.html |title=Au Mali, le Tchad montre son ambition : D\u00e9fense globale |publisher=Defense.blogs.lavoixdunord.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/Monde/Un-cinquieme-soldat-francais-tue-au-Mali-par-un-engin-explosif-_NG_-2013-03-17-921798|title=Un cinqui\u00e8me soldat fran\u00e7ais tu\u00e9 au Mali par un engin explosif|first=|last=La-Croix.com|date=17 March 2013|website=La Croix|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Alexandre-Van-Dooren-5e-mort-francais-au-Mali-230390 |title=Mali.

The objective was to find the forces of AQIM and Ansar Dine, as the army had knowledge that jihadists were present in the Tighargh\u00e2r but did not know what their defense system and the areas they intend to protect as a priority. The operation begins with a reconnaissance mission conducted by GTIA 4 on In Taghlit, a village used by jihadists to stock up, in the Tibeggatine Valley, west of the Ametettai Valley.

They found only a few unarmed men who all say that the jihadists had fled for a dozen days. The paratroopers then go to a nearby wadi and discover a first abandoned logistic depot. They unearth trucks filled with shells, a ton of food, telephones, an engine, gas drums and a large generator. In the afternoon, the French pushed their recognition to the village of Tabankort and camped there to spend the night. The next morning, they divided into two groups. The first, consisting of two platoons of porpoises goes north on the village of Abancko where intelligence suspects the presence of an ammunition depot. The soldiers meet an old man on the spot who guides them to a stockpile of shells that the jihadists had taken over the Malian army after the [[Battle of Tessalit]].  The second group headed for the area called the \"Garage\" bombed by aviation on February 2. Coming from the west, the French stop in front of two rocky mounds, about forty meters high, between which a vehicular passage runs eastward. Veteran officers who fought in Afghanistan and Tuareg guides suspect an ambush and the column is moving cautiously. Around 9 am, the leading vehicles were attacked by a jihadists ambush at 300 meters. A first group of a dozen fighters is located in a green zone a little further north. The soldiers retreat, take cover and half an hour later the Mirage 2000 D intervene and destroy a machine gun nest. The three AMX-10 RC tanks then take control of the neck between the two mounds and open fire with their 105&nbsp;mm guns. Despite the intensity of the fire, the jihadists do not hesitate to move short in front of the tanks, they send some rockets with RPG-7, but the range is too fair. As for the tanks, they fire with thirty explosive shells.<ref name=\"autogenerated422\"/><ref name=\"Bernard Barrera 2013, p. 155-160\">Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 155-160.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/><ref name=\"la-croix1\"/> On their side, the paratroop legionaries of the 2nd REP attack the mound on the right with the aim of controlling the dominant position and to prevent the jihadists from overflowing from the south.

Returning from Abancko, the porpoises of 1st RIMa join the fight from the north. Then, at 10:45, a Mirage drops a GBU on the counterpoise. In the south, the jihadists were contained. The planes remained permanently on zone, supplied by an American tanker. Other Mirage 2000 D, then Rafale, a Puma helicopter loaded with ammunition and finally, at the end of the afternoon, two Tiger helicopters arrive on the scene.

Porpoises the 1 st RIMa fold again and hold their area for six days without being attacked. After the fighting on 19 and 20 February and the fierce resistance of the jihadists, the French staff is now convinced that the Ametettai Valley is the heart of the AQIM device in the Adrar. From the beginning of the fighting, the intelligence intercepted dozens of calls by satellite phones or mobile phones from the valley that had remained silent until then. The French army had \"founded the enemy\" and it could now prepare for the offensive. After crossing the border between Niger and Mali at the beginning of the month, the GTIA 3 leaves Gao on February 20, and arrives in the Adrar of the Ifoghas two days later. 1800 French soldiers are present at Tessalit.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Mali-La-Legion-dans-l-antre-d-Aqmi-229837 |title=Mali.

Coming from Kidal, the second column led by General Bikimo arrived from the south. The two forces make their junction east of the Adrar.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 422.</ref> The February 22, after a few days, Chadian troops reached the eastern entrance to the Amettetai valley. Unlike the French who had advanced cautiously in the Tibeggatine Valley, Chadians were attacking in force. Shortly after 11 am, they clash with jihadists. Clashes broke out on several points of the wadi, but the bloodiest fighting took place on a hill, north of the entrance to the valley. The Chadians were launching a real charge. Many fall under the fire of jihadists entrenched in the caves and behind the rocks. Despite the losses the soldiers are \"euphoric\" and \"galvanized\", one of them, the commander Moussa, will declare: \"The terrorists faced us. They say they are crazy. We too wanted to be more crazy than them \". The clashes were confusing, some soldiers chased after jihadists who retreated to a neighboring wadi, other Islamists ambushed the Chadians, by Chadians overtake them and then shoot them in the back. The fighters are too entangled and the French air force can not intervene. Chadians, however, form a line against the main Islamist position and deliver heavy fire with guns and machine guns. The jihadists repel the first assault but several others follow and the Chadians eventually reach the caves where the last insurgents deliver a desperate resistance. The fighters clash in hand-to-hand combat, a Chadian soldier declares: \"In the caves, nothing was seen. We do not have lamps. We were shooting everywhere, hoping to kill them, then we went home. \" Jihadists pretend to surrender before blowing themselves up, killing several soldiers.

No offensive was launched on February 23.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 447.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 172</ref> On 24 February, Brigadier General Barrera left Gao and headed in Tessalit to conduct the next round of operations. The general of division Gregory de Saint-Quentin, chief of the operation Serval, entrusts to him the command of the terrestrial operations in the Adrar Tigharghar. The French army then planned its offensive, it plans to resume the attack on the west with the GTIA 3 and to surprise the jihadists by advancing the GTIA 4 north, on foot, through the mountainous terrain. According to General Barrera's war notes, the plan was partly inspired by the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]] and [[Operation Diadem]]. However, the French-Chadian forces were not numerous enough to cover the south. The zone of the south is then left to the surveillance of air forces. On the night of February 25 to 26, Operation Panther III begins. The GTIA 4 leaves Tessalit, more than 500 parachutists are loadeded on all available vehicles: VAB, GBC 180 trucks and even TRM 10000. The convoy was heading east for 80 kilometers. Around 3 pm, the parachutists were disembarked and deployed about ten kilometers north of the Ametettai. Colonel Desmeulles places the 1st RIMa tank platoon in the west, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP in the center and the company of the 1st RCP in the east. Two other companies of the 2nd REP are behind the leading units. For the parachutists, a long and trying walk begins, each soldier carries about 50 kilos of water, food and equipment in heat that can exceed 50 degrees. Every night, the troop must be refueled by helicopters, mainly in water. The first day, the progression is slower than expected, the GTIA 4 advance one kilometer and a half. For their part, armored GTIA 3 commanded by Colonel Gougeon set in motion at 3 am west of the Ametettai. Two Caesars from Gao also reach the entrance of the valley at dawn, just arrived they open fire to cover the advance of the column. After 5 kilometers of road, the GTIA 3 arrives at the scene of the fight of 19 February but no jihadist appears. The French continue their progression and reach the crests of Sontai and Puebla. This time the jihadists were present, dozens of fighters open fire, sometimes within 100 meters of the French. Some are ambushed at the top of the ridges, others on the counterpoise or in a green zone below, entrenched in huts or hidden in holes<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 180-181.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 452-457.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated177\">Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 177.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated457\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> About ten porpoises moved on a height and aviation intervenes according to their indications. Airplanes drops Mark 82 and GBU-12 bombs while mortars and Caesar shell Islamist positions. The AMX-10 RC tanks and the VABs also take position at the top of the counter-flank and are missed by five RPG-7 rockets. Meanwhile, a 2nd RIMa sniper kills a jihadist in motion at more than 1,000 meters. Exchanges of artillery and light weapon fire lasted several hours, but the French held the summit of the ridges and the attempts of the jihadists to circumvent them were repulsed. The fight ended at the end of the afternoon, when the Caesar and the mortars make a synchronized shot on two combat positions. Around 7 pm, the jihadists unhook and take away their dead, Sontay and Puebla are in the hands of the French. These consolidate their positions to spend the night. Their losses were three wounded, those of jihadists were estimated at fifteen killed. GTIA 3 resumes its course the next morning, but shortly after its departure a VBL jumps on an anti-tank mine and two soldiers, including a captain, were wounded. For their part, the Chadians have resumed their progress to the east but they also encounter mines that also wounded some of them. To the north, GTIA 4 continues to advance. In the afternoon, tanks and aviation opened fire on a battle station. While further east, the legionnaires collide with a first group of half a dozen fighters armed with machine guns and rocket launchers. The clash lasts about six hours and the planes intervene again. The next day, an armor BRDM-2 is destroyed by two Rafale.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 459-463</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 192-194.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr/archive/2013/02/28/un-vbl-francais-saute-sur-un-engin-explosif-deux-blesses-don.html |title=UN VBL du RICM saute sur un engin explosif: deux bless\u00e9s dont l'un est \u00e9vacu\u00e9 vers la France : Lignes de d\u00e9fense |publisher=Lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 464-466.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\n===Bombings in In Sensa and death of Abu Zeid===\nOn February 27, a concentration of jihadist vehicles with forty men is spotted by the French in the crossroads called the \"Garage\".

On February 28, the Algerian television channel Ennahar is the first to announce the death of the AQIM leader. The channel claims that the latter was killed by French forces in the Adrar Tigharghar with about forty combatants, but sets the date of his death to Monday, February 25. The same day, Paris-Match reports that according to the MNLA and notables of the city of Kidal, 45 men of AQIM and Ansar Dine were killed on Saturday, February 23 by an air raid of the French army in the area. In Sensa, on the bases of Tinwel\u00e8ne and Ticherfen. The MNLA also claims to have supported the French special forces and captured seven survivors - four from the region, an Algerian, a Mauritanian and a member of the Polisario - then handed over to the French. Another AQIM leader, Sedane Ag Hita, the commander of the katiba \"Youssef Ibn Tachfin\", fled to Aguel'hoc after escaping the bombings. He made contact with the MNLA present in the city and reported having defected from AQIM. He is said to have testified to the death of Abu Zeid and 43 of his men allegedly by him in the area of In Sensa and Etagh, near Tabankort on 23 February. For its part, the French newspaper Le Monde announces on March 1 that the death of Abu Zeid is confirmed by a \"reliable source close to the ongoing military operations in northern Mali . \" It would have occurred in the \"very last days\" in the Etagho area and 43 fighters of his katiba would have been killed with him.

He gives more details about the death of Abu Zeid which he claims to have witnessed. According to him, the convoy of the fighters of AQIM and Ansar Dine was about sixty kilometers from Tessalit when it is attacked by French planes. Abu Zeid, driving the lead vehicle, is killed instantly by the first strike. Iyad Ag Ghali is then right behind him, driving the second vehicle of the convoy. Mad with rage, almost in a trance, he throws himself on the 14.5&nbsp;mm machine gun stuck on his own pickup shouting \" Allahu akbar \". It is ultimately his own men who must force him out after seeing a second plane. Iyad Ag Ghali narrowly survives the bombing that follows, his vehicle is sprayed shortly after being abandoned. Hiding in the bushes with some of his relatives, he manages to win another pickup hidden behind tarpaulins, with which he finally manages to escape. According to journalist Serge Daniel, this \"version of the facts corresponds to the information collected from military sources in the Sahel region\".<ref name=\"Serge Daniel p. 129-133\"/> In March 1, Chadian President Idriss Deby gave a completely different version and declares that Abu Zeid was killed by his troops in the fight of February 22, east of the Ametettai: \"On February 22 we lost our soldiers in the Ifoghas massif after destroying the base of the jihadists. This is the first time that there has been a face to face with the jihadists. Our soldiers shot down two jihadist leaders, including Abu Zeid, and freed Tessalit. \"  Then on Saturday, March 2, Chad claimed the death of Mokhtar Belmokhtar and said: \"Chadian forces in Mali have totally destroyed the main base of jihadists in the Adrar mountains of Ifoghas, more precisely in the valley.

He was present during the fight of February 22 but he himself learned the death of Abu Zeid only by the press.

An official of the administration of Aguel'hoc, also says that a young boy from the city was surprised by the Islamists and executed for setting pointing devices for the French air strikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr/archive/2013/02/28/un-vbl-francais-saute-sur-un-engin-explosif-deux-blesses-don.html |title=UN VBL du RICM saute sur un engin explosif: deux bless\u00e9s dont l'un est \u00e9vacu\u00e9 vers la France : Lignes de d\u00e9fense |publisher=Lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/02/28/dans-les-roches-de-l-adrar-de-tigharghar-une-bataille-cruciale-est-engagee_1840262_3212.html |title=Dans les roches de l\u2019Adrar de Tighargh\u00e2r, une bataille cruciale est engag\u00e9e |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-09-11}}</ref> The same day, a sub-group maintained in reserve in Tessalit leads the Septenk\u00e9ro operation. An agreement had recently been reached in which Algeria undertook to supply the French army with fuel to confront AQIM. The French soldiers leave to meet the Algerian soldiers on the Bordj Badji Mokhtar border, in front of the Malian city of In Khalil, held by the MNLA . The reception is very cold, the Algerians show themselves with weapons, helmets and bulletproof vests and fly over the area by many helicopters. Four other Septenk\u00e9ro operations will still be conducted between 8 and 25 March.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 480-482.</ref><ref name=\"Bernard Barrera 2013, p. 197-201\"/> On the morning of March 1, the men of GTIA 4 reached northern Amettetai. The valley then undergoes its most massive bombardment since the beginning of the battle; shots of helicopters, mortars, more than 20 explosive shells shipped by Caesar and fourteen other smoke bombs to cover infantry advance. The 3rd company of the 2nd REP then crosses the valley to reach the southern heights, while the 2nd company remains on the northern heights. However, the forces deployed east and west were delayed by the mines and around noon General Barrera ordered the GTIA 3 and asked the Chadians to speed up the march so as not to leave the GTIA 4 isolated. In the west, GTIA 3 manages to cross the mined lock at the cost of one of its VABs, which is damaged by the explosion of a mine. The jihadists then begin to retreat, the leaders order their men to exfiltrate south to the Terz Valley and Tahor Pass. On the night of March 1 to 2, around 2 am, five pickups were spotted near Tahor. The Atlantic-2 cameras do not identify any hostages, the convoy is then rolled up by three Airburst bombs and twenty shells fired by the Caesar. After this carnage, the jihadist leaders ask their men to retreat on the back of dromedaries. On the evening of March 1, General Barrera goes to the GTIA 4 in the Amettetai, he then goes Tessalit aboard his Puma helicopter with the only prisoner made during the day, a Franco-Algerian jihadist named Djamel Ben Hamdi and nicknamed \"Djamel the Grenoblois\" <ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\">Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 482-488.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 200-206</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 474.</ref> The next day, around 8 o'clock in the morning, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP attacks two mounds north of the valley, while the 3rd company attacks a rocky peak in the south, near the \"camp of the sands\" and the \"camp of rocks \", in the wadi that connects the valley of Ametteta\u00ef to the valley of Integant. The north position is taken around 10 o'clock, and the southern position around 11 o'clock. On each of the two points, the assault gives rise to very close combats which end in caves. About twenty jihadists die into these two clashes. Further east, the 140 men of the 1st RCP attack around 9 am an ultimate rock lock held by a dozen fighters. The French are first targeted by snipers, the hunters replicate and some of them perform a bypass movement on the right. The air force and the Tigers intervene but without success, the thickness of the rocks protects the defenders from the bombs. Around 11 am, the hunters storm, but the jihadists repel them twice. Soldiers hurt themselves by spraining the rocks. Around 18 hours, a third assault fails and a French soldier is shot in the head. The shelling then resumes again. During the seven hours of the fighting, the piton is struck by six Milan missiles fired at AT4, two GBUs and six HOTs fired by two Gazelle helicopters and two Tigers who also empty their ammunition, but at nightfall the jihadists still hold the position.<ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\"/><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 206-209.</ref> According to the French staff, the day's record is of more than fifteen \"neutralized\" Islamists, three destroyed pick-ups and three important caches of ammunition, equipment and several heavy weapons seized.

The hunters bypass the position and head east. The legionaries on their side launch the ultimate assault. They take the peak and kill the only jihadist they find, hidden in a cave. Nevertheless, traces of blood, clothing and ten Korans found on the spot suggest that other fighters have managed to escape, perhaps later dead or injured.<ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\"/> On the morning of March 3, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP goes down from the northern heights and takes control of the small village of Ametettai. For its part the GTIA 3 destroys a pickup and captures a BM-21. Chadians are also advancing, but complain about four injuries due to FDI. Shortly after the three columns make their junction near the village. A group of jihadists open fire on the crowd at 300 meters but the French and Chadians immediately retaliate and kill four men. Some clashes still occur, especially near water points, but at the end of the day, the Ametettai Valley is considered taken. In the words of General Barrera : \"the dungeon has fallen\". The columns then restart. The Chadians go west to cross the valley to refuel, then join their bivouac in Aguel'hoc. For its part, the GTIA 3 turned around to go to search the area of the \"Garage\", there is no resistance but discovered a lot of weapons and equipment. Further south, towards the Terz Valley, a group of 14 insurgents on the run is spotted by the air force despite its attempt to conceal the vegetation. The group is annihilated by an air strike.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 488-491.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 210-214.</ref><ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\"/> On March 4, some jihadists went to the French in the Ametettai Valley and the Garage. Among them are three child soldiers and a Nigerian who admitted to being Boko Haram fighters. From February 28 to March 4, according to the French General Staff, a dozen pick-ups and a 122- mm gun were destroyed and a lot of equipment and ammunition captured; including a BM-21, three other 122mm guns, a towable 100mm gun, an 82mm mortar and a 60mm mortar, weapons, rockets and anti-personnel mines.

They meet a small group of four jihadists who are all killed after two hours of fighting and whose last man is shot to less than one meter. Already visited twice in February, the \"camp of rocks\" is again searched by the special forces the night of March 4 to 5, and that of 6 to 7. They remain there even the next day before retiring. Then, on the morning of March 8, 200 paratroopers took control. The resistance is weaker than expected, a French lieutenant is wounded, and six jihadists are killed. Corpses of fighters probably killed by mortar fire a few days earlier are also discovered. For its part, the GTIA 3 goes down the valley of Integant and advances towards the \"camp of the sands\". Along the way, three jihadists are targeted by the firing of a tank. Two are killed, the third, wounded, traps the bodies of his comrades with grenades before being surprised again and shot not far away.

The maneuver is close to Panther III ; GTIA 3 is to enter the valley from the west, GTIA 4 to the north by Tahor Pass to the north and Chadians to the east to close the lock.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 519.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 520.</ref><ref name=\"Bernard Barrera 2013, p. 263-264\">Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 263-264.</ref> However, the climatic conditions and the nature of the terrain put the vehicles and equipment of the Chadian forces under severe strain. Many armored vehicles have broken down, half of the AMX-10 RC can no longer ride and 200 infantrymen have no more shoes. For three days, the mechanics repaired the two tank squadrons, sometimes \"cannibalizing\" other vehicles, while new pairs of shoes were collected and returned to French soldiers for two days.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 215.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 251-256.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 496-497.</ref> On March 11, Chadians leave Aguel'hoc accompanied by French mortar gunners. They bypass the Adrar Tigharghar from the south and recognize the Assamalmal Valley. A battle occurs around 15 hours after. In a statement, the Chadian staff says that they had dead and wounded and have six dead and five prisoners among jihadists. However, General Barrera does not mention in his war notes of killed on both sides during this conflict. Later, he even said that Chadian soldiers would have encountered a lone fighter. On the 13th, two Chadians wounded by bullets are evacuated by a Puma.<ref name=\"Bernard Barrera 2013, p. 263-264\"/><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 250.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 252.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 303</ref> On the 15th, the GTIA 3 and 4 of the French army leave Tessalit while the Chadians leave the valley of Assamalmal, to take position east of the valley of Terz. The next day, the French enter the valley. The paratroopers do not encounter any resistance on the heights of Tahor, some empty pickups are bombarded by the air force and quickly the soldiers discover arms depots and food in shooting positions. The armor of the GTIA 4 is first preceded by sappers, but the column is late and must accelerate.

But while the French and Chadians expected to find strong resistance, it turns out that Terz was recently abandoned by jihadists. The valley is searched, a pickup containing a large stock of ammunition and shells is destroyed by the engineers. A 14.5&nbsp;mm machine gun, an anti-tank gun SPG-9, mortars and a missile 107 107 type firing station are also found in a cache.

In March 23, GCPare dropped at night by helicopter near the Garden, but the area turned out to be empty. The Chadians approached the circus but they do not finded any passage that would allow vehicles to access the interior, the staff deduced that no material could be conveyed by the jihadists. There is nothing either on the side of the parachute dragons who search the Adrar Dourit from March 23 to 30. On March 23, the Chadians return to Aguel'hoc and the GTIA 4 does the same to Tessalit. The GTIA 3 returns in turn on March 25. From 21 to 25 March, 122 and 120&nbsp;mm shells, four boxes of PG9 rockets, 60&nbsp;mm mortarsand some mines were seized.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 524-529.</ref><ref>https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/operations/autres-operations/operations-achevees/operation-serval-2013-2014/actualite/operation-serval-point-de-situation-du-lundi-25-mars</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 297-307.</ref> In March 26, a company of the 2ond REP and another from the 1st RCP leads Operation Tigris in the town of Tessalit to search the city and to ensure the absence of any jihadi presence.

One of its subgroups led the operation Panth\u00e8re VIII, that went to recognize the valley of Assamalmal south of Adrar Tigharghar, then again the \"Garden\". A printing press is discovered during the excavations, as well as some stocks of weapons. The other sub-group, commanded by Colonel Gougeon, is leading the Renard operation with the Chadians. He go to Boghassa, then Abeibara. In the latter city, a Togolese jihadist is arrested. Generals Barrera and Bikimoand Colonel Gougeon then meet the notables and residents indicate the location of depots of weapons, medical equipment and ammunition. These transactions end on March 31.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 325-329.</ref><ref>https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/mali/actualite/operation-serval-point-de-situation-du-jeudi-4-avril-2013</ref> The Adrar Tigharghar is now considered empty and French troops begin to be disengaged. GTIA 3 returns to Kidal and on April 2 it is in Gao. In early April the GTIA  can repatriate and two of its SGTIA Abidjan, return to France after ten days in the Ivorian capital. On 5 April, Chadian forces return to Kidal. On 9 April, the French garrison of Tessalit rose in ten days from 2.000 to 400 men. In May, all the GTIAs engaged in Operation Serval were relieved and returned to France after a stopover in Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, to decompress at the request of General Barrera. Chadians, on the other hand, remain deployed much longer in the Kidal region; in September 160 soldiers of the Tessalit garrison desert the Amachach military camp after having complained of not having been relieved after nine months of mission in the great north of Mali.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 340.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 358.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 562.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130918-mali-160-soldats-tchadiens-desertent-position-tessalit-deby-keita-gao-fatim-garboa |title=Au Mali, pr\u00e8s de 160 soldats tchadiens d\u00e9sertent leur position \u00e0 Tessalit - RFI |publisher=Rfi.fr |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20130405-mali-troupes-tchadiennes-retour-kidal-nord-bataille-ifoghas-troupes-france-securisation-djihadistes |title=Reportage : les troupes tchadiennes de retour \u00e0 Kidal, bastion des Touareg |publisher=France 24 |date=2016-01-13 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Ifoghas completes the reconquest phase of northern Mali. After this defeat, the jihadists sought to blend in with the population and avoided clashes. In Terz Valley, even the French were discovering the cut beards the jihadists left. Salafist rebels now had gone underground. The jihadists left hundreds of dead in the first months of Operation Serval, and according to General Barrera, after their defeat in the Tighargh\u00e2r;\"They are no longer able to occupy the field, nor numerous enough to fight a classic battle. It only remains small terrorist groups conducting asymmetric warfare and avoid contact \". The jihadists then change their tactics and go to guerrilla warfare ; they carry out suicide attacks, ambush, fire rockets at military barracks, lay mines and IEDs on the roads, and kill supporters of the Malian government or the Tuareg rebellion. On 25 April, AQIM calls for jihad against France in a speech delivered by Abu Obeida Youssef al-Annabi. Iyad Ag Ghali reappears in turn on July 29, 2014 in a video and affirms his will to continue to fight the \"crusaders, with France in the lead\". On April 16, a pickup group spotted northwest of Tessalit was destroyed by French aviation. Several jihadists were killed but Senda Ould Boumama, spokesman of Ansar Dine, escaped the strikes when he was directly targeted. Traumatized by the bombing, he traveled several tens of kilometers in the desert to go to Algerians Bordj Badji Mokhtar.<ref>{{cite web|author=RFI |url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140807-iyad-ag-ghali-ansar-dine-menace-france-serval-fatwa |title=Iyad Ag Ghali, le leader d'Ansar Dine, r\u00e9appara\u00eet et menace la France - RFI |publisher=Rfi.fr |date=2015-10-27 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alain Barluet Auteur - Sa biographie |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2014/03/06/01003-20140306ARTFIG00329-mali-nouvelle-operation-antiterroriste-de-l-armee-francaise.php |title=Mali: nouvelle op\u00e9ration antiterroriste de l'arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Un mot \u00e0 ajouter ? |url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2013/05/07/un-chef-d-al-qaida-appelle-a-attaquer-les-interets-francais_901465 |title=Un chef d\u2019Al-Qaeda appelle \u00e0 attaquer les int\u00e9r\u00eats fran\u00e7ais - Lib\u00e9ration |publisher=Liberation.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Thierry Oberl\u00e9 Auteur - Sa biographie |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2013/05/07/01003-20130507ARTFIG00504-aqmi-appelle-a-la-guerre-sainte-contre-la-france.php |title=Aqmi appelle \u00e0 la guerre sainte contre la France |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Pro- Sarko |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2014/02/27/un-an-apres-serval-les-djihadistes-sont-de-retour-au-mali_4374596_3212.html |title=Un an apr\u00e8s \" Serval \", les djihadistes sont de retour au Mali |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Un mot \u00e0 ajouter ? |url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2014/10/05/la-guerilla-jihadiste-reinvestit-le-nord-mali_1115423 |title=La gu\u00e9rilla jihadiste r\u00e9investit le Nord-Mali - Lib\u00e9ration |publisher=Liberation.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/47359/politique/le-chef-d-ansar-eddine-iyad-ag-ghali-refait-surface/|title=Le chef d\u2019Ansar Eddine, Iyad ag Ghali, refait surface \u2013 JeuneAfrique.com|date=6 August 2014|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130520-mauritanie-porte-parole-ansar-dine-senda-ould-boumama|title=Mauritanie: l'un des porte-parole d\u2019Ansar Dine se serait rendu - RFI|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2013/07/10/dans-l-adrar-de-tigharghar-de-la-sueur-et-des-armes_917412|title=Dans l\u2019Adrar de Tigharghar, de la sueur et des armes|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/international/mali-une-dizaine-de-combattants-d-aqmi-tues-par-les-forces-francaises-06-03-2014-3649865.php|title=Mali : une dizaine de combattants d'Aqmi tu\u00e9s par les forces fran\u00e7aises|date=6 March 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{coord|19.5250|N|1.2200|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ifoghas, Battle of}}\n[[Category:2013 in Mali]]\n[[Category:Battles involving France]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 2013]]\n[[Category:Kidal Region]]\n[[Category:Mali War]]\n[[Category:February 2013 events in Africa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of Ifoghas\n| partof      = [[Operation Panther (2013)|Operation ''Panther'']] and the [[Northern Mali conflict]]\n| image       = Battle of Ifoghas-2013-fr.svg\n| image_size  = 300px\n| caption     =\n| date        = 18 February \u2013 31 March 2013\n| place       = [[Adrar des Ifoghas]], [[Kidal Region]], [[Mali]]\n| territory   =\n| result      = [[France|French]]/[[Chad]]ian victory\n| combatant1  = {{flag|France}}<br>{{flag|Chad}}\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon image|Drapeau Ansar Dine.JPG}} [[Ansar Dine]]<br>{{flagicon image|ShababFlag.svg}} [[Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa|MOJWA]]<br>{{flagicon image|ShababFlag.svg}} [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb|AQIM]]<br>{{flagicon image|ShababFlag.svg}} [[Boko Haram]]<br>{{flagicon image|ShababFlag.svg}} [[Al-Mulathameen]]\n| commander1  = {{flagdeco|France}} [[Bernard Barrera|Gen.

The French army and the Chadian army fought armed Salafist jihadist groups led by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Ansar Dine. After being defeated in January in the [[Battle of Konna]] and the [[Battle of Diabaly]] , the jihadists abandoned Timbuktu and retreated into the Adrar Tigharghar, a mountain of the Adrar of Ifoghas in northeastern Mali, which has been their sanctuary for years. The French started quickly a pursuit, and they took control of the towns of [[Tessalit]] and [[Aguelhok]] and begun the [[Operation Panther (2013)|operation Panther]] in the Tigharghar. The first clashes erupt on February 18 and are mainly concentrated in the Ametettai Valley. It is caught between two armored columns, one French to the west and another Chadian to the east, while the paratroopers manage to surprise the jihadists by attacking on foot from the north. The valley is taken on March 3 and jihadists begin to gradually abandon the Tigharghar. Excavation missions and some skirmishes, however, continue to take place the following days. The operations cease on March 31. The battle was a turning point in the war, as with the capture of the Tigharghar, the jihadists lose their main sanctuary in the Sahel as well as most of their military arsenal, taken from the Malian army or Libya .<ref name=\"lemonde1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/02/28/dans-les-roches-de-l-adrar-de-tigharghar-une-bataille-cruciale-est-engagee_1840262_3212.html |title=Dans les roches de l\u2019Adrar de Tighargh\u00e2r, une bataille cruciale est engag\u00e9e |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref name=\"lemonde1\"/><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, Paris, Tallandier, 2014, 650 p.</ref><ref name=\"la-croix1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/Monde/La-bataille-de-l-Ametettai-du-general-Barrera-au-Mali-2013-05-28-965781|title=La bataille de l\u2019Ametettai du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Barrera au Mali|first=|last=La-Croix.com|date=28 May 2013|website=La Croix|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Deployment of Franco-Chadian forces in the Kidal region==\nThe evening of January 29, 2013, two Tiger helicopters, a Gazelle and four Puma reach Kidal airport and disembark 30 French soldiers of the CPA-10 and the Penfentenyo commando against MNLA pick-ups. They are followed by three planes landing men of 1 RPIMa and Commando de Montfort. The officer in charge of the French special forces then meets Colonel Mohamed Ag Najem, commander-in-chief of the MNLA's military wing. The French then settle in one of the two military camps of the city and begin their cohabitation with the Tuareg rebels, but unlike [[Gao]], [[Timbuktu]] , and the southern cities where they had been celebrated as liberators, in Kidal the French are seen as the vanguard of the Malian army and the reception of the population is much colder.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 368.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 347-350.</ref> But the goal of the French army, at that time, remains the Tigharghar . From the end of January, the surroundings of the Adrar are bombarded by Rafale. Then on the evening of February 2, a first mass air raid struck the interior of the mountain; four Mirage and four Rafale destroy twelve objectives, supported by three Atlantic, a Harfang drone, an AWACS and Tiger helicopters. The raid mainly targets the area known as the \"Garage\", west of Ametettai, where two BMP-1 armored vehicles have been located, as well as an anti-aircraft battery that was probably inoperative.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 373.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 374-375.</ref> On 1 February, a column of fifteen vehicles of the MNLA and thirty men from the French Special Forces leave Kidal to conduct a joint operation towards the Adrar Tigharghar . The night of 2 to 3, the French and the Tuaregs separate. The first pursued towards the valley of Assamalmal, targeted a few hours earlier by the air strikes. On the spot, the balance sheet is rather thin, no body nor destroyed vehicle is discovered, only a stock of gasoline and some motorcycles were swept by the bombs. The Touareg rebels, meanwhile, take control of the town of Aguelhok where the French come back from Assamalmal to join them. The population, strongly hostile to jihadists, welcomes newcomers. The MNLA captured some suspects and discovered several hundred kilos of ammunition, which he then handed over to the French forces as a sign of goodwill.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 375-377.</ref> France was also seeking the help of Chad's President [[Idriss D\u00e9by]]. He agreed to deploy his army in the Adrar of Ifoghas. On February 3, the first Chadian soldiers arrived in Kidal.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 379-380.</ref> On the night of February 7 to 8, the French special forces lead Operation Takouba on Tessalit. Thirty men from the 13 th RDP, CPA-10, a marine CTLO and the ESNO are parachuted near the airport. They spot a piece of runway where two C-160 Transall can land and land four vehicles and a few more men. From Aguel'hoc, the 30 soldiers - mainly from the 1st RPIMa - who had led the reconnaissance mission in the Assamalmal valley are also moving on Tessalit. In the morning, the special forces make their junction and enter the city without encountering any resistance. A few hours later, from Kidal, the Chadians of General Deby arrived on their turn after passing through Aguel'hoc. Then, 54 soldiers of the 1st RCP are deposited by a third plane. Finally, a sub-GTIA party from Gao, consisting mainly of soldiers from 1 RIMa and forming a column of 90 vehicles, arrives at the scene and invests the military camp of Amachach.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 383-393.</ref> On February 13, the Special Forces made a first foray into the Tigharghar during Operation Tazidert, whose goal is to find a record of the Western hostages held by AQIM. They infiltrate the \"camp of the sands\" and the \"camp of the rocks\", but find no trace of the hostages, or - to their surprise - jihadists. The operation ends on February 16.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 416-419</ref> At the same time, GTIA 4 unfolds in the far north. 400 French soldiers are present in Tessalit on February 12.

In comparison with the [[Taliban]] , which the French also faced in [[Afghanistan]], the jihadists of Mali were considered better organized and more tenacious, able to sacrifice themselves while the Afghan insurgents used to flee to limit the losses. In contrast, FDIs were at this time less used than in Afghanistan and were generally poorly manufactured.

It included five Puma, three Gazelle and two Tiger helicopters based at Tessalit.\n\nOn the side of the air force, eight Rafale based in N'Djamena and six Mirage 2000D based in Bamako take turns bombing the Tigharghar. For the aerial reconnaissance, Operation Serval mobilized five Atlantique 2 and two Mirage F1 CRs. It also has a Harfang drone 108.\n\nFor the vehicles, 22 AMX-10 RC tanks are engaged in the battle 109 and for the two Caesar artillery of the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment ( 11th RAMa) are deployed and supported by an intelligence battery of 68 African Artillery Regiment ( 68th RAA).\n\nSupply between Gao and Tessalit is provided by a logistic detachment of the 511th Train Regiment ( 511 th RT). The 9th Advanced Surgical Antenna, initially based in S\u00e9var\u00e9 , is deployed in Tessalit. The command of the land operations is assured by Brigadier General Bernard Barrera. A forward command post is established in Tessalit on 12 February . This staff, called the G08, is under the leadership of Colonel Laurent de Bertier de Sauvigny and Xavier Vanden Neste and is made up of about forty to fifty people from the 11th Parachute Brigade, a few officers of the 3rd Light Armored Brigade were soon amalgamated to form a centralized command post. The special forces and the DGSE set up in Kidal where they have a helicopter base, their mission being to locate the jihadist leaders and the hostages. The special forces are autonomous, they act without coordinating with the Serval brigade and do not come under the command of General Barrera. 1,200 French soldiers take part initially in the operation Panth\u00e8re, at the end of the fighting their number is 1,400 . The majority of French soldiers engaged in battle have combat experience, most of them participated in the Afghanistan war, some even in the Gulf War . In addition to Afghanistan, the air forces also took part in Operation Harmattan in Libya . Many infantry have already experienced extreme heat similar to that of Tighargh\u00e2r in the FFDj [[Djibouti]].<ref>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gout, Lib\u00e9rez Tombouctou !

Their numbers changed during the fighting. In February, 800 men took part in the offensive on the Ametettai Valley, in mid-March 1,400 to 1,500 Chadian soldiers were deployed in the Adrar Tighargh\u00e2r. They had more than a hundred armored vehicles, including about ten BMP-1s 128. The elite troops of the presidential guard form the spearhead of this force, 500 of its members have been integrated into the contingent deployed in Mali. Troops of the National Guard and Nomad of Chad (GNNT) and the Close Action Detachment (DAR) were also engaged in the Adrar. Chadian forces in Mali were commanded by General Oumar Bikimo. The second command, initially ensured by General Abderrahmane Youssouf Me\u00efri, passes from mid-February to General Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by Itno, son of President Idriss D\u00e9by. From 2005 to 2010, the Chadian army fought hard during the [[Chadian Civil War (2005\u201310)|Chadian civil war]]. Its soldiers, most of whom are of Zaghawa ethnicity, are accustomed to the climate and fighting in the desert and are considered to be by far the most experienced and seasoned African forces deployed in Mali.<ref name=\"lavoixdunord1\">{{cite web|url=http://defense.blogs.lavoixdunord.fr/archive/2013/03/05/au-mali-le-tchad-montre-son-ambition.html |title=Au Mali, le Tchad montre son ambition : D\u00e9fense globale |publisher=Defense.blogs.lavoixdunord.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/Monde/Un-cinquieme-soldat-francais-tue-au-Mali-par-un-engin-explosif-_NG_-2013-03-17-921798|title=Un cinqui\u00e8me soldat fran\u00e7ais tu\u00e9 au Mali par un engin explosif|first=|last=La-Croix.com|date=17 March 2013|website=La Croix|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Alexandre-Van-Dooren-5e-mort-francais-au-Mali-230390 |title=Mali.

The operation begins with a reconnaissance mission conducted by GTIA 4 on In Taghlit, a village used by jihadists to stock up, in the Tibeggatine Valley, west of the Ametettai Valley.

They found only a few unarmed men who all say that the jihadists had fled for a dozen days. The paratroopers then go to a nearby wadi and discover a first abandoned logistic depot. They unearth trucks filled with shells, a ton of food, telephones, an engine, gas drums and a large generator. In the afternoon, the French pushed their recognition to the village of Tabankort and camped there to spend the night. The next morning, they divided into two groups. The first, consisting of two platoons of porpoises goes north on the village of Abancko where intelligence suspects the presence of an ammunition depot. The soldiers meet an old man on the spot who guides them to a stockpile of shells that the jihadists had taken over the Malian army after the [[Battle of Tessalit]].  The second group headed for the area called the \"Garage\" bombed by aviation on February 2. Coming from the west, the French stop in front of two rocky mounds, about forty meters high, between which a vehicular passage runs eastward. Veteran officers who fought in Afghanistan and Tuareg guides suspect an ambush and the column is moving cautiously. Around 9 am, the leading vehicles were attacked by a jihadists ambush at 300 meters. A first group of a dozen fighters is located in a green zone a little further north. The soldiers retreat, take cover and half an hour later the Mirage 2000 D intervene and destroy a machine gun nest. The three AMX-10 RC tanks then take control of the neck between the two mounds and open fire with their 105&nbsp;mm guns. Despite the intensity of the fire, the jihadists do not hesitate to move short in front of the tanks, they send some rockets with RPG-7, but the range is too fair. As for the tanks, they fire with thirty explosive shells.<ref name=\"autogenerated422\"/><ref name=\"Bernard Barrera 2013, p. 155-160\">Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 155-160.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/><ref name=\"la-croix1\"/> On their side, the paratroop legionaries of the 2nd REP attack the mound on the right with the aim of controlling the dominant position and to prevent the jihadists from overflowing from the south.

The planes remained permanently on zone, supplied by an American tanker. Other Mirage 2000 D, then Rafale, a Puma helicopter loaded with ammunition and finally, at the end of the afternoon, two Tiger helicopters arrive on the scene.

After the fighting on 19 and 20 February and the fierce resistance of the jihadists, the French staff is now convinced that the Ametettai Valley is the heart of the AQIM device in the Adrar. From the beginning of the fighting, the intelligence intercepted dozens of calls by satellite phones or mobile phones from the valley that had remained silent until then. The French army had \"founded the enemy\" and it could now prepare for the offensive. After crossing the border between Niger and Mali at the beginning of the month, the GTIA 3 leaves Gao on February 20, and arrives in the Adrar of the Ifoghas two days later. 1800 French soldiers are present at Tessalit.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Mali-La-Legion-dans-l-antre-d-Aqmi-229837 |title=Mali.

Coming from Kidal, the second column led by General Bikimo arrived from the south. The two forces make their junction east of the Adrar.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 422.</ref> The February 22, after a few days, Chadian troops reached the eastern entrance to the Amettetai valley. Unlike the French who had advanced cautiously in the Tibeggatine Valley, Chadians were attacking in force. Shortly after 11 am, they clash with jihadists. Clashes broke out on several points of the wadi, but the bloodiest fighting took place on a hill, north of the entrance to the valley. The Chadians were launching a real charge. Many fall under the fire of jihadists entrenched in the caves and behind the rocks. Despite the losses the soldiers are \"euphoric\" and \"galvanized\", one of them, the commander Moussa, will declare: \"The terrorists faced us. They say they are crazy. We too wanted to be more crazy than them \". The clashes were confusing, some soldiers chased after jihadists who retreated to a neighboring wadi, other Islamists ambushed the Chadians, by Chadians overtake them and then shoot them in the back. The fighters are too entangled and the French air force can not intervene. Chadians, however, form a line against the main Islamist position and deliver heavy fire with guns and machine guns. The jihadists repel the first assault but several others follow and the Chadians eventually reach the caves where the last insurgents deliver a desperate resistance.

Commander Abdel Aziz Hassane Adam, leader of the special forces in Mali and number two of the Directorate of Reserved Actions (DAR), is among the dead. The only two doctors and nurses in the Chadian column were overwhelmed and the French had to send two Puma helicopters to evacuate the wounded by rotation to Tessalit's vital surgery module (MCV). The jihadists leave about 93 or 96 dead, about twenty prisoners and six vehicles destroyed according to the Chadian staff.

The general of division Gregory de Saint-Quentin, chief of the operation Serval, entrusts to him the command of the terrestrial operations in the Adrar Tigharghar. The French army then planned its offensive, it plans to resume the attack on the west with the GTIA 3 and to surprise the jihadists by advancing the GTIA 4 north, on foot, through the mountainous terrain. According to General Barrera's war notes, the plan was partly inspired by the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]] and [[Operation Diadem]]. However, the French-Chadian forces were not numerous enough to cover the south. The zone of the south is then left to the surveillance of air forces. On the night of February 25 to 26, Operation Panther III begins. The GTIA 4 leaves Tessalit, more than 500 parachutists are loadeded on all available vehicles: VAB, GBC 180 trucks and even TRM 10000. The convoy was heading east for 80 kilometers. Around 3 pm, the parachutists were disembarked and deployed about ten kilometers north of the Ametettai. Colonel Desmeulles places the 1st RIMa tank platoon in the west, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP in the center and the company of the 1st RCP in the east. Two other companies of the 2nd REP are behind the leading units. For the parachutists, a long and trying walk begins, each soldier carries about 50 kilos of water, food and equipment in heat that can exceed 50 degrees. Every night, the troop must be refueled by helicopters, mainly in water. The first day, the progression is slower than expected, the GTIA 4 advance one kilometer and a half. For their part, armored GTIA 3 commanded by Colonel Gougeon set in motion at 3 am west of the Ametettai. Two Caesars from Gao also reach the entrance of the valley at dawn, just arrived they open fire to cover the advance of the column. After 5 kilometers of road, the GTIA 3 arrives at the scene of the fight of 19 February but no jihadist appears. The French continue their progression and reach the crests of Sontai and Puebla. This time the jihadists were present, dozens of fighters open fire, sometimes within 100 meters of the French. Some are ambushed at the top of the ridges, others on the counterpoise or in a green zone below, entrenched in huts or hidden in holes<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 180-181.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 452-457.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated177\">Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 177.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated457\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> About ten porpoises moved on a height and aviation intervenes according to their indications. Airplanes drops Mark 82 and GBU-12 bombs while mortars and Caesar shell Islamist positions. The AMX-10 RC tanks and the VABs also take position at the top of the counter-flank and are missed by five RPG-7 rockets. Meanwhile, a 2nd RIMa sniper kills a jihadist in motion at more than 1,000 meters. Exchanges of artillery and light weapon fire lasted several hours, but the French held the summit of the ridges and the attempts of the jihadists to circumvent them were repulsed. The fight ended at the end of the afternoon, when the Caesar and the mortars make a synchronized shot on two combat positions. Around 7 pm, the jihadists unhook and take away their dead, Sontay and Puebla are in the hands of the French. These consolidate their positions to spend the night. Their losses were three wounded, those of jihadists were estimated at fifteen killed. GTIA 3 resumes its course the next morning, but shortly after its departure a VBL jumps on an anti-tank mine and two soldiers, including a captain, were wounded. For their part, the Chadians have resumed their progress to the east but they also encounter mines that also wounded some of them. To the north, GTIA 4 continues to advance. In the afternoon, tanks and aviation opened fire on a battle station. While further east, the legionnaires collide with a first group of half a dozen fighters armed with machine guns and rocket launchers. The clash lasts about six hours and the planes intervene again. The next day, an armor BRDM-2 is destroyed by two Rafale.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 459-463</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 192-194.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr/archive/2013/02/28/un-vbl-francais-saute-sur-un-engin-explosif-deux-blesses-don.html |title=UN VBL du RICM saute sur un engin explosif: deux bless\u00e9s dont l'un est \u00e9vacu\u00e9 vers la France : Lignes de d\u00e9fense |publisher=Lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 464-466.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\n===Bombings in In Sensa and death of Abu Zeid===\nOn February 27, a concentration of jihadist vehicles with forty men is spotted by the French in the crossroads called the \"Garage\".

On February 28, the Algerian television channel Ennahar is the first to announce the death of the AQIM leader. The channel claims that the latter was killed by French forces in the Adrar Tigharghar with about forty combatants, but sets the date of his death to Monday, February 25. The same day, Paris-Match reports that according to the MNLA and notables of the city of Kidal, 45 men of AQIM and Ansar Dine were killed on Saturday, February 23 by an air raid of the French army in the area. In Sensa, on the bases of Tinwel\u00e8ne and Ticherfen. The MNLA also claims to have supported the French special forces and captured seven survivors - four from the region, an Algerian, a Mauritanian and a member of the Polisario - then handed over to the French. Another AQIM leader, Sedane Ag Hita, the commander of the katiba \"Youssef Ibn Tachfin\", fled to Aguel'hoc after escaping the bombings. He made contact with the MNLA present in the city and reported having defected from AQIM. He is said to have testified to the death of Abu Zeid and 43 of his men allegedly by him in the area of In Sensa and Etagh, near Tabankort on 23 February. For its part, the French newspaper Le Monde announces on March 1 that the death of Abu Zeid is confirmed by a \"reliable source close to the ongoing military operations in northern Mali . \" It would have occurred in the \"very last days\" in the Etagho area and 43 fighters of his katiba would have been killed with him. Colonel Thierry Burkhard, spokesman for the French armies, then said he had \"no specific information on this person\" but confirmed that a French air raid took place in the In Sensa area and destroyed six vehicles.<ref name=\"lefigaroil\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/02/28/un-chef-d-aqmi-a-ete-tue-par-l-armee-francaise-au-mali_1840892_3212.html |title=L'Elys\u00e9e et l'arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise ne confirment pas la mort d'Abou Zeid |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Abou-Zeid-l-emir-d-Aqmi-tue-dans-un-raid-francais-228591 |title=Abou Zeid, l'\u00e9mir d'Aqmi tu\u00e9 dans un raid fran\u00e7ais |publisher=Parismatch.com |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref> In January 2014, in Kidal, AFP journalist Serge Daniel meets a young Touareg from Tessalit nicknamed \"Tic - Tac\", a battle survivor in Tigharghar. \"Tic-Tac\" claims to be non-Islamist and to have joined Ansar Dine out of admiration for his leader Iyad Ag Ghali . He gives more details about the death of Abu Zeid which he claims to have witnessed. According to him, the convoy of the fighters of AQIM and Ansar Dine was about sixty kilometers from Tessalit when it is attacked by French planes. Abu Zeid, driving the lead vehicle, is killed instantly by the first strike. Iyad Ag Ghali is then right behind him, driving the second vehicle of the convoy. Mad with rage, almost in a trance, he throws himself on the 14.5&nbsp;mm machine gun stuck on his own pickup shouting \" Allahu akbar \". It is ultimately his own men who must force him out after seeing a second plane. Iyad Ag Ghali narrowly survives the bombing that follows, his vehicle is sprayed shortly after being abandoned. Hiding in the bushes with some of his relatives, he manages to win another pickup hidden behind tarpaulins, with which he finally manages to escape. According to journalist Serge Daniel, this \"version of the facts corresponds to the information collected from military sources in the Sahel region\".<ref name=\"Serge Daniel p. 129-133\"/> In March 1, Chadian President Idriss Deby gave a completely different version and declares that Abu Zeid was killed by his troops in the fight of February 22, east of the Ametettai: \"On February 22 we lost our soldiers in the Ifoghas massif after destroying the base of the jihadists. This is the first time that there has been a face to face with the jihadists. Our soldiers shot down two jihadist leaders, including Abu Zeid, and freed Tessalit. \"  Then on Saturday, March 2, Chad claimed the death of Mokhtar Belmokhtar and said: \"Chadian forces in Mali have totally destroyed the main base of jihadists in the Adrar mountains of Ifoghas, more precisely in the valley.

The staff then addresses Commander Jack, the leader of the French Special Forces detachment accompanying the Chadian column. He was present during the fight of February 22 but he himself learned the death of Abu Zeid only by the press. However, he obtained from Chadian soldiers photos of a corpse resembling the jihadist leader and the indication of the place where he was buried.

The 3rd company of the 2nd REP then crosses the valley to reach the southern heights, while the 2nd company remains on the northern heights. However, the forces deployed east and west were delayed by the mines and around noon General Barrera ordered the GTIA 3 and asked the Chadians to speed up the march so as not to leave the GTIA 4 isolated. In the west, GTIA 3 manages to cross the mined lock at the cost of one of its VABs, which is damaged by the explosion of a mine. The jihadists then begin to retreat, the leaders order their men to exfiltrate south to the Terz Valley and Tahor Pass. On the night of March 1 to 2, around 2 am, five pickups were spotted near Tahor. The Atlantic-2 cameras do not identify any hostages, the convoy is then rolled up by three Airburst bombs and twenty shells fired by the Caesar. After this carnage, the jihadist leaders ask their men to retreat on the back of dromedaries. On the evening of March 1, General Barrera goes to the GTIA 4 in the Amettetai, he then goes Tessalit aboard his Puma helicopter with the only prisoner made during the day, a Franco-Algerian jihadist named Djamel Ben Hamdi and nicknamed \"Djamel the Grenoblois\" <ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\">Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 482-488.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 200-206</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 474.</ref> The next day, around 8 o'clock in the morning, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP attacks two mounds north of the valley, while the 3rd company attacks a rocky peak in the south, near the \"camp of the sands\" and the \"camp of rocks \", in the wadi that connects the valley of Ametteta\u00ef to the valley of Integant. The north position is taken around 10 o'clock, and the southern position around 11 o'clock. On each of the two points, the assault gives rise to very close combats which end in caves. About twenty jihadists die into these two clashes. Further east, the 140 men of the 1st RCP attack around 9 am an ultimate rock lock held by a dozen fighters. The French are first targeted by snipers, the hunters replicate and some of them perform a bypass movement on the right. The air force and the Tigers intervene but without success, the thickness of the rocks protects the defenders from the bombs. Around 11 am, the hunters storm, but the jihadists repel them twice. Soldiers hurt themselves by spraining the rocks. Around 18 hours, a third assault fails and a French soldier is shot in the head. The shelling then resumes again. During the seven hours of the fighting, the piton is struck by six Milan missiles fired at AT4, two GBUs and six HOTs fired by two Gazelle helicopters and two Tigers who also empty their ammunition, but at nightfall the jihadists still hold the position.<ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\"/><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 206-209.</ref> According to the French staff, the day's record is of more than fifteen \"neutralized\" Islamists, three destroyed pick-ups and three important caches of ammunition, equipment and several heavy weapons seized.

The hunters bypass the position and head east. The legionaries on their side launch the ultimate assault. They take the peak and kill the only jihadist they find, hidden in a cave. Nevertheless, traces of blood, clothing and ten Korans found on the spot suggest that other fighters have managed to escape, perhaps later dead or injured.<ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\"/> On the morning of March 3, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP goes down from the northern heights and takes control of the small village of Ametettai. For its part the GTIA 3 destroys a pickup and captures a BM-21. Chadians are also advancing, but complain about four injuries due to FDI. Shortly after the three columns make their junction near the village. A group of jihadists open fire on the crowd at 300 meters but the French and Chadians immediately retaliate and kill four men. Some clashes still occur, especially near water points, but at the end of the day, the Ametettai Valley is considered taken. In the words of General Barrera : \"the dungeon has fallen\". The columns then restart. The Chadians go west to cross the valley to refuel, then join their bivouac in Aguel'hoc. For its part, the GTIA 3 turned around to go to search the area of the \"Garage\", there is no resistance but discovered a lot of weapons and equipment. Further south, towards the Terz Valley, a group of 14 insurgents on the run is spotted by the air force despite its attempt to conceal the vegetation. The group is annihilated by an air strike.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 488-491.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 210-214.</ref><ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Notin p. 482-488\"/> On March 4, some jihadists went to the French in the Ametettai Valley and the Garage. Among them are three child soldiers and a Nigerian who admitted to being Boko Haram fighters. From February 28 to March 4, according to the French General Staff, a dozen pick-ups and a 122- mm gun were destroyed and a lot of equipment and ammunition captured; including a BM-21, three other 122mm guns, a towable 100mm gun, an 82mm mortar and a 60mm mortar, weapons, rockets and anti-personnel mines.

They meet a small group of four jihadists who are all killed after two hours of fighting and whose last man is shot to less than one meter. Already visited twice in February, the \"camp of rocks\" is again searched by the special forces the night of March 4 to 5, and that of 6 to 7. They remain there even the next day before retiring. Then, on the morning of March 8, 200 paratroopers took control. The resistance is weaker than expected, a French lieutenant is wounded, and six jihadists are killed. Corpses of fighters probably killed by mortar fire a few days earlier are also discovered. For its part, the GTIA 3 goes down the valley of Integant and advances towards the \"camp of the sands\". Along the way, three jihadists are targeted by the firing of a tank. Two are killed, the third, wounded, traps the bodies of his comrades with grenades before being surprised again and shot not far away.

According to a statement from the Defense Ministry, he addresses the troops \"a message of pride and encouragement for the mission they perform against terrorist groups that had made the massive Ifoghas their sanctuary\".

The operation for the valley of Terz is named Panther VI by the French. The maneuver is close to Panther III ; GTIA 3 is to enter the valley from the west, GTIA 4 to the north by Tahor Pass to the north and Chadians to the east to close the lock.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 519.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 520.</ref><ref name=\"Bernard Barrera 2013, p. 263-264\">Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 263-264.</ref> However, the climatic conditions and the nature of the terrain put the vehicles and equipment of the Chadian forces under severe strain. Many armored vehicles have broken down, half of the AMX-10 RC can no longer ride and 200 infantrymen have no more shoes. For three days, the mechanics repaired the two tank squadrons, sometimes \"cannibalizing\" other vehicles, while new pairs of shoes were collected and returned to French soldiers for two days.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 215.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 251-256.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 496-497.</ref> On March 11, Chadians leave Aguel'hoc accompanied by French mortar gunners. They bypass the Adrar Tigharghar from the south and recognize the Assamalmal Valley. A battle occurs around 15 hours after. In a statement, the Chadian staff says that they had dead and wounded and have six dead and five prisoners among jihadists. However, General Barrera does not mention in his war notes of killed on both sides during this conflict. Later, he even said that Chadian soldiers would have encountered a lone fighter. On the 13th, two Chadians wounded by bullets are evacuated by a Puma.<ref name=\"Bernard Barrera 2013, p. 263-264\"/><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 250.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 252.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 303</ref> On the 15th, the GTIA 3 and 4 of the French army leave Tessalit while the Chadians leave the valley of Assamalmal, to take position east of the valley of Terz. The next day, the French enter the valley. The paratroopers do not encounter any resistance on the heights of Tahor, some empty pickups are bombarded by the air force and quickly the soldiers discover arms depots and food in shooting positions. The armor of the GTIA 4 is first preceded by sappers, but the column is late and must accelerate. Around 16 pm, a tank AMX 10 RC the 1 st RIMa hit a mine, three crew members were seriously burned and the driver is killed.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 272-278.</ref><ref>https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/actualites/serval-point-de-situation-sur-les-operations-du-lundi-18-mars</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 520-522.</ref> The next day the GTIA 3 gives up passing through the west entrance, considered too narrow and too risky, it bypasses the north to take the path taken by the GTIA 4, now secure. But while the French and Chadians expected to find strong resistance, it turns out that Terz was recently abandoned by jihadists. The valley is searched, a pickup containing a large stock of ammunition and shells is destroyed by the engineers. A 14.5&nbsp;mm machine gun, an anti-tank gun SPG-9, mortars and a missile 107 107 type firing station are also found in a cache. On March 20, the French and Chadian make their junction and Operation Panther VI ends the next day.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 522-524.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 279-295.</ref><ref>https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/operation-serval-point-de-situation-du-jeudi-21-mars</ref>\n\n===Operations in Adrar Tigharghar, from March 21 to 31===\nOn March 21, the French and Chadian forces moved south of the Adrar Tigharghar to the area known as \"Jason\", where there is an oasis called the \"Garden\", caves and the circus of Assamalmal - or Tigharghar - a natural amphitheater of 15&nbsp;km in diameter in the middle of which is a mineral desert. In March 23, GCPare dropped at night by helicopter near the Garden, but the area turned out to be empty. The Chadians approached the circus but they do not finded any passage that would allow vehicles to access the interior, the staff deduced that no material could be conveyed by the jihadists. There is nothing either on the side of the parachute dragons who search the Adrar Dourit from March 23 to 30. On March 23, the Chadians return to Aguel'hoc and the GTIA 4 does the same to Tessalit. The GTIA 3 returns in turn on March 25. From 21 to 25 March, 122 and 120&nbsp;mm shells, four boxes of PG9 rockets, 60&nbsp;mm mortarsand some mines were seized.<ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 524-529.</ref><ref>https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/operations/autres-operations/operations-achevees/operation-serval-2013-2014/actualite/operation-serval-point-de-situation-du-lundi-25-mars</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 297-307.</ref> In March 26, a company of the 2ond REP and another from the 1st RCP leads Operation Tigris in the town of Tessalit to search the city and to ensure the absence of any jihadi presence.

One of its subgroups led the operation Panth\u00e8re VIII, that went to recognize the valley of Assamalmal south of Adrar Tigharghar, then again the \"Garden\". A printing press is discovered during the excavations, as well as some stocks of weapons. The other sub-group, commanded by Colonel Gougeon, is leading the Renard operation with the Chadians. He go to Boghassa, then Abeibara. In the latter city, a Togolese jihadist is arrested. Generals Barrera and Bikimoand Colonel Gougeon then meet the notables and residents indicate the location of depots of weapons, medical equipment and ammunition. These transactions end on March 31.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 325-329.</ref><ref>https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/mali/actualite/operation-serval-point-de-situation-du-jeudi-4-avril-2013</ref> The Adrar Tigharghar is now considered empty and French troops begin to be disengaged. GTIA 3 returns to Kidal and on April 2 it is in Gao. In early April the GTIA  can repatriate and two of its SGTIA Abidjan, return to France after ten days in the Ivorian capital. On 5 April, Chadian forces return to Kidal. On 9 April, the French garrison of Tessalit rose in ten days from 2.000 to 400 men. In May, all the GTIAs engaged in Operation Serval were relieved and returned to France after a stopover in Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, to decompress at the request of General Barrera. Chadians, on the other hand, remain deployed much longer in the Kidal region; in September 160 soldiers of the Tessalit garrison desert the Amachach military camp after having complained of not having been relieved after nine months of mission in the great north of Mali.<ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 340.</ref><ref>Bernard Barrera, Op\u00e9ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 358.</ref><ref>Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 562.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130918-mali-160-soldats-tchadiens-desertent-position-tessalit-deby-keita-gao-fatim-garboa |title=Au Mali, pr\u00e8s de 160 soldats tchadiens d\u00e9sertent leur position \u00e0 Tessalit - RFI |publisher=Rfi.fr |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20130405-mali-troupes-tchadiennes-retour-kidal-nord-bataille-ifoghas-troupes-france-securisation-djihadistes |title=Reportage : les troupes tchadiennes de retour \u00e0 Kidal, bastion des Touareg |publisher=France 24 |date=2016-01-13 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Ifoghas completes the reconquest phase of northern Mali. After this defeat, the jihadists sought to blend in with the population and avoided clashes. In Terz Valley, even the French were discovering the cut beards the jihadists left. Salafist rebels now had gone underground. The jihadists left hundreds of dead in the first months of Operation Serval, and according to General Barrera, after their defeat in the Tighargh\u00e2r;\"They are no longer able to occupy the field, nor numerous enough to fight a classic battle. It only remains small terrorist groups conducting asymmetric warfare and avoid contact \". The jihadists then change their tactics and go to guerrilla warfare ; they carry out suicide attacks, ambush, fire rockets at military barracks, lay mines and IEDs on the roads, and kill supporters of the Malian government or the Tuareg rebellion. On 25 April, AQIM calls for jihad against France in a speech delivered by Abu Obeida Youssef al-Annabi. Iyad Ag Ghali reappears in turn on July 29, 2014 in a video and affirms his will to continue to fight the \"crusaders, with France in the lead\". On April 16, a pickup group spotted northwest of Tessalit was destroyed by French aviation.
