The story revolves around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of [[cricket]] as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny.\n\n''Lagaan'' received critical acclaim and awards at [[List of film festivals|international film festivals]], as well as many Indian film awards. It became the third [[Indian film]] to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] after ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957) and ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' (1988).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nIn 1893, a delayed monsoon has rendered the farmers of Champaner unable to grow any crops. They pay a visit to King Puran Singh to ask for exemption from the annual tax (''lagaan''). The king, a nominal figure under protection of the [[British Raj]], is at the Cantonment where a cricket match is underway between the British officers. At the game, a young farmer named Bhuvan ([[Aamir Khan]]) gets into a scuffle with one of the officers and ends up mocking the game in front of the commanding officer, Captain Andrew Russell ([[Paul Blackthorne]]). The short-tempered Captain challenges Bhuvan to a match of cricket in exchange for cancelling ''lagaan''. He raises the stakes by offering exemption for the next three years should the farmers win, but also asking for triple-tax should the farmers lose. Bhuvan accepts the challenge.\n\nAssembling a team proves to be difficult as the only people to support Bhuvan are his mother and Gauri, the daughter of the village medic. The next day, Bhuvan puts up a public display of cricket in the village square and gains two supporters - Bagha, a strong drummer and Guran, an eccentric astrologer. To learn the rules of the game, they start secretly going to the cantonment to observe the playing officers. Unexpected help comes in the form of Captain Russell's sister, Elizabeth ([[Rachel Shelley]]), who wants to give the farmers a fair chance by teaching them the game. With the help of an Indian translator, she starts meeting Bhuvan and his team at a ground outside their village. Soon, other villagers join the team. With a few weeks to go, Bhuvan is still missing one player and spots a hidden talent in Kachra, a cripple living on the fringes of the village. Kachra, bowling from his injured hand, can naturally spin the ball. The other team members threaten a walkout because Kachra is also an [[untouchability|untouchable]], but Bhuvan reminds them of the stakes and expresses belief that Kachra will prove to be their team\u2019s strongest weapon.\n\nThe day of the match arrives and the British team elects to bat. The match has taken on a new dimension for Captain Russell, because he has been commanded by his superiors to pay the exempted ''lagaan'' from his own pocket should his team lose the match. The British team lose early wickets thanks to the unconventional bowling style of the farmers; however, they end the day's play positively with Captain Russell leading the scoring. Kachra has been completely ineffective the whole day. At night, Elizabeth spies Lakha, a member of Bhuvan's team, talking to her brother. Lakha had been playing poorly that day and she informs Bhuvan of his betrayal. The villagers chase after Lakha to kill him but Bhuvan decides to give him another chance when Lakha confesses to being jealous of Gauri\u2019s love for Bhuvan. \n\nThe next day, Lakha redeems himself on the field and plays spiritedly. Kachra regains his ability to spin the ball, now that the ball has lost its hardness. He takes a [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]] and some quick wickets, and the British innings is over. The villagers\u2019 run chase starts promisingly but ends in disaster as the main batting order, apart from Bhuvan, lose their wickets before the end of the day. Defeat is now looming large. The next day, steady batting by Bhuvan and Ismail, an injured but capable player, gets them out of trouble. With victory in sight, Ismail is [[run out]] leaving Bhuvan to make the remaining runs. With an [[Over (cricket)|over]] left to play, Bhuvan loses strike and Kachra is forced to bat for the victory. With a boundary needed on the last ball, he only manages a single. The unbiased British umpire, however, calls a no-ball (illegal delivery), putting Bhuvan on strike for the replayed delivery. He swings and clears the boundary, winning the match for his team.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the Cantonment is disbanded, and the villagers watch as the British caravan departs Champaner, seemingly forever. Elizabeth, who had fallen in love with Bhuvan, steps out to bid him a tearful farewell. She returns to England and never marries, while Gauri and Bhuvan get married with great fanfare in the village.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Bhuvan Latha. Ashutosh first thought of having [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Bobby Deol]] and [[Abhishek Bachchan]] for the role of Bhuvan. After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with [[J. P.

The story revolves around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of [[cricket]] as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny.\n\n''Lagaan'' received critical acclaim and awards at [[List of film festivals|international film festivals]], as well as many Indian film awards. It became the third [[Indian film]] to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] after ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957) and ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' (1988).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nIn 1893, a delayed monsoon has rendered the farmers of Champaner unable to grow any crops. They pay a visit to King Puran Singh to ask for exemption from the annual tax (''lagaan''). The king, a nominal figure under protection of the [[British Raj]], is at the Cantonment where a cricket match is underway between the British officers. At the game, a young farmer named Bhuvan ([[Aamir Khan]]) gets into a scuffle with one of the officers and ends up mocking the game in front of the commanding officer, Captain Andrew Russell ([[Paul Blackthorne]]). The short-tempered Captain challenges Bhuvan to a match of cricket in exchange for cancelling ''lagaan''. He raises the stakes by offering exemption for the next three years should the farmers win, but also asking for triple-tax should the farmers lose. Bhuvan accepts the challenge.\n\nAssembling a team proves to be difficult as the only people to support Bhuvan are his mother and Gauri, the daughter of the village medic. The next day, Bhuvan puts up a public display of cricket in the village square and gains two supporters - Bagha, a strong drummer and Guran, an eccentric astrologer. To learn the rules of the game, they start secretly going to the cantonment to observe the playing officers. Unexpected help comes in the form of Captain Russell's sister, Elizabeth ([[Rachel Shelley]]), who wants to give the farmers a fair chance by teaching them the game. With the help of an Indian translator, she starts meeting Bhuvan and his team at a ground outside their village. Soon, other villagers join the team. With a few weeks to go, Bhuvan is still missing one player and spots a hidden talent in Kachra, a cripple living on the fringes of the village. Kachra, bowling from his injured hand, can naturally spin the ball. The other team members threaten a walkout because Kachra is also an [[untouchability|untouchable]], but Bhuvan reminds them of the stakes and expresses belief that Kachra will prove to be their team\u2019s strongest weapon.\n\nThe day of the match arrives and the British team elects to bat. The match has taken on a new dimension for Captain Russell, because he has been commanded by his superiors to pay the exempted ''lagaan'' from his own pocket should his team lose the match. The British team lose early wickets thanks to the unconventional bowling style of the farmers; however, they end the day's play positively with Captain Russell leading the scoring. Kachra has been completely ineffective the whole day. At night, Elizabeth spies Lakha, a member of Bhuvan's team, talking to her brother. Lakha had been playing poorly that day and she informs Bhuvan of his betrayal. The villagers chase after Lakha to kill him but Bhuvan decides to give him another chance when Lakha confesses to being jealous of Gauri\u2019s love for Bhuvan. \n\nThe next day, Lakha redeems himself on the field and plays spiritedly. Kachra regains his ability to spin the ball, now that the ball has lost its hardness. He takes a [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]] and some quick wickets, and the British innings is over. The villagers\u2019 run chase starts promisingly but ends in disaster as the main batting order, apart from Bhuvan, lose their wickets before the end of the day. Defeat is now looming large. The next day, steady batting by Bhuvan and Ismail, an injured but capable player, gets them out of trouble. With victory in sight, Ismail is [[run out]] leaving Bhuvan to make the remaining runs. With an [[Over (cricket)|over]] left to play, Bhuvan loses strike and Kachra is forced to bat for the victory. With a boundary needed on the last ball, he only manages a single. The unbiased British umpire, however, calls a no-ball (illegal delivery), putting Bhuvan on strike for the replayed delivery. He swings and clears the boundary, winning the match for his team.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the Cantonment is disbanded, and the villagers watch as the British caravan departs Champaner, seemingly forever. Elizabeth, who had fallen in love with Bhuvan, steps out to bid him a tearful farewell. She returns to England and never marries, while Gauri and Bhuvan get married with great fanfare in the village.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Bhuvan Latha.

The film explores the life and imagination of  Ishaan, an 8-year-old  [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a [[boarding school]]. Ishaan's new art teacher suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his disability. [[Darsheel Safary]] stars as 8-year-old Ishaan, and Khan plays his art teacher.\n\nCreative director and writer [[Amole Gupte]] initially developed the idea with his wife [[Deepa Bhatia]], who served as the film's editor.  [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]] composed the film's score, and [[Prasoon Joshi]] wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in [[Mumbai]] and in [[Panchgani]]'s [[New Era High School]], and some of the school's students make appearances.\n\nThe film made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, and [[UTV Software Communications|UTV Home Entertainment]] released a DVD for Indian audiences in 2008. [[Disney]]'s later release of the international edition DVD marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a global company.\n\n''Taare Zameen Par'' has received numerous awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Film]] for 2008 and the 2008 [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare]]. It was India's official entry for the 2009 [[List of submissions to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards Best Foreign Film]], but did not progress to the short-list.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIshaan Awasthi is an 8 year-old boy who dislikes school, as he finds all the subjects difficult and is frequently belittled and berated by both his teachers and his classmates. His imagination, [[creativity]] and talent for art are often disregarded or unnoticed. His father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his children to excel, and his mother, Maya Awasthi, is a housewife frustrated by her inability to educate Ishaan. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan Awasthi, is an exemplary student and athlete whose merits Ishaan is often ashamed of.\n\nAfter receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's father sends him to a [[boarding school]]. There he rapidly sinks into a state of fear, isolation and [[depression (mood)|depression]], despite being befriended by Rajan Damodharan, a [[disability|physically disabled]] boy who is one of the top students in the class. Ishaan is anguished due to missing his parents, the boarding school teachers being even more abusive than the previous school\u2019s, and starting to feel that he genuinely was a failure. Ishaan contemplates [[suicide]], climbing up the fence in a terrace, but Rajan intervenes, saving him.\n\nIshaan's condition changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, a cheerful and optimistic instructor at the Tulips School for young children with [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], joins the school. Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict and abusive predecessor, and he quickly observes Ishaan's unhappiness and impassive participation in class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of [[dyslexia]], a condition suppressing his artistic capabilities. One day he sets off to Mumbai to visit Ishaan's parents where he is surprised to discover Ishaan's hidden interest in art after finding some of his drawings. Upset, he asks Mr Awasthi why he sent the child to a boarding school in the first place and shows Mrs Awasthi her son's notebooks giving an analysis of his struggles. He explains how Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words due to dyslexia even though Mr Awasthi, labelling it as mental retardation, dismisses it as a mere excuse for laziness. Frustrated by his crude and inaccurate explanation of Ishaan's condition, Nikumbh leaves. Mr Awasthi finally feels guilty for his mistreatment towards Ishaan.\n\nNikumbh returns and subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in a class by offering a [[List of people diagnosed with dyslexia|list of famous people who were dyslexic]]. Afterwards, he comforts Ishaan by telling him how he struggled as a child as well by facing similar problems. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's [[tutor]]. With gradual care, he attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using [[Dyslexia#Management|remedial techniques]] developed by dyslexia specialists. Ishaan soon develops an interest in his studies and eventually his grades improve.\n\nTowards the end of the school year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, is declared the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Mr. Awasthi thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:DarsheelSafary.jpg|thumb|alt=A smiling, young Indian boy wearing a red T-shirt, blue and white jacket, and red hat.|165px|right|[[Darsheel Safary]]'s initial screentest lacked dialogue. When [[Aamir Khan]] saw the expression in his eyes and face, however, he instantly knew, \"That's the child. He is Ishaan.\"<ref>Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making.... Event occurs at approximately 3:50</ref>]]\n* [[Darsheel Safary]] as Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi: In looking for an actor to play the central figure of Ishaan, writer [[Amole Gupte]] turned to [[Shiamak Davar]]'s Summer Funk workshops.

Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with ''[[The Hindu]]'' that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]], who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of \"a child who did not fit into the school stream.\" She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawa's biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene \"became the inspiration for how a teacher could transform the life of a student\".<ref name=\"leap\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008020350030200.htm&date=2008/02/03/&prd=mag& |title=A leap of faith |last=Vij |first=Gauri |date=3 February 2008 |website=The Hindu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407235243/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008020350030200.htm&date=2008%2F02%2F03%2F&prd=mag& |archive-date=7 April 2008 |access-date=11 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in the final version of the script.<ref name=leap />\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"While Amole has written what I think is a brilliant and moving script, his contribution towards the film is not limited to that of a writer.

This subplot, which was filmed but later cut, would have tied into the original ending for the movie. In this planned ending, a \"ghost image\" separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a freeze frame of Ishaan's \"ghost image\" successfully making the leap. Aamir Khan, however, disliked this proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it.\n\nWith the working title no longer relevant,<ref name=\"deleted\">{{cite video|people=Khan, Aamir |date=12 January 2010 |title=Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: Deleted Scenes |medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}</ref> Khan, Gupte, and Bhatia discussed several alternatives,<ref name=proud /> eventually deciding on ''Taare Zameen Par.'' Possible translations of this title include ''Stars on the Ground''<ref name=ground /> and ''Stars on Earth''.<ref name=reutersosc /> According to Khan:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Taare Zameen Par'' is a film about children and it is a film which celebrates the abilities of children. ''Taare Zameen Par'' is a title which denotes that aspect. It is a title with a very positive feel to it. All the kids are special and wonderful. They are like stars on earth.

Event occurs at approximately 20:00</ref> Khan spent his first two days as director [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] the first scene to be filmed\u2014Ishaan returning home from school and putting away his recently collected fish\u2014and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

Event occurs at approximately 15:15</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Khan also made use of illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan collecting fish outside his school was shot on location and at [[Film City]]. Shots focusing on Ishaan took place at the former, while those involving the gutter [[Vivarium|terrarium]] were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film.<ref name=\"2:45\">''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 2:45</ref> The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the \"absolutely petrified\" Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 8:30</ref> Ishaan's nightmare\u2014he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd\u2014was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set.

The production team searched for a Mumbai school with an \"oppressive\" feel to establish the \"heaviness of being in a metropolitan school\",<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''.

Event occurs at approximately 23:00</ref> [[New Era High School]] served as Ishaan's boarding school. The change of setting was a \"breath of fresh air\" for the production crew, who moved from Ishaan's small house in Mysore Colony, [[Chembur]] to the \"vast, beautiful environs\" of [[Panchgani]].<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 11:00</ref>\n\nProduction relied on [[stock footage]] for the brief scene of a bird feeding its babies. Khan carefully selected a clip to his liking, but learned three weeks before the film's release that the footage was not available in the proper format. With three days to replace it or else risk delaying the release, Khan made do with what he could find. He says that he \"cringes\" every time he sees it.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:00:15</ref>\n\n=== Children ===\nReal schoolchildren participated throughout the movie's filming. Khan credited them with the film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them.<ref name=bends /> Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went to great lengths to attend to them.<ref name=proud /> The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 16:00</ref> New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and co-operation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 35:00</ref> Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate.<ref name=\"bumbum\">''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:11:30</ref> To fill in the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''.

Event occurs at approximately 2:14:00</ref>\n\nNew to acting, the children often made errors such as staring into the camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised that this would be a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to \"bore the hell out of [them]\", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 21:00</ref> A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and the children's responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3\u20134&nbsp;days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were \"jaded\". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:49:00</ref> The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was {{convert|15|ft}} deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:56:00</ref>\n\nKhan found it important that the audience connect the film to real children, and had Pandey travel throughout India filming documentary-style footage of children from all walks of life. Those visuals were integrated into the end credits.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was not turning out as he had envisioned it.

Event occurs at approximately 1:26:15</ref>\n\n=== Musical sequences ===\nThe musical sequence of \"Jame Raho\" establishes the characters of the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an \"ideal son\" who does all the right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence\u2014this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan\u2014but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he is different from the rest. This concept is furthered by [[Slow motion#In action films|speed ramping]] and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 17:30</ref> The twilight scenes of \"Maa\" were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample\u2014they planned to replace him with another singer\u2014but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

In his opinion, the accompanying song should focus on what a child wants\u2014to be free\u2014and be told from the first-person perspective instead of \"Kholo Kholo{{\"'}}s second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use \"Mera Jahan\"\u2014a song written by Gupte\u2014and moved \"Kholo Kholo\" to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained that it was too long, did not make sense, and merely showed \"touristy\" visuals of Mumbai.

Instead of using a studio, he and the trio [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]] recorded it at Khan's home in Panchgani, to clear their heads and not be in the mindset of the city. As they watched the film, Khan pointed out when he wanted music to begin and of what type. Ehsaan Noorani noted that this strategy allowed the score to have a \"spontaneity to it.\"<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 55:00</ref>\n\nDifferent styles of background music were used to convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes.<ref name=\"2:45\" /> The music of the opening scene\u2014the recurring \"Ishaan's Theme,\" which represents the character's peace of mind\u2014overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps back to reality.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 4:30</ref> But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma.

They also felt it blended \"modern professional knowledge\" with a \"humane approach\" in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the \"present age where everyone is in a restless hurry\". The pair wrote, \"This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading to a state of mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?\" The film depicts how \"threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children\", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan \"dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities\". Overall, the pair found a \"naive oversimplification\" in the film.

The film explores the life and imagination of  Ishaan, an 8-year-old  [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a [[boarding school]]. Ishaan's new art teacher suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his disability. [[Darsheel Safary]] stars as 8-year-old Ishaan, and Khan plays his art teacher.\n\nCreative director and writer [[Amole Gupte]] initially developed the idea with his wife [[Deepa Bhatia]], who served as the film's editor.  [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]] composed the film's score, and [[Prasoon Joshi]] wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in [[Mumbai]] and in [[Panchgani]]'s [[New Era High School]], and some of the school's students make appearances.\n\nThe film made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, and [[UTV Software Communications|UTV Home Entertainment]] released a DVD for Indian audiences in 2008. [[Disney]]'s later release of the international edition DVD marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a global company.\n\n''Taare Zameen Par'' has received numerous awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Film]] for 2008 and the 2008 [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare]]. It was India's official entry for the 2009 [[List of submissions to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards Best Foreign Film]], but did not progress to the short-list.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIshaan Awasthi is an 8 year-old boy who dislikes school, as he finds all the subjects difficult and is frequently belittled and berated by both his teachers and his classmates. His imagination, [[creativity]] and talent for art are often disregarded or unnoticed. His father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his children to excel, and his mother, Maya Awasthi, is a housewife frustrated by her inability to educate Ishaan. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan Awasthi, is an exemplary student and athlete whose merits Ishaan is often ashamed of.\n\nAfter receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's father sends him to a [[boarding school]]. There he rapidly sinks into a state of fear, isolation and [[depression (mood)|depression]], despite being befriended by Rajan Damodharan, a [[disability|physically disabled]] boy who is one of the top students in the class. Ishaan is anguished due to missing his parents, the boarding school teachers being even more abusive than the previous school\u2019s, and starting to feel that he genuinely was a failure. Ishaan contemplates [[suicide]], climbing up the fence in a terrace, but Rajan intervenes, saving him.\n\nIshaan's condition changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, a cheerful and optimistic instructor at the Tulips School for young children with [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], joins the school. Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict and abusive predecessor, and he quickly observes Ishaan's unhappiness and impassive participation in class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of [[dyslexia]], a condition suppressing his artistic capabilities. One day he sets off to Mumbai to visit Ishaan's parents where he is surprised to discover Ishaan's hidden interest in art after finding some of his drawings. Upset, he asks Mr Awasthi why he sent the child to a boarding school in the first place and shows Mrs Awasthi her son's notebooks giving an analysis of his struggles. He explains how Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words due to dyslexia even though Mr Awasthi, labelling it as mental retardation, dismisses it as a mere excuse for laziness. Frustrated by his crude and inaccurate explanation of Ishaan's condition, Nikumbh leaves. Mr Awasthi finally feels guilty for his mistreatment towards Ishaan.\n\nNikumbh returns and subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in a class by offering a [[List of people diagnosed with dyslexia|list of famous people who were dyslexic]]. Afterwards, he comforts Ishaan by telling him how he struggled as a child as well by facing similar problems. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's [[tutor]]. With gradual care, he attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using [[Dyslexia#Management|remedial techniques]] developed by dyslexia specialists. Ishaan soon develops an interest in his studies and eventually his grades improve.\n\nTowards the end of the school year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, is declared the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Mr. Awasthi thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:DarsheelSafary.jpg|thumb|alt=A smiling, young Indian boy wearing a red T-shirt, blue and white jacket, and red hat.|165px|right|[[Darsheel Safary]]'s initial screentest lacked dialogue.

Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with ''[[The Hindu]]'' that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]], who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of \"a child who did not fit into the school stream.\" She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawa's biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene \"became the inspiration for how a teacher could transform the life of a student\".<ref name=\"leap\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008020350030200.htm&date=2008/02/03/&prd=mag& |title=A leap of faith |last=Vij |first=Gauri |date=3 February 2008 |website=The Hindu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407235243/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008020350030200.htm&date=2008%2F02%2F03%2F&prd=mag& |archive-date=7 April 2008 |access-date=11 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in the final version of the script.<ref name=leap />\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"While Amole has written what I think is a brilliant and moving script, his contribution towards the film is not limited to that of a writer.

This subplot, which was filmed but later cut, would have tied into the original ending for the movie. In this planned ending, a \"ghost image\" separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a freeze frame of Ishaan's \"ghost image\" successfully making the leap. Aamir Khan, however, disliked this proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it.\n\nWith the working title no longer relevant,<ref name=\"deleted\">{{cite video|people=Khan, Aamir |date=12 January 2010 |title=Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: Deleted Scenes |medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}</ref> Khan, Gupte, and Bhatia discussed several alternatives,<ref name=proud /> eventually deciding on ''Taare Zameen Par.'' Possible translations of this title include ''Stars on the Ground''<ref name=ground /> and ''Stars on Earth''.<ref name=reutersosc /> According to Khan:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Taare Zameen Par'' is a film about children and it is a film which celebrates the abilities of children. ''Taare Zameen Par'' is a title which denotes that aspect. It is a title with a very positive feel to it. All the kids are special and wonderful. They are like stars on earth. This particular aspect gave birth to the title.<ref name=\"proud\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/12/18/3372/index.html |title=TZP makes me a proud actor, producer and a director |last=Patel |first=Devansh |date=18 December 2007 |publisher=Bollywood Hungama |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rZ0E9jcj?url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/12/18/3372/index.html |archive-date=28 July 2010 |access-date=12 May 2009}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in India over five months.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 20:00</ref> Khan spent his first two days as director [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] the first scene to be filmed\u2014Ishaan returning home from school and putting away his recently collected fish\u2014and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 10:15</ref> Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style for the film that involved relatively little [[Cinematography#Camera movement|camera movement]].<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 15:15</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Khan also made use of illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan collecting fish outside his school was shot on location and at [[Film City]]. Shots focusing on Ishaan took place at the former, while those involving the gutter [[Vivarium|terrarium]] were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film.<ref name=\"2:45\">''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 2:45</ref> The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the \"absolutely petrified\" Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 8:30</ref> Ishaan's nightmare\u2014he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd\u2014was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set. To work around the train set piece's immobility, production placed the camera on a moving trolley to create the illusion of a departing train. For the sequences related from the mother's point of view\u2014shot from behind the actress\u2014Chopra stood on a trolley next to a recreated section of the train's door.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 48:00</ref>\n\nAll the school sequences were filmed on location. The production team searched for a Mumbai school with an \"oppressive\" feel to establish the \"heaviness of being in a metropolitan school\",<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 10:00</ref> and eventually chose [[:Category:Jesuit schools in India|St. Xavier's School]].<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video|people= |date=12 January 2010 |title=Like Stars on Earth |medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}</ref> As the school is situated along a main road filming took place on weekends, to minimise the background noise, but an early scene in which Ishaan is sent out of the classroom was filmed on the day of the [[Mumbai Marathon]]. The production staff placed acrylic sheets invisible to the naked eye on the classroom windows to mask the sounds of nearby crowds and helicopters.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 23:00</ref> [[New Era High School]] served as Ishaan's boarding school. The change of setting was a \"breath of fresh air\" for the production crew, who moved from Ishaan's small house in Mysore Colony, [[Chembur]] to the \"vast, beautiful environs\" of [[Panchgani]].<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 11:00</ref>\n\nProduction relied on [[stock footage]] for the brief scene of a bird feeding its babies. Khan carefully selected a clip to his liking, but learned three weeks before the film's release that the footage was not available in the proper format. With three days to replace it or else risk delaying the release, Khan made do with what he could find. He says that he \"cringes\" every time he sees it.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:00:15</ref>\n\n=== Children ===\nReal schoolchildren participated throughout the movie's filming. Khan credited them with the film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them.<ref name=bends /> Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went to great lengths to attend to them.<ref name=proud /> The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 16:00</ref> New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and co-operation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 35:00</ref> Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate.<ref name=\"bumbum\">''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:11:30</ref> To fill in the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 18:00</ref> A total of 1,500&nbsp;children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400&nbsp;students.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 2:14:00</ref>\n\nNew to acting, the children often made errors such as staring into the camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised that this would be a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to \"bore the hell out of [them]\", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 21:00</ref> A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and the children's responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3\u20134&nbsp;days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were \"jaded\". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:49:00</ref> The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was {{convert|15|ft}} deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:56:00</ref>\n\nKhan found it important that the audience connect the film to real children, and had Pandey travel throughout India filming documentary-style footage of children from all walks of life. Those visuals were integrated into the end credits.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

Event occurs at approximately 53:45</ref> The storyboarding took one and a half months and the shooting required 15&nbsp;days.<ref name=cp /> The \"3 into 9\" sequence, in which Ishaan delves into his imagination to solve a math problem, was originally conceived as a 3D animation. Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was not turning out as he had envisioned it. Khan scrapped the project and hired Vaibhav Kumaresh, who hand-drew the scene as a 2D animation.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 51:30</ref>\n\nArtist [[Samir Mondal]] composed Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair watercolour paintings. He held a workshop with the schoolchildren, and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaan's.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''.

Event occurs at approximately 1:38:00</ref> The art department's designs for Ishaan's school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:26:15</ref>\n\n=== Musical sequences ===\nThe musical sequence of \"Jame Raho\" establishes the characters of the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an \"ideal son\" who does all the right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence\u2014this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan\u2014but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he is different from the rest. This concept is furthered by [[Slow motion#In action films|speed ramping]] and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 17:30</ref> The twilight scenes of \"Maa\" were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample\u2014they planned to replace him with another singer\u2014but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 51:00</ref>\n[[File:Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy Raymond Weil.jpg|thumb|The trio of [[Shankar Mahadevan]] (right), [[Ehsaan Noorani]] (middle), and [[Loy Mendonsa]] (left) composed most of the film's music.]]\nIshaan's truancy scene\u2014he leaves school one day after realising that his mother has not signed his failed math test\u2014originally coincided with the song \"Kholo Kholo,\" but Khan did not believe it worked well for the situation. In his opinion, the accompanying song should focus on what a child wants\u2014to be free\u2014and be told from the first-person perspective instead of \"Kholo Kholo{{\"'}}s second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use \"Mera Jahan\"\u2014a song written by Gupte\u2014and moved \"Kholo Kholo\" to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained that it was too long, did not make sense, and merely showed \"touristy\" visuals of Mumbai. Khan nevertheless kept the scene, because he \"connected deeply\" with it and felt that it established Ishaan's world.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 28:45</ref>\n\n[[Shiamak Davar]] choreographed the dance sequence of \"Bum Bum Bole,\" and was given free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40&nbsp;students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers.<ref name=\"bumbum\" /> Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product up to them to avoid a choreographed appearance.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 45:00</ref> Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming \"Bum Bum Bole,\" [[Ram Madhvani]] took over as director for \"Bheja Kum\".<ref name=\"bumbum\" /><ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

Instead of using a studio, he and the trio [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]] recorded it at Khan's home in Panchgani, to clear their heads and not be in the mindset of the city. As they watched the film, Khan pointed out when he wanted music to begin and of what type. Ehsaan Noorani noted that this strategy allowed the score to have a \"spontaneity to it.\"<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 55:00</ref>\n\nDifferent styles of background music were used to convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes.<ref name=\"2:45\" /> The music of the opening scene\u2014the recurring \"Ishaan's Theme,\" which represents the character's peace of mind\u2014overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps back to reality.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 4:30</ref> But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:38:30</ref>\n\n=== Promotional material ===\nWhen filming part of the montage that details Ishaan's tutoring by Nikumbh, Khan immediately decided it would be the \"key art of the film\".

Labeling Ishaan an example of \"dyslexic savant syndrome\", he especially praised the growth of Ishaan's artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the \"most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon\" of the film.

S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T.

They also felt it blended \"modern professional knowledge\" with a \"humane approach\" in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the \"present age where everyone is in a restless hurry\". The pair wrote, \"This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading to a state of mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?\" The film depicts how \"threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children\", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan \"dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities\". Overall, the pair found a \"naive oversimplification\" in the film. With India \"only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability\", however, they \"easily [forgave the film's fault] under artistic license\".<ref name=\"ground\">{{Cite journal |last=Rao |first=T.

Like most Semitic scripts, it is an [[abjad]], where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel.\n\nAlthough it appears similar to Mesopotamian cuneiform (whose writing techniques it borrowed), its symbols and symbol meanings are unrelated. It is the oldest example of the family of West Semitic scripts such as the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]], and [[Aramaic alphabet]]s (including the [[Hebrew alphabet]]). The so-called \"long alphabet\" has 30 letters while the \"short alphabet\" has 22. Other languages (particularly [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]) were occasionally written in it in the Ugarit area, although not elsewhere.\n\n[[Clay tablet]]s written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the Levantine ordering of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic order of the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets; and the South Semitic order, which gave rise to the order of the [[Ge'ez script]]. The script was written from left to right.\n\n==Phonology==\nUgaritic had 28 consonantal [[phoneme]]s (including two [[semivowel]]s) and eight [[vowel]] phonemes (three short vowels and five long vowels): ''a \u0101 i \u012b u \u016b \u0113 \u014d''. The phonemes ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d'' occur only as long vowels and are the result of [[monophthongization]] of the [[diphthong]]s ''ay'' and ''aw'', respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+Ugaritic consonantal phonemes{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2 colspan=2|\n!rowspan=2| [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Interdental consonant|Interdental]]\n!colspan=2| [[Dental consonant|Dental/Alveolar]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Pharyngeal consonant|Pharyngeal]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!

Like most Semitic scripts, it is an [[abjad]], where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel.\n\nAlthough it appears similar to Mesopotamian cuneiform (whose writing techniques it borrowed), its symbols and symbol meanings are unrelated. It is the oldest example of the family of West Semitic scripts such as the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]], and [[Aramaic alphabet]]s (including the [[Hebrew alphabet]]). The so-called \"long alphabet\" has 30 letters while the \"short alphabet\" has 22. Other languages (particularly [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]) were occasionally written in it in the Ugarit area, although not elsewhere.\n\n[[Clay tablet]]s written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the Levantine ordering of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic order of the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets; and the South Semitic order, which gave rise to the order of the [[Ge'ez script]]. The script was written from left to right.\n\n==Phonology==\nUgaritic had 28 consonantal [[phoneme]]s (including two [[semivowel]]s) and eight [[vowel]] phonemes (three short vowels and five long vowels): ''a \u0101 i \u012b u \u016b \u0113 \u014d''. The phonemes ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d'' occur only as long vowels and are the result of [[monophthongization]] of the [[diphthong]]s ''ay'' and ''aw'', respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+Ugaritic consonantal phonemes{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2 colspan=2|\n!rowspan=2| [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Interdental consonant|Interdental]]\n!colspan=2| [[Dental consonant|Dental/Alveolar]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Pharyngeal consonant|Pharyngeal]]\n!rowspan=2| [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!
