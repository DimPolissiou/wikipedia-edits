The [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event was held on November 9, 1997, at the [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]] in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The manipulation \u2013 a \"[[shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] [[screwjob]]\" in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|professional wrestling parlance]] \u2013 occurred without Hart's knowledge and resulted in Hart, the reigning [[WWE Champion|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]], losing the title to Michaels in his last WWF match before departing for rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). The \"screwjob\" is generally believed to be an off-screen betrayal of Hart, who was one of the WWF's longest-tenured and most popular performers at the time.\n\nHart won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in August 1997. A week prior to Survivor Series, Hart, who had performed for the WWF since 1984, signed a contract to join WCW beginning in December 1997. McMahon sought to prevent Hart from leaving the company as the champion, but Hart was unwilling to lose the title to Michaels \u2013 with whom he had a long feud both on-screen and off \u2013 at Survivor Series in his home country of Canada. Hart, Michaels, and McMahon came to an agreement where the Survivor Series match would end with a disqualification, which under normal rules would result in Hart retaining the title. Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date. However, McMahon decided without Hart's knowledge that Michaels would win the title at Survivor Series. Accounts differ as to who exactly was involved in the plan and the extent of their involvement. The plan was executed when match referee [[Earl Hebner]], on direct orders from McMahon, ended the match as Michaels held Hart in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] [[Grappling hold|submission hold]], Hart's signature finishing move, even though Hart had not submitted. Michaels was declared the winner by submission and crowned as the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nThe Montreal Screwjob has garnered a notorious legacy both on-screen and off, and was partly chronicled in the documentary film ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'' (1998). The far-reaching impact of the incident led to its adoption as a theme in matches and storylines of the WWF's [[The Attitude Era|\"Attitude Era\"]] and the creation of the character of \"[[Vince McMahon#Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Mr. McMahon: 1997\u20131999|Mr. McMahon]],\" the evil boss. Many wrestling fans, and several within the business, believe the entire incident was an elaborate [[Work (professional wrestling)|work]] executed in [[#Legitimacy|collaboration with Hart]]. Nonetheless, Hart was ostracized from the WWF while McMahon and Michaels continued to receive angry responses from Canadian audiences for many years. Hart and McMahon later reconciled, and Hart was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006. On the January 4, 2010 episode of ''WWE Raw'', Hart, in his first live appearance on WWE television since the 1997 Survivor Series, had a lengthy on-screen discussion with Michaels about the Montreal Screwjob and other events in their past, and agreed to call a truce, bringing closure to the incident after more than 12 years.<ref name=\"calgary\"/><ref name=\"baltimore\"/> Hart would defeat McMahon at [[WrestleMania 26]] in a match built around lingering animosity from the Screwjob.<ref>{{Citation|title=Bret Hart vs. Mr. McMahon - No Holds Barred Lumberjack Match: WrestleMania 26|url=https://www.wwe.com/videos/bret-hart-vs-mr-mcmahon-wrestlemania-26-no-holds-barred-lumberjack-match|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> Longtime industry writer Mike Johnson referred to the 1997 Survivor Series bout in which the Screwjob occurred as \"arguably the most talked-about match in the history of professional wrestling\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/97719/119-this-day-in-history-bret-hart-vs-shawn-michaels-in-montreal.html|title=11/9 This Day in History: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels in Montreal|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=November 9, 2015|website=PWInsider|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Hart's departure from the WWF==\n[[File:BretHartJuly242005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bret Hart|Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart]]]]\nAt the time of the screwjob, Bret Hart was a 14-year veteran of the WWF, having got his first break in the promotion in the 1980s as one-half of the hated [[The Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]] [[tag team]] with his brother-in-law [[Jim Neidhart]] and manager [[Jimmy Hart]]. After the team had two reigns as the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] -  splitting from Jimmy Hart and becoming [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]] between reigns -  Hart then achieved tremendous success as a singles performer in the 1990s, twice taking the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Title]], and then winning the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] five times. Between his fourth and fifth reigns, he took a seven-month leave of absence from the company after [[WrestleMania XII]], during which he considered contract offers from both the WWF and its rival, WCW. In October 1996, Hart declined a three-year, $8.4 million offer from WCW, instead opting to sign an unprecedented 20-year deal offered by McMahon, which promised to make him the highest-paid wrestler in the company and secure him a major role with the company management following his retirement. Both Hart and the WWF saw the contract as an expression of mutual loyalty.<ref name=\"DM\">{{cite magazine|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|date=1997-11-17|url=http://www.brethart.com/facts.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406153712/http://www.brethart.com/facts.asp|archivedate=2006-04-06|title=Montreal Screwjob|magazine=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref><ref name=\"MF\">{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=624|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1997, however, the WWF was facing financial difficulties due to stiff competition from WCW, which had become the largest professional wrestling promotion in the United States. At the same time, McMahon was planning to [[Initial public offering|make the WWF a publicly traded company]] (even though the WWF wouldn't go public until 1999), a move which required him to minimize any long-term financial commitments.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thebiggestrivalries/a/shawnvsbret.htm|title=Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart|last=Cohen|first=Eric|publisher=Prowrestling at About.com|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>\n\nFor several months prior to the 1997 Survivor Series, Hart and Shawn Michaels had several backstage arguments, culminating in a fight before a [[house show]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (after Michaels had publicly accused Hart of having an affair with [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]]) that saw Michaels suspended for two months. After a show in [[San Jose, California]] on October 12, 1997, Hart claimed he spoke to Michaels about being professional and trusting one another in the ring; Hart allegedly said he would have no problem losing to Michaels if McMahon requested. He also claimed that when Michaels replied that he \"would not be willing to do the same\" to Hart, Hart was shocked and became angry.<ref name = \"BH1\"/> This led to Hart's outright refusal to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Michaels at the pay-per-view event in Montreal, although in [[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows|Hart's documentary]], Hart states to McMahon that he would happily drop the belt but not in Canada. However, in his own autobiography, Michaels refuted Hart's claim, saying that he would have cleanly lost to Hart had storylines demanded so (however others, including [[Jim Cornette]] in various shoot interviews, have often refuted this, saying that they knew first-hand that Michaels had no intention of losing cleanly to Hart). Michaels also pointed out that he had lost cleanly to Hart several times in the past, most notably in the WWF's first ever [[ladder match]] at a ''[[WWF Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'' taping on July 21, 1992, which would subsequently be made available on multiple [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum/WWE Home Video]] releases<ref>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm WWF @ Portland, ME - Civic Center - July 21, 1992]. The History of WWE. Retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref> and in the main event of the 1992 [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]]. Michaels also lost to Hart in a [[Steel cage|Steel Cage]] match in December 1993.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm WWF @ Utica, NY - War Memorial - December 1, 1993 (4,500)].

However, by September 22, 1997, the WWF's monetary problems were at an all-time high. McMahon began to defer payments to Hart, claiming that the WWF was in \"financial peril.\" At this time, McMahon reviewed the WWF's plans for the future, and saw the likes of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[The Undertaker]], and [[D-Generation X]] leading what was to become \"[[The Attitude Era]]\". However, McMahon's plans did not include Hart; McMahon therefore encouraged Hart to reopen negotiations with WCW.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\nWhile Hart considered an offer from then-WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]], McMahon informed Hart that the WWF would honor his contract if he chose to stay. However, when Hart talked to McMahon about future plans and storylines, he was disappointed by McMahon's response and what he considered lackluster suggestions. At the time, Hart felt as though his career had been sabotaged by changes to his character, which had been retooled as an anti-America [[Canadian nationalism|Canadian nationalist]]; as a result, he drew significant ire from American audiences, but remained a hero in his native Canada. As a result, he was neither a hero nor a villain, and as such could not be properly placed into feuds with other wrestlers with more concrete personas. Hart had also been unhappy about McMahon's move towards more controversial subject matter, which would become a staple of the company's product during the Attitude Era. Convinced that McMahon's future plans did not include him, Hart resigned from the WWF and signed an agreement with WCW, which had just offered him a large $3 million per annum contract on November 1, 1997<!--offer or acceptance?-->. Hart's signing the WCW deal caused McMahon to worry about the possibility of Hart entering WCW while still WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hart asked McMahon if he would be mocked after leaving for WCW, as had occurred with other wrestlers who had transferred to WCW from the WWF (for example, [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]] in the \"Billionaire Ted\" sketches of early 1996, and [[Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]] after they joined WCW later in 1996). McMahon assured him that nothing of the sort would happen. Despite this, on the night after the Montreal Screwjob on ''Monday Night Raw'', D-Generation X performed a segment mockingly re-enacting the match between Michaels and Hart, with a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] dressed as Bret.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n==Title transition==\n[[File:Vince McMahon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vince McMahon]]]]\nHart's imminent move to WCW created a tense situation, as he had won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam 1997]] from [[The Undertaker]]. His WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, one month after the WWF's annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal.<ref name=\"MF1\"/> Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging [[D-Generation X]] [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], had been booked into a main event title match with Hart at that show. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought his consent to [[Job (professional wrestling)|job]] to Michaels. Hart, however, refused to give up the title to a member of [[The Kliq]] (a group that included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, [[Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], and [[Sean Waltman]] that had previously held enormous backstage influence), apparently standing up for the rest of the locker room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart. Wrestling fans also knew of Hart's long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels\u2014Hart had been angered at Michaels' forfeiture of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in February 1997, ruining plans for a Hart\u2013Michaels rematch at [[WrestleMania 13]], where Michaels was expected to lose the title to him.<ref name=\"MF1\">{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=625|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}</ref> Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to get out of their planned match.<ref name=\"SM6\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/240 240]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/240}}</ref><ref name=\"PWT\">{{cite web|title=An interview with Bret Hart |archivedate=2006-12-03 |accessdate=2007-02-22 |url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/17464 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203042631/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/17464 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> While Michaels denied rumors that he did not want to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it,<ref name=\"SM2\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/176 176]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/176}}</ref> Hart felt certain that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF.<ref name=\"WCW\">{{cite book|first=R.D.|last=Reynolds|author2=Bryan Alvarez|title=The Death of WCW|page=108|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-661-4}}</ref> The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF [[Manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]].<ref name=\"About\" /> The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart's father [[Stu Hart]], which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset.<ref name=\"DM\"/> McMahon's offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.<ref>{{cite book|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/241 241]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/241}}</ref>\n\nMcMahon remained insistent about Hart dropping the title. The WWF owner was anxious over Hart pulling a move like that of former employee [[Debrah Miceli]]. Miceli, a veteran women's wrestler who has competed under the name Madusa for most of her career, performed as Alundra Blayze in the WWF from 1993\u20131995 and won the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Championship]] during her stay there. McMahon, however, had neglected to renew her contract when it expired and Miceli signed with WCW where she changed her ring name back to Madusa. When she made her first appearance on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', Madusa made fun of her time in the WWF and brought her title belt with her to the program, dumping it into a trash can. McMahon feared a repeat, despite claims from Bischoff (according to Hart's DVD biography)<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AOEPU2|title=WWE: Bret \"Hitman\" Hart - The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be|date=3 May 2011|publisher=|via=Amazon}}</ref> that legal issues between the WWF and WCW would prevent such a thing, and that he would rather have Hart join WCW with a \"clean slate\". Hart continued to refuse to drop the title to Michaels, offering to lose the title anywhere in the United States prior to ''Survivor Series'' or to surrender the title to McMahon on the episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' the day after ''Survivor Series'', in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref name=\"WCW\" /> After several disagreements, McMahon, Michaels and Hart agreed to a proposal of a disqualification finish, which would be the result of a brawl between Hart's allies [[Owen Hart]], [[Jim Neidhart]], and [[Davey Boy Smith]] with Michaels's allies [[Triple H]] and [[Chyna]], who would interfere in the match to aid Michaels.<ref name=\"MF3\">{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=626|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}</ref> Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date, as he was not due to start in WCW until December. Hart also asked for and obtained McMahon's permission for an opportunity to explain his actions, his heel character, praise McMahon and the WWF and thus leave on good terms with the company and the fans.\n\nAt some point in the days leading up to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's impending departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at ''Survivor Series'' would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on ''Nitro'' the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to ''Nitro'' going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref name=\"WCW2\">{{cite book|author=R.D.

Slaughter]] had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted that he did not know the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGS-kwPn6f4&t=15s | title=Jim Ross shoots on Montreal screw job}}</ref> Ross has stated that Jerry Lawler also did not know about the screwjob beforehand. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested.<ref name=\"SM3\">{{cite book|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|author2=Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273 273]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273}}</ref> The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]], and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.\n\nIn his 1998 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows'', Hart said that his fears were largely assuaged because he was close friends with referee Earl Hebner and trusted him implicitly. Asked by Hart, Hebner swore by his children that he would never double-cross Hart and that he would rather quit his job than participate in a screwjob.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref name=\"MVP\">{{cite book|author=Adam Kleinberg and Adam Nudelman|title=Mysteries of Wrestling: Solved|year=2005|pages=73\u201374|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-685-0}}</ref> However, according to Michaels' account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, ''Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story'', Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273 273]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273}}</ref> This contradicted what Hebner said on a 2003 edition of ''[[WWE Confidential]]'', claiming that he first knew of McMahon's plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he ran out of the ring, through the crowd and remained in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.\n\nTensions and excitement were high as the wrestlers and officials congregated for Survivor Series. Hart was anxious over the match finish and had been warned of the prospect of a screwjob by his brother-in-law and Hart Foundation member Davey Boy Smith as well as [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], who had experienced similar situations while wrestling in Japan. They advised Hart to be alert, not lie on his back for too long, kick out from pinfall counts immediately so as to avoid a fast count, and not allow himself to be placed in submission holds.\n\n[[File:Earlhebner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Earl Hebner]]]]\nThe [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]] in Montreal was sold out, with more than 20,000 fans in attendance. Rumors of Hart's imminent departure from WWF had leaked and consequently heightened the fan interest in the match. The mixed signals and a war of words between Hart, McMahon, Michaels and WCW further heightened anticipation.<ref name=\"DM\"/> Emotions were also running high due to the Hart\u2013Michaels rivalry and the \"U.S. vs. Canada\" storyline. While both men had been cordial with each other backstage, WWF officials ordered the deployment of a large number of company agents around the ring as a precaution if Hart decided to attack Michaels or McMahon in reaction to the double-cross. Highly unusual for any wrestling match, the deployment was explained on television as a necessary precaution in wake of the intense animosity between Hart's and Michaels' characters.<ref name=\"DM\"/> There was also some legitimate concern that Michaels could be attacked during the planned in-crowd brawl, by fans angered at his actions of demeaning the Canadian flag. Michaels' entrance was greeted by loud booing and upon entering the ring, he proceeded to rub the Canadian flag against his crotch, picked his nose with it and later humped it\u2014Michaels maintains that this [[flag desecration]] was actually suggested by Hart as an effective way to draw heat and emotion.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/274 274]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/274}}</ref> The palpable anger of the fans was converted into raucous cheering as Hart entered the ring carrying the Canadian flag and wearing the championship belt. Hart, however, was visibly disturbed when segments of the crowd that were aware of his move to WCW jeered him with chants of \"You sold out!\" as the match progressed.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\nOnce the match began, Hart and Michaels brought their performance outside the ring and into the crowd, while being followed by McMahon and WWF officials. As the climax of the match approached, the two wrestlers returned to the ring while WWF officials continued to order more personnel to ringside. Hart first became suspicious as to why Vince McMahon was not at the announcers' table to perform commentary, and why the on-screen commissioner Sgt. Slaughter was also standing at ringside with Vince McMahon. Nevertheless, the match continued. As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top [[turnbuckle]], sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Eye rake|rake]] on Hart's eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart's legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver. At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not notice anything amiss. [[Mike Chioda]], the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme.<ref name=\"DM\"/> Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter to break out of the hold.<ref name=\"SM76\"/> At that moment, Hebner got to his feet, looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, \"Ring the bell!\" McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, \"Ring the fucking bell!\" Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels' leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall.<ref name=\"DM\" /><ref name=\"MVP\" /> Michaels' theme music then began playing and the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. After an initial moment of shock, Hart got to his feet, approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion.<ref name=\"MVP\" /><ref name=\"SM76\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/276 276]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/276}}</ref> Michaels was ordered by McMahon to \"pick up the damn belt and get the hell out of here!\" Michaels left the arena with Brisco and Triple H and the broadcast signal cut off almost immediately after Michaels exited, with the last shot being a tight closeup of the Survivor Series logo above the entranceway.<ref>Survivor Series 1997 pay-per-view broadcast feed, originally aired 11-9-97</ref> McMahon and most other WWF officials also quickly made their way backstage as an angry Hart smashed cameras, monitors, and ringside equipment.<ref name = \"ORS45\"/> Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage.

A mustached Rude appeared on ''Nitro'', which was live, and proceeded to criticize Michaels, DX, and the WWF, calling the company the \"[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]\" (a reference to Titan Enterprises, as WWF's parent company was then known, as the \"sinking ship\").<ref name=oww>{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Rick Rude|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/rick-rude.html|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> An hour later on ''Raw'' (which had been taped six days earlier), Rude then appeared with the full beard he had been sporting during his last few weeks in the WWF.<ref name=oww/><ref name=main111>{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/111 111]|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/111}}</ref> Of the Hart family, only Owen continued to work with the company, being unable to terminate his contract.<ref name=\"SM79\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/279 279]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/279}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Owen and Bulldog staying in WWF|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/nov12_owen.html|work=[[Calgary Sun]]|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|date=1997-11-12|author=Francis, Eric|accessdate=2009-03-06}}</ref>\n\nAt the next night's ''Raw'' in Ottawa, Michaels appeared carrying the WWF title belt and performing a segment where he boasted before the audience of how he beat Hart with his own trademark move in his own country.

[[Mike Tenay]] and [[Tony Schiavone]] strongly criticized McMahon and Michaels for their actions. The show started with Bischoff making reference to Hart's impending arrival in WCW and his punching McMahon in the face, and he then used his on-air persona as the mouthpiece for the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] to claim (kayfabe) that Hart was to join the nWo as soon as he could be signed to WCW.

Just as The Rock put the Sharpshooter hold on Mankind, McMahon called for the bell to be rung, even though Mankind did not submit.

After dropping the WWF title to Austin at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in 1998, Michaels was forced into retirement for four years due to a serious back injury. After a long period of rehabilitation, Michaels returned to the ring in 2002 at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]], and eventually retired in 2010 at [[WrestleMania XXVI]], losing a Streak vs. Career match to The Undertaker in the [[main event]], but came out of retirement for one match eight years later at [[Crown Jewel (2018)|Crown Jewel]] in 2018.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, WWE.com announced in late August 2005 that Hart and WWE had agreed to collaborate on a DVD project chronicling Hart's wrestling career.

Hart, however, maintains that he was prepared to lose the title anywhere and to anyone, except to Michaels in Canada given that, during 1997, his \"Hitman\" character had been built up as a great Canadian hero. As his contract with WWF did not expire for four more weeks, Hart asserts that there was plenty of time and several other opportunities for him to drop the title. Several accounts claim that McMahon had originally proposed that Hart drop the title at December's [[D-Generation X: In Your House|In Your House]] pay-per-view in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], or at January's [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]] in [[San Jose, California]].<ref name=\"PWT\" />\n\nAlthough Michaels expressed happiness at Hart's 2006 induction into the Hall of Fame, the Hart\u2013Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism.<ref name=\"About\" /> Michaels criticized Hart's behavior and conduct during his days in WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a \"mafia hit,\"<ref name=\"SM\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/268 268]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/268}}</ref> and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would \"never forgive\" Michaels.<ref name=\"BH1\">{{cite book|author=Bret Hart|authorlink=Bret Hart|title=My Life in the Cartoon World of Professional Wrestling| page=448|year=2007|publisher=Random House Canada|isbn=0-307-35566-7}}</ref> In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony if he saw Michaels anywhere on the [[WrestleMania 22]] weekend.

After announcing [[Bob Barker]] as the recipient of the award, McMahon asked guest host [[Dennis Miller]] who he would like to see as a ''Raw'' guest host. Miller said he would like to see his long-time favorite, Bret Hart. McMahon dismissed Miller's suggestion, reminding him that the last time Hart was in the WWE was when \"Bret screwed Bret,\" and that he likely would have no interest in hosting the show.

The [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event was held on November 9, 1997, at the [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]] in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The manipulation \u2013 a \"[[shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] [[screwjob]]\" in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|professional wrestling parlance]] \u2013 occurred without Hart's knowledge and resulted in Hart, the reigning [[WWE Champion|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]], losing the title to Michaels in his last WWF match before departing for rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). The \"screwjob\" is generally believed to be an off-screen betrayal of Hart, who was one of the WWF's longest-tenured and most popular performers at the time.\n\nHart won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in August 1997. A week prior to Survivor Series, Hart, who had performed for the WWF since 1984, signed a contract to join WCW beginning in December 1997. McMahon sought to prevent Hart from leaving the company as the champion, but Hart was unwilling to lose the title to Michaels \u2013 with whom he had a long feud both on-screen and off \u2013 at Survivor Series in his home country of Canada. Hart, Michaels, and McMahon came to an agreement where the Survivor Series match would end with a disqualification, which under normal rules would result in Hart retaining the title. Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date. However, McMahon decided without Hart's knowledge that Michaels would win the title at Survivor Series. Accounts differ as to who exactly was involved in the plan and the extent of their involvement. The plan was executed when match referee [[Earl Hebner]], on direct orders from McMahon, ended the match as Michaels held Hart in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] [[Grappling hold|submission hold]], Hart's signature finishing move, even though Hart had not submitted. Michaels was declared the winner by submission and crowned as the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nThe Montreal Screwjob has garnered a notorious legacy both on-screen and off, and was partly chronicled in the documentary film ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'' (1998). The far-reaching impact of the incident led to its adoption as a theme in matches and storylines of the WWF's [[The Attitude Era|\"Attitude Era\"]] and the creation of the character of \"[[Vince McMahon#Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Mr. McMahon: 1997\u20131999|Mr. McMahon]],\" the evil boss. Many wrestling fans, and several within the business, believe the entire incident was an elaborate [[Work (professional wrestling)|work]] executed in [[#Legitimacy|collaboration with Hart]]. Nonetheless, Hart was ostracized from the WWF while McMahon and Michaels continued to receive angry responses from Canadian audiences for many years. Hart and McMahon later reconciled, and Hart was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006. On the January 4, 2010 episode of ''WWE Raw'', Hart, in his first live appearance on WWE television since the 1997 Survivor Series, had a lengthy on-screen discussion with Michaels about the Montreal Screwjob and other events in their past, and agreed to call a truce, bringing closure to the incident after more than 12 years.<ref name=\"calgary\"/><ref name=\"baltimore\"/> Hart would defeat McMahon at [[WrestleMania 26]] in a match built around lingering animosity from the Screwjob.<ref>{{Citation|title=Bret Hart vs. Mr. McMahon - No Holds Barred Lumberjack Match: WrestleMania 26|url=https://www.wwe.com/videos/bret-hart-vs-mr-mcmahon-wrestlemania-26-no-holds-barred-lumberjack-match|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> Longtime industry writer Mike Johnson referred to the 1997 Survivor Series bout in which the Screwjob occurred as \"arguably the most talked-about match in the history of professional wrestling\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/97719/119-this-day-in-history-bret-hart-vs-shawn-michaels-in-montreal.html|title=11/9 This Day in History: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels in Montreal|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=November 9, 2015|website=PWInsider|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Hart's departure from the WWF==\n[[File:BretHartJuly242005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bret Hart|Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart]]]]\nAt the time of the screwjob, Bret Hart was a 14-year veteran of the WWF, having got his first break in the promotion in the 1980s as one-half of the hated [[The Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]] [[tag team]] with his brother-in-law [[Jim Neidhart]] and manager [[Jimmy Hart]]. After the team had two reigns as the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] -  splitting from Jimmy Hart and becoming [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]] between reigns -  Hart then achieved tremendous success as a singles performer in the 1990s, twice taking the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Title]], and then winning the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] five times. Between his fourth and fifth reigns, he took a seven-month leave of absence from the company after [[WrestleMania XII]], during which he considered contract offers from both the WWF and its rival, WCW. In October 1996, Hart declined a three-year, $8.4 million offer from WCW, instead opting to sign an unprecedented 20-year deal offered by McMahon, which promised to make him the highest-paid wrestler in the company and secure him a major role with the company management following his retirement. Both Hart and the WWF saw the contract as an expression of mutual loyalty.<ref name=\"DM\">{{cite magazine|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|date=1997-11-17|url=http://www.brethart.com/facts.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406153712/http://www.brethart.com/facts.asp|archivedate=2006-04-06|title=Montreal Screwjob|magazine=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref><ref name=\"MF\">{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=624|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1997, however, the WWF was facing financial difficulties due to stiff competition from WCW, which had become the largest professional wrestling promotion in the United States. At the same time, McMahon was planning to [[Initial public offering|make the WWF a publicly traded company]] (even though the WWF wouldn't go public until 1999), a move which required him to minimize any long-term financial commitments.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thebiggestrivalries/a/shawnvsbret.htm|title=Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart|last=Cohen|first=Eric|publisher=Prowrestling at About.com|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>\n\nFor several months prior to the 1997 Survivor Series, Hart and Shawn Michaels had several backstage arguments, culminating in a fight before a [[house show]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (after Michaels had publicly accused Hart of having an affair with [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]]) that saw Michaels suspended for two months. After a show in [[San Jose, California]] on October 12, 1997, Hart claimed he spoke to Michaels about being professional and trusting one another in the ring; Hart allegedly said he would have no problem losing to Michaels if McMahon requested. He also claimed that when Michaels replied that he \"would not be willing to do the same\" to Hart, Hart was shocked and became angry.<ref name = \"BH1\"/> This led to Hart's outright refusal to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Michaels at the pay-per-view event in Montreal, although in [[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows|Hart's documentary]], Hart states to McMahon that he would happily drop the belt but not in Canada. However, in his own autobiography, Michaels refuted Hart's claim, saying that he would have cleanly lost to Hart had storylines demanded so (however others, including [[Jim Cornette]] in various shoot interviews, have often refuted this, saying that they knew first-hand that Michaels had no intention of losing cleanly to Hart). Michaels also pointed out that he had lost cleanly to Hart several times in the past, most notably in the WWF's first ever [[ladder match]] at a ''[[WWF Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'' taping on July 21, 1992, which would subsequently be made available on multiple [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum/WWE Home Video]] releases<ref>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm WWF @ Portland, ME - Civic Center - July 21, 1992]. The History of WWE. Retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref> and in the main event of the 1992 [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]]. Michaels also lost to Hart in a [[Steel cage|Steel Cage]] match in December 1993.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm WWF @ Utica, NY - War Memorial - December 1, 1993 (4,500)]. The History of WWE. Retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref>\n\nMcMahon believed he made the right choice in pressing Hart to return, which kept him from joining WCW in 1996. However, by September 22, 1997, the WWF's monetary problems were at an all-time high. McMahon began to defer payments to Hart, claiming that the WWF was in \"financial peril.\" At this time, McMahon reviewed the WWF's plans for the future, and saw the likes of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[The Undertaker]], and [[D-Generation X]] leading what was to become \"[[The Attitude Era]]\". However, McMahon's plans did not include Hart; McMahon therefore encouraged Hart to reopen negotiations with WCW.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\nWhile Hart considered an offer from then-WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]], McMahon informed Hart that the WWF would honor his contract if he chose to stay. However, when Hart talked to McMahon about future plans and storylines, he was disappointed by McMahon's response and what he considered lackluster suggestions. At the time, Hart felt as though his career had been sabotaged by changes to his character, which had been retooled as an anti-America [[Canadian nationalism|Canadian nationalist]]; as a result, he drew significant ire from American audiences, but remained a hero in his native Canada. As a result, he was neither a hero nor a villain, and as such could not be properly placed into feuds with other wrestlers with more concrete personas. Hart had also been unhappy about McMahon's move towards more controversial subject matter, which would become a staple of the company's product during the Attitude Era. Convinced that McMahon's future plans did not include him, Hart resigned from the WWF and signed an agreement with WCW, which had just offered him a large $3 million per annum contract on November 1, 1997<!--offer or acceptance?-->. Hart's signing the WCW deal caused McMahon to worry about the possibility of Hart entering WCW while still WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hart asked McMahon if he would be mocked after leaving for WCW, as had occurred with other wrestlers who had transferred to WCW from the WWF (for example, [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]] in the \"Billionaire Ted\" sketches of early 1996, and [[Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]] after they joined WCW later in 1996). McMahon assured him that nothing of the sort would happen. Despite this, on the night after the Montreal Screwjob on ''Monday Night Raw'', D-Generation X performed a segment mockingly re-enacting the match between Michaels and Hart, with a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] dressed as Bret.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n==Title transition==\n[[File:Vince McMahon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vince McMahon]]]]\nHart's imminent move to WCW created a tense situation, as he had won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam 1997]] from [[The Undertaker]]. His WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, one month after the WWF's annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal.<ref name=\"MF1\"/> Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging [[D-Generation X]] [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], had been booked into a main event title match with Hart at that show. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought his consent to [[Job (professional wrestling)|job]] to Michaels. Hart, however, refused to give up the title to a member of [[The Kliq]] (a group that included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, [[Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], and [[Sean Waltman]] that had previously held enormous backstage influence), apparently standing up for the rest of the locker room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart. Wrestling fans also knew of Hart's long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels\u2014Hart had been angered at Michaels' forfeiture of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in February 1997, ruining plans for a Hart\u2013Michaels rematch at [[WrestleMania 13]], where Michaels was expected to lose the title to him.<ref name=\"MF1\">{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=625|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}</ref> Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to get out of their planned match.<ref name=\"SM6\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/240 240]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/240}}</ref><ref name=\"PWT\">{{cite web|title=An interview with Bret Hart |archivedate=2006-12-03 |accessdate=2007-02-22 |url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/17464 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203042631/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/17464 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> While Michaels denied rumors that he did not want to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it,<ref name=\"SM2\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/176 176]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/176}}</ref> Hart felt certain that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF.<ref name=\"WCW\">{{cite book|first=R.D.|last=Reynolds|author2=Bryan Alvarez|title=The Death of WCW|page=108|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-661-4}}</ref> The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF [[Manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]].<ref name=\"About\" /> The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart's father [[Stu Hart]], which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset.<ref name=\"DM\"/> McMahon's offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.<ref>{{cite book|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/241 241]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/241}}</ref>\n\nMcMahon remained insistent about Hart dropping the title. The WWF owner was anxious over Hart pulling a move like that of former employee [[Debrah Miceli]]. Miceli, a veteran women's wrestler who has competed under the name Madusa for most of her career, performed as Alundra Blayze in the WWF from 1993\u20131995 and won the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Championship]] during her stay there. McMahon, however, had neglected to renew her contract when it expired and Miceli signed with WCW where she changed her ring name back to Madusa. When she made her first appearance on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', Madusa made fun of her time in the WWF and brought her title belt with her to the program, dumping it into a trash can. McMahon feared a repeat, despite claims from Bischoff (according to Hart's DVD biography)<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AOEPU2|title=WWE: Bret \"Hitman\" Hart - The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be|date=3 May 2011|publisher=|via=Amazon}}</ref> that legal issues between the WWF and WCW would prevent such a thing, and that he would rather have Hart join WCW with a \"clean slate\". Hart continued to refuse to drop the title to Michaels, offering to lose the title anywhere in the United States prior to ''Survivor Series'' or to surrender the title to McMahon on the episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' the day after ''Survivor Series'', in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref name=\"WCW\" /> After several disagreements, McMahon, Michaels and Hart agreed to a proposal of a disqualification finish, which would be the result of a brawl between Hart's allies [[Owen Hart]], [[Jim Neidhart]], and [[Davey Boy Smith]] with Michaels's allies [[Triple H]] and [[Chyna]], who would interfere in the match to aid Michaels.<ref name=\"MF3\">{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=626|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}</ref> Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date, as he was not due to start in WCW until December. Hart also asked for and obtained McMahon's permission for an opportunity to explain his actions, his heel character, praise McMahon and the WWF and thus leave on good terms with the company and the fans.\n\nAt some point in the days leading up to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's impending departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at ''Survivor Series'' would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on ''Nitro'' the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to ''Nitro'' going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref name=\"WCW2\">{{cite book|author=R.D.

Slaughter]] had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted that he did not know the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGS-kwPn6f4&t=15s | title=Jim Ross shoots on Montreal screw job}}</ref> Ross has stated that Jerry Lawler also did not know about the screwjob beforehand. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested.<ref name=\"SM3\">{{cite book|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|author2=Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273 273]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273}}</ref> The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]], and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.\n\nIn his 1998 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows'', Hart said that his fears were largely assuaged because he was close friends with referee Earl Hebner and trusted him implicitly. Asked by Hart, Hebner swore by his children that he would never double-cross Hart and that he would rather quit his job than participate in a screwjob.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref name=\"MVP\">{{cite book|author=Adam Kleinberg and Adam Nudelman|title=Mysteries of Wrestling: Solved|year=2005|pages=73\u201374|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-685-0}}</ref> However, according to Michaels' account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, ''Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story'', Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273 273]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/273}}</ref> This contradicted what Hebner said on a 2003 edition of ''[[WWE Confidential]]'', claiming that he first knew of McMahon's plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he ran out of the ring, through the crowd and remained in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.\n\nTensions and excitement were high as the wrestlers and officials congregated for Survivor Series. Hart was anxious over the match finish and had been warned of the prospect of a screwjob by his brother-in-law and Hart Foundation member Davey Boy Smith as well as [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], who had experienced similar situations while wrestling in Japan. They advised Hart to be alert, not lie on his back for too long, kick out from pinfall counts immediately so as to avoid a fast count, and not allow himself to be placed in submission holds.\n\n[[File:Earlhebner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Earl Hebner]]]]\nThe [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]] in Montreal was sold out, with more than 20,000 fans in attendance. Rumors of Hart's imminent departure from WWF had leaked and consequently heightened the fan interest in the match. The mixed signals and a war of words between Hart, McMahon, Michaels and WCW further heightened anticipation.<ref name=\"DM\"/> Emotions were also running high due to the Hart\u2013Michaels rivalry and the \"U.S. vs. Canada\" storyline. While both men had been cordial with each other backstage, WWF officials ordered the deployment of a large number of company agents around the ring as a precaution if Hart decided to attack Michaels or McMahon in reaction to the double-cross. Highly unusual for any wrestling match, the deployment was explained on television as a necessary precaution in wake of the intense animosity between Hart's and Michaels' characters.<ref name=\"DM\"/> There was also some legitimate concern that Michaels could be attacked during the planned in-crowd brawl, by fans angered at his actions of demeaning the Canadian flag. Michaels' entrance was greeted by loud booing and upon entering the ring, he proceeded to rub the Canadian flag against his crotch, picked his nose with it and later humped it\u2014Michaels maintains that this [[flag desecration]] was actually suggested by Hart as an effective way to draw heat and emotion.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/274 274]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/274}}</ref> The palpable anger of the fans was converted into raucous cheering as Hart entered the ring carrying the Canadian flag and wearing the championship belt. Hart, however, was visibly disturbed when segments of the crowd that were aware of his move to WCW jeered him with chants of \"You sold out!\" as the match progressed.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\nOnce the match began, Hart and Michaels brought their performance outside the ring and into the crowd, while being followed by McMahon and WWF officials. As the climax of the match approached, the two wrestlers returned to the ring while WWF officials continued to order more personnel to ringside. Hart first became suspicious as to why Vince McMahon was not at the announcers' table to perform commentary, and why the on-screen commissioner Sgt. Slaughter was also standing at ringside with Vince McMahon. Nevertheless, the match continued. As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top [[turnbuckle]], sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Eye rake|rake]] on Hart's eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart's legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver. At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not notice anything amiss. [[Mike Chioda]], the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme.<ref name=\"DM\"/> Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter to break out of the hold.<ref name=\"SM76\"/> At that moment, Hebner got to his feet, looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, \"Ring the bell!\" McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, \"Ring the fucking bell!\" Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels' leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall.<ref name=\"DM\" /><ref name=\"MVP\" /> Michaels' theme music then began playing and the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. After an initial moment of shock, Hart got to his feet, approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion.<ref name=\"MVP\" /><ref name=\"SM76\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/276 276]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/276}}</ref> Michaels was ordered by McMahon to \"pick up the damn belt and get the hell out of here!\" Michaels left the arena with Brisco and Triple H and the broadcast signal cut off almost immediately after Michaels exited, with the last shot being a tight closeup of the Survivor Series logo above the entranceway.<ref>Survivor Series 1997 pay-per-view broadcast feed, originally aired 11-9-97</ref> McMahon and most other WWF officials also quickly made their way backstage as an angry Hart smashed cameras, monitors, and ringside equipment.<ref name = \"ORS45\"/> Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage. Owen Hart, Neidhart and Davey Boy came out to the ring and had a conversation with Bret calming him down. Hart proceeded to finger trace \"W-C-W\" and \"I love you\" to the cheering fans before returning backstage.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n==Reactions==\nWhile much of the live Montreal audience immediately understood what had happened and responded angrily, television viewers had been left largely confused as Jim Ross promptly wrapped up the event on commentary and Survivor Series went off the air four minutes ahead of schedule with the parting image of Michaels holding the belt aloft as he disappeared backstage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Survivor Series screws the fans|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/nov10_wre1.html|author=Powell, John|work=Slam!

Rude appeared on both ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw is War]]'' and ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' on November 17, 1997.

[[Mike Tenay]] and [[Tony Schiavone]] strongly criticized McMahon and Michaels for their actions. The show started with Bischoff making reference to Hart's impending arrival in WCW and his punching McMahon in the face, and he then used his on-air persona as the mouthpiece for the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] to claim (kayfabe) that Hart was to join the nWo as soon as he could be signed to WCW.

At [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series 1998]]\u2014the first anniversary of the screwjob\u2014McMahon's son Shane, a match referee, abandoned his on-screen rebellion against his father and allowed his father to screw Austin, by refusing to count Austin's pinfall against [[Mick Foley|Mankind]]. The McMahons then double-crossed Mankind in his main event title match against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] later that night. Just as The Rock put the Sharpshooter hold on Mankind, McMahon called for the bell to be rung, even though Mankind did not submit. The Rock was declared the winner by submission and the new WWF Champion, fully re-enacting the Hart double-cross, this time with a switch between the respective face and heel characters.<ref name=\"MF702\">{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=702|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}</ref>\n\nSince then, professional wrestling storylines, including some storylines written by WWE, continue to refer to the screwjob whenever a title match ends under controversial circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwebreakingpoint/currentepisode/11460100/|title=WWE Breaking Point Results: Hell's Gate-crasher|first=\"Craig\"|last=\"Tello\"|date=2009-09-13|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref>\n\n==Resolution==\nWWF eventually surpassed its arch-rival WCW.

After dropping the WWF title to Austin at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in 1998, Michaels was forced into retirement for four years due to a serious back injury.

Hart, however, maintains that he was prepared to lose the title anywhere and to anyone, except to Michaels in Canada given that, during 1997, his \"Hitman\" character had been built up as a great Canadian hero. As his contract with WWF did not expire for four more weeks, Hart asserts that there was plenty of time and several other opportunities for him to drop the title. Several accounts claim that McMahon had originally proposed that Hart drop the title at December's [[D-Generation X: In Your House|In Your House]] pay-per-view in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], or at January's [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]] in [[San Jose, California]].<ref name=\"PWT\" />\n\nAlthough Michaels expressed happiness at Hart's 2006 induction into the Hall of Fame, the Hart\u2013Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism.<ref name=\"About\" /> Michaels criticized Hart's behavior and conduct during his days in WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a \"mafia hit,\"<ref name=\"SM\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels & Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/268 268]|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743493802/page/268}}</ref> and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would \"never forgive\" Michaels.<ref name=\"BH1\">{{cite book|author=Bret Hart|authorlink=Bret Hart|title=My Life in the Cartoon World of Professional Wrestling| page=448|year=2007|publisher=Random House Canada|isbn=0-307-35566-7}}</ref> In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony if he saw Michaels anywhere on the [[WrestleMania 22]] weekend.

After announcing [[Bob Barker]] as the recipient of the award, McMahon asked guest host [[Dennis Miller]] who he would like to see as a ''Raw'' guest host. Miller said he would like to see his long-time favorite, Bret Hart. McMahon dismissed Miller's suggestion, reminding him that the last time Hart was in the WWE was when \"Bret screwed Bret,\" and that he likely would have no interest in hosting the show. Miller then asked the audience if they would like to see Hart as a guest host, to applause, but McMahon simply walked away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12142009/mainarticle/|title=Dennis, anyone?|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|first=Greg|last=Adkins|accessdate=2010-01-12|date=2009-12-14}}</ref> On December 16, [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' reported that Hart had signed a four-month contract with WWE, and would debut as the guest host of ''Raw'' on January 4, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/5401.html|title=Bret Hart signs WWE contract|publisher=Lords of Pain|first=Michael|last=Bluth|date=2009-12-16|accessdate=2010-01-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201143830/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/5401.html|archivedate=February 1, 2010}} {{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date=May 2012}}</ref> On December 28, WWE.com confirmed that McMahon would be at ''Raw'' that night to address the rumors about Hart hosting the show.

Hart and Michaels then aired their grievances with one another while recognizing that their Ironman match at [[WrestleMania XII]] ought to be the highlight of their relationship rather than the Montreal Screwjob. The pair shook hands and Michaels turned as if to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but instead chose to embrace Hart.

However, the episode was overshadowed by [[Jerry Lawler]]'s real on-air heart attack earlier in the evening, from which he eventually made a full recovery. He also briefly appeared during [[Royal Rumble (2013)|the 2013 Royal Rumble]], giving a pep talk to [[Alberto Del Rio]] before his Last Man Standing match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] with [[Big Show]].

Bret was pictured in the evening speaking to the likes of [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Daniel Bryan]] and Cena among others.
