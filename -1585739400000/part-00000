International Department== in the Qunli subdistrict of Daoli District===== Headed by Director Christine Wang, Harbin No. 3 High School International Department is actually owned by Pattison English group, directed by a Mr. Yang. There are three grade levels that attend. The students study the GAC (Global Assessment Certificate) as well as typical Chinese High School courses. Additionally, the have classes on ACT, TOEFL, SAT and IELTS depending on their plan.\nHarbin No. 3 International Department has a reputation for mistreatment, dishonesty and lack of communication with foreign teachers who travel from western countries to fulfill a two year contract. Since it is actually illegal for the foreign teachers to obtain a two year work permit, the school forces them to sign two contracts. One is for one year and the other is for two years. They avoid paying the foreign teacher salary when they arrive by forcing them to sign two contracts. They file the one year contract with the local government. They will suggest that you go work at Pattison English part-time and that it is perfectly fine, but you should know that it is completely illegal and you could be arrested and deported.\nAlso, the foreign human resources will try to retain your passport and your work permit. Do not allow them. Tell them it is illegal and they will give it back.\nOther problems that have been documented are a high turnover rate for foreign teachers, low job satisfaction and more. During the 2019-2020 school year the salary was consistently paid late with little explanation.\nThis pattern of breach of contract due to late salary payment to was the worst when foreign teachers received a salary payment on December 10th 2019 and did not receive the next salary payment until February 1st 2020. The foreign teacher contract states that the foreign teachers should be paid between the 15th and 18th of each month. This delay in payment caused some foreign teachers to be stranded in China during the novel coronavirus outbreak. The foreign human resources has been responsible for several teachers visa overstay as he did not complete them on-time.\nFurthermore, the Director of the International Department, Christine Wang, involved foreign teachers in dishonest business practices by using their U.S. passports to import foreign vehicles. When confronted by the foreign teachers regarding the breach of contract due to late salary payment, the school shirked their contractual obligation. They then went a step further and reduced the salary of foreign teachers by 20% because Mr. Yang's other private business interests lost money during the Harbin coronavirus shutdown.\nOther complaints are that they ignore their contractual obligations such as paying for in China visa and medical examination expenses and refusing to supply a Letter of Release. For the foreign teachers, classes are frequently cancelled with no notice and the school consistently schedules teachers outside of the contractual work hours.\nIf you try to get information from them they refer you to each other in a circle. I mean, the foreign human resource says to ask the human resource director. The human resource director says to ask the director of foreign teachers and then the director of foreign teachers says to ask the human resources director and on and on. It is hard to tell if they are simply incompetent or actively working against you.\nNearly all of the foreign teachers reported by frustrated and dissatisfied with lack of communication, constant last minute changes and underlying contempt that the school and its employees have for foreign teachers.\nTwo foreign teachers were told to arrive at certain dates. When those dates came close, the school could not or did not know or communicate that something had changed. This caused to foreign teachers to lose two months salary because the school was so disorganized and slow getting the paperwork.\nThe foreign teacher HR relies on the assumption that a foreigner in China cannot read, speak or write Chinese and will use this to lie about the contract and to shirk responsibility.\nBy the time students reach grade 3, they are able to completely stop going to school as there is no effective attendance policy in place. Often times for the entire senior class only one student is reported to have attend. This attendance and lack of motivation for the GAC program was due to some teacher telling the students that the GAC curriculum did not matter. This led to an incident where the Director of Foreign Teachers yelled at his class and stormed out. The list of complaints goes on and on. If you are a foreign teacher considering working, you should reconsider.\n\n<ref>Former Employee, First Hand Account</ref>\n\n<ref>First Hand Account of Employee</ref>\n{{coord missing|Heilongjiang}}\n\n[[Category:High schools in Heilongjiang]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Harbin No.3 High School.JPG|thumb|Historical school yard]]\n\n'''Harbin No.3 High School''' (Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u5e02\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2d\u5b66) is a [[high school]] in [[Harbin]], [[Heilongjiang Province]].<ref>http://sites.psu.edu/ruijiazhang/2015/03/02/129/</ref>\n\nThe school has two campuses.

Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows. When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches, i.e., breaks out of the egg's shell.

The larva has grown around the remains of the yolk and the remains of the soft, transparent egg are discarded.]]\n\nThe most common reproductive strategy for [[fish]] is known as [[oviparity]], in which the female lays undeveloped eggs that are externally fertilized by a male. Typically large numbers of eggs are laid at one time (an adult female [[cod]] can produce 4\u20136 million eggs in one spawning) and the eggs are then left to develop without parental care. When the larvae hatch from the egg, they often carry the remains of the yolk in a yolk sac which continues to nourish the larvae for a few days as they learn how to swim. Once the yolk is consumed, there is a critical point after which they must learn how to hunt and feed or they will die.\n\nA few fish, notably the [[ray (fish)|ray]]s and most [[shark]]s use [[ovoviviparity]] in which the eggs are fertilized and develop internally. However the larvae still grow inside the egg consuming the egg's yolk and without any direct nourishment from the mother. The mother then gives birth to relatively mature young. In certain instances, the physically most developed offspring will devour its smaller siblings for further nutrition while still within the mother's body. This is known as [[Cannibalism (zoology)#Intrauterine cannibalism|intrauterine cannibalism]].\n\nIn certain scenarios, some fish such as the [[hammerhead shark]] and [[reef shark (SIA)|reef shark]] are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], with the egg being fertilized and developed internally, but with the mother also providing direct nourishment.\n\nThe eggs of fish and [[amphibian]]s are jellylike. Cartilagenous fish (sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras) eggs are fertilized internally and exhibit a wide variety of both internal and external embryonic development. Most fish species spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating the eggs after the female lays them. These eggs do not have a shell and would dry out in the air. Even air-breathing amphibians lay their eggs in water, or in protective foam as with the Coast foam-nest treefrog, ''[[Chiromantis xerampelina]]''.\n\n===Bird eggs===\n{{main|Bird egg}}\nBird eggs are laid by females and [[Incubate (bird)|incubated]] for a time that varies according to the species; a single young hatches from each egg. Average [[clutch (eggs)|clutch size]]s range from one (as in [[condor]]s) to about 17 (the [[grey partridge]]). Some birds lay eggs even when not fertilized (e.g. [[chicken|hens]]); it is not uncommon for pet owners to find their lone bird nesting on a clutch of unfertilized eggs, which are sometimes called wind-eggs.\n\n====Colors====\n[[File:Uria aalge MHNT Box Rouzic.jpg|thumb|[[Guillemot]] eggs]]\nThe default color of vertebrate eggs is the white of the [[calcium carbonate]] from which the shells are made, but some birds, mainly [[passerine]]s, produce colored eggs. The pigment [[biliverdin]] and its zinc [[chelate]] give a green or blue ground color, and [[protoporphyrin]] produces reds and browns as a ground color or as spotting.\n\nNon-passerines typically have white eggs, except in some ground-nesting groups such as the [[Charadriiformes]], [[sandgrouse]] and [[nightjar]]s, where camouflage is necessary, and some [[brood parasite|parasitic]] [[cuckoo]]s which have to match the passerine host's egg. Most passerines, in contrast, lay colored eggs, even if there is no need of cryptic colors.\n\nHowever some have suggested that the protoporphyrin markings on passerine eggs actually act to reduce brittleness by acting as a solid state lubricant.<ref>Solomon, S.E. (1987). Egg shell pigmentation. In Egg Quality : Current Problems and Recent Advances (eds R.G. Wells & C.G.\nBelyarin). Butterworths, London, pp. 147\u2013157.</ref> If there is insufficient calcium available in the local soil, the egg shell may be thin, especially in a circle around the broad end. Protoporphyrin speckling compensates for this, and increases inversely to the amount of calcium in the soil.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Andrew G.|last=Gosler |author2=James P. Higham |author3=S. James Reynolds|title=Why are birds' eggs speckled?|journal=Ecology Letters|year=2005|volume= 8|issue=10 |pages=1105\u20131113|doi= 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00816.x}}</ref>\n\nFor the same reason, later eggs in a clutch are more spotted than early ones as the female's store of calcium is depleted.\n\nThe color of individual eggs is also genetically influenced, and appears to be inherited through the mother only, suggesting that the [[gene]] responsible for pigmentation is on the sex determining [[W chromosome]] (female birds are WZ, males ZZ).\n\nIt used to be thought that color was applied to the shell immediately before laying, but this research shows that coloration is an integral part of the development of the shell, with the same protein responsible for depositing calcium carbonate, or protoporphyrins when there is a lack of that mineral.\n\nIn species such as the [[common guillemot]], which nest in large groups, each female's eggs have very different markings, making it easier for females to identify their own eggs on the crowded cliff ledges on which they breed.\n\n====Shell====\nBird eggshells are diverse. For example:\n*[[cormorant]] eggs are rough and chalky\n*[[tinamou]] eggs are shiny\n*[[duck]] eggs are oily and waterproof\n*[[cassowary]] eggs are heavily pitted\n\nTiny pores in bird eggshells allow the embryo to breathe. The [[chicken|domestic hen]]'s egg has around 7000 pores.<ref>[http://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/virtualfarm/poultry/poultry_eggparts.html Vermont educational site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123092430/http://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/virtualfarm/poultry/poultry_eggparts.html |date=2016-11-23 }}</ref>\n\nSome bird eggshells have a coating of [[vaterite]] spherules, which is a rare polymorph of calcium carbonate. In [[Greater Ani]] ''Crotophaga major'' this vaterite coating is thought to act as a shock absorber, protecting the calcite shell from fracture during incubation, such as colliding with other eggs in the nest.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= Portugal, J.

This shape results from the egg being forced through the [[oviduct]]. Muscles contract the oviduct behind the egg, pushing it forward. The egg's wall is still shapeable, and the pointed end develops at the back. Long, pointy eggs are an incidental consequence of having a streamlined body typical of birds with strong flying abilities; flight narrows the oviduct, which changes the type of egg a bird can lay.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Ed|title=Why Are Bird Eggs Egg-Shaped?

For example, principal predators of the [[American black oystercatcher|black oystercatcher]]'s eggs include [[raccoon]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[mink]], river and sea [[otter]]s, [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s and [[fox]]es. The [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') and [[long-tailed weasel]] (''M. frenata'') steal ducks' eggs. [[Snake]]s of the genera ''[[Dasypeltis]]'' and ''[[Elachistodon]]'' specialize in eating eggs.\n\n[[Brood parasitism]] occurs in birds when one species lays its eggs in the nest of another. In some cases, the host's eggs are removed or eaten by the female, or expelled by her chick. Brood parasites include the [[cowbird]]s and many Old World [[cuckoo]]s.\n\n====Various examples====\n<gallery>\nFile:Egg125o.png|An average [[whooping crane]] egg is {{convert|102|mm|abbr=on}} long and weighs {{convert|208|g|oz|abbr=on}}\nFile:Oystercatcher Eggs Norway.jpg|[[Eurasian oystercatcher]] eggs camouflaged in the nest\nFile:Senegal egg 10s06.JPG|Egg of a [[senegal parrot]], a bird that nests in tree holes, on a {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} grid\nFile:Comparison of eggs by Zureks.jpg|Eggs of [[ostrich]], [[emu]], [[kiwi]] and [[chicken]]\nFile:Finch Egg.jpg|[[Finch]] egg next to [[Dime (United States coin)|American dime]]\nFile:Ou\u0103.jpg|Eggs of [[duck]], [[goose]], [[guineafowl]] and [[chicken]]\nFile:Various_eggs.JPG|Eggs of [[ostrich]], [[southern cassowary|cassowary]], [[chicken]], [[flamingo]], [[pigeon]] and [[common blackbird|blackbird]]\nFile:Emu Egg.JPG|Egg of an [[emu]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Amniote eggs and embryos===\n[[File:Snapping turtle eggs md.jpg|thumb|right|[[Turtle]] eggs in a nest dug by a female common snapping turtle (''[[common snapping turtle|Chelydra serpentina]]'')]]\nLike amphibians, [[amniote]]s are air-breathing [[vertebrate]]s, but they have complex eggs or [[embryo]]s, including an [[amniotic membrane]]. Amniotes include [[reptile]]s (including dinosaurs and their descendants, birds) and mammals.\n\nReptile eggs are often rubbery and are always initially white. They are able to survive in the air. Often the sex of the developing embryo is determined by the temperature of the surroundings, with cooler temperatures favouring males. Not all reptiles lay eggs; some are [[viviparous]] (\"live birth\").\n\nDinosaurs laid eggs, some of which have been preserved as petrified fossils.\n\nAmong mammals, early extinct species laid eggs, as do [[platypus]]es and [[echidna]]s (spiny anteaters). Platypuses and two genera of echidna are Australian [[monotremes]]. [[Marsupial]] and [[placental]] mammals do not lay eggs, but their unborn young do have the complex tissues that identify amniotes.\n\n===Mammalian eggs===\nThe eggs of the egg-laying mammals (the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s) are macrolecithal eggs very much like those of [[reptile]]s. The eggs of [[marsupial]]s are likewise macrolecithal, but rather small, and develop inside the body of the female, but do not form a [[placenta]]. The young are born at a very early stage, and can be classified as a \"[[larva]]\" in the biological sense.<ref>Colbert, H.E & Morales, M.

Receiving nutrients from the mother, the fetus completes the development while inside the uterus.\n\n===Invertebrate eggs===\n[[File:Editing Image-Acanthodoris lutea laying eggs 2.jpg|[[Orange-peel doris]] (''Acanthodoris lutea''), a [[nudibranch]], in [[tide pool]] laying eggs|right|thumb]]\nEggs are common among [[invertebrate]]s, including [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, [[mollusk]]s, and [[crustacean]]s.\n\n==Evolution and structure==\nAll sexually reproducing life, including both plants and animals, produces [[gametes]]. The male gamete cell, [[sperm]], is usually motile whereas the female gamete cell, the [[ovum]], is generally larger and [[wikt:sessile|sessile]]. The male and female gametes combine to produce the [[zygote]] cell. In [[multicellular]] organisms the zygote subsequently divides in an organised manner into smaller more specialised cells, so that this new individual develops into an [[embryo]]. In most animals the embryo is the sessile initial stage of the individual life cycle, and is followed by the emergence (that is, the hatching) of a motile stage. The zygote or the ovum itself or the sessile organic vessel containing the developing embryo may be called the egg.\n\nA recent proposal suggests that the [[phylotype|phylotypic]] animal [[body plan]]s originated in cell aggregates before the existence of an egg stage of [[developmental biology|development]]. Eggs, in this view, were later evolutionary [[emergence|innovations]], selected for their role in ensuring genetic uniformity among the cells of incipient multicellular organisms.<ref name=Newman>{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=S.A.|title=Animal egg as evolutionary innovation: a solution to the 'embryonic hourglass' puzzle|journal= Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution|date=2011|volume=316|issue=7|pages=467\u2013483|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21417|pmid=21557469}}</ref>\n\n==Scientific classifications==\nScientists often classify animal reproduction according to the degree of development that occurs before the new individuals are expelled from the adult body, and by the yolk which the egg provides to nourish the embryo.\n\n===Egg size and yolk===\n[[Vertebrate]] eggs can be classified by the relative amount of [[yolk]]. Simple eggs with little yolk are called ''microlecithal'', medium-sized eggs with some yolk are called ''mesolecithal'', and large eggs with a large concentrated yolk are called ''macrolecithal''.<ref name=\"Romer & Parson\">[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A. S.]] & Parsons, T. S. (1985): ''The Vertebrate Body.'' (6th ed.) Saunders, Philadelphia.</ref> This classification of eggs is based on the eggs of [[chordata|chordates]], though the basic principle extends to the whole [[animalia|animal kingdom]].\n\n====Microlecithal ====\n[[File:Toxocara embryonated eggs.jpg|thumb|right|Microlecithal eggs from the [[Nematoda|roundworm]] ''[[Toxocara]]'']]\n[[File:Paragonimus westermani 01.jpg|thumb|right|Microlecithal eggs from the [[flatworm]] ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'']]\nSmall eggs with little yolk are called microlecithal. The yolk is evenly distributed, so the cleavage of the egg cell cuts through and divides the egg into cells of fairly similar sizes. In [[sponges]] and [[cnidaria]]ns the dividing eggs develop directly into a simple larva, rather like a [[morula]] with [[cilium|cilia]]. In cnidarians, this stage is called the [[planula]], and either develops directly into the adult animals or forms new adult individuals through a process of [[budding]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reitzel|first=A.M.|author2=Sullivan, J.C|author3=Finnery, J.R|title=Qualitative shift to indirect development in the parasitic sea anemone ''Edwardsiella lineata''|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|year=2006|volume=46|issue=6|pages=827\u2013837|doi=10.1093/icb/icl032|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/6/827.full|pmid=21672788|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808134136/http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/6/827.full|archivedate=2016-08-08|df=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nMicrolecithal eggs require minimal yolk mass.

(1968): Invertebrate Zoology. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia. 743 pages</ref> In anatomically simple animals, such as cnidarians and flatworms, the fetal development can be quite short, and even microlecithal eggs can undergo direct development. These small eggs can be produced in large numbers. In animals with high egg mortality, microlecithal eggs are the norm, as in bivalves and marine arthropods. However, the latter are more complex anatomically than e.g. flatworms, and the small microlecithal eggs do not allow full development. Instead, the eggs hatch into [[larva]]e, which may be markedly different from the adult animal.\n\nIn placental mammals, where the embryo is nourished by the mother throughout the whole fetal period, the egg is reduced in size to essentially a naked egg cell.\n\n====Mesolecithal====\n[[File:Frogspawn closeup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frog]]spawn is mesolecithal.]]\nMesolecithal eggs have comparatively more yolk than the microlecithal eggs. The yolk is concentrated in one part of the egg (the ''vegetal pole''), with the [[cell nucleus]] and most of the [[cytoplasm]] in the other (the ''animal pole'').

Symposium of the Zoological Society of London, pp 38\u2013615</ref>\n\nMacrolecithal eggs go through a different type of development than other eggs. Due to the large size of the yolk, the cell division can not split up the yolk mass. The fetus instead develops as a plate-like structure on top of the yolk mass, and only envelopes it at a later stage.<ref name=\"Romer & Parson\"/> A portion of the yolk mass is still present as an external or semi-external [[yolk sac]] at hatching in many groups. This form of fetal development is common in [[bony fish]], even though their eggs can be quite small. Despite their macrolecithal structure, the small size of the eggs does not allow for direct development, and the eggs hatch to a larval stage (\"fry\"). In terrestrial animals with macrolecithal eggs, the large volume to surface ratio necessitates structures to aid in transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and for storage of waste products so that the embryo does not suffocate or get poisoned from its own waste while inside the egg, see [[amniote]].<ref name=\"Stewart J.

''oviparous'') from live-bearing (Latin. ''viviparous'').\n\nThese classifications are divided into more detail according to the development that occurs before the offspring are expelled from the adult's body. Traditionally:<ref>[[Thierry Lod\u00e9]] 2001. Les strat\u00e9gies de reproduction des animaux (reproduction strategies in animal kingdom). Eds Dunod Sciences, Paris</ref>\n*'''Ovuliparity''' means the female [[Spawn (biology)|spawns]] unfertilized eggs (ova), which must then be externally fertilised. Ovuliparity is typical of [[bony fish]], [[anuran]]s, echinoderms, bivalves and cnidarians. Most aquatic organisms are ovuliparous. The term is derived from the diminiutive meaning \"little egg\".\n*'''Oviparity''' is where fertilisation occurs internally and so the eggs laid by the female are zygotes (or newly developing embryos), often with important outer tissues added (for example, in a chicken egg, no part outside of the yolk originates with the zygote). Oviparity is typical of birds, reptiles, some cartilaginous fish and most arthropods. Terrestrial organisms are typically oviparous, with egg-casings that resist evaporation of moisture. \n*'''Ovo-viviparity''' is where the zygote is retained in the adult's body but there are no ''trophic'' (feeding) interactions. That is, the embryo still obtains all of its nutrients from inside the egg. Most live-bearing fish, amphibians or reptiles are actually ovoviviparous. Examples include the reptile ''[[Anguis fragilis]]'', the sea horse (where zygotes are retained in the male's ventral \"marsupium\"), and the frogs ''Rhinoderma darwinii'' (where the eggs develop in the vocal sac) and ''Rheobatrachus'' (where the eggs develop in the stomach).\n*'''Histotrophic viviparity''' means embryos develop in the female's [[oviduct]]s but obtain nutrients by consuming other ova, zygotes or sibling embryos ([[oophagy]] or [[adelphophagy]]). This [[intra-uterine cannibalism]] occurs in some sharks and in the black salamander ''Salamandra atra''. [[Marsupials]] excrete a \"uterine milk\" supplementing the nourishment from the yolk sak.<ref>{{cite book|last1=USA|first1=David O.

Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and sets them together in a bowl. The tradition of a [[dancing egg]] is held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities since the 16th century.

The larva has grown around the remains of the yolk and the remains of the soft, transparent egg are discarded.]]\n\nThe most common reproductive strategy for [[fish]] is known as [[oviparity]], in which the female lays undeveloped eggs that are externally fertilized by a male. Typically large numbers of eggs are laid at one time (an adult female [[cod]] can produce 4\u20136 million eggs in one spawning) and the eggs are then left to develop without parental care. When the larvae hatch from the egg, they often carry the remains of the yolk in a yolk sac which continues to nourish the larvae for a few days as they learn how to swim. Once the yolk is consumed, there is a critical point after which they must learn how to hunt and feed or they will die.\n\nA few fish, notably the [[ray (fish)|ray]]s and most [[shark]]s use [[ovoviviparity]] in which the eggs are fertilized and develop internally. However the larvae still grow inside the egg consuming the egg's yolk and without any direct nourishment from the mother. The mother then gives birth to relatively mature young. In certain instances, the physically most developed offspring will devour its smaller siblings for further nutrition while still within the mother's body. This is known as [[Cannibalism (zoology)#Intrauterine cannibalism|intrauterine cannibalism]].\n\nIn certain scenarios, some fish such as the [[hammerhead shark]] and [[reef shark (SIA)|reef shark]] are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], with the egg being fertilized and developed internally, but with the mother also providing direct nourishment.\n\nThe eggs of fish and [[amphibian]]s are jellylike. Cartilagenous fish (sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras) eggs are fertilized internally and exhibit a wide variety of both internal and external embryonic development. Most fish species spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating the eggs after the female lays them. These eggs do not have a shell and would dry out in the air. Even air-breathing amphibians lay their eggs in water, or in protective foam as with the Coast foam-nest treefrog, ''[[Chiromantis xerampelina]]''.\n\n===Bird eggs===\n{{main|Bird egg}}\nBird eggs are laid by females and [[Incubate (bird)|incubated]] for a time that varies according to the species; a single young hatches from each egg. Average [[clutch (eggs)|clutch size]]s range from one (as in [[condor]]s) to about 17 (the [[grey partridge]]). Some birds lay eggs even when not fertilized (e.g. [[chicken|hens]]); it is not uncommon for pet owners to find their lone bird nesting on a clutch of unfertilized eggs, which are sometimes called wind-eggs.\n\n====Colors====\n[[File:Uria aalge MHNT Box Rouzic.jpg|thumb|[[Guillemot]] eggs]]\nThe default color of vertebrate eggs is the white of the [[calcium carbonate]] from which the shells are made, but some birds, mainly [[passerine]]s, produce colored eggs. The pigment [[biliverdin]] and its zinc [[chelate]] give a green or blue ground color, and [[protoporphyrin]] produces reds and browns as a ground color or as spotting.\n\nNon-passerines typically have white eggs, except in some ground-nesting groups such as the [[Charadriiformes]], [[sandgrouse]] and [[nightjar]]s, where camouflage is necessary, and some [[brood parasite|parasitic]] [[cuckoo]]s which have to match the passerine host's egg. Most passerines, in contrast, lay colored eggs, even if there is no need of cryptic colors.\n\nHowever some have suggested that the protoporphyrin markings on passerine eggs actually act to reduce brittleness by acting as a solid state lubricant.<ref>Solomon, S.E. (1987). Egg shell pigmentation. In Egg Quality : Current Problems and Recent Advances (eds R.G. Wells & C.G.\nBelyarin). Butterworths, London, pp. 147\u2013157.</ref> If there is insufficient calcium available in the local soil, the egg shell may be thin, especially in a circle around the broad end. Protoporphyrin speckling compensates for this, and increases inversely to the amount of calcium in the soil.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Andrew G.|last=Gosler |author2=James P. Higham |author3=S.

For example:\n*[[cormorant]] eggs are rough and chalky\n*[[tinamou]] eggs are shiny\n*[[duck]] eggs are oily and waterproof\n*[[cassowary]] eggs are heavily pitted\n\nTiny pores in bird eggshells allow the embryo to breathe. The [[chicken|domestic hen]]'s egg has around 7000 pores.<ref>[http://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/virtualfarm/poultry/poultry_eggparts.html Vermont educational site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123092430/http://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/virtualfarm/poultry/poultry_eggparts.html |date=2016-11-23 }}</ref>\n\nSome bird eggshells have a coating of [[vaterite]] spherules, which is a rare polymorph of calcium carbonate.

This shape results from the egg being forced through the [[oviduct]]. Muscles contract the oviduct behind the egg, pushing it forward. The egg's wall is still shapeable, and the pointed end develops at the back. Long, pointy eggs are an incidental consequence of having a streamlined body typical of birds with strong flying abilities; flight narrows the oviduct, which changes the type of egg a bird can lay.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Ed|title=Why Are Bird Eggs Egg-Shaped?

For example, principal predators of the [[American black oystercatcher|black oystercatcher]]'s eggs include [[raccoon]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[mink]], river and sea [[otter]]s, [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s and [[fox]]es. The [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') and [[long-tailed weasel]] (''M. frenata'') steal ducks' eggs. [[Snake]]s of the genera ''[[Dasypeltis]]'' and ''[[Elachistodon]]'' specialize in eating eggs.\n\n[[Brood parasitism]] occurs in birds when one species lays its eggs in the nest of another. In some cases, the host's eggs are removed or eaten by the female, or expelled by her chick. Brood parasites include the [[cowbird]]s and many Old World [[cuckoo]]s.\n\n====Various examples====\n<gallery>\nFile:Egg125o.png|An average [[whooping crane]] egg is {{convert|102|mm|abbr=on}} long and weighs {{convert|208|g|oz|abbr=on}}\nFile:Oystercatcher Eggs Norway.jpg|[[Eurasian oystercatcher]] eggs camouflaged in the nest\nFile:Senegal egg 10s06.JPG|Egg of a [[senegal parrot]], a bird that nests in tree holes, on a {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} grid\nFile:Comparison of eggs by Zureks.jpg|Eggs of [[ostrich]], [[emu]], [[kiwi]] and [[chicken]]\nFile:Finch Egg.jpg|[[Finch]] egg next to [[Dime (United States coin)|American dime]]\nFile:Ou\u0103.jpg|Eggs of [[duck]], [[goose]], [[guineafowl]] and [[chicken]]\nFile:Various_eggs.JPG|Eggs of [[ostrich]], [[southern cassowary|cassowary]], [[chicken]], [[flamingo]], [[pigeon]] and [[common blackbird|blackbird]]\nFile:Emu Egg.JPG|Egg of an [[emu]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Amniote eggs and embryos===\n[[File:Snapping turtle eggs md.jpg|thumb|right|[[Turtle]] eggs in a nest dug by a female common snapping turtle (''[[common snapping turtle|Chelydra serpentina]]'')]]\nLike amphibians, [[amniote]]s are air-breathing [[vertebrate]]s, but they have complex eggs or [[embryo]]s, including an [[amniotic membrane]]. Amniotes include [[reptile]]s (including dinosaurs and their descendants, birds) and mammals.\n\nReptile eggs are often rubbery and are always initially white. They are able to survive in the air. Often the sex of the developing embryo is determined by the temperature of the surroundings, with cooler temperatures favouring males. Not all reptiles lay eggs; some are [[viviparous]] (\"live birth\").\n\nDinosaurs laid eggs, some of which have been preserved as petrified fossils.\n\nAmong mammals, early extinct species laid eggs, as do [[platypus]]es and [[echidna]]s (spiny anteaters). Platypuses and two genera of echidna are Australian [[monotremes]]. [[Marsupial]] and [[placental]] mammals do not lay eggs, but their unborn young do have the complex tissues that identify amniotes.\n\n===Mammalian eggs===\nThe eggs of the egg-laying mammals (the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s) are macrolecithal eggs very much like those of [[reptile]]s. The eggs of [[marsupial]]s are likewise macrolecithal, but rather small, and develop inside the body of the female, but do not form a [[placenta]]. The young are born at a very early stage, and can be classified as a \"[[larva]]\" in the biological sense.<ref>Colbert, H.E & Morales, M.

Receiving nutrients from the mother, the fetus completes the development while inside the uterus.\n\n===Invertebrate eggs===\n[[File:Editing Image-Acanthodoris lutea laying eggs 2.jpg|[[Orange-peel doris]] (''Acanthodoris lutea''), a [[nudibranch]], in [[tide pool]] laying eggs|right|thumb]]\nEggs are common among [[invertebrate]]s, including [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, [[mollusk]]s, and [[crustacean]]s.\n\n==Evolution and structure==\nAll sexually reproducing life, including both plants and animals, produces [[gametes]]. The male gamete cell, [[sperm]], is usually motile whereas the female gamete cell, the [[ovum]], is generally larger and [[wikt:sessile|sessile]]. The male and female gametes combine to produce the [[zygote]] cell. In [[multicellular]] organisms the zygote subsequently divides in an organised manner into smaller more specialised cells, so that this new individual develops into an [[embryo]]. In most animals the embryo is the sessile initial stage of the individual life cycle, and is followed by the emergence (that is, the hatching) of a motile stage. The zygote or the ovum itself or the sessile organic vessel containing the developing embryo may be called the egg.\n\nA recent proposal suggests that the [[phylotype|phylotypic]] animal [[body plan]]s originated in cell aggregates before the existence of an egg stage of [[developmental biology|development]]. Eggs, in this view, were later evolutionary [[emergence|innovations]], selected for their role in ensuring genetic uniformity among the cells of incipient multicellular organisms.<ref name=Newman>{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=S.A.|title=Animal egg as evolutionary innovation: a solution to the 'embryonic hourglass' puzzle|journal= Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution|date=2011|volume=316|issue=7|pages=467\u2013483|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21417|pmid=21557469}}</ref>\n\n==Scientific classifications==\nScientists often classify animal reproduction according to the degree of development that occurs before the new individuals are expelled from the adult body, and by the yolk which the egg provides to nourish the embryo.\n\n===Egg size and yolk===\n[[Vertebrate]] eggs can be classified by the relative amount of [[yolk]]. Simple eggs with little yolk are called ''microlecithal'', medium-sized eggs with some yolk are called ''mesolecithal'', and large eggs with a large concentrated yolk are called ''macrolecithal''.<ref name=\"Romer & Parson\">[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.

The yolk is evenly distributed, so the cleavage of the egg cell cuts through and divides the egg into cells of fairly similar sizes. In [[sponges]] and [[cnidaria]]ns the dividing eggs develop directly into a simple larva, rather like a [[morula]] with [[cilium|cilia]]. In cnidarians, this stage is called the [[planula]], and either develops directly into the adult animals or forms new adult individuals through a process of [[budding]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reitzel|first=A.M.|author2=Sullivan, J.C|author3=Finnery, J.R|title=Qualitative shift to indirect development in the parasitic sea anemone ''Edwardsiella lineata''|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|year=2006|volume=46|issue=6|pages=827\u2013837|doi=10.1093/icb/icl032|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/6/827.full|pmid=21672788|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808134136/http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/6/827.full|archivedate=2016-08-08|df=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nMicrolecithal eggs require minimal yolk mass.

(1968): Invertebrate Zoology. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia. 743 pages</ref> In anatomically simple animals, such as cnidarians and flatworms, the fetal development can be quite short, and even microlecithal eggs can undergo direct development. These small eggs can be produced in large numbers. In animals with high egg mortality, microlecithal eggs are the norm, as in bivalves and marine arthropods. However, the latter are more complex anatomically than e.g. flatworms, and the small microlecithal eggs do not allow full development. Instead, the eggs hatch into [[larva]]e, which may be markedly different from the adult animal.\n\nIn placental mammals, where the embryo is nourished by the mother throughout the whole fetal period, the egg is reduced in size to essentially a naked egg cell.\n\n====Mesolecithal====\n[[File:Frogspawn closeup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frog]]spawn is mesolecithal.]]\nMesolecithal eggs have comparatively more yolk than the microlecithal eggs. The yolk is concentrated in one part of the egg (the ''vegetal pole''), with the [[cell nucleus]] and most of the [[cytoplasm]] in the other (the ''animal pole''). The cell cleavage is uneven, and mainly concentrated in the cytoplasma-rich animal pole.<ref name=Hildebrand>Hildebrand, M. & Gonslow, G. (2001): Analysis of Vertebrate Structure. 5th edition.

Symposium of the Zoological Society of London, pp 38\u2013615</ref>\n\nMacrolecithal eggs go through a different type of development than other eggs. Due to the large size of the yolk, the cell division can not split up the yolk mass. The fetus instead develops as a plate-like structure on top of the yolk mass, and only envelopes it at a later stage.<ref name=\"Romer & Parson\"/> A portion of the yolk mass is still present as an external or semi-external [[yolk sac]] at hatching in many groups. This form of fetal development is common in [[bony fish]], even though their eggs can be quite small. Despite their macrolecithal structure, the small size of the eggs does not allow for direct development, and the eggs hatch to a larval stage (\"fry\"). In terrestrial animals with macrolecithal eggs, the large volume to surface ratio necessitates structures to aid in transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and for storage of waste products so that the embryo does not suffocate or get poisoned from its own waste while inside the egg, see [[amniote]].<ref name=\"Stewart J.

''oviparous'') from live-bearing (Latin. ''viviparous'').\n\nThese classifications are divided into more detail according to the development that occurs before the offspring are expelled from the adult's body. Traditionally:<ref>[[Thierry Lod\u00e9]] 2001. Les strat\u00e9gies de reproduction des animaux (reproduction strategies in animal kingdom). Eds Dunod Sciences, Paris</ref>\n*'''Ovuliparity''' means the female [[Spawn (biology)|spawns]] unfertilized eggs (ova), which must then be externally fertilised. Ovuliparity is typical of [[bony fish]], [[anuran]]s, echinoderms, bivalves and cnidarians. Most aquatic organisms are ovuliparous. The term is derived from the diminiutive meaning \"little egg\".\n*'''Oviparity''' is where fertilisation occurs internally and so the eggs laid by the female are zygotes (or newly developing embryos), often with important outer tissues added (for example, in a chicken egg, no part outside of the yolk originates with the zygote). Oviparity is typical of birds, reptiles, some cartilaginous fish and most arthropods. Terrestrial organisms are typically oviparous, with egg-casings that resist evaporation of moisture. \n*'''Ovo-viviparity''' is where the zygote is retained in the adult's body but there are no ''trophic'' (feeding) interactions. That is, the embryo still obtains all of its nutrients from inside the egg. Most live-bearing fish, amphibians or reptiles are actually ovoviviparous. Examples include the reptile ''[[Anguis fragilis]]'', the sea horse (where zygotes are retained in the male's ventral \"marsupium\"), and the frogs ''Rhinoderma darwinii'' (where the eggs develop in the vocal sac) and ''Rheobatrachus'' (where the eggs develop in the stomach).\n*'''Histotrophic viviparity''' means embryos develop in the female's [[oviduct]]s but obtain nutrients by consuming other ova, zygotes or sibling embryos ([[oophagy]] or [[adelphophagy]]). This [[intra-uterine cannibalism]] occurs in some sharks and in the black salamander ''Salamandra atra''. [[Marsupials]] excrete a \"uterine milk\" supplementing the nourishment from the yolk sak.<ref>{{cite book|last1=USA|first1=David O.

Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and sets them together in a bowl. The tradition of a [[dancing egg]] is held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities since the 16th century. It consists of an emptied egg, positioned over the water jet from a fountain, which starts turning without falling.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cr4NXT5fd4 L'ou com balla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409213049/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cr4NXT5fd4 |date=2016-04-09 }}, Barcelona Cathedral.</ref>\n\nAlthough a food item, raw eggs are sometimes thrown at houses, cars, or people. This act, known commonly as \"[[egging]]\" in the various English-speaking countries, is a minor form of vandalism and, therefore, usually a criminal offense and is capable of damaging property (egg whites can degrade certain types of vehicle paint) as well as potentially causing serious eye injury. On Halloween, for example, trick or treaters have been known to throw eggs (and sometimes flour) at property or people from whom they received nothing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Eggs are also often thrown in protests, as they are inexpensive and nonlethal, yet very messy when broken.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2015/oct/05/history-egging-political-protest-britain|title=Beyond a yolk: a brief history of egging as a political protest|last=Ramaswamy|first=Chitra|date=2015-10-05|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Collecting==\n\nEgg collecting was a popular hobby in some cultures, including among the first Australians.

In the United Kingdom, the practice is prohibited by the Protection of Birds Act 1954 and [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1954/30/section/1/enacted|title=Protection of Birds Act 1954|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref> On the other hand, ongoing underground trading is becoming a serious issue.<ref>{{Citation|last=Wheeler|first=Timothy|title=Poached|date=2015-03-16|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283664/|accessdate=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\nSince the protection of wild bird eggs was regulated, early collections have come to the museums as curiosities.
