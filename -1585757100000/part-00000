The biosynthesis of plant hormones within plant tissues is often diffuse and not always localized. Plants lack glands to produce and store hormones, because, unlike animals\u2014which have two circulatory systems ([[lymphatic]] and [[cardiovascular]]) powered by a [[heart]] that moves fluids around the body\u2014plants use more passive means to move chemicals around their bodies.  Plants utilize simple chemicals as hormones, which move more easily through their tissues. They are often produced and used on a local basis within the plant body.  Plant cells produce hormones that affect even different regions of the cell producing the hormone.\n\nHormones are transported within the plant by utilizing four types of movements.  For localized movement, [[cytoplasm]]ic streaming within cells and slow diffusion of [[ion]]s and [[molecule]]s between cells are utilized. Vascular tissues are used to move hormones from one part of the plant to another; these include [[sieve tube]]s or [[phloem]] that move [[sugar]]s from the leaves to the [[root]]s and flowers, and [[xylem]] that moves water and mineral solutes from the roots to the [[foliage]].\n\nNot all plant cells respond to hormones, but those cells that do are programmed to respond at specific points in their growth cycle.  The greatest effects occur at specific stages during the cell's life, with diminished effects occurring before or after this period. Plants need hormones at very specific times during plant growth and at specific locations.  They also need to disengage the effects that hormones have when they are no longer needed. The production of hormones occurs very often at sites of active growth within the [[meristem]]s, before cells have fully differentiated. After production, they are sometimes moved to other parts of the plant, where they cause an immediate effect; or they can be stored in cells to be released later. Plants use different pathways to regulate internal hormone quantities and moderate their effects; they can regulate the amount of chemicals used to biosynthesize hormones.  They can store them in cells, inactivate them, or cannibalise already-formed hormones by [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugating]] them with [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s, or [[peptide]]s. Plants can also break down hormones chemically, effectively destroying them. Plant hormones frequently regulate the concentrations of other plant hormones.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarup R, Perry P, Hagenbeek D, Van Der Straeten D, Beemster GT, Sandberg G, Bhalerao R, Ljung K, Bennett MJ | title = Ethylene upregulates auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis seedlings to enhance inhibition of root cell elongation | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 2186\u201396 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17630275 | pmc = 1955695 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.107.052100 }}</ref> Plants also move hormones around the plant diluting their concentrations.\n\nThe concentration of hormones required for plant responses are very low (10<sup>\u22126</sup> to 10<sup>\u22125</sup> [[mole (unit)|mol]]/[[liter|L]]). Because of these low concentrations, it has been very difficult to study plant hormones, and only since the late 1970s have scientists been able to start piecing together their effects and relationships to plant physiology.<ref>{{harvnb|Srivastava|2002|p=143}}</ref>  Much of the early work on plant hormones involved studying plants that were genetically deficient in one or involved the use of tissue-cultured plants grown ''[[in vitro]]'' that were subjected to differing ratios of hormones, and the resultant growth compared. The earliest scientific observation and study dates to the 1880s; the determination and observation of plant hormones and their identification was spread-out over the next 70 years.\n\n==Classes==\nDifferent hormones can be sorted into different classes, depending on their chemical structures. Within each class of hormone the exact structures vary, but they have similar physiological effects. Initial research into plant hormones identified five major classes: abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinins, ethylene and gibberellins.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Weier |last1=Thomas Elliot |first2=Rost |last2=Thomas L. |name-list-format=vanc |title=Botany: a brief introduction to plant biology |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1979 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/botanybriefintro00rost/page/155 155\u2013170] |isbn=978-0-471-02114-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/botanybriefintro00rost/page/155 }}</ref>  This list was later expanded and brassinosteroids, jasmonates, salicylic acid and strigolactones are now considered as major plant hormones. Additionally there are also several other compounds that fulfill a similar function to the major hormones, but their status as ''bone fide'' hormones is still debated.\n\n===Abscisic acid===\n[[File:Abscisic acid.svg|thumb|Abscisic acid]]\n[[Abscisic acid]] (also called ABA) is one of the most important plant growth inhibitor. It was discovered and researched under two different names before its chemical properties were fully known, it was called ''dormin'' and ''abscicin II''. Once it was determined that the two compounds are the same, it was named abscisic acid. The name \"abscisic acid\" was given because it was found in high concentrations in newly abscissed or freshly fallen leaves.\n\nThis class of PGR is composed of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from [[chloroplast]]s, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects [[bud]] growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought to play a role in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as [[gibberellin]] levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Feurtado JA, Ambrose SJ, Cutler AJ, Ross AR, Abrams SR, Kermode AR | title = Dormancy termination of western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl.

Just before the seed germinates, ABA levels decrease; during germination and early growth of the seedling, ABA levels decrease even more. As plants begin to produce shoots with fully functional leaves, ABA levels begin to increase, slowing down cellular growth in more \"mature\" areas of the plant.  Stress from water or predation affects ABA production and catabolism rates, mediating another cascade of effects that trigger specific responses from targeted cells.

They also help delay [[senescence]] of tissues, are responsible for mediating auxin transport throughout the plant, and affect internodal length and leaf growth. Cytokinins and auxins often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of plant hormones affect most major growth periods during a plant's lifetime. Cytokinins counter the apical dominance induced by auxins; they in conjunction with ethylene promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.<ref>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Sipes DL, Einset JW |title=Cytokinin stimulation of abscission in lemon pistil explants |journal=J Plant Growth Regul |volume=2 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=73\u201380 |date=August 1983 |doi=10.1007/BF02042235 }}</ref>\n\n===Ethylene===\n[[File:Ethene-2D-flat.png|155x155px|Ethylene|thumb]]\n[[Ethylene]] is a gas that forms through the breakdown of methionine, which is in all cells. Ethylene has very limited solubility in water and does not accumulate within the cell but diffuses out of the cell and escapes out of the plant.  Its effectiveness as a plant hormone is dependent on its rate of production versus its rate of escaping into the atmosphere. Ethylene is produced at a faster rate in rapidly growing and dividing cells, especially in darkness. New growth and newly germinated seedlings produce more ethylene than can escape the plant, which leads to elevated amounts of ethylene, inhibiting [[leaf expansion]] (''see [[Hyponastic response]]''). As the new shoot is exposed to light, reactions by [[phytochrome]] in the plant's cells produce a signal for ethylene production to decrease, allowing leaf expansion. Ethylene affects cell growth and cell shape; when a growing shoot hits an obstacle while underground, ethylene production greatly increases, preventing cell elongation and causing the stem to swell. The resulting thicker stem can exert more pressure against the object impeding its path to the surface. If the shoot does not reach the surface and the ethylene stimulus becomes prolonged, it affects the stem's natural [[geotropic]] response, which is to grow upright, allowing it to grow around an object.   Studies seem to indicate that ethylene affects stem diameter and height: When stems of trees are subjected to wind, causing lateral stress, greater ethylene production occurs, resulting in thicker, more sturdy tree trunks and branches. Ethylene affects fruit-ripening: Normally, when the seeds are mature, ethylene production increases and builds-up within the fruit, resulting in a [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] event just before seed dispersal.  The nuclear protein Ethylene Insensitive2 (EIN2) is regulated by ethylene production, and, in turn, regulates other hormones including ABA and stress hormones.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Liu C, Li K, Sun F, Hu H, Li X, Zhao Y, Han C, Zhang W, Duan Y, Liu M, Li X | display-authors = 6 | title = Arabidopsis EIN2 modulates stress response through abscisic acid response pathway | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 64 | issue = 6 | pages = 633\u201344 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17533512 | doi = 10.1007/s11103-007-9182-7 }}</ref>\n\n===Gibberellins===\n[[File:Gibberellin A1.svg|thumb|155x155px|Gibberellin A1]]\n\n[[Gibberellin]]s (GAs) include a large range of chemicals that are produced naturally within plants and by fungi.

In grafting, auxin promotes [[callus]] tissue formation, which joins the surfaces of the [[grafting|graft]] together. In micropropagation, different PGRs are used to promote multiplication and then rooting of new plantlets.  In the tissue-culturing of plant cells, PGRs are used to produce callus growth, multiplication, and rooting.\n\n===Seed dormancy===\n{{main|Seed dormancy}}\nPlant hormones affect seed germination and dormancy by acting on different parts of the seed.\n\nEmbryo dormancy is characterized by a high ABA:GA ratio, whereas the seed has high abscisic acid sensitivity and low GA sensitivity. In order to release the seed from this type of dormancy and initiate seed germination, an alteration in hormone biosynthesis and degradation toward a low ABA/GA ratio, along with a decrease in ABA sensitivity and an increase in GA sensitivity, must occur.\n\nABA controls embryo dormancy, and GA embryo germination.\nSeed coat dormancy involves the mechanical restriction of the seed coat.  This, along with a low embryo growth potential, effectively produces seed dormancy.  GA releases this dormancy by increasing the embryo growth potential, and/or weakening the seed coat so the radical of the seedling can break through the seed coat.\nDifferent types of seed coats can be made up of living or dead cells, and both types can be influenced by hormones; those composed of living cells are acted upon after seed formation, whereas the seed coats composed of dead cells can be influenced by hormones during the formation of the seed coat.  ABA affects testa or seed coat growth characteristics, including thickness, and effects the GA-mediated embryo growth potential. These conditions and effects occur during the formation of the seed, often in response to environmental conditions. Hormones also mediate endosperm dormancy: Endosperm in most seeds is composed of living tissue that can actively respond to hormones generated by the embryo. The endosperm often acts as a barrier to seed germination, playing a part in seed coat dormancy or in the germination process.  Living cells respond to and also affect the ABA:GA ratio, and mediate cellular sensitivity; GA thus increases the embryo growth potential and can promote endosperm weakening. GA also affects both ABA-independent and ABA-inhibiting processes within the endosperm.<ref>{{cite web | first =  Website | last = Gerhard | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.seedbiology.de/dormancy.asp | title = Seed Dormancy | work = The Seed Biology Place | publisher = Royal Holloway University of London | year = 2000 }}</ref>\n\n==Applications in humans==\n\n=== Salicylic acid ===\nWillow bark has been used for centuries as a painkiller.

The biosynthesis of plant hormones within plant tissues is often diffuse and not always localized. Plants lack glands to produce and store hormones, because, unlike animals\u2014which have two circulatory systems ([[lymphatic]] and [[cardiovascular]]) powered by a [[heart]] that moves fluids around the body\u2014plants use more passive means to move chemicals around their bodies.  Plants utilize simple chemicals as hormones, which move more easily through their tissues. They are often produced and used on a local basis within the plant body.  Plant cells produce hormones that affect even different regions of the cell producing the hormone.\n\nHormones are transported within the plant by utilizing four types of movements.  For localized movement, [[cytoplasm]]ic streaming within cells and slow diffusion of [[ion]]s and [[molecule]]s between cells are utilized. Vascular tissues are used to move hormones from one part of the plant to another; these include [[sieve tube]]s or [[phloem]] that move [[sugar]]s from the leaves to the [[root]]s and flowers, and [[xylem]] that moves water and mineral solutes from the roots to the [[foliage]].\n\nNot all plant cells respond to hormones, but those cells that do are programmed to respond at specific points in their growth cycle.  The greatest effects occur at specific stages during the cell's life, with diminished effects occurring before or after this period. Plants need hormones at very specific times during plant growth and at specific locations.  They also need to disengage the effects that hormones have when they are no longer needed. The production of hormones occurs very often at sites of active growth within the [[meristem]]s, before cells have fully differentiated. After production, they are sometimes moved to other parts of the plant, where they cause an immediate effect; or they can be stored in cells to be released later. Plants use different pathways to regulate internal hormone quantities and moderate their effects; they can regulate the amount of chemicals used to biosynthesize hormones.  They can store them in cells, inactivate them, or cannibalise already-formed hormones by [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugating]] them with [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s, or [[peptide]]s. Plants can also break down hormones chemically, effectively destroying them. Plant hormones frequently regulate the concentrations of other plant hormones.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarup R, Perry P, Hagenbeek D, Van Der Straeten D, Beemster GT, Sandberg G, Bhalerao R, Ljung K, Bennett MJ | title = Ethylene upregulates auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis seedlings to enhance inhibition of root cell elongation | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 2186\u201396 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17630275 | pmc = 1955695 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.107.052100 }}</ref> Plants also move hormones around the plant diluting their concentrations.\n\nThe concentration of hormones required for plant responses are very low (10<sup>\u22126</sup> to 10<sup>\u22125</sup> [[mole (unit)|mol]]/[[liter|L]]). Because of these low concentrations, it has been very difficult to study plant hormones, and only since the late 1970s have scientists been able to start piecing together their effects and relationships to plant physiology.<ref>{{harvnb|Srivastava|2002|p=143}}</ref>  Much of the early work on plant hormones involved studying plants that were genetically deficient in one or involved the use of tissue-cultured plants grown ''[[in vitro]]'' that were subjected to differing ratios of hormones, and the resultant growth compared.

Within each class of hormone the exact structures vary, but they have similar physiological effects. Initial research into plant hormones identified five major classes: abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinins, ethylene and gibberellins.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Weier |last1=Thomas Elliot |first2=Rost |last2=Thomas L. |name-list-format=vanc |title=Botany: a brief introduction to plant biology |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1979 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/botanybriefintro00rost/page/155 155\u2013170] |isbn=978-0-471-02114-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/botanybriefintro00rost/page/155 }}</ref>  This list was later expanded and brassinosteroids, jasmonates, salicylic acid and strigolactones are now considered as major plant hormones. Additionally there are also several other compounds that fulfill a similar function to the major hormones, but their status as ''bone fide'' hormones is still debated.\n\n===Abscisic acid===\n[[File:Abscisic acid.svg|thumb|Abscisic acid]]\n[[Abscisic acid]] (also called ABA) is one of the most important plant growth inhibitor. It was discovered and researched under two different names before its chemical properties were fully known, it was called ''dormin'' and ''abscicin II''. Once it was determined that the two compounds are the same, it was named abscisic acid. The name \"abscisic acid\" was given because it was found in high concentrations in newly abscissed or freshly fallen leaves.\n\nThis class of PGR is composed of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from [[chloroplast]]s, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects [[bud]] growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought to play a role in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as [[gibberellin]] levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Feurtado JA, Ambrose SJ, Cutler AJ, Ross AR, Abrams SR, Kermode AR | title = Dormancy termination of western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl.

Soon after plants are water-stressed and the roots are deficient in water, a signal moves up to the leaves, causing the formation of ABA precursors there, which then move to the roots. The roots then release ABA, which is translocated to the foliage through the vascular system<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ren H, Gao Z, Chen L, Wei K, Liu J, Fan Y, Davies WJ, Jia W, Zhang J | title = Dynamic analysis of ABA accumulation in relation to the rate of ABA catabolism in maize tissues under water deficit | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 211\u20139 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16982652 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erl117 | url = http://jexbot.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16982652 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120710210532/http://jexbot.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16982652 | archive-date = 2012-07-10 }}</ref> and modulates the potassium and sodium uptake within the [[guard cell]]s, which then lose [[turgid]]ity, closing the stomata.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Else MA, Coupland D, Dutton L, Jackson MB |title=Decreased root hydraulic conductivity reduces leaf water potential, initiates stomatal closure, and slows leaf expansion in flooded plants of castor oil (''Ricinus communis'') despite diminished delivery of ABA from the roots to shoots in xylem sap |journal=Physiologia Plantarum |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=46\u201354 |date=January 2001 |doi= 10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1110107.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan J, Tsuichihara N, Etoh T, Iwai S | title = Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide are involved in ABA inhibition of stomatal opening | journal = Plant, Cell & Environment | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 1320\u20135 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17727421 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01711.x  }}</ref>\nABA exists in all parts of the plant and its concentration within any tissue seems to mediate its effects and function as a hormone; its degradation, or more properly [[catabolism]], within the plant affects metabolic reactions and cellular growth and production of other hormones.<ref>\n{{cite journal |title=Role of Abscisic Acid in Seed Dormancy |journal=J Plant Growth Regul |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=319\u2013344 |date=December 2005 |doi=10.1007/s00344-005-0110-2 | vauthors = Kermode AR }}</ref>  Plants start life as a seed with high ABA levels.  Just before the seed germinates, ABA levels decrease; during germination and early growth of the seedling, ABA levels decrease even more. As plants begin to produce shoots with fully functional leaves, ABA levels begin to increase, slowing down cellular growth in more \"mature\" areas of the plant.  Stress from water or predation affects ABA production and catabolism rates, mediating another cascade of effects that trigger specific responses from targeted cells.

Because of this property, [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] auxin herbicides including [[2,4-D]](2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) and [[2,4,5-T]] have been developed and used for [[weed]] control. Auxins, especially [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid]] (NAA) and [[Indole-3-butyric acid]] (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants.

Brassinosteroids control cell elongation and division, [[gravitropism]], resistance to stress, and [[xylem]] differentiation. They inhibit [[root]] growth and leaf [[abscission]].

They were called kinins in the past when the first cytokinins were isolated from yeast cells. They also help delay [[senescence]] of tissues, are responsible for mediating auxin transport throughout the plant, and affect internodal length and leaf growth. Cytokinins and auxins often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of plant hormones affect most major growth periods during a plant's lifetime. Cytokinins counter the apical dominance induced by auxins; they in conjunction with ethylene promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.<ref>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Sipes DL, Einset JW |title=Cytokinin stimulation of abscission in lemon pistil explants |journal=J Plant Growth Regul |volume=2 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=73\u201380 |date=August 1983 |doi=10.1007/BF02042235 }}</ref>\n\n===Ethylene===\n[[File:Ethene-2D-flat.png|155x155px|Ethylene|thumb]]\n[[Ethylene]] is a gas that forms through the breakdown of methionine, which is in all cells. Ethylene has very limited solubility in water and does not accumulate within the cell but diffuses out of the cell and escapes out of the plant.  Its effectiveness as a plant hormone is dependent on its rate of production versus its rate of escaping into the atmosphere. Ethylene is produced at a faster rate in rapidly growing and dividing cells, especially in darkness. New growth and newly germinated seedlings produce more ethylene than can escape the plant, which leads to elevated amounts of ethylene, inhibiting [[leaf expansion]] (''see [[Hyponastic response]]''). As the new shoot is exposed to light, reactions by [[phytochrome]] in the plant's cells produce a signal for ethylene production to decrease, allowing leaf expansion. Ethylene affects cell growth and cell shape; when a growing shoot hits an obstacle while underground, ethylene production greatly increases, preventing cell elongation and causing the stem to swell. The resulting thicker stem can exert more pressure against the object impeding its path to the surface. If the shoot does not reach the surface and the ethylene stimulus becomes prolonged, it affects the stem's natural [[geotropic]] response, which is to grow upright, allowing it to grow around an object.   Studies seem to indicate that ethylene affects stem diameter and height: When stems of trees are subjected to wind, causing lateral stress, greater ethylene production occurs, resulting in thicker, more sturdy tree trunks and branches. Ethylene affects fruit-ripening: Normally, when the seeds are mature, ethylene production increases and builds-up within the fruit, resulting in a [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] event just before seed dispersal.  The nuclear protein Ethylene Insensitive2 (EIN2) is regulated by ethylene production, and, in turn, regulates other hormones including ABA and stress hormones.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Liu C, Li K, Sun F, Hu H, Li X, Zhao Y, Han C, Zhang W, Duan Y, Liu M, Li X | display-authors = 6 | title = Arabidopsis EIN2 modulates stress response through abscisic acid response pathway | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 64 | issue = 6 | pages = 633\u201344 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17533512 | doi = 10.1007/s11103-007-9182-7 }}</ref>\n\n===Gibberellins===\n[[File:Gibberellin A1.svg|thumb|155x155px|Gibberellin A1]]\n\n[[Gibberellin]]s (GAs) include a large range of chemicals that are produced naturally within plants and by fungi.

In order to release the seed from this type of dormancy and initiate seed germination, an alteration in hormone biosynthesis and degradation toward a low ABA/GA ratio, along with a decrease in ABA sensitivity and an increase in GA sensitivity, must occur.\n\nABA controls embryo dormancy, and GA embryo germination.\nSeed coat dormancy involves the mechanical restriction of the seed coat.  This, along with a low embryo growth potential, effectively produces seed dormancy.  GA releases this dormancy by increasing the embryo growth potential, and/or weakening the seed coat so the radical of the seedling can break through the seed coat.\nDifferent types of seed coats can be made up of living or dead cells, and both types can be influenced by hormones; those composed of living cells are acted upon after seed formation, whereas the seed coats composed of dead cells can be influenced by hormones during the formation of the seed coat.  ABA affects testa or seed coat growth characteristics, including thickness, and effects the GA-mediated embryo growth potential. These conditions and effects occur during the formation of the seed, often in response to environmental conditions. Hormones also mediate endosperm dormancy: Endosperm in most seeds is composed of living tissue that can actively respond to hormones generated by the embryo. The endosperm often acts as a barrier to seed germination, playing a part in seed coat dormancy or in the germination process.  Living cells respond to and also affect the ABA:GA ratio, and mediate cellular sensitivity; GA thus increases the embryo growth potential and can promote endosperm weakening. GA also affects both ABA-independent and ABA-inhibiting processes within the endosperm.<ref>{{cite web | first =  Website | last = Gerhard | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.seedbiology.de/dormancy.asp | title = Seed Dormancy | work = The Seed Biology Place | publisher = Royal Holloway University of London | year = 2000 }}</ref>\n\n==Applications in humans==\n\n=== Salicylic acid ===\nWillow bark has been used for centuries as a painkiller.

The album was entirely produced and co-written with the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] production trio and is the last album by the girl group to generate significant chart hits. Tensions between group member [[Siobhan Fahey]] and Stock, Aitken and Waterman regarding songwriting input and lyrical content (particularly with the track \"Strike it Rich\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}) prompted Fahey's departure from Bananarama months after its release. By the time the album's fourth single, \"I Want You Back\", was released, Fahey had been replaced with [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]], who re-recorded the vocals for the single version of the song. Fahey would resurface in 1988 with her new band, [[Shakespears Sister]].\n\nWhile the album was a moderate success in both the UK and the US, it was a particularly big hit in Australia, where it

The album was entirely produced and co-written with the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] production trio and is the last album by the girl group to generate significant chart hits. Tensions between group member [[Siobhan Fahey]] and Stock, Aitken and Waterman regarding songwriting input and lyrical content (particularly with the track \"Strike it Rich\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}) prompted Fahey's departure from Bananarama months after its release. By the time the album's fourth single, \"I Want You Back\", was released, Fahey had been replaced with [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]], who re-recorded the vocals for the single version of the song. Fahey would resurface in 1988 with her new band, [[Shakespears Sister]].\n\nWhile the album was a moderate success in both the UK and the US, it was a particularly big hit in Australia, where it topped the charts.<ref name=aus/>  The album was certified gold in the UK.<ref name=bpi/>\n\n''WOW!'' was re-issued in 2013 as a 3-Disc Deluxe Version and includes \"Reason for Living\", which is an early version of \"I Want You Back\".\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by Sara Dallin, Siobhan Fahey, Keren Woodward, Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman, except where noted.\n\n'''LP
