As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982/83 many of the industries built by his predecessor suffered with a huge surge in import costs. After years of appreciation under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and despite huge increases in foreign aid the Rupee depreciated.\n\n=== Foreign exchange rate ===\nThe Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar until around the start of the 21st century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar. Pakistan's central bank then stabilised by lowering interest rates and buying dollars, in order to preserve the country's export competitiveness\n\n=== Foreign exchange reserves ===\n\nPakistan maintains foreign reserves with [[State Bank of Pakistan]].

While per-capita agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by the growth of the non-agricultural sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen rapid growth in industries (such as apparel, textiles, and cement) and services (such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and finance).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Major sectors ==\n{{See also|List of Pakistani companies}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\n[[File:Agriculture by Province.jpg|thumb|Agriculture by Province]]\n[[File:MangoTree.jpeg|thumb|Mango Orchard in [[Multan]], Pakistan]]\n\nThe most important crops are wheat, [[sugarcane]], cotton, and rice, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 26,674,000 tonnes of wheat, almost equal to all of Africa (27.1 million tonnes) and more than all of South America (25.9 million tonnes), according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=wheat production|website=fao.org|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> In the previous market year of 2018/19 Pakistan exported a record 4.5 million tonnes of rice  as compared to around 4 MMT during the corresponding period last year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Grain%20and%20Feed%20Update_Islamabad_Pakistan_12-30-2019|title=Pakistan Grain and Feed Update|last=|first=|date=|website=gain.fas.usda.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/field/2007/1000497/index.html|title=Pakistan cuts pesticide use dramatically|website=fao.org}}</ref>\n\nPakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years when its harvest is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest [[camel]] market, second-largest [[apricot]] and [[ghee]] market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, play a central role in the government's economic reform package.\n\nMajority of the population, directly or indirectly, dependent on this sector.

About 25% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia. Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year round warmth. Agriculture accounts for about 18.9% of GDP and employs about 42.3% of the labour force. [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited]] is the largest financial institution geared towards the development of agriculture sector through provision of financial services and technical expertise.\n\n==== Mining ====\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. Based on available information, the country's more than 6,00,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. In the wake of 18th amendment to the constitution all the provinces are free to exploit and explore the mineral resources which are in their jurisdiction.\nMining and quarrying contributes 13.19% in industrial sector and its share in GDP is 2.8%. Pakistan mining and quarrying sector grew by 3.04% in 2018 against the negative growth of \u22120.38% last year.\n\nIn the recent past, exploration by government agencies as well as by multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of sizeable minerals deposits. Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province, covered by thick alluvial cover have opened new vistas for metallic minerals exploration. Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals. The discovery of coal deposits having over 175 billion tonnes of reserves at Thar in the Sindh province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternative source of energy. There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones.\n\nExtraction of principal minerals in the last 5 fiscal years is given in the table below :-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//mbs/monthly_bulletin_of_statistics_july_2019.pdf|title=Extraction of Principal Minerals|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Pakistan is manufacturing and selling weapons to over 40 countries, bringing in $20 million annually.The country's arms imports increased by 119 percent between the 2004\u20132008 and 2009\u201313, with China providing 54pc and the USA 27pc of Pakistan's imports.\n\n==== Textiles ====\n{{Main|Textile industry in Pakistan}}\nMost of the Textile Industry is established in Punjab. Before 1990, the situation was different; most of the industry was in Karachi. Textile industry in Pakistan is traditional and conservative, producing and exporting most of low cost raw articles e.g. Raw Cotton, Yarn, fabric etc. Share of finished goods and branded articles is nominal. Pakistan has a potential to quadruple its textile production and export, due to emerging Chinese markets and with its existing infrastructure. 10% of United States imports regarding clothing and other form of textiles is covered by Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe textile sector accounts for 70% of Pakistan's exports, but the working conditions of workers are deplorable. Small manufacturing workshops generally do not sign employment contracts, do not respect the minimum wage and sometimes employ children. Violations of labour law also occur among major subcontractors of international brands, where workers may be beaten, insulted by their superiors or paid below the minimum wage. Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a [[Karachi]] factory. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones. Elsewhere, \"workers involved in the creation of trade unions are victims of violence, intimidation, threats or dismissals\".<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2019/01/25/un-rapport-de-l-ong-human-rights-watch-denonce-les-conditions-de-travail-dans-le-textile-au-pakistan_5414575_3234.html</ref>\n\n==== Other ====\n{{as of|2010}}, Pakistan is one of the largest users of CNG ([[compressed natural gas]]) in the world.

It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums and squatter settlements.

Pakistan faces a significant challenge in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity.\nWhile the government claims credit for overseeing a turnaround in the economy through a comprehensive recovery, it has just failed to oversee a similar improvement in the quality of the network for electricity supply.\nMost cities in Pakistan receive substantial sunlight throughout the year, which would suggest good conditions for investment in solar energy. If the rich people in Pakistan are shifted to solar energy that they should be forced to purchase solar panels, the shortfall can be controlled. this will make the economy boost again as before 2007. According to an econometric analysis published in Quality & Quantity by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich and his colleague Muhammad Shahbaz, economic growth in Pakistan leads to electricity consumption but not vice versa.<ref>Shahbaz, Muhammad and Feridun, Mete (2012) Electricity consumption and economic growth empirical evidence from Pakistan.

Most barriers to the flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of equity participation is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing business has been becoming increasingly difficult over the past decade due to political instability, rising domestic insurgency and insecurity and vehement corruption.

However, in subsequent years exports have declined considerably. This declined started from financial year 2014\u201315 when an international commodity slump set in. This was compounded by structural supply side constraints including energy shortages, high input costs and an overvalued exchange rate. From financial year 2014 to 2016, exports declined by 12.4 percent. Exports growth trend over this period was similar to the world trade growth patterns. Pakistan's external sector continued facing stress during 2016\u201317. But still Pakistan's merchandise trade exports grew by 0.1 percent during the fiscal year 2016\u201317. The imports continued to grow at a much faster rate and grew by a large percentage of 18.0 during the FY 2017 as compared to the previous year.<ref name=\"sbp.gov.pk\">http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Aug/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\nWorld imports had been stagnant between 2011 and 2014 but registered significant drop since early 2015 because of weak commodity and product prices and weak global economic activity. Economic growth was lacklustre in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\ncountries which contributed to the slowdown in China. Furthermore, the ratio between real growth in world imports and world real GDP growth substantially declined. This decline in the import content of economic activity triggered a shift in consumption worldwide from traded towards non-traded goods, import substitution, a slowdown in the pace of [[Free trade|trade liberalization]], and gave currency to protectionist measures. A bulk of Pakistan's exports are directed to the OECD region and China. Historical data suggest strong correlation between Pakistani exports to imports in OECD and China. As per FY 2016 data, more than half of country's exports are shipped to these two destinations i.e. OECD and China. A decline in Pakistan overall exports,thus occurred in this backdrop.<ref name=\"financegov\">http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/08-Trade.pdf</ref>\n\nPakistan's imports are showing rising trend at a relatively faster rate due to the increased economic activity as part of [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), particularly in the Energy sector. The construction projects under CPEC require heavy machinery that has to be imported. It is also observed that the economy is currently being led both by investments as well as consumption, resulting in relatively higher levels of imports. During FY 2018 Pakistan's exports picked up and reached to US$24.8 billion showing a growth of 12.6 percent over previous year FY 2017. Imports on the other hand also increased by 16.2 percent and touched the highest figure of US$56.6 billion. As a result, the trade deficit widened to US$31.8 billion which was the highest since last ten years.

A reversal in global oil prices led to\nincrease in POL imports, accompanied by falling exports, as a result the merchandised [[trade deficit]] grew by 39.4 percent to US$26.885 billion in FY 2017. While [[remittances]] and Coalition Support Fund inflows both declined slightly over the same period last year, however, the impact was offset by an improvement in the income account, mainly due to lower profit repatriations by oil and gas firms.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n'''Current account'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Current account deficit]] increased to US$12.4 billion in FY 2017, against US$3.2 billion in FY 2016.<ref>http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Nov/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\n\nHowever, the impact of high current deficit on [[foreign exchange reserves]] was not severe, as financial inflows were available to the country to partially offset the gap; these inflows helped ensure stability in the exchange rate. Net [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] grew by 12.4 percent and reached US$1.6 billion in the nine-months period, whereas net FPI saw an inflow of US$631 million, against an outflow of US$393 million last year. Encouragingly for the country, the period saw the completion of multiple merger and acquisition deals between local and foreign companies. Moreover, multiple foreign automakers announced their intention to enter the Pakistani market, and some also entered into joint ventures with local conglomerates. This indicates that Pakistan is clearly on foreign investors' radar, and provides a positive outlook for FDI inflows going forward. government's successful issuance of a US$1.0 billion Sukuk in the international capital market, at an extremely low rate of 5.5 percent.\nBesides, Pakistan continued to enjoy support from international financial institutions (IFIs) like the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]], and from bilateral partners like China, in the post-EFF period: net official loan inflows of US$1.1 billion were recorded during the period. As a result, the country's FX reserve amounted to US$20.8 billion by 4 May 2017 sufficient to finance around four month of import payments.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n=== Economic aid ===\n{{Main|Foreign aid to Pakistan}}\nPakistan receives economic aid from several sources as loans and grants. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] (WB), [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), etc. provide long-term loans to Pakistan. Pakistan also receives bilateral aid from developed and oil-rich countries. [[Foreign aid to Pakistan|Foreign aid]] has been one of the main sources of money for the Pakistani Economy.

The Pakistanis settled in Western Europe and North America are important sources of remittances to Pakistan. Since 1973 the Pakistani workers in the oil rich Arab states have been sources of billions of dollars of remittances.\n\nThe 9 million-strong [[Pakistani diaspora]], contributed US$19.3 billion to the economy in FY2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Aug/ExternalSector.pdf|title=Pakistan &#124; State Bank of Pakistan |publisher=sbp.org |date= |accessdate=2017-09-07}}</ref> The major source countries of remittances to Pakistan include UAE, US, Saudi Arabia, GCC countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman), Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway,  Switzerland, UK and EU countries.\n\nRemittances sent home by overseas Pakistani workers have seen a negative growth of 3.0% in the fiscal year 2017 compare to previous year when remittances reached at all-time high of 19.9 billion US dollars. This decline in remittances is mainly due to the adverse economic conditions of Arabian and gulf countries after the fall in oil prices in 2016. However, the recent development activities in the Qatar FIFA World Cup, Dubai Expo, Saudi Arabia's implementation of its Vision 2030 and particularly the recent visit of the P.M to Kuwait should all be helpful in opening new avenues for employment in these countries .

As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982/83 many of the industries built by his predecessor suffered with a huge surge in import costs. After years of appreciation under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and despite huge increases in foreign aid the Rupee depreciated.\n\n=== Foreign exchange rate ===\nThe Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar until around the start of the 21st century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar.

While per-capita agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by the growth of the non-agricultural sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen rapid growth in industries (such as apparel, textiles, and cement) and services (such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and finance).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Major sectors ==\n{{See also|List of Pakistani companies}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\n[[File:Agriculture by Province.jpg|thumb|Agriculture by Province]]\n[[File:MangoTree.jpeg|thumb|Mango Orchard in [[Multan]], Pakistan]]\n\nThe most important crops are wheat, [[sugarcane]], cotton, and rice, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 26,674,000 tonnes of wheat, almost equal to all of Africa (27.1 million tonnes) and more than all of South America (25.9 million tonnes), according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=wheat production|website=fao.org|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> In the previous market year of 2018/19 Pakistan exported a record 4.5 million tonnes of rice  as compared to around 4 MMT during the corresponding period last year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Grain%20and%20Feed%20Update_Islamabad_Pakistan_12-30-2019|title=Pakistan Grain and Feed Update|last=|first=|date=|website=gain.fas.usda.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/field/2007/1000497/index.html|title=Pakistan cuts pesticide use dramatically|website=fao.org}}</ref>\n\nPakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years when its harvest is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest [[camel]] market, second-largest [[apricot]] and [[ghee]] market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, play a central role in the government's economic reform package.\n\nMajority of the population, directly or indirectly, dependent on this sector. It contributes about 18.5% percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and accounts for 37.4% of employed labor force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.<ref name=\":3\" /> During 2017\u201318, agriculture sector recorded a remarkable growth of 3.70 percent and surpassed its targeted growth of 3.5 percent and last year's growth of 2.18 percent.

About 25% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia. Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year round warmth. Agriculture accounts for about 18.9% of GDP and employs about 42.3% of the labour force. [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited]] is the largest financial institution geared towards the development of agriculture sector through provision of financial services and technical expertise.\n\n==== Mining ====\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. Based on available information, the country's more than 6,00,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. In the wake of 18th amendment to the constitution all the provinces are free to exploit and explore the mineral resources which are in their jurisdiction.\nMining and quarrying contributes 13.19% in industrial sector and its share in GDP is 2.8%. Pakistan mining and quarrying sector grew by 3.04% in 2018 against the negative growth of \u22120.38% last year.\n\nIn the recent past, exploration by government agencies as well as by multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of sizeable minerals deposits. Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province, covered by thick alluvial cover have opened new vistas for metallic minerals exploration. Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals. The discovery of coal deposits having over 175 billion tonnes of reserves at Thar in the Sindh province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternative source of energy. There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones.\n\nExtraction of principal minerals in the last 5 fiscal years is given in the table below :-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//mbs/monthly_bulletin_of_statistics_july_2019.pdf|title=Extraction of Principal Minerals|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Pakistan is manufacturing and selling weapons to over 40 countries, bringing in $20 million annually.The country's arms imports increased by 119 percent between the 2004\u20132008 and 2009\u201313, with China providing 54pc and the USA 27pc of Pakistan's imports.\n\n==== Textiles ====\n{{Main|Textile industry in Pakistan}}\nMost of the Textile Industry is established in Punjab. Before 1990, the situation was different; most of the industry was in Karachi. Textile industry in Pakistan is traditional and conservative, producing and exporting most of low cost raw articles e.g. Raw Cotton, Yarn, fabric etc. Share of finished goods and branded articles is nominal. Pakistan has a potential to quadruple its textile production and export, due to emerging Chinese markets and with its existing infrastructure. 10% of United States imports regarding clothing and other form of textiles is covered by Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe textile sector accounts for 70% of Pakistan's exports, but the working conditions of workers are deplorable. Small manufacturing workshops generally do not sign employment contracts, do not respect the minimum wage and sometimes employ children. Violations of labour law also occur among major subcontractors of international brands, where workers may be beaten, insulted by their superiors or paid below the minimum wage. Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a [[Karachi]] factory. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones. Elsewhere, \"workers involved in the creation of trade unions are victims of violence, intimidation, threats or dismissals\".<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2019/01/25/un-rapport-de-l-ong-human-rights-watch-denonce-les-conditions-de-travail-dans-le-textile-au-pakistan_5414575_3234.html</ref>\n\n==== Other ====\n{{as of|2010}}, Pakistan is one of the largest users of CNG ([[compressed natural gas]]) in the world.

It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums and squatter settlements. The report said that meeting the backlog in housing, besides replacement of out-lived housing units, is beyond the financial resources of the government.

Pakistan faces a significant challenge in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity.\nWhile the government claims credit for overseeing a turnaround in the economy through a comprehensive recovery, it has just failed to oversee a similar improvement in the quality of the network for electricity supply.\nMost cities in Pakistan receive substantial sunlight throughout the year, which would suggest good conditions for investment in solar energy. If the rich people in Pakistan are shifted to solar energy that they should be forced to purchase solar panels, the shortfall can be controlled. this will make the economy boost again as before 2007. According to an econometric analysis published in Quality & Quantity by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich and his colleague Muhammad Shahbaz, economic growth in Pakistan leads to electricity consumption but not vice versa.<ref>Shahbaz, Muhammad and Feridun, Mete (2012) Electricity consumption and economic growth empirical evidence from Pakistan.

Most barriers to the flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of equity participation is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing business has been becoming increasingly difficult over the past decade due to political instability, rising domestic insurgency and insecurity and vehement corruption.

However, in subsequent years exports have declined considerably. This declined started from financial year 2014\u201315 when an international commodity slump set in. This was compounded by structural supply side constraints including energy shortages, high input costs and an overvalued exchange rate. From financial year 2014 to 2016, exports declined by 12.4 percent. Exports growth trend over this period was similar to the world trade growth patterns. Pakistan's external sector continued facing stress during 2016\u201317. But still Pakistan's merchandise trade exports grew by 0.1 percent during the fiscal year 2016\u201317. The imports continued to grow at a much faster rate and grew by a large percentage of 18.0 during the FY 2017 as compared to the previous year.<ref name=\"sbp.gov.pk\">http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Aug/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\nWorld imports had been stagnant between 2011 and 2014 but registered significant drop since early 2015 because of weak commodity and product prices and weak global economic activity. Economic growth was lacklustre in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\ncountries which contributed to the slowdown in China. Furthermore, the ratio between real growth in world imports and world real GDP growth substantially declined. This decline in the import content of economic activity triggered a shift in consumption worldwide from traded towards non-traded goods, import substitution, a slowdown in the pace of [[Free trade|trade liberalization]], and gave currency to protectionist measures. A bulk of Pakistan's exports are directed to the OECD region and China. Historical data suggest strong correlation between Pakistani exports to imports in OECD and China. As per FY 2016 data, more than half of country's exports are shipped to these two destinations i.e. OECD and China. A decline in Pakistan overall exports,thus occurred in this backdrop.<ref name=\"financegov\">http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/08-Trade.pdf</ref>\n\nPakistan's imports are showing rising trend at a relatively faster rate due to the increased economic activity as part of [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), particularly in the Energy sector. The construction projects under CPEC require heavy machinery that has to be imported. It is also observed that the economy is currently being led both by investments as well as consumption, resulting in relatively higher levels of imports. During FY 2018 Pakistan's exports picked up and reached to US$24.8 billion showing a growth of 12.6 percent over previous year FY 2017. Imports on the other hand also increased by 16.2 percent and touched the highest figure of US$56.6 billion. As a result, the trade deficit widened to US$31.8 billion which was the highest since last ten years.

A reversal in global oil prices led to\nincrease in POL imports, accompanied by falling exports, as a result the merchandised [[trade deficit]] grew by 39.4 percent to US$26.885 billion in FY 2017. While [[remittances]] and Coalition Support Fund inflows both declined slightly over the same period last year, however, the impact was offset by an improvement in the income account, mainly due to lower profit repatriations by oil and gas firms.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n'''Current account'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Current account deficit]] increased to US$12.4 billion in FY 2017, against US$3.2 billion in FY 2016.<ref>http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Nov/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\n\nHowever, the impact of high current deficit on [[foreign exchange reserves]] was not severe, as financial inflows were available to the country to partially offset the gap; these inflows helped ensure stability in the exchange rate. Net [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] grew by 12.4 percent and reached US$1.6 billion in the nine-months period, whereas net FPI saw an inflow of US$631 million, against an outflow of US$393 million last year. Encouragingly for the country, the period saw the completion of multiple merger and acquisition deals between local and foreign companies. Moreover, multiple foreign automakers announced their intention to enter the Pakistani market, and some also entered into joint ventures with local conglomerates. This indicates that Pakistan is clearly on foreign investors' radar, and provides a positive outlook for FDI inflows going forward. government's successful issuance of a US$1.0 billion Sukuk in the international capital market, at an extremely low rate of 5.5 percent.\nBesides, Pakistan continued to enjoy support from international financial institutions (IFIs) like the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]], and from bilateral partners like China, in the post-EFF period: net official loan inflows of US$1.1 billion were recorded during the period. As a result, the country's FX reserve amounted to US$20.8 billion by 4 May 2017 sufficient to finance around four month of import payments.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n=== Economic aid ===\n{{Main|Foreign aid to Pakistan}}\nPakistan receives economic aid from several sources as loans and grants. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] (WB), [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), etc. provide long-term loans to Pakistan. Pakistan also receives bilateral aid from developed and oil-rich countries. [[Foreign aid to Pakistan|Foreign aid]] has been one of the main sources of money for the Pakistani Economy.

However, the recent development activities in the Qatar FIFA World Cup, Dubai Expo, Saudi Arabia's implementation of its Vision 2030 and particularly the recent visit of the P.M to Kuwait should all be helpful in opening new avenues for employment in these countries .

He created the television series ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' (1993\u20131995), a popular and critical success in the UK, for which he received two [[Edgar Award]]s from the [[Mystery Writers of America]]. He has also received recognition for ''[[Hillsborough (1996 film)|Hillsborough]]'', ''[[The Lakes (TV series)|The Lakes]],'' ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]'' and ''[[Accused (2010 TV series)|Accused]]'', among others.\n\n==Early life==\nMcGovern was one of nine children born to working class Liverpool born parents, William McGovern and Jane Warner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/cracker-writer-jimmy-mcgovern-says-5219049|title=Cracker writer Jimmy McGovern says he could have been IRA soldier if born in Ireland|publisher=Mirror|date=24 February 2015|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> He had a stammer until the age of eight. He attended a Jesuit secondary school, [[St. Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool|St Francis Xavier's College]] in Liverpool. He taught for a time at Quarry Bank Secondary Comprehensive school, where he organised the end-of-school play.\n\n==Television writing career==\nIn 1982, McGovern started his TV career working on [[Channel 4]]'s soap opera ''[[Brookside]]''. He tackled many social issues in the course of the series, especially unemployment \u2013 which was at a post-war high at the time. In 1993, he created the drama serial ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'', about the work of a fictional criminal psychologist played by [[Robbie Coltrane]]. Made by [[Granada Television]] and screened on [[ITV Network|ITV]], the series was a critical and popular success, lasting until 1995. ''Cracker'' also aired in the [[United States]], on the [[A&E Network|Arts and Entertainment]] cable network. McGovern's writing earned him two [[Edgar Award]]s from the [[Mystery Writers of America]]. In 1997 he created ''[[The Lakes (TV series)|The Lakes]]'', a drama that shared ''Brookside's'' realist setting and reused themes from ''Cracker,'' such as gambling addiction. In 2006, he created the [[BBC One]] drama, ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]''; its third and final season aired in 2009.\n\nMcGovern also wrote the script for the television [[docudrama]] ''[[Hillsborough (1996 film)|Hillsborough]]'' (1996), based on the events of the [[Hillsborough disaster|stadium disaster]] in 1989, which claimed the lives of 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final. Among the cast of this drama was [[Christopher Eccleston]], who also featured in ''Cracker'', along with former ''Brookside'' actor [[Ricky Tomlinson]]. In 2013, Eccleston said it was the most important work he'd ever done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2010/11/30/christopher-eccleston-says-jimmy-mcgovern-s-hillsborough-is-most-important-work-he-s-ever-done-100252-27739218/ |title=Christopher Eccleston says Jimmy McGovern\u2019s Hillsborough is most important work he's ever done |publisher=Liverpool Echo |date= |accessdate=2013-01-02}}</ref> Newspapers cited ''Hillsborough'' as a factor in a new inquiry set up in 1997.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1052988/index.html | title= Hillsborough (1996) | work=Screenonline | accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis series ''[[Accused (2010 TV series)|Accused]]'' aired from 2010 to 2012 on BBC One. It followed a similar format to ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]'' but with a crime component. The series' writers included McGovern, [[Danny Brocklehurst]], Alice Nutter and Shaun Duggan. It was produced by Sita Williams.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 2012, McGovern together with local Indigenous Australian writers from [[Sydney]], developed the Australian television drama series ''[[Redfern Now]]'', set among the [[Indigenous Australians]] of the Sydney suburb of [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].

He created the television series ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' (1993\u20131995), a popular and critical success in the UK, for which he received two [[Edgar Award]]s from the [[Mystery Writers of America]]. He has also received recognition for ''[[Hillsborough (1996 film)|Hillsborough]]'', ''[[The Lakes (TV series)|The Lakes]],'' ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]'' and ''[[Accused (2010 TV series)|Accused]]'', among others.\n\n==Early life==\nMcGovern was one of nine children born to working class Liverpool born parents, William McGovern and Jane Warner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/cracker-writer-jimmy-mcgovern-says-5219049|title=Cracker writer Jimmy McGovern says he could have been IRA soldier if born in Ireland|publisher=Mirror|date=24 February 2015|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> He had a stammer until the age of eight. He attended a Jesuit secondary school, [[St. Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool|St Francis Xavier's College]] in Liverpool. He taught for a time at Quarry Bank Secondary Comprehensive school, where he organised the end-of-school play.\n\n==Television writing career==\nIn 1982, McGovern started his TV career working on [[Channel 4]]'s soap opera ''[[Brookside]]''. He tackled many social issues in the course of the series, especially unemployment \u2013 which was at a post-war high at the time. In 1993, he created the drama serial ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'', about the work of a fictional criminal psychologist played by [[Robbie Coltrane]]. Made by [[Granada Television]] and screened on [[ITV Network|ITV]], the series was a critical and popular success, lasting until 1995. ''Cracker'' also aired in the [[United States]], on the [[A&E Network|Arts and Entertainment]] cable network. McGovern's writing earned him two [[Edgar Award]]s from the [[Mystery Writers of America]]. In 1997 he created ''[[The Lakes (TV series)|The Lakes]]'', a drama that shared ''Brookside's'' realist setting and reused themes from ''Cracker,'' such as gambling addiction. In 2006, he created the [[BBC One]] drama, ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]''; its third and final season aired in 2009.\n\nMcGovern also wrote the script for the television [[docudrama]] ''[[Hillsborough (1996 film)|Hillsborough]]'' (1996), based on the events of the [[Hillsborough disaster|stadium disaster]] in 1989, which claimed the lives of 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final. Among the cast of this drama was [[Christopher Eccleston]], who also featured in ''Cracker'', along with former ''Brookside'' actor [[Ricky Tomlinson]]. In 2013, Eccleston said it was the most important work he'd ever done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2010/11/30/christopher-eccleston-says-jimmy-mcgovern-s-hillsborough-is-most-important-work-he-s-ever-done-100252-27739218/ |title=Christopher Eccleston says Jimmy McGovern\u2019s Hillsborough is most important work he's ever done |publisher=Liverpool Echo |date= |accessdate=2013-01-02}}</ref> Newspapers cited ''Hillsborough'' as a factor in a new inquiry set up in 1997.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1052988/index.html | title= Hillsborough (1996) | work=Screenonline | accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis series ''[[Accused (2010 TV series)|Accused]]'' aired from 2010 to 2012 on BBC One. It followed a similar format to ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]'' but with a crime component. The series' writers included McGovern, [[Danny Brocklehurst]], Alice Nutter and Shaun Duggan. It was produced by Sita Williams.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 2012, McGovern together with local Indigenous Australian writers from [[Sydney]], developed the Australian television drama series ''[[Redfern Now]]'', set among the [[Indigenous Australians]] of the Sydney suburb of [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]]. The six-part series follows a similar format to ''Accused'', telling the stories of six inner-city households in one street whose lives are changed by a seemingly insignificant incident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/funding/indigenous/SpecInit_redfernnow.aspx |title=Industry Support \u2013 Indigenous Programs |publisher=Screen Australia |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2013-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422134105/http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/funding/indigenous/SpecInit_RedfernNow.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The series debuted on 1 November 2012, was produced by [[Blackfella Films]] and has been commissioned for a second series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/11/renewed-redfern-now.html |title=Renewed: Redfern Now |publisher=TV Tonight |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Film writing==\nMcGovern wrote the screenplay for the 1994 drama, ''[[Priest (1994 film)|Priest]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/jimmy-mcgovern-attends-fact-priest-3427304|title=Jimmy McGovern attends FACT Priest screening|last=Echo|first=Liverpool|date=2010-03-02|work=liverpoolecho|access-date=2017-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Theatre==\nMcGovern wrote the book for the musical stage show ''[[King Cotton (play)|King Cotton]]'', which explores links between the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and [[Industrial Revolution|industrialisation]] in [[North West England]], as part of the [[Liverpool]] [[European Capital of Culture]] 2008. ''King Cotton'' premiered at [[the Lowry]] in September 2007 before moving to the [[Liverpool Empire Theatre|Liverpool Empire]].\n\n==Producer==\nIn 2009, McGovern was the executive producer on the BBC One miniseries ''[[Moving On (TV series)|Moving On]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/04_april/15/moving.shtml|title=BBC - Press Office - Moving On press pack: introduction|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Views==\nMcGovern has described cinema scriptwriters as being treated like hacks and forced to crank out countless drafts by successive producers. McGovern has openly criticised dramas such as ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' lamenting the lack of quality, believable storytelling in the early 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4794478.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Cracker writer attacks ITV drama|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHe believes that television directors are underrated.
