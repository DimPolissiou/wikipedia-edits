The operation put into action [[Nazi Germany]]'s  ideological goal of conquering the western Soviet Union so as to repopulate it with [[Germans]]. The German [[Generalplan Ost]] aimed to use some of the conquered as [[unfree labour|slave labour]] for the Axis war effort, to acquire the oil reserves of the [[Caucasus]] and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories, and eventually to [[War of annihilation|annihilate]] the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] and create {{lang|de|[[Lebensraum]]}} for Germany.{{sfn|Rich|1973|pp=204\u2013221}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|title=Blood lands|publisher=Basic Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0465031474|location=|pages=416}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Smelser, Ronald.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/237148298|title=The myth of the Eastern Front : the Nazi-Soviet war in American popular culture|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Nevertheless, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] began planning an invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1940 (under the codename [[Operation Otto]]), which [[Adolf Hitler]] authorized on 18 December 1940. Over the course of the operation, about three million personnel of the [[Axis powers]]\u2014the largest invasion force in the [[history of warfare]]\u2014invaded the western Soviet Union along a {{convert|2900|km|mi|sp=us|adj=on}} front, with 600,000 motor vehicles and over 600,000 horses for non-combat operations. The offensive marked an escalation of World War II, both geographically and in the formation of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied coalition]] including the Soviet Union.\n\nThe operation opened up the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], in which more forces were committed than in any other [[theater of war]] in history. The area saw some of the war's largest battles, most horrific [[war crime|atrocities]], and highest [[World War II casualties|casualties]] (for Soviet and Axis forces alike), all of which influenced the course of World War II and the subsequent [[history of the 20th century]]. The German armies eventually captured some 5,000,000 Soviet [[Red Army]] troops,{{sfn|Chapoutot|2018|p=272}} a majority of whom never returned alive. The Nazis deliberately [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|starved to death, or otherwise killed]], 3.3 million Soviet prisoners of war, and a vast number of civilians, as the \"[[Hunger Plan]]\" worked to [[Generalplan Ost|exterminate the Slavic population]].{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=175\u2013186}} [[Einsatzgruppen|Mass shootings]] and gassing operations, carried out by the Nazis or willing collaborators,{{Efn|See for instance the involvement of Latvian and Ukrainian forces in killing Jews cited by historian, Raul Hilberg.{{sfn|Hilberg|1992|pp=58\u201361, 199\u2013202}}}} murdered over a million [[Soviet Jews]] as part of [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|1996|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe failure of Operation Barbarossa reversed the fortunes of the [[Third Reich]].{{sfn|Rees|2010}} Operationally, German forces achieved significant victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the Soviet Union (mainly in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]) and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. Despite these early successes, the German offensive stalled in the [[Battle of Moscow]] at the end of 1941, and the subsequent [[Battle of Moscow#Soviet counter-offensive|Soviet winter counteroffensive]] pushed German troops back. The Germans had confidently expected a quick collapse of Soviet resistance as in [[Invasion of Poland|Poland]], but the Red Army absorbed the German [[Wehrmacht]]'s strongest blows and bogged it down in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] for which the Germans were unprepared. The Wehrmacht's diminished forces could no longer attack along the entire Eastern Front, and subsequent operations to retake the initiative and drive deep into Soviet territory\u2014such as [[Case Blue]] in 1942 and [[Operation Citadel]] in 1943\u2014eventually failed, which resulted in the Wehrmacht's retreat and collapse.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Background==\n===Racial policies of Nazi Germany===\n{{Main|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}\nAs early as 1925, [[Adolf Hitler]] vaguely declared in his political manifesto and autobiography ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' that he would invade the [[Soviet Union]], asserting that the German people needed to secure ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") to ensure the survival of Germany for generations to come.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2002|p=188}} On 10 February 1939, Hitler told his army commanders that the next war would be \"purely a war of ''[[Weltanschauung]]en'' ... totally a people's war, a [[racial war]]\". On 23 November, once World War II had already started, Hitler declared that \"racial war has broken out and this war shall determine who shall govern Europe, and with it, the world\".{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=21}} The [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] portrayed the Soviet Union (and all of Eastern Europe) as populated by non-Aryan ''[[Untermenschen]]'' (\"sub-humans\"), ruled by [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevik]] conspirators.{{sfn|Hillgruber|1972|p=140}} Hitler claimed in ''Mein Kampf'' that Germany's destiny was to \"[[Drang nach Osten|turn to the East]]\" as it did \"six hundred years ago\" (see ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'').{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=716}} Accordingly, it was stated Nazi policy to kill, deport, or enslave the majority of Russian and other Slavic populations and repopulate the land with Germanic peoples, under the [[Generalplan Ost]].{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=271}} The Nazis' belief in their ethnic superiority pervades official records and [[pseudoscientific]] articles in German periodicals, on topics such as \"how to deal with alien populations\".{{sfn|Fahlbusch|1999|pp=241\u2013264}}\n[[File:Generalplan Ost-en.svg|thumb|200px|Plan of new German settlement colonies (marked with dots and diamonds), drawn up by the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] Institute of Agriculture in Berlin, 1942]]\nWhile older histories tended to emphasize the notion of a \"[[Clean Wehrmacht]]\" upholding its honor in the face of Hitler's fanaticism, the historian [[J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster]] notes that \"In fact, the military commanders were caught up in the ideological character of the conflict, and involved in its implementation as willing participants.\"{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=21}} Before and during the invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops were heavily indoctrinated with [[anti-Bolshevik]], [[anti-Semitic]], and [[anti-Slavic]] ideology via movies, radio, lectures, books, and leaflets.{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=59}} Likening the Soviets to the forces of [[Genghis Khan]], Hitler told [[Croatia]]n military leader [[Slavko Kvaternik]] that the \"Mongolian race\" threatened Europe.{{sfn|Breitman|1990|pp=340\u2013341}} Following the invasion, Wehrmacht officers told their soldiers to target people who were described as \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\", the \"Mongol hordes\", the \"Asiatic flood\", and the \"Red beast\".{{sfn|Evans|1989|pp=59\u201360}} Nazi propaganda portrayed the war against the Soviet Union as both an ideological war between German National Socialism and Jewish Bolshevism, and a racial war between the disciplined Germans and the Jewish, Gypsy, and Slavic ''Untermenschen''.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=512}} An 'order from the F\u00fchrer' stated that the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' were to execute all Soviet functionaries who were \"less valuable Asiatics, Gypsies and Jews\".{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=100}} Six months into the invasion of the Soviet Union, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had already murdered in excess of 500,000 Soviet Jews, a figure greater than the number of Red Army soldiers killed in combat during that time.{{sfn|Lewy|2017|p=24}} German army commanders cast the Jews as the major cause behind the \"[[Partisan (military)|partisan]] struggle\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=466}} The main guideline for German troops was \"Where there's a partisan, there's a Jew, and where there's a Jew, there's a partisan\", or \"The partisan is where the Jew is\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=467}}{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=28}} Many German troops viewed the war in Nazi terms and regarded their Soviet enemies as sub-human.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|2005|p=127}}\n\nAfter the war began, the Nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign slave workers.{{sfn|Majer|2003|p=180}} There were regulations enacted against the ''[[Ost-Arbeiter]]'' (\"Eastern workers\") that included the death penalty for sexual relations with a German.{{sfn|Gellately|1990|p=224}} [[Heinrich Himmler]], in his secret memorandum, ''Reflections on the Treatment of Peoples of Alien Races in the East'' (dated 25 May 1940), outlined the Nazi plans for the non-German populations in the East.{{sfn|Himmler|1940|pp=147\u2013150}} Himmler believed the [[Germanization]] process in Eastern Europe would be complete when \"in the East dwell only men with truly German, Germanic blood\".{{sfn|Mazower|2009|p=181}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B01718, Ausstellung \"Planung und Aufbau im Osten\".jpg|thumb|left|Heinrich Himmler, [[Rudolf Hess]], and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] listening to [[Konrad Meyer]] at a ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' exhibition, 20 March 1941]]\nThe Nazi secret plan ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (\"General Plan for the East\"), prepared in 1941 and confirmed in 1942, called for a \"new order of ethnographical relations\" in the territories occupied by Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe. It envisaged [[ethnic cleansing]], executions, and enslavement of the populations of conquered countries, with very small percentages undergoing Germanization, expulsion into the depths of Russia, or other fates, while the conquered territories would be Germanized. The plan had two parts: the ''Kleine Planung'' (\"small plan\"), which covered actions to be taken during the war, and the ''Gro\u00dfe Planung'' (\"large plan\"), which covered policies after the war was won, to be implemented gradually over 25 to 30 years.{{sfn|R\u00f6ssler|Schleiermacher|1996|pp=270\u2013274}}\n\nA speech given by General [[Erich Hoepner]] demonstrates the dissemination of the Nazi racial plan, as he informed the [[4th Panzer Group]] that the war against the Soviet Union was \"an essential part of the German people's struggle for existence\" (''Daseinskampf''), also referring to the imminent battle as the \"old struggle of Germans against Slavs\" and even stated, \"the struggle must aim at the annihilation of today's Russia and must, therefore, be waged with unparalleled harshness\".{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=140}} Hoepner also added that the Germans were fighting for \"the defense of European culture against Moscovite\u2013Asiatic inundation, and the repulse of Jewish Bolshevism ... No adherents of the present Russian-Bolshevik system are to be spared.\" [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] also told his subordinates that troops should view the war as a \"struggle between two different races and [should] act with the necessary severity\".{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=23}} Racial motivations were central to Nazi ideology and played a key role in planning for Operation Barbarossa since both [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jews and communists]] were considered equivalent enemies of the Nazi state.

The grey area represents Nazi Germany, its allies, and countries under its firm control.]]\n\nIn August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact in Moscow known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. A secret protocol to the pact outlined an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union on the division of the eastern European [[Border states (Eastern Europe)|border states]] between their respective \"[[spheres of influence]]\": the Soviet Union and Germany would partition Poland in the event of an invasion by Germany, and the Soviets would be allowed to overrun the Baltic states and [[Finland]].{{sfn|Kirby|1980|p=120}} On 23 August 1939 the rest of the world learned of this pact but were unaware of the provisions to partition Poland.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1973|p=89}} The pact stunned the world because of the parties' earlier mutual hostility and their conflicting [[Ideology|ideologies]].{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=30}} The conclusion of this pact was followed by the [[German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September that triggered the outbreak of [[World War II in Europe]], then the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] that led to the annexation of the eastern part of the country.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|pp=56\u201359}} As a result of the pact, Germany and the Soviet Union maintained reasonably strong diplomatic relations for two years and fostered [[Nazi\u2013Soviet economic relations (1934\u201341)|an important economic relationship]]. The countries entered a [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|trade pact in 1940]] by which the Soviets received German military equipment and trade goods in exchange for raw materials, such as oil and wheat, to help the Nazis circumvent a British [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u201345)|blockade of Germany]].{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=668\u2013669}}\n\nDespite the parties' ostensibly cordial relations, each side was highly suspicious of the other's intentions. For instance, the Soviet invasion of [[Bukovina]] in June 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with Germany.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341}} After Germany entered the [[Tripartite Pact|Axis Pact]] with Japan and Italy, it began [[German\u2013Soviet Axis talks|negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact]].{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=57}} After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12 to 14 November 1940, Germany presented a written proposal for a Soviet entry into the Axis. On 25 November 1940, the Soviet Union offered a written counter-proposal to join the Axis if Germany would agree to refrain from interference in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, but Germany did not respond.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=57}} As both sides began colliding with each other in Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they did sign a [[German\u2013Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement|border and commercial agreement]] addressing several open issues in January 1941. According to historian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], [[Joseph Stalin]] was convinced that the overall military strength of the USSR was such that he had nothing to fear and anticipated an easy victory should Germany attack; moreover, Stalin believed that since the Germans were still fighting the British in the west, Hitler would be unlikely to open up a two front war and subsequently delayed the reconstruction of defensive fortifications in the border regions.{{sfn|Service|2005|p=259}} When German soldiers swam across the [[Bug River]] to warn the [[Red Army]] of an impending attack, they were treated like enemy agents and shot.{{sfn|Service|2005|pp=259\u2013260}} Some historians{{Who|date=June 2017}} believe that Stalin, despite providing an amicable front to Hitler, did not wish to remain allies with Germany. Rather, Stalin might have had intentions to break off from Germany and proceed with his own campaign against Germany to be followed by one against the rest of Europe.{{sfn|Weeks|2002|p=98}}\n\n===German invasion plans===\n{{See also|A-A line|Ural Mountains in Nazi planning|Lossberg study}}\n[[File:Marcks Plan for Operation Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|The [[Erich Marcks|Marcks Plan]] was the original German plan of attack for Operation Barbarossa, as depicted in a US Government study (March 1955).]]\n\nStalin's reputation as a brutal dictator contributed both to the Nazis' justification of their assault and their faith in success; many competent and experienced military officers had been killed in the [[Great Purge]] of the 1930s, leaving the Red Army with a relatively inexperienced leadership compared to that of their German adversary. The Nazis often emphasized the Soviet regime's brutality when targeting the Slavs with propaganda.{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=9\u201324}}  They also claimed that the Red Army was [[Soviet offensive plans controversy|preparing to attack the Germans]], and their own invasion was thus presented as a [[pre-emptive war|pre-emptive]] strike.{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=9\u201324}}\n\nIn the middle of 1940, following the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union seemed the only solution to Hitler.{{sfn|Ericson|1999|p=127}} While no concrete plans had yet been made, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for a showdown with Bolshevism.{{sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=129\u2013130}} With the successful end to the [[Battle of France|campaign in France]], General [[Erich Marcks]] was assigned the task of drawing up the initial invasion plans of the [[Soviet Union]]. The first battle plans were entitled ''Operation Draft East'' (colloquially known as the ''Marcks Plan'').{{sfn|Kay|2006|p=31}} His report advocated the [[A-A line]] as the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union.

The Finnish attack was launched on 10 July.

The operation put into action [[Nazi Germany]]'s  ideological goal of conquering the western Soviet Union so as to repopulate it with [[Germans]]. The German [[Generalplan Ost]] aimed to use some of the conquered as [[unfree labour|slave labour]] for the Axis war effort, to acquire the oil reserves of the [[Caucasus]] and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories, and eventually to [[War of annihilation|annihilate]] the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] and create {{lang|de|[[Lebensraum]]}} for Germany.{{sfn|Rich|1973|pp=204\u2013221}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|title=Blood lands|publisher=Basic Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0465031474|location=|pages=416}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Smelser, Ronald.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/237148298|title=The myth of the Eastern Front : the Nazi-Soviet war in American popular culture|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Nevertheless, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] began planning an invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1940 (under the codename [[Operation Otto]]), which [[Adolf Hitler]] authorized on 18 December 1940. Over the course of the operation, about three million personnel of the [[Axis powers]]\u2014the largest invasion force in the [[history of warfare]]\u2014invaded the western Soviet Union along a {{convert|2900|km|mi|sp=us|adj=on}} front, with 600,000 motor vehicles and over 600,000 horses for non-combat operations. The offensive marked an escalation of World War II, both geographically and in the formation of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied coalition]] including the Soviet Union.\n\nThe operation opened up the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], in which more forces were committed than in any other [[theater of war]] in history. The area saw some of the war's largest battles, most horrific [[war crime|atrocities]], and highest [[World War II casualties|casualties]] (for Soviet and Axis forces alike), all of which influenced the course of World War II and the subsequent [[history of the 20th century]]. The German armies eventually captured some 5,000,000 Soviet [[Red Army]] troops,{{sfn|Chapoutot|2018|p=272}} a majority of whom never returned alive. The Nazis deliberately [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|starved to death, or otherwise killed]], 3.3 million Soviet prisoners of war, and a vast number of civilians, as the \"[[Hunger Plan]]\" worked to [[Generalplan Ost|exterminate the Slavic population]].{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=175\u2013186}} [[Einsatzgruppen|Mass shootings]] and gassing operations, carried out by the Nazis or willing collaborators,{{Efn|See for instance the involvement of Latvian and Ukrainian forces in killing Jews cited by historian, Raul Hilberg.{{sfn|Hilberg|1992|pp=58\u201361, 199\u2013202}}}} murdered over a million [[Soviet Jews]] as part of [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|1996|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe failure of Operation Barbarossa reversed the fortunes of the [[Third Reich]].{{sfn|Rees|2010}} Operationally, German forces achieved significant victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the Soviet Union (mainly in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]) and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. Despite these early successes, the German offensive stalled in the [[Battle of Moscow]] at the end of 1941, and the subsequent [[Battle of Moscow#Soviet counter-offensive|Soviet winter counteroffensive]] pushed German troops back. The Germans had confidently expected a quick collapse of Soviet resistance as in [[Invasion of Poland|Poland]], but the Red Army absorbed the German [[Wehrmacht]]'s strongest blows and bogged it down in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] for which the Germans were unprepared. The Wehrmacht's diminished forces could no longer attack along the entire Eastern Front, and subsequent operations to retake the initiative and drive deep into Soviet territory\u2014such as [[Case Blue]] in 1942 and [[Operation Citadel]] in 1943\u2014eventually failed, which resulted in the Wehrmacht's retreat and collapse.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Background==\n===Racial policies of Nazi Germany===\n{{Main|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}\nAs early as 1925, [[Adolf Hitler]] vaguely declared in his political manifesto and autobiography ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' that he would invade the [[Soviet Union]], asserting that the German people needed to secure ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") to ensure the survival of Germany for generations to come.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2002|p=188}} On 10 February 1939, Hitler told his army commanders that the next war would be \"purely a war of ''[[Weltanschauung]]en'' ... totally a people's war, a [[racial war]]\". On 23 November, once World War II had already started, Hitler declared that \"racial war has broken out and this war shall determine who shall govern Europe, and with it, the world\".{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=21}} The [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] portrayed the Soviet Union (and all of Eastern Europe) as populated by non-Aryan ''[[Untermenschen]]'' (\"sub-humans\"), ruled by [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevik]] conspirators.{{sfn|Hillgruber|1972|p=140}} Hitler claimed in ''Mein Kampf'' that Germany's destiny was to \"[[Drang nach Osten|turn to the East]]\" as it did \"six hundred years ago\" (see ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'').{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=716}} Accordingly, it was stated Nazi policy to kill, deport, or enslave the majority of Russian and other Slavic populations and repopulate the land with Germanic peoples, under the [[Generalplan Ost]].{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=271}} The Nazis' belief in their ethnic superiority pervades official records and [[pseudoscientific]] articles in German periodicals, on topics such as \"how to deal with alien populations\".{{sfn|Fahlbusch|1999|pp=241\u2013264}}\n[[File:Generalplan Ost-en.svg|thumb|200px|Plan of new German settlement colonies (marked with dots and diamonds), drawn up by the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] Institute of Agriculture in Berlin, 1942]]\nWhile older histories tended to emphasize the notion of a \"[[Clean Wehrmacht]]\" upholding its honor in the face of Hitler's fanaticism, the historian [[J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster]] notes that \"In fact, the military commanders were caught up in the ideological character of the conflict, and involved in its implementation as willing participants.\"{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=21}} Before and during the invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops were heavily indoctrinated with [[anti-Bolshevik]], [[anti-Semitic]], and [[anti-Slavic]] ideology via movies, radio, lectures, books, and leaflets.{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=59}} Likening the Soviets to the forces of [[Genghis Khan]], Hitler told [[Croatia]]n military leader [[Slavko Kvaternik]] that the \"Mongolian race\" threatened Europe.{{sfn|Breitman|1990|pp=340\u2013341}} Following the invasion, Wehrmacht officers told their soldiers to target people who were described as \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\", the \"Mongol hordes\", the \"Asiatic flood\", and the \"Red beast\".{{sfn|Evans|1989|pp=59\u201360}} Nazi propaganda portrayed the war against the Soviet Union as both an ideological war between German National Socialism and Jewish Bolshevism, and a racial war between the disciplined Germans and the Jewish, Gypsy, and Slavic ''Untermenschen''.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=512}} An 'order from the F\u00fchrer' stated that the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' were to execute all Soviet functionaries who were \"less valuable Asiatics, Gypsies and Jews\".{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=100}} Six months into the invasion of the Soviet Union, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had already murdered in excess of 500,000 Soviet Jews, a figure greater than the number of Red Army soldiers killed in combat during that time.{{sfn|Lewy|2017|p=24}} German army commanders cast the Jews as the major cause behind the \"[[Partisan (military)|partisan]] struggle\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=466}} The main guideline for German troops was \"Where there's a partisan, there's a Jew, and where there's a Jew, there's a partisan\", or \"The partisan is where the Jew is\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=467}}{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=28}} Many German troops viewed the war in Nazi terms and regarded their Soviet enemies as sub-human.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|2005|p=127}}\n\nAfter the war began, the Nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign slave workers.{{sfn|Majer|2003|p=180}} There were regulations enacted against the ''[[Ost-Arbeiter]]'' (\"Eastern workers\") that included the death penalty for sexual relations with a German.{{sfn|Gellately|1990|p=224}} [[Heinrich Himmler]], in his secret memorandum, ''Reflections on the Treatment of Peoples of Alien Races in the East'' (dated 25 May 1940), outlined the Nazi plans for the non-German populations in the East.{{sfn|Himmler|1940|pp=147\u2013150}} Himmler believed the [[Germanization]] process in Eastern Europe would be complete when \"in the East dwell only men with truly German, Germanic blood\".{{sfn|Mazower|2009|p=181}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B01718, Ausstellung \"Planung und Aufbau im Osten\".jpg|thumb|left|Heinrich Himmler, [[Rudolf Hess]], and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] listening to [[Konrad Meyer]] at a ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' exhibition, 20 March 1941]]\nThe Nazi secret plan ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (\"General Plan for the East\"), prepared in 1941 and confirmed in 1942, called for a \"new order of ethnographical relations\" in the territories occupied by Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe. It envisaged [[ethnic cleansing]], executions, and enslavement of the populations of conquered countries, with very small percentages undergoing Germanization, expulsion into the depths of Russia, or other fates, while the conquered territories would be Germanized. The plan had two parts: the ''Kleine Planung'' (\"small plan\"), which covered actions to be taken during the war, and the ''Gro\u00dfe Planung'' (\"large plan\"), which covered policies after the war was won, to be implemented gradually over 25 to 30 years.{{sfn|R\u00f6ssler|Schleiermacher|1996|pp=270\u2013274}}\n\nA speech given by General [[Erich Hoepner]] demonstrates the dissemination of the Nazi racial plan, as he informed the [[4th Panzer Group]] that the war against the Soviet Union was \"an essential part of the German people's struggle for existence\" (''Daseinskampf''), also referring to the imminent battle as the \"old struggle of Germans against Slavs\" and even stated, \"the struggle must aim at the annihilation of today's Russia and must, therefore, be waged with unparalleled harshness\".{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=140}} Hoepner also added that the Germans were fighting for \"the defense of European culture against Moscovite\u2013Asiatic inundation, and the repulse of Jewish Bolshevism ... No adherents of the present Russian-Bolshevik system are to be spared.\" [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] also told his subordinates that troops should view the war as a \"struggle between two different races and [should] act with the necessary severity\".{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1988|p=23}} Racial motivations were central to Nazi ideology and played a key role in planning for Operation Barbarossa since both [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jews and communists]] were considered equivalent enemies of the Nazi state.

The grey area represents Nazi Germany, its allies, and countries under its firm control.]]\n\nIn August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact in Moscow known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. A secret protocol to the pact outlined an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union on the division of the eastern European [[Border states (Eastern Europe)|border states]] between their respective \"[[spheres of influence]]\": the Soviet Union and Germany would partition Poland in the event of an invasion by Germany, and the Soviets would be allowed to overrun the Baltic states and [[Finland]].{{sfn|Kirby|1980|p=120}} On 23 August 1939 the rest of the world learned of this pact but were unaware of the provisions to partition Poland.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1973|p=89}} The pact stunned the world because of the parties' earlier mutual hostility and their conflicting [[Ideology|ideologies]].{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=30}} The conclusion of this pact was followed by the [[German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September that triggered the outbreak of [[World War II in Europe]], then the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] that led to the annexation of the eastern part of the country.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|pp=56\u201359}} As a result of the pact, Germany and the Soviet Union maintained reasonably strong diplomatic relations for two years and fostered [[Nazi\u2013Soviet economic relations (1934\u201341)|an important economic relationship]]. The countries entered a [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|trade pact in 1940]] by which the Soviets received German military equipment and trade goods in exchange for raw materials, such as oil and wheat, to help the Nazis circumvent a British [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u201345)|blockade of Germany]].{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=668\u2013669}}\n\nDespite the parties' ostensibly cordial relations, each side was highly suspicious of the other's intentions. For instance, the Soviet invasion of [[Bukovina]] in June 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with Germany.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341}} After Germany entered the [[Tripartite Pact|Axis Pact]] with Japan and Italy, it began [[German\u2013Soviet Axis talks|negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact]].{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=57}} After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12 to 14 November 1940, Germany presented a written proposal for a Soviet entry into the Axis. On 25 November 1940, the Soviet Union offered a written counter-proposal to join the Axis if Germany would agree to refrain from interference in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, but Germany did not respond.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=57}} As both sides began colliding with each other in Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they did sign a [[German\u2013Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement|border and commercial agreement]] addressing several open issues in January 1941. According to historian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], [[Joseph Stalin]] was convinced that the overall military strength of the USSR was such that he had nothing to fear and anticipated an easy victory should Germany attack; moreover, Stalin believed that since the Germans were still fighting the British in the west, Hitler would be unlikely to open up a two front war and subsequently delayed the reconstruction of defensive fortifications in the border regions.{{sfn|Service|2005|p=259}} When German soldiers swam across the [[Bug River]] to warn the [[Red Army]] of an impending attack, they were treated like enemy agents and shot.{{sfn|Service|2005|pp=259\u2013260}} Some historians{{Who|date=June 2017}} believe that Stalin, despite providing an amicable front to Hitler, did not wish to remain allies with Germany. Rather, Stalin might have had intentions to break off from Germany and proceed with his own campaign against Germany to be followed by one against the rest of Europe.{{sfn|Weeks|2002|p=98}}\n\n===German invasion plans===\n{{See also|A-A line|Ural Mountains in Nazi planning|Lossberg study}}\n[[File:Marcks Plan for Operation Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|The [[Erich Marcks|Marcks Plan]] was the original German plan of attack for Operation Barbarossa, as depicted in a US Government study (March 1955).]]\n\nStalin's reputation as a brutal dictator contributed both to the Nazis' justification of their assault and their faith in success; many competent and experienced military officers had been killed in the [[Great Purge]] of the 1930s, leaving the Red Army with a relatively inexperienced leadership compared to that of their German adversary. The Nazis often emphasized the Soviet regime's brutality when targeting the Slavs with propaganda.{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=9\u201324}}  They also claimed that the Red Army was [[Soviet offensive plans controversy|preparing to attack the Germans]], and their own invasion was thus presented as a [[pre-emptive war|pre-emptive]] strike.{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=9\u201324}}\n\nIn the middle of 1940, following the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union seemed the only solution to Hitler.{{sfn|Ericson|1999|p=127}} While no concrete plans had yet been made, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for a showdown with Bolshevism.{{sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=129\u2013130}} With the successful end to the [[Battle of France|campaign in France]], General [[Erich Marcks]] was assigned the task of drawing up the initial invasion plans of the [[Soviet Union]]. The first battle plans were entitled ''Operation Draft East'' (colloquially known as the ''Marcks Plan'').{{sfn|Kay|2006|p=31}} His report advocated the [[A-A line]] as the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union. This assault would extend from the northern city of [[Arkhangelsk]] on the [[Arctic Sea]] through [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] and [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] to the port city of [[Astrakhan]] at the mouth of the [[Volga]] on the [[Caspian Sea]]. The report concluded that\u2014once established\u2014this military border would reduce the threat to Germany from attacks by enemy [[bombers]].{{sfn|Kay|2006|p=31}}\n\nAlthough Hitler was warned by his general staff that occupying \"[[Western Russia]]\" would create \"more of a drain than a relief for Germany's economic situation\", he anticipated compensatory benefits, such as the [[demobilization]] of entire divisions to relieve the acute [[labor shortage]] in German industry; the exploitation of [[Ukraine]] as a reliable and immense source of agricultural products; the use of [[forced labor]] to stimulate Germany's overall economy; and the expansion of territory to improve Germany's efforts to isolate the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Roberts|2011|pp=147\u2013148}} Hitler was convinced that Britain would sue for peace once the Germans triumphed in the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Hildebrand|1973|p=105}} and if they did not, he would use the resources available in the East to defeat the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Overy|1996|p=60}}\n\n{{quote box |width = 22em |quote = We only have to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.{{sfn|Hardesty|2012|p=6}}|source = \u2014Adolf Hitler}}\nOn 5 December 1940, Hitler received the final military plans for the invasion on which the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] had been working since July 1940 under the codename \"Operation Otto\". Hitler, however, was dissatisfied with these plans and on 18 December issued [[s:F\u00fchrer Directive 21|F\u00fchrer Directive 21]],{{Efn|The first sentence of Directive 21 read, \"The German Wehrmacht must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign even before the end of the war against England.\"{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|p=13}} }} which called for a new battle plan, now code-named \"Operation Barbarossa\".{{sfn|Fritz|2011|p=51}} The operation was named after medieval Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a leader of the [[Third Crusade]] in the 12th century.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=258}} \nOn 30 March 1941 the [[Barbarossa decree]] declared that the war would be one of extermination and advocated the eradication of all political and intellectual elites.{{sfn|Chickering|F\u00f6rster|Greiner|2005|pp=328\u2013330}}\nThe invasion was set for 15 May 1941, though it was delayed for over a month to allow for further preparations and possibly better weather.{{sfn|Bradley|Buell|2002|p=page 101}} (See [[#Reasons for delay|Reasons for delay]].)\n\nAccording to a 1978 essay by German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]], the invasion plans drawn up by the German military elite were coloured by hubris stemming from the rapid defeat of France at the hands of the \"invincible\" Wehrmacht and by traditional German stereotypes of Russia as a primitive, backward \"Asiatic\" country.{{Efn|It is additionally important that considerable portions of the German General Staff thought of Russia as a \"colossus of clay\" which was \"politically unstable, filled with discontented minorities, ineffectively ruled, and militarily weak.\"{{sfn|Megargee|2000|p=110}} }} Red Army soldiers were considered brave and tough, but the officer corps was held in contempt. The leadership of the Wehrmacht paid little attention to politics, culture, and the considerable industrial capacity of the Soviet Union, in favour of a very narrow military view.{{sfn|Wette|2007|pp=21\u201322}} Hillgruber argued that because these assumptions were shared by the entire military elite, Hitler was able to push through with a \"war of annihilation\" that would be waged in the most inhumane fashion possible with the complicity of \"several military leaders\", even though it was quite clear that this would be in violation of all accepted norms of warfare.{{sfn|Wette|2007|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nIn autumn 1940, high-ranking German officials drafted a memorandum on the dangers of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia, and the Baltic States would end up as only a further economic burden for Germany.{{sfn|Gorodetsky|2001|pp=69\u201370}} It was argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany.{{sfn|Gorodetsky|2001|pp=69\u201370}} Hitler disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], the chief of the Luftwaffe, that he would no longer listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with Russia.{{sfn|Ericson|1999|p=162}} It is speculated that this was passed on to General [[Georg Thomas]], who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany in the event of an invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first blow; Thomas revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes.{{sfn|Ericson|1999|p=162}} The [[Red Army]]'s ineptitude in the [[Winter War]] against Finland in 1939\u201340 convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and [[winterization]] of vehicles and lubricants, were not made.{{sfn|Palmer|2010|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nBeginning in March 1941, [[G\u00f6ring's Green Folder]] laid out details for the Soviet economy after conquest.

Field expedient general courts were established to deal with civilians spreading rumors and military deserters.{{sfn|Seaton|1972|p=111}} On 30 June, Stalin relieved Pavlov of his command, and on 22 July tried and executed him along with many members of his staff on charges of \"cowardice\" and \"criminal incompetence\".{{sfn|Glantz|2010a|pp=56\u201357}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2014|p=253}}\n\nOn 29 June, Hitler, through the Commander-in-Chief of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] Walther von Brauchitsch, instructed the commander of Army Group Center [[Fedor von Bock]] to halt the advance of his panzers until the infantry formations liquidating the pockets catch up.{{sfn|Glantz|2010a|pp=54\u201356}} But the commander of the 2nd Panzer Group [[Heinz Guderian]], with the tacit support of Fedor von Bock and the chief of OKH [[Franz Halder]], ignored the instruction and attacked on eastward towards Bobruisk, albeit reporting the advance as a [[reconnaissance-in-force]].

Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into an attack on Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched ''[[Operation Rentier]]'' and occupied the [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo Province]] at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to [[Operation Kilpapurjehdus|remilitarize the neutral \u00c5land Islands]]. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti.

The Finnish attack was launched on 10 July. The Army of Karelia held a numerical advantage versus the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army and [[23rd Army (Soviet Union)|23rd Army]], so it could advance swiftly. The important road junction at Loimola was captured on 14 July. By 16 July, the first Finnish units reached Lake Ladoga at Koirinoja, achieving the goal of splitting the Soviet forces.

With Soviet resistance breaking down, the Finns were able to encircle Viipuri by advancing to the [[Vuoksi River]]. The city itself was taken on 30 August, along with a broad advance on the rest of the Karelian Isthmus.

Hitler, having realized that Germany's oil supply was \"severely depleted\",{{sfn|Hayward|2000|p=769}} aimed to capture the [[oil field]]s of [[Baku]] in an offensive, codenamed [[Case Blue]].{{sfn|Symonds|2014|p=70}} Again, the Germans quickly overran great expanses of Soviet territory, but they failed to achieve their ultimate goals in the wake of their defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in February 1943.{{sfn|Baker|2009|pp=57\u201368}}\n\nBy 1943, Soviet armaments production was fully operational and increasingly outproducing the German war economy.{{sfn|Dunn|1995|pp=44\u201345}} The final major German offensive in the Eastern theater of the Second World War took place during July\u2014August 1943 with the launch of [[Operation Zitadelle]], an assault on the Kursk salient.{{sfn|Baudot|Bernard|Foot|Jacobsen|1989|p=483}} Approximately one million German troops confronted a Soviet force over 2.5 million strong. The Soviets prevailed. Following the defeat of Operation Zitadelle, the Soviets launched counter-offensives employing six million men along a {{convert|1500|mi|order=flip|adj=on}} front towards the Dnieper River as they drove the Germans westwards.{{sfn|Glantz|2002|pp=36\u201341}} Employing increasingly ambitious and tactically sophisticated offensives, along with making operational improvements in secrecy and deception, the Red Army was eventually able to liberate much of the area which the Germans had previously occupied by the summer of 1944.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|pp=444\u2013450, 463\u2013467}} The destruction of [[Army Group Centre]], the outcome of [[Operation Bagration]], proved to be a decisive success; additional Soviet offensives against the German Army Groups North and South in the fall of 1944 put the German war machine into retreat.{{sfn|Baker|2009|pp=87\u201397}} By January 1945, Soviet military might was aimed at the German capital of Berlin.{{sfn|Baker|2009|p=98}} The war ended with the total defeat and capitulation of Nazi Germany in May 1945.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=794\u2013812}}\n\n===War crimes===\n{{Main|Einsatzgruppen|German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|The Holocaust in Russia|War crimes of the Wehrmacht}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-026-43, Minsk, Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer vor Hinrichtung.jpg|thumb|right|[[Masha Bruskina]], a nurse with the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet resistance]], before her execution by hanging.

The first was [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]'s [[S\u00e1ndor Kocsis]] with eleven [[1954 FIFA World Cup|in 1954]]. At the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|next tournament]], France's [[Just Fontaine]] improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] scored 10 for [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]] and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in the World Cup final tournament during West Germany's win in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|1974 final]].

The lowest scoring top scorer was [[1962 FIFA World Cup|in 1962]], when six players tied at only four goals each. Across the 21 editions of the men's World Cup finals, 30 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals, and no one has achieved this feat twice. Nine of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament, while Brazil's [[Jairzinho]] became the only footballer to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of that tournament in 1970. These 30 top goalscorers played for 19 nations, the most (five) for Brazil. Another five came from other South American countries, with the remaining 20 coming from Europe.

Since then, only 22 male players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than St\u00e1bile did throughout the 1930 tournament. The first was [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]'s [[S\u00e1ndor Kocsis]] with eleven [[1954 FIFA World Cup|in 1954]]. At the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|next tournament]], France's [[Just Fontaine]] improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] scored 10 for [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]] and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in the World Cup final tournament during West Germany's win in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|1974 final]]. His record stood for more than three decades until [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]'s 15 goals between [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Germany's [[Miroslav Klose]] went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Only two other players have surpassed 10 goals in the World Cup: [[Pel\u00e9]] with 12 between 1958 and 1970 for Brazil, and [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] with 11 between [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and 1998 for Germany.\n\nOf all the players who have played in the men's World Cup finals, only six have achieved an average of two goals or more per game played: Kocsis, Fontaine, St\u00e1bile, [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s [[Oleg Salenko]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'s [[Josef H\u00fcgi]], and [[Poland national football team|Poland]]'s [[Ernst Wilimowski]] \u2014 the last of these scored four in his [[Brazil v Poland (1938 FIFA World Cup)|single World Cup game]] in 1938.<ref name=goalscorers>{{cite web|url= https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/statistics-and-records/worldcup/players/index.html |title= FIFA World Cup Players Statistics |publisher=FIFA|date=2014-07-25 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}</ref> The top 97 goalscorers have represented 28 nations, with 14 players scoring for Brazil, and another 14 for Germany or West Germany. In total, 64 footballers came from [[UEFA]] (Europe), 29 from [[CONMEBOL]] (South America), and only four from elsewhere: [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].\n\nFontaine holds the record for the most goals scored at a single men's tournament, with 13 goals in 1958. The players that came closest were Kocsis in 1954, M\u00fcller in 1970 and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]'s [[Eus\u00e9bio]] [[1966 FIFA World Cup|in 1966]], with 11, 10 and 9, respectively. The lowest scoring top scorer was [[1962 FIFA World Cup|in 1962]], when six players tied at only four goals each. Across the 21 editions of the men's World Cup finals, 30 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals, and no one has achieved this feat twice. Nine of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament, while Brazil's [[Jairzinho]] became the only footballer to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of that tournament in 1970. These 30 top goalscorers played for 19 nations, the most (five) for Brazil. Another five came from other South American countries, with the remaining 20 coming from Europe. Excluding the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 edition]], all the top tournament scorers won the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]].\n\n==Overall top male goalscorers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\u2666\n| Denotes national top scorers (or joint top scorers) at the World Cup\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |#\n| Denotes players still active at international level\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[ ]\n| Denotes tournaments where the player was part of the squad, but did not play in a match\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |( )\n| Denotes tournaments where the player played in a match, but did not score a goal\n|}\n\n[[File:Wolfgang Overath, Gerd Muller 1974.jpg|thumb|Gerd M\u00fcller ''(right)'' scored 14 goals for West Germany.|alt=Gerd M\u00fcller with a World Cup in his hand]]\n[[File:Pel\u00e9 jump 1958.jpg|thumb|Pel\u00e9 ''(right)'' scored 12 goals for Brazil.|alt=Pele jumping for the ball]]\n[[File:Thomas M\u00fcller, Germany national football team (03).jpg|thumb|Thomas M\u00fcller has scored 10 goals for Germany.|alt=Thomas M\u00fcller standing on a field]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0706-0040, Fu\u00dfball-WM, VR Polen - Brasilien 1-0.jpg|thumb|Grzegorz Lato ''(left)'' scored 10 goals for Poland.|alt=Grzegorz Lato is in the air]]\n[[File:Spain-Tahiti, Confederations Cup 2013 (18).jpg|thumb|David Villa ''(left)'' is the top World Cup goalscorer for Spain, with nine goals.|alt=David Villa walking on the field]]\n[[File:Valdomiro Vaz Franco, Roberto Rivelino, Jairzinho 1974.jpg|thumb|Jairzinho ''(upper right)'' and Roberto Rivellino ''(center)'' have scored nine and six goals, respectively, for Brazil.|alt=Four players talking to each other]]<!-- \n[[File:Johnny Rep 1974.jpg|thumb|Johnny Rep is the top World Cup goalscorer for the Netherlands, with 7 goals.]] -->\n<!-- [[File:NED-DEN Euro 2012 (10).jpg|thumb|Arjen Robben (orange, left) and Robin van Persie (orange, right) have scored 6 goals each for the Netherlands.]]\n[[File:Lothar Matth\u00e4us.jpg|thumb|Lothar Matth\u00e4us scored 6 goals in this record 25 matches at the World Cup.]]\n -->[[File:Landon Donovan corner kick.jpg|thumb|Landon Donovan is the first player from the United States to score five goals.|alt=Landon Donovan taking a corner kick]]\n<!-- [[File:Franz Beckenbauer 22-6-74.png|thumb|Franz Beckenbauer scored 5 goals for West Germany.]] -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Players with at least 5 goals at the FIFA World Cup tournaments<ref name=goalscorers/><ref name=database>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/statistics-and-records/worldcup/index.html | title=FIFA World Cup All Time Statistics \u2014 All editions | publisher=FIFA| accessdate=2015-09-14}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |Player\n! scope=\"col\" |Team\n! scope=\"col\" |Goals<br>scored\n! scope=\"col\" |Matches<br>played\n! scope=\"col\" |{{Tooltip|Goals<br>per game<br>|Total number of goals scored divided by the total number of matches played}}{{refn|group=nb|Outside this list is [[Ernst Wilimowski]] of Poland, the player with the highest goals-to-games ratio in the World Cup.
