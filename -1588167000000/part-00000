Outside, a single American soldier stood looking casually at the towers while the guards eyed him and others who were two or three hundred yards way. When the Americans opened fire, the guards in the gate tower came down, hands in the air. One held a pistol behind his back, and the first American shot him.

The area was partially enclosed by an L-shaped masonry wall about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and next to a hospital. The German POWs were watched over by a machine gun team from Company I. He left those men behind to head towards the center of the camp where there were SS who had not yet surrendered; he had only gone a short distance when he heard a soldier yell, \"They're trying to get away!\" and then machine-gun fire coming from the area he had just left.

He issued a report on June 8, 1945, called the \"Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau\" and also known as \"the I.G. Report\". In 1991, an archived copy was found in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C., and was made public.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nWhitaker reported that close to the back entrance to the camp Lt. William P. Walsh, commander of Company \"I\", 157th Infantry, shot four German soldiers in a [[box car]] who had surrendered to him. Pvt. Albert C.

At noon on Sunday the camp was quiet, and the SS guards were at their posts in the towers when the cry \"Americans!\" went up. A prisoner rushed toward the gate, and a guard shot him. Outside, a single American soldier stood looking casually at the towers while the guards eyed him and others who were two or three hundred yards way. When the Americans opened fire, the guards in the gate tower came down, hands in the air. One held a pistol behind his back, and the first American shot him.

Joseph Whitaker, the Seventh Army's Assistant Inspector General, was ordered to investigate after witnesses came forward testifying about the killings. He issued a report on June 8, 1945, called the \"Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau\" and also known as \"the I.G. Report\". In 1991, an archived copy was found in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. and was made public.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nWhitaker reported that close to the back entrance to the camp Lt. William P. Walsh, commander of Company \"I\", 157th Infantry, shot four German soldiers in a [[box car]] who had surrendered to him. Pvt. Albert C. Pruitt then climbed into the box car and performed a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' on the wounded men.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nAfter he had entered the camp, Walsh, along with Lt. Jack Bushyhead, the executive officer of Company \"I\", organized the segregation of POWs into those who were members of the Wehrmacht and those who were in the SS. The SS were marched into a separate enclosure and were shot by members of \"I\" Company with several different types of weapons.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nThe investigation resulted in the U.S. military considering [[court-martial|courts-martial]] against those involved, including the battalion commander [[Felix L.

In 1785, Fulton bought a farm at [[Hopewell Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania|Hopewell Township]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]] near [[Pittsburgh]] for \u00a380 <!-- according to {{Inflation|UK|80|1785}}, \u00a380 = \u00a39,956 in 2018 pounds --> (equivalent to ${{To USD|9956|GBR|round=yes}} in 2018),{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and moved his mother and family into it.\n\n== Work ==\n=== Career in Europe (1786\u20131806) ===\n[[File:Fulton's submarine design.jpg|alt=Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.|thumb|Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.]]\nAt the age of 23, Fulton traveled to Europe, where he would live for the next twenty years. He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>\n\nFulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham. ''The Peak Forest Canal''. {{ISBN|9780901461599}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Fulton por HOUDON, Jean-Antoine 1803.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Robert Fulton by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], 1803.]]\n\nAs early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmip\u00e8de'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Sa\u00f4ne]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.\n\nIn Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. \n\n[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]\n\nIn 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost (painter)|Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.\n\n[[File:Plaque comm\u00e9morative \u00e0 Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]\n\nIn France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.\n\nIn 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>\n\n=== Career in the United States (1806\u20131815) ===\nIn 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>\n\nFrom 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].\n\nFulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.\n\nFrom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767\u20131854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.\n\nFulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786\u20131824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]\u2013303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227\u2013228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.

He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>\n\nFulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham.

The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmip\u00e8de'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Sa\u00f4ne]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.\n\nIn Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. \n\n[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]\n\nIn 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost (painter)|Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.\n\n[[File:Plaque comm\u00e9morative \u00e0 Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]\n\nIn France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.\n\nIn 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>\n\n=== Career in the United States (1806\u20131815) ===\nIn 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>\n\nFrom 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].\n\nFulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.\n\nFrom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767\u20131854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.\n\nFulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786\u20131824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]\u2013303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227\u2013228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.

He is believed to have contracted [[pneumonia]]. When he got home, his sickness worsened. He was diagnosed with consumption and died at 49 years old. After his death, his widow remarried to Charles Augustus Dale on November 26, 1816.\n\nHe is buried in the [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] for [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church (Episcopal)]] at [[Wall Street]] in New York City, near other notable Americans such as former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Albert Gallatin]].

Since its opening in 1966, it has served as the home ballpark of the [[Los Angeles Angels]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), and was also the home stadium to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1980 to 1994. The stadium is often referred to by its unofficial nickname '''The Big A''', coined by Herald Examiner Sports Editor, Bud Furillo. It is the fourth-oldest [[List of Major League Baseball stadiums|active Major League Baseball stadium]], behind [[Fenway Park]], [[Wrigley Field]], and [[Dodger Stadium]]; it is also the second-oldest stadium in the American League.<!-- NOTE: The Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum is not tied with Angel Stadium.

Located near the eastern boundary of the parking lot is the landmark [[Big A Sign|\"Big A\" sign]] and electronic marquee, which originally served as a scoreboard support. The [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] located near the top of the {{convert|230|foot|adj=on}} tall, 210-ton sign is illuminated following games in which the Angels win (both at home and on the road), which gives rise to the fan expression, \"Light that baby Up!\"\n\n[[Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center|ARTIC (Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center)]] servicing the [[Metrolink Orange County Line]] and Amtrak [[Pacific Surfliner]], is located nearby on the other side of the [[California State Route 57|State Route 57]] and accessed through the Douglass Road gate at the northeast corner of the parking lot. The station provides convenient access to the stadium, the nearby [[Honda Center]], and [[Disneyland]] from various communities along the route, which links [[San Luis Obispo]], Los Angeles, and [[San Diego]]. The [[Anaheim Resort Transit]] stops at the center along with [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] buses.\n\nAside from professional baseball and football, Angel Stadium has hosted high school and [[college football]] games, [[National Football League]] pre-season games, the short-lived [[World Football League]], two crusades by evangelist [[Billy Graham]], nearly 20 consecutive annual crusades by evangelist [[Greg Laurie]], [[Eid el Fitr]] celebrations,<ref name = \"eid\">{{cite news |title=20,000 Muslims Gather at Eid Prayer Celebration in Anaheim|first=Greg|last=Mellen|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2017/06/25/20000-muslims-gather-at-eid-prayer-celebration-in-anaheim/|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref> and concerts, and 2 to 3 [[AMA Supercross Championship]] races a year.\n\nThe stadium also houses the studios and offices of the Angels' owned and operated flagship radio station, [[KLAA (AM)|KLAA]] (830 AM).\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:6505-AngelStadiumUnderConstruction.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Anaheim Stadium under construction, May 1965]]\nAngel Stadium has been the home of the Angels since their move from Los Angeles. On August 31, 1964, ground was broken for Anaheim Stadium and in 1966, the then-California Angels moved into their new home after having spent four seasons renting [[Dodger Stadium]] (referred to in Angels games as [[Ch\u00e1vez Ravine]] Stadium) from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]].\n\nThe stadium was built on a parcel of about {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of flat land originally used for agricultural purposes by the Allec, Russell, and Knutzen families<ref name=\"LosAngelesTimes\"/>  in the southeast portion of Anaheim.  Consistent with many major-league sports stadiums built in the 1960s, it is located in a suburban area, though one that is host to major tourist attractions.\n\nThe field dimensions (333 feet instead of 347 or 350, for example) were derived from a scientific study conducted by the Angels. Based on the air density at normal game times (1:30 pm and 8 pm), the Angels tried to formulate dimensions that were fairly balanced between pitcher, hitter and average weather conditions. The Angels tinkered with those dimensions several times, expanding or contracting parts of the outfield by a few feet here and there, to try to refine that balance. {{convert|396|ft|m|3}} is the shortest center-field in the American League, and tied for 2nd-shortest in the major leagues with [[Petco Park]] behind only [[Dodger Stadium]]'s {{convert|395|ft|m|3}}.\n\nNone of this seemed to matter to their [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]], who threw two of his record seven [[no-hitter]]s in this ballpark, and racked up 2,416 of his 5,714 career strikeouts in eight seasons with the Angels (Ryan stats from ''The Sporting News Baseball Record Book''). One of the no-hitters, on June 1, 1975, was his fourth, which tied [[Sandy Koufax]]'s career record, one Ryan would eventually surpass with seven by the end of his career in 1993.\n\n===The Rams move in===\n[[File:Anaheim Stadium 1991.jpg|thumb|left|265px|The Angels play at an enclosed Anaheim Stadium, 1991]]\nIn the late 1970s, [[Los Angeles Rams]] owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] was looking for a more modern venue than the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], and also wanted a stadium that would be small enough to keep Rams games from being blacked out on local television.  The Coliseum seated almost 100,000 people, and the Rams had trouble filling it even in their best years.  Rosenbloom brokered a deal by which the Rams would move from Los Angeles to an expanded Anaheim Stadium. To add more seats (eventually about 23,000) for football games, the mezzanine and upper decks were extended completely around the playing field, resulting in a roughly trapezoidal, completely enclosed stadium. An elevated bank of bleachers was built in right field, and temporary seats were placed underneath, to be pulled out for football games. Another bank of bleachers was built in left field. As a result, the view of the local mountains and [[Orange Freeway|State Highway 57]] was lost.\n\nAdditionally, the [[Big A sign|Big A]] scoreboard support that stood in left field, and was the inspiration for the stadium's nickname, was moved {{convert|1300|ft|m}} to its present site in the parking lot, adjoining the Orange Freeway beyond the right-field stands; its usage changed from scoreboard to electronic marquee advertising upcoming events at the stadium. A black and white scoreboard/instant replay video board was installed above the newly constructed upper deck seats in left field, but was later deemed inadequate, especially during day games (in 1988 the scoreboard was replaced by a Sony Jumbotron color video board, with black and white matrix scoreboards installed above the right field upper deck and the infield upper deck). A triangular metal spire was added to the top of the Jumbotron to evoke the original emplacement of the \"Big A\".\n\nThe changes did not sit well with Angels fans.  As originally built, no seat was further than {{convert|109|ft}} from the field.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|url=https://archive.org/details/storiedstadiumsb00curt|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Carroll & Graf|location=New York|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}</ref>  However, as was the case nearly everywhere else where the multipurpose stadium concept was tried, most of the new center field seats were too far from the action.  Also, while the expanded capacity allowed the Angels to set attendance records that still stand today, on most occasions even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the environment.\n\n[[Image:Angelstadiumrockpile.jpg|thumb|265px|The centerfield rockpile, also known as the \"California Spectacular\"]]\nThe expansion was completed in time for the 1980 NFL season, and the Rams played in Anaheim Stadium from then until their move to [[St. Louis]] after the 1994 season. The Rams would return to Los Angeles in 2016, playing their games at the Memorial Coliseum again for four seasons; the team is slated to move into [[SoFi Stadium]] in 2020.\n\nThe January 17, [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] caused the Sony Jumbotron to collapse onto the upper deck seats beneath it. No injuries were caused, as the stadium was unoccupied when the earthquake occurred in the predawn hours of a national holiday ([[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]]). The damaged section was deconstructed and rebuilt with a new scoreboard structure and Jumbotron, eliminating the A-frame spire that evoked the Big A.<ref>{{cite web|last=Busser|first=Bob|title=Anaheim Stadium part 2 \u2013 Anaheim, California|url=http://www.ballparks.phanfare.com/6635435|website=Ballparks, Arenas and Stadiums|accessdate=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082937/http://www.ballparks.phanfare.com/6635435|archive-date=May 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===The Disney era===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Biga2018.png|thumb|245px|left|The Big A in 2018]]\nIn 1996, [[The Walt Disney Company]], a minority owner of the team since its inception (the stadium is located less than 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) east of [[Disneyland]] and across from the [[Honda Center]], the home venue of the then Disney-owned [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]), gained enough support on the board to effectively take control of the team. Soon afterward, the Angels and the city of Anaheim agreed to a new deal that would keep the Angels in Anaheim until 2031, with an option to leave the facility after the 2016 season. As part of the deal, the stadium underwent an extensive renovation, returning the stadium to its original role as a baseball-only facility. Before the [[1997 in baseball|1997 baseball season]], the section behind the outfield wall was demolished. Disney briefly considered moving the Big A scoreboard to its original location, but decided against such a move, citing costs, as well as the fact that the Big A had become a Southern California landmark in its parking lot location.\n\nDespite the fact that much of the stadium was still a hard-hat zone, the demolition and construction being only half-completed, the Angels played their 1997 season in Anaheim. Fans were greeted by a restored view of the San Gabriel and Santa Ana Mountains, the Brea Hills, and the 57 freeway beyond the outfield.\n\nWork that didn't interfere with game play continued throughout the 1997 season, with major renovations resuming in the winter of 1997. These included the installation of outfield bleacher pavilions, a video display board and an out-of-town scoreboard below the right field seats. All of the multicolored seats were replaced by green seats. The exterior of the stadium was also renovated. The concrete structure and ramps were painted a combination of green and sandstone. Much of the facade of the stadium was torn down to create a more open feeling for visitors.\n\nThe most notable feature of the entire renovation, however, was a \"California Spectacular\" in which geysers erupt and a stream cascades down a mountainside ([[Pride Rock]]) covered with real trees, artificial rocks behind the left-center field fence, and new bullpens. Fireworks shoot out of the display at the start of games, after every Angel home run and after every Angel win (they had been shot off from a parking garage before then).\n\nThe field dimensions of the renovated stadium became somewhat asymmetrical, with the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} high fence in right center field (which earlier hid the football-only bleacher section) replaced by a {{convert|19|ft|m|adj=on}} high wall which contains a scoreboard displaying out-of-town scores of other games. A plaza was built around the perimeter of the stadium, and inside are statues depicting longtime Angel owner and chairman [[Gene Autry]] and Michelle Carew, daughter of former Angel [[Rod Carew]], who died of [[leukemia]] at the age of 18.\n\n[[File:Exterior of Angel Stadium, Anaheim, 2017.jpg|thumb|350px|Angel Stadium of Anaheim's exterior]]\nThe main entrance includes two giant Angels hats complete with [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]] tags on the sweatband (including one indicating the hats' [[hat size|size]]: 649\u00bd). The hats were originally blue and featured the Angels' \"winged\" logo designed by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] for the 1997 season, and were repainted red and decorated with the present-day halo insignia for the 2002 season. Also outside home plate gate is a full-sized brick infield complete with regulation pitcher's mound and lighted bases, with bricks at each player position engraved with the names of Angels players who played at that position on Opening Day of each season since the Angels began play in 1961. For a fee, the green infield bricks can be engraved with fans' names or personalized messages.  The Angels opened their \"new\" stadium on April 1, 1998, with a 4\u20131 victory over the New York Yankees.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1998&t=ANA 1998 Anaheim Angels Schedule by Baseball Almanac<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The renovated stadium has 5,075 club seats and 78 luxury suites.\n\nIn 1998, the stadium was renamed Edison International Field of Anaheim after local utility [[Edison International]] reached a deal giving it [[naming rights]] over the stadium for 20 years, and during this time, the stadium was referred to as the \"Big Ed\". However, after the 2003 season, Edison International exercised its option to exit the sponsorship deal. On December 29, 2003, the Angels announced that from then on the stadium would be known as Angel Stadium (in full, Angel Stadium of Anaheim); Disney sold the Angels around this time as well. Some locals can still be caught calling the venue by its original name, Anaheim Stadium, as well. After the name change in 2004, its original nickname, \"The Big A\", was restored again. Despite efforts to cover them up with the Angels' halo insignia, Edison's insignia can still be found on the ends of seating rows throughout the ballpark.\n\nIn 2009, [[Brookings, South Dakota]]-based [[Daktronics]] installed [[light emitting diode]] (LED) displays at the stadium. The largest video display measures {{convert|41|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|67|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide. Two smaller displays flank the large display, and a field-level display sits in the centerfield fence.<ref name=display>{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/photos/details?pn=WP-12876|title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Angel Stadium of Anaheim}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium will host baseball and softball at the [[2028 Summer Olympics]].<ref>http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part2_english.pdf</ref>\n\nDuring the 2017-2018 offseason, the Angels upgraded the existing video boards in left and right field. The new left field video board measures {{convert|5488|sqft|abbr=on}}, while the new right field board measures {{convert|9500|sqft|abbr=on}}, the fourth largest scoreboard in MLB. In addition to this, the out of town scoreboard was upgraded, new video ribbons stretch from foul pole to foul pole, and a new sound system was added. Because of the new out of town scoreboard, the Angels moved the home run line in right field down from {{convert|18|ft}} to {{convert|8|ft}}, though the right field wall remains the same height.<ref>{{cite web |title=Halos Will Have MLB's Third Largest Scoreboard|first=Maria|last=Guardado|url=https://www.mlb.com/angels/news/angel-stadium-installing-massive-scoreboard/c-263775160|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Angels to Lower HR Boundary of Right-Field Wall|first=David|last=Adler|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-lower-home-run-boundary-in-right-field/c-266776238|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=February 20, 2018|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Angels opted out of their lease in October 2018, largely to avoid a contractual provision which would have forced them to remain in the stadium until 2029.

[[Albert Pujols]] led off the batting in the bottom of the 19th inning with a walk-off homer, giving the Angels the win, 5\u20134.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/39619/rapid-reaction-angels-5-red-sox-4 |title = Rapid reaction: Angels 5, Red Sox 4 |first = Gordon |last = Edes |date = August 10, 2014 |accessdate = August 10, 2014 |publisher = [[ESPN]] }}</ref>\n\nThe stadium is currently designated to host softball and baseball events for the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] along with [[Dodger Stadium]].\n\n===Football===\n[[Eric Dickerson]] broke the NFL single-season rushing record in game 15 of the 1984 season, finishing with 2,007 yards.<ref>https://www.profootballhof.com/players/eric-dickerson/</ref> (He would go on accumulate 2,105 yards that season.)\n\nIn December 2017, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] used Angel Stadium as their practice field, as part of the Eagles\u2019 two game west coast road trip.\n\n===Soccer===\nAnaheim Stadium hosted five group stage matches of the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], including two involving the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]].<ref>http://www.rsssf.com/tables/96gc-full.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; width:95%;\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Date\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Winning Team\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Result\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Losing Team\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Tournament\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Spectators\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|January 10, 1996||'''{{fb|CAN}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20131||{{fb|HON}}||style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=5|[[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] First Round||style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|27,125\n|-\n|'''{{fb|SLV}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20132||{{fb|TRI}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|January 13, 1996||'''{{fb|USA}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20132||{{fb|TRI}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|12,425\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|January 16, 1996||'''{{fb|GUA}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20130||{{nobreak|{{fb|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}}}||style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|52,345\n|-\n|'''{{fb|USA}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20130||{{fb|SLV}}\n|}\n\n===Concerts===\nAngel Stadium has played host to major recording acts in concert such as  [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], [[The Osmonds]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]],<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Jackson Browne]],<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Linda Ronstadt]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Toots and the Maytals]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last=Eliot|first=Marc|title=To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC&q=1975+rolling+stone+cover+anaheim#v=snippet&q=1975%20rolling%20stone%20cover%20anaheim&f=false&nbsp;|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The final sequence of ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]'' (1988) features an electronically manipulated [[Reggie Jackson]] trying to shoot [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Exteriors were shot at the ballpark, but most baseball scenes were shot at [[Dodger Stadium]]. The 1988 sci-fi comedy ''[[My Stepmother Is an Alien]]'' features a scene shot in Angel Stadium of [[Kim Basinger]] speaking to an extraterrestrial counsel. The 1990 comedy ''[[Taking Care of Business (film)|Taking Care of Business]]'' featured a World Series matchup between the Angels and the [[Chicago Cubs]], with the baseball scenes in the movie having been filmed in the stadium.  The Disney remake of ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1994 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'' (1994) prominently uses the ballpark; however, many of the interior shots were filmed at the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]]. The stadium served as a stand-in for [[Candlestick Park]] in filming of ''[[The Fan (1996 film)|The Fan]]'' (1996). Scenes from ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'' and ''[[Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch]]'' were also filmed here.\n\n===Other events===\nOn November 16, 1979, Anaheim Stadium hosted [[Motorcycle speedway]] when it was the venue for the American Final, a qualifying round for the [[1980 Individual Speedway World Championship|1980]] [[Speedway World Championship]]. Future dual World Champion [[Bruce Penhall]] won the Final from [[Scott Autrey]] and [[Dennis Sigalos]]. Penhall and Autrey qualified to the [[Intercontinental Final]] in England held over 6 months later. Penhall qualified through to his first World Final held at the [[Ullevi|Ullevi Stadium]] in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden where he finished in 5th place.\n\nAnaheim Stadium has hosted an [[AMA Supercross Championship]] round from 1976 to 1979, 1981 to 1987, 1989 to 1996, and 1999 to the present.<ref>[http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf 2015 AMA Supercross Media Guide]</ref>\n\nAngel Stadium has been the site of annual Christian [[Harvest Crusade]]s since 1990.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Q & A with Harvest Crusade Founder Greg Laurie, Who Says Happiness Is Accessible to All|first=Alejandra|last=Molina|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/26/a-q-a-with-harvest-crusade-founder-greg-laurie-who-says-happiness-is-accessible-to-all/|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=August 26, 2015|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref> It has also hosted Muslim [[Eid el Fitr]] celebrations.<ref name = \"eid\" /> In 2014, [[Barack Obama]] [[commencement speech|spoke at the commencement ceremony]] for the [[University of California, Irvine]], which was held at the stadium to accommodate capacity and security concerns.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Baseball|American football|Greater Los Angeles}}\n{{Commons category|Angel Stadium of Anaheim}}\n* {{Official website|http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/ana/ballpark/}}\n*[http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/al/AngelStadium.htm Angel Stadium at ballparksofbaseball.com]\n*[http://ballparkdigest.com/200811281006/major-league-baseball/visits/angel-stadium-los-angeles-angels-of-anaheim Ballpark Digest Visit to Angel Stadium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010195247/http://www.sports-venue.info/MLB/LAA_Angel_Stadium.html Angel Stadium's Major Renovations]\n*[http://anaheim.angels.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/ana/ballpark/ana_ballpark_history.jsp MLB's Ballpark History]\n*[http://seatingchartview.com/angel-stadium-anaheim/ Angel Stadium Seating Chart]\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{S-start-collapsible|header={{S-sta|et}}}}\n{{Succession box\n | title = Home of the<br />[[Los Angeles Angels]]\n | years = 1966\u2013present\n | before = [[Dodger Stadium|Ch\u00e1vez Ravine Stadium]]\n | after = Current\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title = Home of the<br />[[Los Angeles Rams]]\n | years = 1980\u20131994\n | before = [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]\n | after = [[Busch Memorial Stadium]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title = Host of the<br />[[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]\n | years = [[1967 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1967]]<br />[[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1989]]<br />[[2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2010]]\n | before = <br />[[Busch Memorial Stadium]]<br />[[Riverfront Stadium]]<br />[[Busch Stadium]]\n | after = <br />[[Astrodome]]<br />[[Wrigley Field]]<br />[[Chase Field]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{MLB Ballparks}}\n{{Defunct NFL stadiums}}\n{{Anaheim}}\n{{Los Angeles Angels|state=collapsed}}\n{{Los Angeles Rams}}\n{{California Surf}}\n{{Cal State Fullerton Titans football navbox}}\n{{Long Beach State 49ers football navbox}}\n{{2006 World Baseball Classic Stadiums}}\n{{Orange County Sports}}\n{{AMA Supercross venues}}\n{{Olympic venues discontinued events}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1966]]\n[[Category:American football venues in California]]\n[[Category:Anaheim Angels stadiums]]\n[[Category:Baseball venues in California]]\n[[Category:Cal State Fullerton Titans football]]\n[[Category:California Angels stadiums]]\n[[Category:California Surf sports facilities|a]]\n[[Category:CONCACAF Gold Cup stadiums]]\n[[Category:Defunct college football venues]]\n[[Category:Defunct National Football League venues]]\n[[Category:Defunct soccer venues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Long Beach State 49ers football]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Angels stadiums]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim stadiums]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Rams stadiums]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball venues]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in California]]\n[[Category:National Football League venues in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984) stadiums]]\n[[Category:Rugby union stadiums in California]]\n[[Category:Soccer venues in California]]\n[[Category:Softball venues in California]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Anaheim, California]]\n[[Category:Venues of the 2028 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Venues of defunct NCAA bowl games]]\n[[Category:World Baseball Classic venues]]\n[[Category:World Football League venues]]\n[[Category:Olympic baseball venues]]\n[[Category:Olympic softball venues]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Del E.

It is the fourth-oldest [[List of Major League Baseball stadiums|active Major League Baseball stadium]], behind [[Fenway Park]], [[Wrigley Field]], and [[Dodger Stadium]]; it is also the second-oldest stadium in the American League.<!-- NOTE: The Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum is not tied with Angel Stadium. Angel Stadium opened on April 19, 1966 while the Oakland Coliseum opened on September 18, 1966 for the Raiders. The Oakland Coliseum would not host baseball until the A's move in 1968. --><ref>{{cite news |last=Shaikin|first=Bill|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-angels-anaheim-los-angeles-arte-moreno-20130830,0,2484255.story#axzz2dVnAJFRO|title='Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim' could be no more|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref> It hosted the [[1967 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1967]], [[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1989]], and [[2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]s.<ref name=\"losangeles.angels.mlb.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080523&content_id=2753329&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=MLB.com |access-date=May 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525211302/http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080523&content_id=2753329&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |archive-date=May 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAngel Stadium and its surrounding parking lot are roughly bounded by Katella Avenue to the north, the [[Orange Freeway]] to the east, Orangewood Avenue to the south, and State College Boulevard to the west. Located near the eastern boundary of the parking lot is the landmark [[Big A Sign|\"Big A\" sign]] and electronic marquee, which originally served as a scoreboard support. The [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] located near the top of the {{convert|230|foot|adj=on}} tall, 210-ton sign is illuminated following games in which the Angels win (both at home and on the road), which gives rise to the fan expression, \"Light that baby Up!\"\n\n[[Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center|ARTIC (Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center)]] servicing the [[Metrolink Orange County Line]] and Amtrak [[Pacific Surfliner]], is located nearby on the other side of the [[California State Route 57|State Route 57]] and accessed through the Douglass Road gate at the northeast corner of the parking lot. The station provides convenient access to the stadium, the nearby [[Honda Center]], and [[Disneyland]] from various communities along the route, which links [[San Luis Obispo]], Los Angeles, and [[San Diego]]. The [[Anaheim Resort Transit]] stops at the center along with [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] buses.\n\nAside from professional baseball and football, Angel Stadium has hosted high school and [[college football]] games, [[National Football League]] pre-season games, the short-lived [[World Football League]], two crusades by evangelist [[Billy Graham]], nearly 20 consecutive annual crusades by evangelist [[Greg Laurie]], [[Eid el Fitr]] celebrations,<ref name = \"eid\">{{cite news |title=20,000 Muslims Gather at Eid Prayer Celebration in Anaheim|first=Greg|last=Mellen|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2017/06/25/20000-muslims-gather-at-eid-prayer-celebration-in-anaheim/|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref> and concerts, and 2 to 3 [[AMA Supercross Championship]] races a year.\n\nThe stadium also houses the studios and offices of the Angels' owned and operated flagship radio station, [[KLAA (AM)|KLAA]] (830 AM).\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:6505-AngelStadiumUnderConstruction.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Anaheim Stadium under construction, May 1965]]\nAngel Stadium has been the home of the Angels since their move from Los Angeles. On August 31, 1964, ground was broken for Anaheim Stadium and in 1966, the then-California Angels moved into their new home after having spent four seasons renting [[Dodger Stadium]] (referred to in Angels games as [[Ch\u00e1vez Ravine]] Stadium) from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]].\n\nThe stadium was built on a parcel of about {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of flat land originally used for agricultural purposes by the Allec, Russell, and Knutzen families<ref name=\"LosAngelesTimes\"/>  in the southeast portion of Anaheim.  Consistent with many major-league sports stadiums built in the 1960s, it is located in a suburban area, though one that is host to major tourist attractions.\n\nThe field dimensions (333 feet instead of 347 or 350, for example) were derived from a scientific study conducted by the Angels. Based on the air density at normal game times (1:30 pm and 8 pm), the Angels tried to formulate dimensions that were fairly balanced between pitcher, hitter and average weather conditions. The Angels tinkered with those dimensions several times, expanding or contracting parts of the outfield by a few feet here and there, to try to refine that balance. {{convert|396|ft|m|3}} is the shortest center-field in the American League, and tied for 2nd-shortest in the major leagues with [[Petco Park]] behind only [[Dodger Stadium]]'s {{convert|395|ft|m|3}}.\n\nNone of this seemed to matter to their [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]], who threw two of his record seven [[no-hitter]]s in this ballpark, and racked up 2,416 of his 5,714 career strikeouts in eight seasons with the Angels (Ryan stats from ''The Sporting News Baseball Record Book''). One of the no-hitters, on June 1, 1975, was his fourth, which tied [[Sandy Koufax]]'s career record, one Ryan would eventually surpass with seven by the end of his career in 1993.\n\n===The Rams move in===\n[[File:Anaheim Stadium 1991.jpg|thumb|left|265px|The Angels play at an enclosed Anaheim Stadium, 1991]]\nIn the late 1970s, [[Los Angeles Rams]] owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] was looking for a more modern venue than the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], and also wanted a stadium that would be small enough to keep Rams games from being blacked out on local television.  The Coliseum seated almost 100,000 people, and the Rams had trouble filling it even in their best years.  Rosenbloom brokered a deal by which the Rams would move from Los Angeles to an expanded Anaheim Stadium. To add more seats (eventually about 23,000) for football games, the mezzanine and upper decks were extended completely around the playing field, resulting in a roughly trapezoidal, completely enclosed stadium. An elevated bank of bleachers was built in right field, and temporary seats were placed underneath, to be pulled out for football games. Another bank of bleachers was built in left field. As a result, the view of the local mountains and [[Orange Freeway|State Highway 57]] was lost.\n\nAdditionally, the [[Big A sign|Big A]] scoreboard support that stood in left field, and was the inspiration for the stadium's nickname, was moved {{convert|1300|ft|m}} to its present site in the parking lot, adjoining the Orange Freeway beyond the right-field stands; its usage changed from scoreboard to electronic marquee advertising upcoming events at the stadium. A black and white scoreboard/instant replay video board was installed above the newly constructed upper deck seats in left field, but was later deemed inadequate, especially during day games (in 1988 the scoreboard was replaced by a Sony Jumbotron color video board, with black and white matrix scoreboards installed above the right field upper deck and the infield upper deck). A triangular metal spire was added to the top of the Jumbotron to evoke the original emplacement of the \"Big A\".\n\nThe changes did not sit well with Angels fans.  As originally built, no seat was further than {{convert|109|ft}} from the field.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|url=https://archive.org/details/storiedstadiumsb00curt|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Carroll & Graf|location=New York|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}</ref>  However, as was the case nearly everywhere else where the multipurpose stadium concept was tried, most of the new center field seats were too far from the action.  Also, while the expanded capacity allowed the Angels to set attendance records that still stand today, on most occasions even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the environment.\n\n[[Image:Angelstadiumrockpile.jpg|thumb|265px|The centerfield rockpile, also known as the \"California Spectacular\"]]\nThe expansion was completed in time for the 1980 NFL season, and the Rams played in Anaheim Stadium from then until their move to [[St. Louis]] after the 1994 season. The Rams would return to Los Angeles in 2016, playing their games at the Memorial Coliseum again for four seasons; the team is slated to move into [[SoFi Stadium]] in 2020.\n\nThe January 17, [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] caused the Sony Jumbotron to collapse onto the upper deck seats beneath it. No injuries were caused, as the stadium was unoccupied when the earthquake occurred in the predawn hours of a national holiday ([[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]]). The damaged section was deconstructed and rebuilt with a new scoreboard structure and Jumbotron, eliminating the A-frame spire that evoked the Big A.<ref>{{cite web|last=Busser|first=Bob|title=Anaheim Stadium part 2 \u2013 Anaheim, California|url=http://www.ballparks.phanfare.com/6635435|website=Ballparks, Arenas and Stadiums|accessdate=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082937/http://www.ballparks.phanfare.com/6635435|archive-date=May 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===The Disney era===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Biga2018.png|thumb|245px|left|The Big A in 2018]]\nIn 1996, [[The Walt Disney Company]], a minority owner of the team since its inception (the stadium is located less than 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) east of [[Disneyland]] and across from the [[Honda Center]], the home venue of the then Disney-owned [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]), gained enough support on the board to effectively take control of the team. Soon afterward, the Angels and the city of Anaheim agreed to a new deal that would keep the Angels in Anaheim until 2031, with an option to leave the facility after the 2016 season. As part of the deal, the stadium underwent an extensive renovation, returning the stadium to its original role as a baseball-only facility. Before the [[1997 in baseball|1997 baseball season]], the section behind the outfield wall was demolished. Disney briefly considered moving the Big A scoreboard to its original location, but decided against such a move, citing costs, as well as the fact that the Big A had become a Southern California landmark in its parking lot location.\n\nDespite the fact that much of the stadium was still a hard-hat zone, the demolition and construction being only half-completed, the Angels played their 1997 season in Anaheim. Fans were greeted by a restored view of the San Gabriel and Santa Ana Mountains, the Brea Hills, and the 57 freeway beyond the outfield.\n\nWork that didn't interfere with game play continued throughout the 1997 season, with major renovations resuming in the winter of 1997. These included the installation of outfield bleacher pavilions, a video display board and an out-of-town scoreboard below the right field seats. All of the multicolored seats were replaced by green seats. The exterior of the stadium was also renovated. The concrete structure and ramps were painted a combination of green and sandstone. Much of the facade of the stadium was torn down to create a more open feeling for visitors.\n\nThe most notable feature of the entire renovation, however, was a \"California Spectacular\" in which geysers erupt and a stream cascades down a mountainside ([[Pride Rock]]) covered with real trees, artificial rocks behind the left-center field fence, and new bullpens. Fireworks shoot out of the display at the start of games, after every Angel home run and after every Angel win (they had been shot off from a parking garage before then).\n\nThe field dimensions of the renovated stadium became somewhat asymmetrical, with the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} high fence in right center field (which earlier hid the football-only bleacher section) replaced by a {{convert|19|ft|m|adj=on}} high wall which contains a scoreboard displaying out-of-town scores of other games. A plaza was built around the perimeter of the stadium, and inside are statues depicting longtime Angel owner and chairman [[Gene Autry]] and Michelle Carew, daughter of former Angel [[Rod Carew]], who died of [[leukemia]] at the age of 18.\n\n[[File:Exterior of Angel Stadium, Anaheim, 2017.jpg|thumb|350px|Angel Stadium of Anaheim's exterior]]\nThe main entrance includes two giant Angels hats complete with [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]] tags on the sweatband (including one indicating the hats' [[hat size|size]]: 649\u00bd). The hats were originally blue and featured the Angels' \"winged\" logo designed by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] for the 1997 season, and were repainted red and decorated with the present-day halo insignia for the 2002 season. Also outside home plate gate is a full-sized brick infield complete with regulation pitcher's mound and lighted bases, with bricks at each player position engraved with the names of Angels players who played at that position on Opening Day of each season since the Angels began play in 1961. For a fee, the green infield bricks can be engraved with fans' names or personalized messages.  The Angels opened their \"new\" stadium on April 1, 1998, with a 4\u20131 victory over the New York Yankees.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1998&t=ANA 1998 Anaheim Angels Schedule by Baseball Almanac<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The renovated stadium has 5,075 club seats and 78 luxury suites.\n\nIn 1998, the stadium was renamed '''Edison International Field of Anaheim''' after local utility [[Edison International]] reached a deal giving it [[naming rights]] over the stadium for 20 years, and during this time, the stadium was referred to as the ''Big Ed''. However, after the 2003 season, Edison International exercised its option to exit the sponsorship deal. On December 29, 2003, the Angels announced that from then on the stadium would be known as Angel Stadium (in full, '''Angel Stadium of Anaheim'''); Disney sold the Angels around this time as well. Some locals can still be caught calling the venue by its original name, ''Anaheim Stadium'', as well. After the name change in 2004, its original nickname, ''The Big A'', was restored again. Despite efforts to cover them up with the Angels' halo insignia, Edison's insignia can still be found on the ends of seating rows throughout the ballpark.\n\nIn 2009, [[Brookings, South Dakota]]-based [[Daktronics]] installed [[light emitting diode]] (LED) displays at the stadium. The largest video display measures {{convert|41|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|67|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide. Two smaller displays flank the large display, and a field-level display sits in the centerfield fence.<ref name=display>{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/photos/details?pn=WP-12876|title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Angel Stadium of Anaheim}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium will host baseball and softball at the [[2028 Summer Olympics]].<ref>http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part2_english.pdf</ref>\n\nDuring the 2017-2018 offseason, the Angels upgraded the existing video boards in left and right field. The new left field video board measures {{convert|5488|sqft|abbr=on}}, while the new right field board measures {{convert|9500|sqft|abbr=on}}, the fourth largest scoreboard in MLB. In addition to this, the out of town scoreboard was upgraded, new video ribbons stretch from foul pole to foul pole, and a new sound system was added. Because of the new out of town scoreboard, the Angels moved the home run line in right field down from {{convert|18|ft}} to {{convert|8|ft}}, though the right field wall remains the same height.<ref>{{cite web |title=Halos Will Have MLB's Third Largest Scoreboard|first=Maria|last=Guardado|url=https://www.mlb.com/angels/news/angel-stadium-installing-massive-scoreboard/c-263775160|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Angels to Lower HR Boundary of Right-Field Wall|first=David|last=Adler|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-lower-home-run-boundary-in-right-field/c-266776238|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=February 20, 2018|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Angels opted out of their lease in October 2018, largely to avoid a contractual provision which would have forced them to remain in the stadium until 2029.

[[Albert Pujols]] led off the batting in the bottom of the 19th inning with a walk-off homer, giving the Angels the win, 5\u20134.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/39619/rapid-reaction-angels-5-red-sox-4 |title = Rapid reaction: Angels 5, Red Sox 4 |first = Gordon |last = Edes |date = August 10, 2014 |accessdate = August 10, 2014 |publisher = [[ESPN]] }}</ref>\n\nThe stadium is currently designated to host softball and baseball events for the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] along with [[Dodger Stadium]].\n\n===Football===\n[[Eric Dickerson]] broke the NFL single-season rushing record in game 15 of the 1984 season, finishing with 2,007 yards.<ref>https://www.profootballhof.com/players/eric-dickerson/</ref> (He would go on accumulate 2,105 yards that season.)\n\nIn December 2017, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] used Angel Stadium as their practice field, as part of the Eagles\u2019 two game west coast road trip.\n\n===Soccer===\nAnaheim Stadium hosted five group stage matches of the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], including two involving the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]].<ref>http://www.rsssf.com/tables/96gc-full.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; width:95%;\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Date\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Winning Team\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Result\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Losing Team\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Tournament\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Los Angeles Angels|border=2}};\"|Spectators\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|January 10, 1996||'''{{fb|CAN}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20131||{{fb|HON}}||style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=5|[[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] First Round||style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|27,125\n|-\n|'''{{fb|SLV}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20132||{{fb|TRI}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|January 13, 1996||'''{{fb|USA}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20132||{{fb|TRI}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|12,425\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|January 16, 1996||'''{{fb|GUA}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20130||{{nobreak|{{fb|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}}}||style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|52,345\n|-\n|'''{{fb|USA}}'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20130||{{fb|SLV}}\n|}\n\n===Concerts===\nAngel Stadium has played host to major recording acts in concert such as  [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], [[The Osmonds]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]],<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Jackson Browne]],<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Linda Ronstadt]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Toots and the Maytals]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last=Eliot|first=Marc|title=To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC&q=1975+rolling+stone+cover+anaheim#v=snippet&q=1975%20rolling%20stone%20cover%20anaheim&f=false&nbsp;|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The final sequence of ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]'' (1988) features an electronically manipulated [[Reggie Jackson]] trying to shoot [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Exteriors were shot at the ballpark, but most baseball scenes were shot at [[Dodger Stadium]]. The 1988 sci-fi comedy ''[[My Stepmother Is an Alien]]'' features a scene shot in Angel Stadium of [[Kim Basinger]] speaking to an extraterrestrial counsel. The 1990 comedy ''[[Taking Care of Business (film)|Taking Care of Business]]'' featured a World Series matchup between the Angels and the [[Chicago Cubs]], with the baseball scenes in the movie having been filmed in the stadium.  The Disney remake of ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1994 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'' (1994) prominently uses the ballpark; however, many of the interior shots were filmed at the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]]. The stadium served as a stand-in for [[Candlestick Park]] in filming of ''[[The Fan (1996 film)|The Fan]]'' (1996). Scenes from ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'' and ''[[Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch]]'' were also filmed here.\n\n===Other events===\nOn November 16, 1979, Anaheim Stadium hosted [[Motorcycle speedway]] when it was the venue for the American Final, a qualifying round for the [[1980 Individual Speedway World Championship|1980]] [[Speedway World Championship]]. Future dual World Champion [[Bruce Penhall]] won the Final from [[Scott Autrey]] and [[Dennis Sigalos]]. Penhall and Autrey qualified to the [[Intercontinental Final]] in England held over 6 months later. Penhall qualified through to his first World Final held at the [[Ullevi|Ullevi Stadium]] in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden where he finished in 5th place.\n\nAnaheim Stadium has hosted an [[AMA Supercross Championship]] round from 1976 to 1979, 1981 to 1987, 1989 to 1996, and 1999 to the present.<ref>[http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf 2015 AMA Supercross Media Guide]</ref>\n\nAngel Stadium has been the site of annual Christian [[Harvest Crusade]]s since 1990.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Q & A with Harvest Crusade Founder Greg Laurie, Who Says Happiness Is Accessible to All|first=Alejandra|last=Molina|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/26/a-q-a-with-harvest-crusade-founder-greg-laurie-who-says-happiness-is-accessible-to-all/|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=August 26, 2015|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref> It has also hosted Muslim [[Eid el Fitr]] celebrations.<ref name = \"eid\" /> In 2014, [[Barack Obama]] [[commencement speech|spoke at the commencement ceremony]] for the [[University of California, Irvine]], which was held at the stadium to accommodate capacity and security concerns.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Baseball|American football|Greater Los Angeles}}\n{{Commons category|Angel Stadium of Anaheim}}\n* {{Official website|http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/ana/ballpark/}}\n*[http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/al/AngelStadium.htm Angel Stadium at ballparksofbaseball.com]\n*[http://ballparkdigest.com/200811281006/major-league-baseball/visits/angel-stadium-los-angeles-angels-of-anaheim Ballpark Digest Visit to Angel Stadium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010195247/http://www.sports-venue.info/MLB/LAA_Angel_Stadium.html Angel Stadium's Major Renovations]\n*[http://anaheim.angels.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/ana/ballpark/ana_ballpark_history.jsp MLB's Ballpark History]\n*[http://seatingchartview.com/angel-stadium-anaheim/ Angel Stadium Seating Chart]\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{S-start-collapsible|header={{S-sta|et}}}}\n{{Succession box\n | title = Home of the<br />[[Los Angeles Angels]]\n | years = 1966\u2013present\n | before = [[Dodger Stadium|Ch\u00e1vez Ravine Stadium]]\n | after = Current\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title = Home of the<br />[[Los Angeles Rams]]\n | years = 1980\u20131994\n | before = [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]\n | after = [[Busch Memorial Stadium]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title = Host of the<br />[[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]\n | years = [[1967 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1967]]<br />[[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1989]]<br />[[2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2010]]\n | before = <br />[[Busch Memorial Stadium]]<br />[[Riverfront Stadium]]<br />[[Busch Stadium]]\n | after = <br />[[Astrodome]]<br />[[Wrigley Field]]<br />[[Chase Field]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{MLB Ballparks}}\n{{Defunct NFL stadiums}}\n{{Anaheim}}\n{{Los Angeles Angels|state=collapsed}}\n{{Los Angeles Rams}}\n{{California Surf}}\n{{Cal State Fullerton Titans football navbox}}\n{{Long Beach State 49ers football navbox}}\n{{2006 World Baseball Classic Stadiums}}\n{{Orange County Sports}}\n{{AMA Supercross venues}}\n{{Olympic venues discontinued events}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1966]]\n[[Category:American football venues in California]]\n[[Category:Anaheim Angels stadiums]]\n[[Category:Baseball venues in California]]\n[[Category:Cal State Fullerton Titans football]]\n[[Category:California Angels stadiums]]\n[[Category:California Surf sports facilities|a]]\n[[Category:CONCACAF Gold Cup stadiums]]\n[[Category:Defunct college football venues]]\n[[Category:Defunct National Football League venues]]\n[[Category:Defunct soccer venues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Long Beach State 49ers football]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Angels stadiums]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim stadiums]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Rams stadiums]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball venues]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in California]]\n[[Category:National Football League venues in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984) stadiums]]\n[[Category:Rugby union stadiums in California]]\n[[Category:Soccer venues in California]]\n[[Category:Softball venues in California]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Anaheim, California]]\n[[Category:Venues of the 2028 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Venues of defunct NCAA bowl games]]\n[[Category:World Baseball Classic venues]]\n[[Category:World Football League venues]]\n[[Category:Olympic baseball venues]]\n[[Category:Olympic softball venues]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Del E.

Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

In the year 980 it was sacked and razed to the ground.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p6</ref> It was once believed that a castle existed in Montrose in the 10th century and was destroyed by [[Kenneth III]]. However the historicity of this account has been disputed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Andrew Jervise, \"Memorials of Angus and the Mearns\"</ref>\n\nIn the two proceeding centuries there are no precise dates in its history. During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside. The ruins have acquired the name [[Red Castle, Angus|Red Castle]]. The last record of a charter there was in 1198.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\">Mitchell (1866), p8</ref> A [[convent]] dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] is said to have been founded in 1230 by [[Alan Durward]] but the precise location is unknown.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1244 the town succumbed to fire.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\nIn July 1296<ref>[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm Angus Council, \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> during the Wars of Independence, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] visited the town with 30,000 of his men and stayed at Munros castle for three nights. Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial.
