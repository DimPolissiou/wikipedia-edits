Premiering in Paris in 1980, it has music by [[Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg]], original French lyrics by [[Alain Boublil]] and Jean-Marc Natel, with an English-language [[libretto]] by [[Herbert Kretzmer]]. The London production has run continuously since October 1985 &ndash; the longest-running musical in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and the [[The Fantasticks|second longest-running]] musical in the world.\n\n==Performance==\nThere have been several recordings of this material, including ones by the original London cast and original Broadway cast. However, no recording contains the entire performance of songs, score and spoken parts as featured on stage; ''The Complete Symphonic Recording'' comes closest, but a pair of songs that were cut from the show following the initial London run, as well as one song only present in the Original French Concept Album, are not included.\n\n===Characters===\nThe characters who sing solos or duets are:\n\n* [[Jean Valjean]], a morally conflicted paroled convict, prisoner 24601, and the protagonist. Failing to find work with his yellow parole note and redeemed by the Bishop of Digne's mercy, he tears his passport up and conceals his identity (under the alias \"Monsieur Madeleine\" and later \"Monsieur Fauchelevent\") in order to live his life again as an honest man. However, Javert constantly pursues him\n* [[Fantine]], a struggling single mother who becomes a street prostitute in order to pay for her child's well-being\n* [[Javert]], a willful police inspector, originally a prison-guard, who becomes obsessed with hunting down Valjean to whom he refers as \"Prisoner 24601\"\n* [[\u00c9ponine]], the young daughter of the sinister Th\u00e9nardiers who was pampered and spoiled as a child but grows up to be ragged in Paris. She secretly loves Marius\n* [[Cosette]], Fantine's daughter, who is abused and mistreated by the Th\u00e9nardiers but whom Valjean later adopts&nbsp;\u2013 she soon grows into a beautiful young woman\n* [[Marius Pontmercy]], a French student and revolutionary who falls in love with Cosette\n* [[Th\u00e9nardiers|Monsieur and Madame Th\u00e9nardier]], a crooked couple who own an inn and exploit their customers. They later become a feared band of thieves in the streets of Paris\n* [[Enjolras]], leader of the student revolutionaries who seek to bring revolution and change to France\n* [[Gavroche]], a hotheaded young boy who is adored by the people and aligns himself with their revolution&nbsp;\u2013 he is a true symbol of the youth and boldness of the rebellion\n* [[Grantaire]], a revolutionary who doesn't believe in the causes of the revolution.  He reveres Enjolras, and is often drunk\n\n===Songs===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Act I'''\n* Overture&nbsp;\u2013 [[Instrumental]] (Orchestra)\n* Prologue: Work Song (\"Look Down\")&nbsp;\u2013 Chain Gang, Javert and Valjean\n* Prologue: On Parole&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean, Farmer, Labourer, Innkeeper's Wife and Innkeeper\n* Prologue: (The Bishop) Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven&nbsp;\u2013 Constables and Bishop\n* Prologue: What Have I Done?&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean\n* At the End of the Day&nbsp;\u2013 Fantine, The Poor, Foreman, Workers, Factory Girls and Valjean\n* I Dreamed a Dream&nbsp;\u2013 Fantine\n* Lovely Ladies&nbsp;\u2013 Fantine, Sailors, Whores, Old Woman, Crone and Pimp\n* Fantine's Arrest&nbsp;\u2013 Fantine, Bamatabois, Javert and Valjean\n* The Runaway Cart&nbsp;\u2013 Onlookers, Valjean, Fauchelevent and Javert\n* Who Am I?&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean\n* Fantine's Death&nbsp;\u2013 Fantine and Valjean\n* The Confrontation&nbsp;\u2013 Javert and Valjean\n* Castle on a Cloud&nbsp;\u2013 Young Cosette and Madame Th\u00e9nardier\n* Master of the House&nbsp;\u2013 Th\u00e9nardier, Madame Th\u00e9nardier and Chorus\n* The Well Scene&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean and Young Cosette\n* The Bargain / The Th\u00e9nardier Waltz of Treachery&nbsp;\u2013 Th\u00e9nardier, Valjean, Madame Th\u00e9nardier and Young Cosette\n* Suddenly&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean ([[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|2012 film]] only)\n* The Convent ([[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|2012 film]] only)\n* Stars&nbsp;\u2013 Javert \n* Look Down&nbsp;\u2013 Beggars, Gavroche, Old Woman, Prostitute, Pimp, Enjolras and Marius\n* The Robbery / Javert's Intervention&nbsp;\u2013 Th\u00e9nardier, Madame Th\u00e9nardier, \u00c9ponine, Marius, Valjean and Javert\n* \u00c9ponine's Errand&nbsp;\u2013 Marius and \u00c9ponine\n* The ABC Caf\u00e9 / Red and Black&nbsp;\u2013 Students, Enjolras, Marius, Grantaire and Gavroche\n* Do You Hear the People Sing?&nbsp;\u2013 Enjolras, Grantaire, Students and Beggars\n* In My Life&nbsp;\u2013 Cosette, Valjean, Marius and \u00c9ponine\n* A Heart Full of Love&nbsp;\u2013 Marius, Cosette and \u00c9ponine\n* The Attack on Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 Th\u00e9nardier, Thieves, \u00c9ponine, Marius, Valjean and Cosette\n* One Day More&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean, Marius, Cosette, \u00c9ponine, Enjolras, Javert, Th\u00e9nardier, Madame Th\u00e9nardier and Company\n{{col-break}}\n'''Act II'''\n* At the Barricade (Upon These Stones)&nbsp;\u2013 Enjolras, Javert, Marius, \u00c9ponine and Valjean\n* On My Own&nbsp;\u2013 \u00c9ponine\n* Building the Barricade (Upon These Stones)&nbsp;\u2013 Enjolras, Students and Army Officer\n* Javert's Arrival&nbsp;\u2013 Javert and Enjolras\n* Little People&nbsp;\u2013 Gavroche, Students, Enjolras and Javert\n* A Little Fall of Rain&nbsp;\u2013 \u00c9ponine and Marius\n* Night of Anguish&nbsp;\u2013 Enjolras, Valjean and Students\n* The First Attack&nbsp;\u2013 Enjolras, Grantaire, Students, Valjean and Javert\n* Drink with Me&nbsp;\u2013 Grantaire and Marius\n* Bring Him Home&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean\n* Dawn of Anguish&nbsp;\u2013 Enjolras and Students\n* The Second Attack (Death of Gavroche)&nbsp;\u2013 Enjolras, Marius, Valjean, Grantaire, Gavroche and Students\n* The Final Battle&nbsp;\u2013 Army Officer, Grantaire, Enjolras and Students\n* The Sewers&nbsp;\u2013 Instrumental (Orchestra)\n* Dog Eats Dog (The Sewers)&nbsp;\u2013 Th\u00e9nardier\n* Javert's Suicide&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean and Javert\n* Turning&nbsp;\u2013 Women of Paris\n* Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&nbsp;\u2013 Marius\n* Every Day / A Heart Full of Love (Reprise)&nbsp;\u2013 Cosette, Marius and Valjean\n* Valjean's Confession&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean and Marius\n* Suddenly (Reprise)&nbsp;\u2013 Marius and Cosette (2012 film only)\n* Wedding Chorale&nbsp;\u2013 Guests, Th\u00e9nardier, Marius and Madame Th\u00e9nardier\n* Beggars at the Feast&nbsp;\u2013 Th\u00e9nardier and Madame Th\u00e9nardier\n* Epilogue: Valjean's Death&nbsp;\u2013 Valjean, Fantine, Cosette, Marius and \u00c9ponine\n* Finale: Do You Hear the People Sing (Reprise)&nbsp;\u2013 Full Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Prologue ==\n\n=== Overture / Work Song ===\n\nThe \"Overture\" is the opening song and a dramatic instrumental introduction that establishes the setting as Toulon, France, 1815. The \"Work Song\" flows from the \"Overture\", the former opening with a choir of imprisoned men singing a melody later used in \"Look Down\" but eventually becoming a dark duet between the prisoner Jean Valjean and the guard Javert. In early versions, such as in the Original London Recording, the \"Overture\" was essentially just a minor version of the beginning of \"At the End of the Day\", but is now almost exclusively played with part of the same melody as the \"Work Song\" and \"Look Down\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, nor did any of the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Ouverture'' (Overture) and ''Le bagne : piti\u00e9, piti\u00e9'' (The Prison: Mercy, mercy).\n\n=== On Parole ===\n\n\"On Parole\" is the second song in the Prologue. Sometimes this is the first half of [[Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables#Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven|\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"]], but is commonly known as the first part of \"The Bishop of Digne\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, nor did any of the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''En libert\u00e9 conditionnelle'' (On Parole).\n\n=== Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven ===\n\nThe song contains two parts, the first in which Valjean is invited in by the Bishop and steals the silver, the second, where Valjean is caught by two constables. The former is often cut out of recordings. When the both parts are played, the song is usually known as \"The Bishop of Digne\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, nor did any of the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''L\u2019\u00e9v\u00eaque de Digne'' (The Bishop of Digne).\n\n=== Valjean's Soliloquy&nbsp;\u2013 What Have I Done? ===\n\n\"What Have I Done?\" is the fourth and final song in the Prologue, sung by the main character, [[Jean Valjean]].\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, nor did any of the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Pourquoi ai-je permis \u00e0 cet homme?'' (Why Did I Allow That Man?).\n\n== Act I ==\n\n=== At the End of the Day ===\n\nThe music of \"At the End of the Day\" is fast and intricate, with different melodies coinciding as sung by various groups of poor women and men, female workers, solos by certain workers, and repetitious instrumentation.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La journ\u00e9e est finie'' (The Day is Finished), in which it appears as the first song.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Quand un jour est pass\u00e9'' (When a Day is Past).\n\n=== I Dreamed a Dream ===\n\n{{main|I Dreamed a Dream}}\n\n\"I Dreamed a Dream\" is a [[solo (music)|solo]] sung by [[Fantine]] during the first act and the play's most famous number. Most of the music is soft and melancholic, but towards the end becomes louder and taut with frustration and anguish as she cries aloud about the wretched state of her life and her unfair mistreatment.\n\n'''Other uses'''\n\n* ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' characters [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel Berry]] and [[List of Glee characters#McKinley High faculty|Shelby Corcoran]] (portrayed by [[Lea Michele]] and [[Idina Menzel]], respectively) recorded a [[cover version]] of this song.\n* Other covers include [[Neil Diamond]] (from his 1987 live album ''[[Hot August Night II]]'') and [[Aretha Franklin]] (from her 1991 album ''What You See Is What You Sweat'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/search?ev=hs&q=%22i+dreamed+a+dream%22&btn=Search |title=I Dreamed a Dream |publisher= discogs.com |accessdate= 18 April 2009}}</ref> Franklin also performed this song for U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] on the evening of the day that he was [[First inauguration of Bill Clinton|inaugurated]].<ref>{{cite web|date=30 June 2007 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl5ZM02s7yA |title=Aretha Franklin&nbsp;\u2013 I Dreamed A Dream&nbsp;\u2013 Clinton Inauguration |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-03-22}}</ref>\n* In the film ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]'' (1991), one of the auditionees for the titular band sings \"I Dreamed a Dream\" as her audition song.\n* [[Susan Boyle]] performed it in 2009 for her audition on the third season of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/17/susan.boyle/?iref=mpstoryview |title=Scottish singer 'gobsmacked' by overnight stardom |publisher=CNN |date= 17 April 2009}}</ref> The song's renewed popularity caused [[Patti LuPone]]'s 1985 recording to enter the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at forty-five with 4,987 [[music download|digital download]] sales. \"I Dreamed a Dream\" is the musical's only chart hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.uk.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chartwatch/3149/week-ending-april-25th-2009/ |title=Week Ending April 25th 2009&nbsp;\u2013 Chart Watch UK |publisher=New.uk.music.yahoo.com |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/We%20Weren%27t%20Born%20To%20Follow |title=Patti LuPone&nbsp;\u2013 I Dreamed A Dream |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}</ref>\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''J'avais r\u00eav\u00e9 d'une autre vie'' (I Had Dreamed of Another Life).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''J'avais r\u00eav\u00e9'' (I Had Dreamed).\n\n=== Lovely Ladies ===\n\n\"Lovely Ladies\" is a song from the first act. It is followed by \"Fantine's Arrest\" and sometimes the two are counted as one song. Fantine, now unemployed, wanders to the docks where she eventually turns to prostitution to survive.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was a part of the stage show as a song known as ''La nuit'' (The Night), which depicts similar events as the scene where Fantine sells her hair in ''Les beaux cheveux que voil\u00e0'' (The Beautiful Hair That is There). A shortened version of this song was added at the end of ''J'avais r\u00eav\u00e9 d'une autre vie'' (I Had Dreamed of Another Life), which contains the same melody as the final and slower section of ''Lovely Ladies''.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Tu viens, ch\u00e9ri!'' (You Come, Darling!).\n\n=== Fantine's Arrest ===\n\n\"Fantine's Arrest\" is a song from the first act. It follows \"[[#Lovely Ladies|Lovely Ladies]]\" (the two are sometimes counted as one song). Valjean's appearance in the song is sometimes referred to as \"Valjean's Intervention\". This song is followed by \"[[#The Runaway Cart|The Runaway Cart]]\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was separated into two songs, which were called ''Dites-moi ce qui se passe'' (Tell Me What Happened) and ''Fantine et Monsieur Madeleine'' (Fantine and Monsieur Madeleine).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Runaway Cart ===\n\n\"The Runaway Cart\" is a song from the first act, divided into two parts. The chorus, Fauchelevent, and Valjean sing the first with instrumental parts. Valjean sings the second one and Javert on a medium-paced tune often picked up by Javert or other policemen (first sung in \"[[#Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven|Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven]]\"). The song is cut heavily or left completely out in most recordings. It is known in the School Edition as \"The Cart Crash\". In the 2012 film, the first part of the song follows \"At The End of The Day\" with the second part following \"Fantine's Arrest\"\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was a part of the stage show in slightly longer form.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== Who Am I?&nbsp;\u2013 The Trial ===\n\n\"Who Am I?\" is a song from the first act, a solo sung by the main character [[Jean Valjean]]. It is rather slow-paced, and shares a melody with Valjean's solo in \"One Day More\", as well as the ten-years-later sequence after the Prologue.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was a part of the stage show as ''Comment faire?'' (What to Do?). It includes an additional stanza, in which Valjean shortly reveals his past, since the concept version did not contain the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le proc\u00e8s : comment faire?'' (The Trial&nbsp;\u2013 What to Do?).\n\n=== Fantine's Death ===\n\n\"Fantine's Death\", also known as \"Come to Me\", is a song from the first act. It is followed by \"[[#The Confrontation|The Confrontation]]\". It is slow-paced and the tune is very soft. It has the same melody as the more famous \"[[#On My Own|On My Own]]\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La mort de Fantine'' (Fantine's Death).\n\n=== The Confrontation ===\n\nThe main opposing characters Jean Valjean and Javert sing \"The Confrontation\". It follows \"[[#Come to Me|Come to Me]]\" and is followed by \"Castle on a Cloud\". The song is low and slow-paced. The instrumentation behind the vocals is the same as in the \"[[#Overture / Work Song|Work Song]]\", the melody partly also picks up that song. The song's highlight is Javert and Valjean singing in [[counterpoint]], with the lead alternating.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear. In the stage show, a doctor shortly informed Valjean of Fantine's death and Valjean asked three days to fetch Cosette, which Javert refuses. The music was entirely different, but finished in the same instrumental climax that is still used.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La confrontation'' (The Confrontation).\n\n=== Castle On A Cloud ===\n\n\"Castle on a Cloud\" is a [[solo (music)|solo]] for the part of young [[Cosette]]. She sings about a castle where she does not have to sweep floors and a lady all in white looks after her. It is followed by a [[tag (music)|tag]] that breaks away from the main melody, involving the first entrance of Mme Th\u00e9nardier, which is cut from many recordings. Mme Th\u00e9nardier verbally abuses Cosette, orders her to fetch some water from a well, praises her daughter young \u00c9ponine (a silent role), and again refers to Cosette (after \u00c9ponine points to her to show she did not leave), warning that she never asks twice.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 The main song is called ''Mon prince est en chemin'' (My Prince is On the Way) where it is preceded by a long instrumental section. The part where Cosette is caught by Mme Th\u00e9nardier is called ''Mam'zelle [[Crapaud]]'' (Miss Toad) that is added onto the end of \"Castle on a Cloud\" in the English version.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Une poup\u00e9e dans la vitrine'' (A Doll in a Window). This is a reference to the book; to a doll.\n\n=== Master of the House ===\n\n\"Master of the House\" is one of the better-known songs of the musical. It introduces the Th\u00e9nardiers and the crooked way that they operate their inn. The song is preceded by a lengthy introduction sung largely by regulars at the inn and Th\u00e9nardier himself, which is cut from almost all recordings.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La devise du cabaretier'' (The Innkeeper's Motto).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Ma\u00eetre Th\u00e9nardier'' (Master Th\u00e9nardier).\n\n=== The Well Scene ===\n\n\"The Well Scene\" is sung by Valjean and Young Cosette. Cosette is walking alone in the woods with a bucket of water. Valjean arrives and Cosette sees him. Valjean tells her to not be afraid. He asks for her name and Cosette tells him. He takes the bucket for her and walks her back to the inn. (only in the new video production in 2013 and in Czech version)\n\n=== The Bargain / The Waltz of Treachery ===\n\n\"The Bargain\" and \"The Waltz of Treachery\" are two intertwined songs. Much of the number is often cut from recordings. The latter part of \"The Waltz of Treachery\" is largely instrumental. It flows directly into \"Look Down\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Valjean chez les Th\u00e9nardier'' (Valjean at the Th\u00e9nardiers') and ''La valse de la fourberie'' (The Waltz of Treachery).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La transaction'' (The Dealing). It is only the second part.\n\n=== Suddenly ===\n\n{{main|Suddenly (Les Mis\u00e9rables)}}\n\n\"Suddenly\" is a song created for the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|2012 film]]. The song \"explains what happens when Valjean takes Cosette from the inn and looks after her\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/159493-One-Song-More-Les-Miz-Film-Will-Have-New-Song-and-Live-Singing-Cameron-Mackintosh-Reveals-All |title=One Song More!

It is important for plot, introducing Gavroche, Enjolras, Marius, the adolescent \u00c9ponine, the adolescent Cosette, and the plight of the working poor; it flows directly into \"The Robbery\". The song comes after \"Stars\" in the Original London Recording and the 2012 film.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Donnez, donnez'' (Give, Give). The song is about twice as long. It has a second solo sung by Gavroche, where he makes fun of king [[Louis-Philippe]] and the politicians. A part of what would later become ''The Robbery'' can be found at the end. This stanza asks for some historical knowledge; otherwise, the joke cannot be understood.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Bonjour, Paris'' (Hello, Paris).\n\n=== The Robbery / Javert's Intervention ===\n\n\"The Robbery\" is a lesser-known song from the musical. The young adults Eponine, Marius, and Cosette are introduced (though Cosette's part in the scene is silent). Marius and Cosette bump into each other and fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier attempts to rob Jean Valjean, realizing he is the one \"who borrowed Cosette\", a brawl breaks out. \u00c9ponine cries out as Javert arrives on the scene (a segment of the song commonly known as \"Javert's Intervention\") but, because Javert does not immediately recognise Valjean, the latter escapes; Th\u00e9nardier then convinces Javert to let him go and pursue Valjean instead.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song appeared at the end of ''Donnez, donnez'' (Give, Give) on the recording, but also existed in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== Stars ===\n\n\"Stars\" is one of the two chief songs performed as a solo by Javert. It is among the better-known songs from the musical. It comes before \"Look Down\" in the Original London Version and the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|2012 film]].\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Sous les \u00e9toiles'' (Under the Stars).\n\n=== \u00c9ponine's Errand ===\n\n\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\" is an important scene in the show in which Marius asks \u00c9ponine to discover where Cosette lives and then take him to her. It is clear that \u00c9ponine is reluctant to encourage the brewing romance between Marius and Cosette, but because of her love for Marius, she cooperates. The first part follows the same melody as ''L'un vers l'autre'' (''Towards One Another''), a solo for \u00c9ponine that appeared on the original concept album but did not make it to the current version. This tune appears throughout the show.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The ABC Caf\u00e9&nbsp;\u2013 Red and Black ===\n\n\"The ABC Caf\u00e9&nbsp;\u2013 [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Red and Black]]\", on most recordings referred to as simply \"Red and Black\", introduces the group of young student revolutionaries, who have formed an organization called the Friends of the ABC. The song name is a mixture from the Caf\u00e9 Musain, which was their favourite meeting place in the book and their name, \"La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis de l'ABC\" (literally in English, the Society of Friends of the ABC). The name is a pun, as in French \"ABC\" when pronounced one letter at a time is \"abaiss\u00e9\", which is also the word for \"lower\" (therefore, \"Friends of the Lower Class or the Poor\"). The song consists of many different changing parts. The song involves a [[tag (music)|tag]], in which Gavroche enters and announces to the students that [[General Lamarque]] is dead; Enjolras then sings a solo about how this is a sign for the beginning of the revolution, transitioning directly into \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version These songs are known as ''Rouge et noir'' (Red and Black), sung by Marius about his meeting with Cosette, followed by ''Les amis de l'ABC'' (The Friends of the ABC).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 These songs are known as ''Le caf\u00e9 des amis de l'ABC'' (The Caf\u00e9 of the Friends of the ABC) and ''Rouge la flamme de la col\u00e8re'' (Red, the Flame of Anger). The song order is reversed to match the English versions.\n\n=== Do You Hear the People Sing? ===\n\n{{main|Do You Hear the People Sing?}}\n\n\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" is one of the principal and most recognizable songs from the musical, sometimes (especially in various translated versions of the play) called \"The People's Song\". A stirring anthem, it is sung twice: once at the end of the first act, and once at the end of the musical's Finale. Instrumentally, the theme is also prominent in the battle scenes. In the 2012 movie, it is performed after \"One Day More\".\n\nAt the special ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' [[Les Mis\u00e9rables - The Dream Cast in Concert|10th Anniversary Concert]] in 1995, \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" was sung as an [[encore (concert)|encore]] by seventeen different actors who had played Jean Valjean around the world. Each actor sang a line of the song in his own language (except for [[Jerzy Jeszke]], who being Polish himself sung a line in German as he'd performed the role of Valjean in Germany), and the languages sung including French, German, Japanese, Hungarian, Swedish, Polish, Dutch, Norwegian, Czech, Danish, Icelandic and English.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''\u00c0 la volont\u00e9 du peuple'' (To the Will of the People).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is also known as ''\u00c0 la volont\u00e9 du peuple'' (To the Will of the People), but has slightly different lyrics to the original.\n\n=== Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 In My Life ===\n\n\"Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 In My Life\", referred to on most recordings as simply \"In My Life\", is among the better-known songs from the musical. It largely involves a duet between Cosette and Valjean, though Marius and \u00c9ponine also sing near the end. In the Original London recording alone, it plays alongside a Cosette solo, \"I Saw Him Once\", (''Te souviens-tu du premier jour ?'' in the original 1980 French production) cut out of all other recordings.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Cosette: Dans la vie'' (Cosette: In Life) and ''Marius: Dans la vie'' (Marius: In Life).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 Dans ma vie'' (Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 In My Life).\n\n=== A Heart Full of Love ===\n\n\"A Heart Full of Love\" is sung by Cosette, Marius, and \u00c9ponine, immediately following \"In My Life\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le c\u0153ur au bonheur'' (The Heart at Happiness).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le c\u0153ur au bonheur'' (The Heart at Happiness).\n\n=== The Attack on Rue Plumet ===\n\n\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\" is a three-part song, the first part of which plays in only two recordings: a long version in the 1980 Original French recording and a much-shortened version only on the Complete Symphonic Recording and added into the beginning of \"The Attack on Rue Plumet\". The second is best known and is played in all recordings while the third is again more important for plot than music. On the London Original Cast recording, it is called the \"Plumet Attack\". \u00c9ponine, bringing Marius to Valjean's house to see Cosette, stumbles upon her father Th\u00e9nardier and his gang [[Patron-Minette]], made up of Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse, preparing to rob the house; \u00c9ponine screams, dispersing the robbers, while Valjean is led to believe that Javert or his minions have discovered his whereabouts at last, and so prepares to leave at once with Cosette. It is one of the lesser-known songs of the musical, yet serves as an important plot point. Interestingly, the large majority of this song's music is not heard anywhere else in the musical.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 The first part of the song figures as ''Voil\u00e0 le soir qui tombe'' (Behold, The Night Falls), which lasts over a minute and a half and actually occurs between \"In My Life\" and \"A Heart Full of Love\". It is sung solo by \u00c9ponine and warns Marius about the planned break-in. The second part did not figure on the recording, but was used as a purely instrumental piece in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le casse de la rue {{Not a typo|Plumet}}'' (The Break-In of Rue Plumet).\n\n=== One Day More ===\n\n{{main|One Day More}}\n\n\"One Day More\" is a choral piece with many solos: all of the main characters (except for Fantine and The Bishop - both of whom have died by this point) sing in it in a [[counterpoint]] style known as dramatic [[quodlibet]], as well as parts by the ensemble. It is the finale to Act 1. The song borrows themes from several songs from the first act.\n\nEach character sings his/her part to a different melody at the same time ([[counterpoint]]), before joining for the final chorus:\n\n* Valjean picks up the melody of \"Who Am I?\" without any changes (A major)\n* Marius, Cosette and \u00c9ponine sing to the melody of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" with \u00c9ponine taking the bridge (\"But the tigers come at night\", sung by \u00c9ponine as \"One more day all on my own\") and the other two taking a countermelody that is only instrumental in Fantine's solo. (A major, modulating to F# minor)\n* Enjolras repeats the bridge melody of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" with Marius singing the countermelody. (E\u266d major)\n* Javert sings to the already often-used theme from \"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\", \"Fantine's Arrest\" and \"The Robbery/Javert's Intervention\", only slower and in a major key. (A major)\n* The Th\u00e9nardiers sing to a slightly changed melody from \"Master of the House\" (A Major)\n* The revolutionaries repeat the bridge melody of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" with the countermelody. (A major)\n* At the end of the song, everyone sings the melody of \"Who Am I?\" (C major)\n\n'''Other uses'''\n\nThe song was used by [[Bill Clinton]] in his successful [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 campaign]] for the presidency of the United States.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1888965,00.html |title=Moral Philosophy: The Musical passes an unexpected milestone |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date=October 6, 2006}}</ref> Another version was used by Barack Obama supporters during his successful [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]] campaign. It was also used as a finale to the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables in Concert: The 25th Anniversary|25th Anniversary concert of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'']] at [[The O2 (London)|The O2]], sung by the OLC with [[Ramin Karimloo]] singing the part of [[Enjolras]].\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Demain'' (Tomorrow). It is slightly longer, finishing with a short solo from Valjean.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le grand jour'' (The Big Day).\n\n== Act II ==\n\n=== Upon These Stones&nbsp;\u2013 Building the Barricade ===\n\n\"Building the Barricade\" is the [[entr'acte]] of the musical and contains a new theme, which transitions into \u00c9ponine's appearance at the barricade, and her sung dialogue with Marius and later with Valjean as she passes to him a letter from Marius intended for Cosette. It is often cut out of recordings in part or completely. On the Complete Symphonic Recording, this song is mislabeled \"At the Barricade\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was present in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La premi\u00e8re barricade'' (The First Barricade). The section where \u00c9ponine delivers the letter to Valjean is cut.\n\n=== On My Own ===\n\n{{main|On My Own (Les Mis\u00e9rables)}}\n\n\"On My Own\" is a [[solo (music)|solo]] part for [[\u00c9ponine]]. The refrain of the song is the same tune as that of ''\"Fantine's Death (Come to Me)\"'', although it adds a [[bridge (music)|bridge]] and the tune of the verses are different. Beginning in the key of D, [[modulation (music)|modulating]] to [[B-flat major|B\u266d]] (even though the song does not actually change key), then ending in F, this is her most important song. In the film adaptation, the song comes after ''A Heart Full of Love'' and before ''[[One Day More]]''.\n\n''' Other uses'''\n\n\"On My Own\" has appeared in many famous events outside of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'', for example:\n\n* The character of [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel Berry]] in ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', played by [[Lea Michele]] (who played Eponine at the Hollywood Bowl production of ''Les Mis''), sang this song as an audition to join the Glee Club in the [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]].<ref name=\"Pilot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/glee/music/season-1/episode-1.htm|title=Pilot: Featured Music|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|accessdate=29 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903115746/http://www.fox.com/glee/music/season-1/episode-1.htm|archivedate=2009-09-03|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Michele's version has been released as a [[music download|digital download]] [[Single (music)|single]].\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] parodied the song at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. (Hathaway would later go on to play [[Fantine]] in the 2012 film version of ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.)\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not figure, although the music was adapted from ''L'air de la mis\u00e8re'' (The Air of Misery), which was sung by Fantine about her misery and suffering. \u00c9ponine's solo was known as ''L'un vers l'autre'' (The One Toward the Other), bearing no resemblance.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Mon histoire'' (My Story).\n\n=== Upon These Stones&nbsp;\u2013 At the Barricade ===\n\n\"At the Barricade\", also called \"Back at the Barricade\", begins with an instrumental reprise of the \"Red and Black\" and a sung reprise of the \"Upon These Stones\" musical themes. It is also the first of the two times that a National Guardsmen sings a warning to the revolutionaries. On the Complete Symphonic Recording, this song is mislabeled \"Building the Barricade\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Sur la barricade'' (On the Barricade).\n\n=== Javert's Arrival ===\n\n\"Javert's Arrival\" or \"Javert's Return\" involves Javert's return to the barricade to report on the enemy's plans; however, he is interrupted by Gavroche's exposing him as a spy in \"Little People\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was a part of the stage show in similar form, but was not a part of the recording.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Je sais ce qui se trame'' (I Know What is Happening).\n\n=== Little People ===\n\n\"Little People\" begins as Gavroche proudly and merrily uncovers Javert's identity as an undercover police inspector.\n\n; Versions\nThe Original London Recording included a much longer version sung by Gavroche, sung in the first act, between \"Look Down\" and \"Red and Black\". This original version was related to Gavroche being able to be useful even though small, rather than the uncovering of Javert. For later versions of the musical, the song was halved to its current length. Gavroche's gleeful uncovering of Javert is sung to an entirely different melody, already used in the Original French Version and is much shorter, before leading to the musical bit that was left in.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La faute \u00e0 Voltaire'' (Voltaire's Fault) and is accompanied by a background choir. The chorus was taken directly from the novel.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''C'est la faute \u00e0...'' (It Is the Fault of...).\n\n=== A Little Fall of Rain ===\n\"A Little Fall of Rain\" is the song of [[\u00c9ponine]]'s death. \u00c9ponine, the eldest daughter of the Th\u00e9nardiers, she tells [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]] that she loves him and dies in his arms. Marius's reaction to her death in the musical is quite different from that in the novel; in the book, Marius does not really care much about \u00c9ponine, whereas in the musical they are portrayed as best friends, and he and his fellow students mourn her death, \"fighting in her name\", Marius being quite devastated by his best friend's death, even crying while holding her in his arms, and refusing to let go when his fellow students try to take her body away, and refusing the comfort of Enjolras, and continuing to cry over his best friend being gone forever. The title lyric is often misinterpreted; she thinks she is wet because of rain, Marius sees it's blood from her wound(s) that's \"everywhere\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Ce n'est rien'' (It is Nothing).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Un peu de sang qui pleure'' (A Little Blood that Weeps).\n\n=== Night of Anguish ===\n\n\"Night of Anguish\" is a musical interlude scene. The exact definition of this song and the following are hazy; sometimes the few lines following \u00c9ponine's death are named \"Night of Anguish\", sometimes it is the scene directly after the first attack that includes the dialogue between Valjean and Javert, that receives this name. In the 2012 film, this song following Eponine's death is omitted and replaced with a non-vocal musical interlude.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La nuit de l'angoisse'' (The Night of Anguish), which contains much of the same musical material, appears much earlier on the concept recording, and is about the revolutionaries' lamentation of their predicament. It also includes material that would later be used in \"Drink with Me\".\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The First Attack ===\n\n\"The First Attack\" begins as a largely instrumental number with only some short lines of singing; there also several lines shouted by revolutionaries during the attack. Depending on the definition of the song, it includes the scene in which Valjean sets Javert free. This scene, even though musically relatively uninteresting, is very important for the plot.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''L'aube du 6 juin'' (Dawn of June 6) on the recording, but was revised for the stage show into musical sections still present in the English version.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La premi\u00e8re attaque'' (The First Attack).\n\n=== Drink with Me ===\n\n\"Drink with Me\" is the revolutionaries' mellow song as night falls and they await their enemy's retaliation.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 One stanza of it can be found in the song ''La nuit de l'angoisse'' (The Night of Anguish).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Souviens-toi des jours pass\u00e9s'' (Remember the Past Days).\n\n=== Bring Him Home ===\nValjean begs God to save and return Marius to Cosette. In a documentary on the [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] of the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|film adaptation]], [[Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg]] revealed that the song was written specifically for [[Colm Wilkinson]].<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Sch\u00f6nberg, Claude-Michel| title = The West End Connection| medium = Blu-ray Disc | publisher = Universal Studios}}</ref>\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Comme un homme'' (Like a Man).\n* 1999 Spanish Cathedral Version&nbsp;- This song is known as ''S\u00e1lvalo'' (Save him).\n\n=== Dawn of Anguish ===\n\n\"Dawn of Anguish\" is another minor interlude in which Enjolras and the revolutionaries come to the realisation that the people of Paris are not joining their revolution. Without the masses rising up to support them, they accept that the uprising's failure is inevitable and so Enjolras tells all the women and fathers of children to return to their homes, since they will only die if they remain at the barricades.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n* 1999 Spanish Cathedral Version&nbsp;- This song never appeared and was never mentioned.\n\n=== The Second Attack ===\n\n\"The Second Attack\" or \"Death of Gavroche\"  is important to the plot. Gavroche runs into the enemy line of fire to retrieve ammunition for the revolutionaries, but is killed during a reprise of his \"Little People\" solo.\n\nJames Fenton had written another song for Gavroche's death, called \"Ten Little Bullets\", using the melody of Gavroche's solo in \"Look Down\".<ref name=\"The complete book of Les Mis\u00e9rables\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&printsec=frontcover&q=|title=The Complete Book of Les Miserables|first=Edward|last=Behr|year=1993|publisher= Arcade Publishing|isbn= 978-1-55970-156-3}}</ref> The song did not make it past recordings, probably not even there. Only the Broadway Revival version restarted using it in 2006.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La mort de Gavroche'' (The Death of Gavroche).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Final Battle ===\n\n\"The Final Battle\" is a mostly instrumental number, often omitted from recordings. It repeats the first [[Bar (music)|bar]] of the theme from \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" with some variations and key changes, before erupting into a final reprise of the \"Red and Black\" theme, ending on a discordant chord instead of the major chord of that theme.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Sewers / Dog Eats Dog ===\n\"The Sewers\" is mostly a lengthy completely instrumental reprise of \"Bring Him Home\", though it also incorporates \"Dog Eats Dog\", a solo performed by Th\u00e9nardier. In it, Th\u00e9nardier describes his robbing the dead bodies from the battle at the barricades and justifies his actions by saying that somebody has to \"clean them up...as a service to the town\". He also declares that God is dead and that the only thing looking down from the heavens is the \"[[Full moon#Harvest moon|harvest moon]]\". It is one of the darkest songs of the musical.\n\nThe song was notably absent in the 2012 film adaptation, which instead contained a shorter chase-action sequence, scored primarily to \"Look Down\", in its place. The omission of the song allows Th\u00e9nardier's character in the film to remain somewhat comical, though he is still shown in the sewers robbing dead bodies.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Fureurs cannibales'' (Cannibal Frenzy).\n\n=== Javert's Suicide ===\n\n\"Javert's Suicide\" is the second and last chief song performed solely by Javert. It is preceded by a repeat of the beginning of \"The Confrontation\" theme (which is sometimes cut from recordings or incorporated into \"The Sewers\"), in which Valjean asks Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a hospital, a request to which Javert, this time, agrees. After Valjean leaves, Javert contemplates the paradox of hunting the man who has spared him his life; he proceeds to jump to his death in the river. The song is instrumentally an exact reprise of Valjean's Soliloquy, though sung by Javert with changed lyrics. Part of an instrumental from Stars is heard at the end of song as he is falling.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Noir ou blanc'' (Black or White).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le suicide de Javert'' (Javert's Suicide).\n\n=== Turning ===\n\nIn \"Turning\", the women of Paris mourn the loss of the students and their own hopeless cycles of childbirth and misery. It is set to the melody of \"Lovely Ladies\". It is also the only song in the musical not sung by a major character.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Tourne, tourne'' (Turn, Turn).\n\n=== Empty Chairs at Empty Tables ===\n\n\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\" is a [[solo (music)|solo]] sung by the character [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]], who is mourning the death of all of his friends who were killed at the barricade. Part of it is to the tune of \"The Bishop of Digne\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Seul devant ces tables vides'' (Alone in Front of These Empty Tables).\n\n=== Every Day ===\n\n\"Every Day\" or \"Marius and Cosette\" is a two-part song sung by Cosette, Marius and Valjean. The second part is often known as \"A Heart Full of Love (Reprise)\". Gillenormand sings part of the song in the 2012 film.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, but identical music sections were present in a former exchange between Marius and the Gillenormands in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== Valjean's Confession ===\n\n\"Valjean's Confession\" is sung by Valjean and Marius. Though important for the plot, the music is more important as an introduction to \"Who Am I?\".\n\n''' French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''L'aveu de Jean Valjean'' (Jean Valjean's Confession) and was much longer. It explains Valjean's motives more clearly. When Marius asks why Valjean confesses to him, Valjean explains that his conscience will not let him rest until he has done so. Valjean asks Marius if it would be better if he (Valjean) did not see Cosette again and Marius says that he thinks so. This fits much better with the description in the book.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Wedding ===\n\n\"The Wedding\" is a very brief song, also known as the \"Wedding Chorale\", and is sung by the guests on Cosette and Marius's wedding. The second part is a dialogue-heavy song that is often abridged or cut, sung by Marius and the Th\u00e9nardiers. This part is sometimes called \"The Waltz of Treachery (Reprise)\" as it is sung to a similar melody.\n\n''' French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 The first part of this song is known as ''Le mariage: soyez heureux'' (The Marriage: Be Happy). It was longer than all other versions, featuring an additional refrain. The second part is known as ''Marchandage et r\u00e9v\u00e9lation'' (Bargaining and Revelation), where it is more than only slightly longer. It included another subplot from the book. Here, Th\u00e9nardier first tries to shock Marius with the revelation that Valjean is an ex-convict, which Marius already knows. When Th\u00e9nardier says that Valjean is also a murderer, Marius claims to know that as well. He believes Valjean to have killed both Javert (on the barricade) and a certain M. Madeleine, a rich factory owner. Th\u00e9nardier proves to him (with the help of newspaper clippings), that Javert committed suicide and that Madeleine and Valjean are the same person&nbsp;\u2013 Marius's false source of information is unknown&nbsp;\u2013 and then tells him about the sewers.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Sonnez, sonnez'' (Ring, Ring).\n\n=== Beggars at the Feast ===\n\n\"Beggars at the Feast\" is the second big musical number sung by the Th\u00e9nardiers, in which they proclaim how through their treacherous ways they always manage to come out on top before waving the audience goodbye with the mocking line \"When we're rich as Croesus, Jesus, won't we see you all in hell\". It is a reprise of the \"Master of the House\" theme.\n\n'''French Versions''''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Mendiants \u00e0 la f\u00eate'' (Beggars at the Party).\n\n== Epilogue ==\n\n=== Valjean's Death ===\n\n\"Valjean's Death\" is the penultimate (or last, depending on the song organization) musical number in ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''. This and the \"Finale\", into which it flows without pause, are sometimes counted as one song. The combination is often known as \"The Epilogue\" (as the musical also has a Prologue). Fantine and \u00c9ponine come to welcome him into salvation. \"Valjean's Death\" borrows the tune from \"Fantine's Death\" and \"On My Own\", and towards the end, \"Bring Him Home\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''\u00c9pilogue: la lumi\u00e8re'' (Epilogue: The Light). Fantine and Eponine do not appear, as the song ends alternatively with Valjean emploring Cosette and Marius to love and cherish each other, before he peacefully passes away.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Final: c'est pour demain'' (Finale: It is For Tomorrow).\n\n=== Finale ===\n\n\"The Finale\", also known as \"Do You Hear the People Sing? (Reprise)\", is the last song in the musical; it is often incorporated with \"Valjean's Death\" into a single track on recordings, simply entitled \"Epilogue\".\n\n''' French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, instead ending with Valjean's Death.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Final: c'est pour demain'' (Finale: It is For Tomorrow).\n\n== Song appearances in recordings ==\n'''Key'''\n{{Plainlist}}\n*[[File:Yes check.svg|15px|Yes]]&nbsp;\u2013 All or almost all of song included\n*[[File:Check.svg|15px|Partially]]&nbsp;\u2013 Part of song included\n*[[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]&nbsp;\u2013 Song excluded\n{{Endplainlist}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The \"Work Song\" flows from the \"Overture\", the former opening with a choir of imprisoned men singing a melody later used in \"Look Down\" but eventually becoming a dark duet between the prisoner Jean Valjean and the guard Javert. In early versions, such as in the Original London Recording, the \"Overture\" was essentially just a minor version of the beginning of \"At the End of the Day\", but is now almost exclusively played with part of the same melody as the \"Work Song\" and \"Look Down\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, nor did any of the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Ouverture'' (Overture) and ''Le bagne : piti\u00e9, piti\u00e9'' (The Prison: Mercy, mercy).\n\n=== On Parole ===\n\n\"On Parole\" is the second song in the Prologue. Sometimes this is the first half of [[Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables#Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven|\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"]], but is commonly known as the first part of \"The Bishop of Digne\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, nor did any of the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''En libert\u00e9 conditionnelle'' (On Parole).\n\n=== Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven ===\n\nThe song contains two parts, the first in which Valjean is invited in by the Bishop and steals the silver, the second, where Valjean is caught by two constables. The former is often cut out of recordings.

It is followed by \"Fantine's Arrest\" and sometimes the two are counted as one song. Fantine, now unemployed, wanders to the docks where she eventually turns to prostitution to survive.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was a part of the stage show as a song known as ''La nuit'' (The Night), which depicts similar events as the scene where Fantine sells her hair in ''Les beaux cheveux que voil\u00e0'' (The Beautiful Hair That is There). A shortened version of this song was added at the end of ''J'avais r\u00eav\u00e9 d'une autre vie'' (I Had Dreamed of Another Life), which contains the same melody as the final and slower section of ''Lovely Ladies''.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Tu viens, ch\u00e9ri!'' (You Come, Darling!).\n\n=== Fantine's Arrest ===\n\n\"Fantine's Arrest\" is a song from the first act. It follows \"[[#Lovely Ladies|Lovely Ladies]]\" (the two are sometimes counted as one song). Valjean's appearance in the song is sometimes referred to as \"Valjean's Intervention\". This song is followed by \"[[#The Runaway Cart|The Runaway Cart]]\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was separated into two songs, which were called ''Dites-moi ce qui se passe'' (Tell Me What Happened) and ''Fantine et Monsieur Madeleine'' (Fantine and Monsieur Madeleine).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Runaway Cart ===\n\n\"The Runaway Cart\" is a song from the first act, divided into two parts. The chorus, Fauchelevent, and Valjean sing the first with instrumental parts. Valjean sings the second one and Javert on a medium-paced tune often picked up by Javert or other policemen (first sung in \"[[#Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven|Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven]]\"). The song is cut heavily or left completely out in most recordings. It is known in the School Edition as \"The Cart Crash\". In the 2012 film, the first part of the song follows \"At The End of The Day\" with the second part following \"Fantine's Arrest\"\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was a part of the stage show in slightly longer form.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== Who Am I?&nbsp;\u2013 The Trial ===\n\n\"Who Am I?\" is a song from the first act, a solo sung by the main character [[Jean Valjean]]. It is rather slow-paced, and shares a melody with Valjean's solo in \"One Day More\", as well as the ten-years-later sequence after the Prologue.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was a part of the stage show as ''Comment faire?'' (What to Do?). It includes an additional stanza, in which Valjean shortly reveals his past, since the concept version did not contain the Prologue.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le proc\u00e8s : comment faire?'' (The Trial&nbsp;\u2013 What to Do?).\n\n=== Fantine's Death ===\n\n\"Fantine's Death\", also known as \"Come to Me\", is a song from the first act. It is followed by \"[[#The Confrontation|The Confrontation]]\". It is slow-paced and the tune is very soft. It has the same melody as the more famous \"[[#On My Own|On My Own]]\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La mort de Fantine'' (Fantine's Death).\n\n=== The Confrontation ===\n\nThe main opposing characters Jean Valjean and Javert sing \"The Confrontation\". It follows \"[[#Come to Me|Come to Me]]\" and is followed by \"Castle on a Cloud\". The song is low and slow-paced. The instrumentation behind the vocals is the same as in the \"[[#Overture / Work Song|Work Song]]\", the melody partly also picks up that song. The song's highlight is Javert and Valjean singing in [[counterpoint]], with the lead alternating.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear. In the stage show, a doctor shortly informed Valjean of Fantine's death and Valjean asked three days to fetch Cosette, which Javert refuses. The music was entirely different, but finished in the same instrumental climax that is still used.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La confrontation'' (The Confrontation).\n\n=== Castle On A Cloud ===\n\n\"Castle on a Cloud\" is a [[solo (music)|solo]] for the part of young [[Cosette]]. She sings about a castle where she does not have to sweep floors and a lady all in white looks after her. It is followed by a [[tag (music)|tag]] that breaks away from the main melody, involving the first entrance of Mme Th\u00e9nardier, which is cut from many recordings. Mme Th\u00e9nardier verbally abuses Cosette, orders her to fetch some water from a well, praises her daughter young \u00c9ponine (a silent role), and again refers to Cosette (after \u00c9ponine points to her to show she did not leave), warning that she never asks twice.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 The main song is called ''Mon prince est en chemin'' (My Prince is On the Way) where it is preceded by a long instrumental section. The part where Cosette is caught by Mme Th\u00e9nardier is called ''Mam'zelle [[Crapaud]]'' (Miss Toad) that is added onto the end of \"Castle on a Cloud\" in the English version.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Une poup\u00e9e dans la vitrine'' (A Doll in a Window). This is a reference to the book; to a doll.\n\n=== Master of the House ===\n\n\"Master of the House\" is one of the better-known songs of the musical. It introduces the Th\u00e9nardiers and the crooked way that they operate their inn. The song is preceded by a lengthy introduction sung largely by regulars at the inn and Th\u00e9nardier himself, which is cut from almost all recordings.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La devise du cabaretier'' (The Innkeeper's Motto).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Ma\u00eetre Th\u00e9nardier'' (Master Th\u00e9nardier).\n\n=== The Well Scene ===\n\n\"The Well Scene\" is sung by Valjean and Young Cosette. Cosette is walking alone in the woods with a bucket of water. Valjean arrives and Cosette sees him. Valjean tells her to not be afraid. He asks for her name and Cosette tells him. He takes the bucket for her and walks her back to the inn. (only in the new video production in 2013 and in Czech version)\n\n=== The Bargain / The Waltz of Treachery ===\n\n\"The Bargain\" and \"The Waltz of Treachery\" are two intertwined songs. Much of the number is often cut from recordings. The latter part of \"The Waltz of Treachery\" is largely instrumental. It flows directly into \"Look Down\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Valjean chez les Th\u00e9nardier'' (Valjean at the Th\u00e9nardiers') and ''La valse de la fourberie'' (The Waltz of Treachery).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La transaction'' (The Dealing). It is only the second part.\n\n=== Suddenly ===\n\n{{main|Suddenly (Les Mis\u00e9rables)}}\n\n\"Suddenly\" is a song created for the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|2012 film]]. The song \"explains what happens when Valjean takes Cosette from the inn and looks after her\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/159493-One-Song-More-Les-Miz-Film-Will-Have-New-Song-and-Live-Singing-Cameron-Mackintosh-Reveals-All |title=One Song More!

It is important for plot, introducing Gavroche, Enjolras, Marius, the adolescent \u00c9ponine, the adolescent Cosette, and the plight of the working poor; it flows directly into \"The Robbery\". The song comes after \"Stars\" in the Original London Recording and the 2012 film.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Donnez, donnez'' (Give, Give). The song is about twice as long. It has a second solo sung by Gavroche, where he makes fun of king [[Louis-Philippe]] and the politicians. A part of what would later become ''The Robbery'' can be found at the end. This stanza asks for some historical knowledge; otherwise, the joke cannot be understood.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Bonjour, Paris'' (Hello, Paris).\n\n=== The Robbery / Javert's Intervention ===\n\n\"The Robbery\" is a lesser-known song from the musical. The young adults Eponine, Marius, and Cosette are introduced (though Cosette's part in the scene is silent). Marius and Cosette bump into each other and fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier attempts to rob Jean Valjean, realizing he is the one \"who borrowed Cosette\", a brawl breaks out. \u00c9ponine cries out as Javert arrives on the scene (a segment of the song commonly known as \"Javert's Intervention\") but, because Javert does not immediately recognise Valjean, the latter escapes; Th\u00e9nardier then convinces Javert to let him go and pursue Valjean instead.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song appeared at the end of ''Donnez, donnez'' (Give, Give) on the recording, but also existed in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== Stars ===\n\n\"Stars\" is one of the two chief songs performed as a solo by Javert. It is among the better-known songs from the musical. It comes before \"Look Down\" in the Original London Version and the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|2012 film]].\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Sous les \u00e9toiles'' (Under the Stars).\n\n=== \u00c9ponine's Errand ===\n\n\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\" is an important scene in the show in which Marius asks \u00c9ponine to discover where Cosette lives and then take him to her. It is clear that \u00c9ponine is reluctant to encourage the brewing romance between Marius and Cosette, but because of her love for Marius, she cooperates. The first part follows the same melody as ''L'un vers l'autre'' (''Towards One Another''), a solo for \u00c9ponine that appeared on the original concept album but did not make it to the current version. This tune appears throughout the show.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The ABC Caf\u00e9&nbsp;\u2013 Red and Black ===\n\n\"The ABC Caf\u00e9&nbsp;\u2013 [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Red and Black]]\", on most recordings referred to as simply \"Red and Black\", introduces the group of young student revolutionaries, who have formed an organization called the Friends of the ABC. The song name is a mixture from the Caf\u00e9 Musain, which was their favourite meeting place in the book and their name, \"La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis de l'ABC\" (literally in English, the Society of Friends of the ABC). The name is a pun, as in French \"ABC\" when pronounced one letter at a time is \"abaiss\u00e9\", which is also the word for \"lower\" (therefore, \"Friends of the Lower Class or the Poor\"). The song consists of many different changing parts. The song involves a [[tag (music)|tag]], in which Gavroche enters and announces to the students that [[General Lamarque]] is dead; Enjolras then sings a solo about how this is a sign for the beginning of the revolution, transitioning directly into \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version These songs are known as ''Rouge et noir'' (Red and Black), sung by Marius about his meeting with Cosette, followed by ''Les amis de l'ABC'' (The Friends of the ABC).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 These songs are known as ''Le caf\u00e9 des amis de l'ABC'' (The Caf\u00e9 of the Friends of the ABC) and ''Rouge la flamme de la col\u00e8re'' (Red, the Flame of Anger). The song order is reversed to match the English versions.\n\n=== Do You Hear the People Sing? ===\n\n{{main|Do You Hear the People Sing?}}\n\n\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" is one of the principal and most recognizable songs from the musical, sometimes (especially in various translated versions of the play) called \"The People's Song\". A stirring anthem, it is sung twice: once at the end of the first act, and once at the end of the musical's Finale. Instrumentally, the theme is also prominent in the battle scenes. In the 2012 movie, it is performed after \"One Day More\".\n\nAt the special ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' [[Les Mis\u00e9rables - The Dream Cast in Concert|10th Anniversary Concert]] in 1995, \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" was sung as an [[encore (concert)|encore]] by seventeen different actors who had played Jean Valjean around the world. Each actor sang a line of the song in his own language (except for [[Jerzy Jeszke]], who being Polish himself sung a line in German as he'd performed the role of Valjean in Germany), and the languages sung including French, German, Japanese, Hungarian, Swedish, Polish, Dutch, Norwegian, Czech, Danish, Icelandic and English.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''\u00c0 la volont\u00e9 du peuple'' (To the Will of the People).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''\u00c0 la volont\u00e9 du peuple'' (To the Will of the People).\n\n=== Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 In My Life ===\n\n\"Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 In My Life\", referred to on most recordings as simply \"In My Life\", is among the better-known songs from the musical. It largely involves a duet between Cosette and Valjean, though Marius and \u00c9ponine also sing near the end. In the Original London recording alone, it plays alongside a Cosette solo, \"I Saw Him Once\", (''Te souviens-tu du premier jour ?'' in the original 1980 French production) cut out of all other recordings.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Cosette: Dans la vie'' (Cosette: In Life) and ''Marius: Dans la vie'' (Marius: In Life).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 Dans ma vie'' (Rue Plumet&nbsp;\u2013 In My Life).\n\n=== A Heart Full of Love ===\n\n\"A Heart Full of Love\" is sung by Cosette, Marius, and \u00c9ponine, immediately following \"In My Life\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le c\u0153ur au bonheur'' (The Heart at Happiness).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le c\u0153ur au bonheur'' (The Heart at Happiness).\n\n=== The Attack on Rue Plumet ===\n\n\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\" is a three-part song, the first part of which plays in only two recordings: a long version in the 1980 Original French recording and a much-shortened version only on the Complete Symphonic Recording and added into the beginning of \"The Attack on Rue Plumet\". The second is best known and is played in all recordings while the third is again more important for plot than music. On the London Original Cast recording, it is called the \"Plumet Attack\". \u00c9ponine, bringing Marius to Valjean's house to see Cosette, stumbles upon her father Th\u00e9nardier and his gang [[Patron-Minette]], made up of Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse, preparing to rob the house; \u00c9ponine screams, dispersing the robbers, while Valjean is led to believe that Javert or his minions have discovered his whereabouts at last, and so prepares to leave at once with Cosette. It is one of the lesser-known songs of the musical, yet serves as an important plot point. Interestingly, the large majority of this song's music is not heard anywhere else in the musical.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 The first part of the song figures as ''Voil\u00e0 le soir qui tombe'' (Behold, The Night Falls), which lasts over a minute and a half and actually occurs between \"In My Life\" and \"A Heart Full of Love\". It is sung solo by \u00c9ponine and warns Marius about the planned break-in. The second part did not figure on the recording, but was used as a purely instrumental piece in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le casse de la rue {{Not a typo|Plumet}}'' (The Break-In of Rue Plumet).\n\n=== One Day More ===\n\n{{main|One Day More}}\n\n\"One Day More\" is a choral piece with many solos: all of the main characters (except for Fantine and The Bishop - both of whom have died by this point) sing in it in a [[counterpoint]] style known as dramatic [[quodlibet]], as well as parts by the ensemble. It is the finale to Act 1. The song borrows themes from several songs from the first act.\n\nEach character sings his/her part to a different melody at the same time ([[counterpoint]]), before joining for the final chorus:\n\n* Valjean picks up the melody of \"Who Am I?\" without any changes (A major)\n* Marius, Cosette and \u00c9ponine sing to the melody of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" with \u00c9ponine taking the bridge (\"But the tigers come at night\", sung by \u00c9ponine as \"One more day all on my own\") and the other two taking a countermelody that is only instrumental in Fantine's solo. (A major, modulating to F# minor)\n* Enjolras repeats the bridge melody of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" with Marius singing the countermelody. (E\u266d major)\n* Javert sings to the already often-used theme from \"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\", \"Fantine's Arrest\" and \"The Robbery/Javert's Intervention\", only slower and in a major key. (A major)\n* The Th\u00e9nardiers sing to a slightly changed melody from \"Master of the House\" (A Major)\n* The revolutionaries repeat the bridge melody of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" with the countermelody. (A major)\n* At the end of the song, everyone sings the melody of \"Who Am I?\" (C major)\n\n'''Other uses'''\n\nThe song was used by [[Bill Clinton]] in his successful [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 campaign]] for the presidency of the United States.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1888965,00.html |title=Moral Philosophy: The Musical passes an unexpected milestone |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date=October 6, 2006}}</ref> Another version was used by Barack Obama supporters during his successful [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]] campaign.

It is slightly longer, finishing with a short solo from Valjean.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le grand jour'' (The Big Day).\n\n== Act II ==\n\n=== Upon These Stones&nbsp;\u2013 Building the Barricade ===\n\n\"Building the Barricade\" is the [[entr'acte]] of the musical and contains a new theme, which transitions into \u00c9ponine's appearance at the barricade, and her sung dialogue with Marius and later with Valjean as she passes to him a letter from Marius intended for Cosette. It is often cut out of recordings in part or completely. On the Complete Symphonic Recording, this song is mislabeled \"At the Barricade\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear on the recording, but was present in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La premi\u00e8re barricade'' (The First Barricade). The section where \u00c9ponine delivers the letter to Valjean is cut.\n\n=== On My Own ===\n\n{{main|On My Own (Les Mis\u00e9rables)}}\n\n\"On My Own\" is a [[solo (music)|solo]] part for [[\u00c9ponine]]. The refrain of the song is the same tune as that of ''\"Fantine's Death (Come to Me)\"'', although it adds a [[bridge (music)|bridge]] and the tune of the verses are different. Beginning in the key of D, [[modulation (music)|modulating]] to [[B-flat major|B\u266d]] (even though the song does not actually change key), then ending in F, this is her most important song.

(Hathaway would later go on to play [[Fantine]] in the 2012 film version of ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.)\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not figure, although the music was adapted from ''L'air de la mis\u00e8re'' (The Air of Misery), which was sung by Fantine about her misery and suffering. \u00c9ponine's solo was known as ''L'un vers l'autre'' (The One Toward the Other), bearing no resemblance.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Mon histoire'' (My Story).\n\n=== Upon These Stones&nbsp;\u2013 At the Barricade ===\n\n\"At the Barricade\", also called \"Back at the Barricade\", begins with an instrumental reprise of the \"Red and Black\" and a sung reprise of the \"Upon These Stones\" musical themes. It is also the first of the two times that a National Guardsmen sings a warning to the revolutionaries. On the Complete Symphonic Recording, this song is mislabeled \"Building the Barricade\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Sur la barricade'' (On the Barricade).\n\n=== Javert's Arrival ===\n\n\"Javert's Arrival\" or \"Javert's Return\" involves Javert's return to the barricade to report on the enemy's plans; however, he is interrupted by Gavroche's exposing him as a spy in \"Little People\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was a part of the stage show in similar form, but was not a part of the recording.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Je sais ce qui se trame'' (I Know What is Happening).\n\n=== Little People ===\n\n\"Little People\" begins as Gavroche proudly and merrily uncovers Javert's identity as an undercover police inspector.\n\n; Versions\nThe Original London Recording included a much longer version sung by Gavroche, sung in the first act, between \"Look Down\" and \"Red and Black\". This original version was related to Gavroche being able to be useful even though small, rather than the uncovering of Javert. For later versions of the musical, the song was halved to its current length. Gavroche's gleeful uncovering of Javert is sung to an entirely different melody, already used in the Original French Version and is much shorter, before leading to the musical bit that was left in.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La faute \u00e0 Voltaire'' (Voltaire's Fault) and is accompanied by a background choir. The chorus was taken directly from the novel.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''C'est la faute \u00e0...'' (It Is the Fault of...).\n\n=== A Little Fall of Rain ===\n\"A Little Fall of Rain\" is the song of [[\u00c9ponine]]'s death. \u00c9ponine, the eldest daughter of the Th\u00e9nardiers, she tells [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]] that she loves him and dies in his arms. Marius's reaction to her death in the musical is quite different from that in the novel; in the book, Marius does not really care much about \u00c9ponine, whereas in the musical they are portrayed as best friends, and he and his fellow students mourn her death, \"fighting in her name\", Marius being quite devastated by his best friend's death, even crying while holding her in his arms, and refusing to let go when his fellow students try to take her body away, and refusing the comfort of Enjolras, and continuing to cry over his best friend being gone forever. The title lyric is often misinterpreted; she thinks she is wet because of rain, Marius sees it's blood from her wound(s) that's \"everywhere\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Ce n'est rien'' (It is Nothing).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Un peu de sang qui pleure'' (A Little Blood that Weeps).\n\n=== Night of Anguish ===\n\n\"Night of Anguish\" is a musical interlude scene. The exact definition of this song and the following are hazy; sometimes the few lines following \u00c9ponine's death are named \"Night of Anguish\", sometimes it is the scene directly after the first attack that includes the dialogue between Valjean and Javert, that receives this name. In the 2012 film, this song following Eponine's death is omitted and replaced with a non-vocal musical interlude.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La nuit de l'angoisse'' (The Night of Anguish), which contains much of the same musical material, appears much earlier on the concept recording, and is about the revolutionaries' lamentation of their predicament. It also includes material that would later be used in \"Drink with Me\".\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The First Attack ===\n\n\"The First Attack\" begins as a largely instrumental number with only some short lines of singing; there also several lines shouted by revolutionaries during the attack. Depending on the definition of the song, it includes the scene in which Valjean sets Javert free. This scene, even though musically relatively uninteresting, is very important for the plot.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''L'aube du 6 juin'' (Dawn of June 6) on the recording, but was revised for the stage show into musical sections still present in the English version.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La premi\u00e8re attaque'' (The First Attack).\n\n=== Drink with Me ===\n\n\"Drink with Me\" is the revolutionaries' mellow song as night falls and they await their enemy's retaliation.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 One stanza of it can be found in the song ''La nuit de l'angoisse'' (The Night of Anguish).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Souviens-toi des jours pass\u00e9s'' (Remember the Past Days).\n\n=== Bring Him Home ===\nValjean begs God to save and return Marius to Cosette. In a documentary on the [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] of the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|film adaptation]], [[Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg]] revealed that the song was written specifically for [[Colm Wilkinson]].<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Sch\u00f6nberg, Claude-Michel| title = The West End Connection| medium = Blu-ray Disc | publisher = Universal Studios}}</ref>\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Comme un homme'' (Like a Man).\n* 1999 Spanish Cathedral Version&nbsp;- This song is known as ''S\u00e1lvalo'' (Save him).\n\n=== Dawn of Anguish ===\n\n\"Dawn of Anguish\" is another minor interlude in which Enjolras and the revolutionaries come to the realisation that the people of Paris are not joining their revolution. Without the masses rising up to support them, they accept that the uprising's failure is inevitable and so Enjolras tells all the women and fathers of children to return to their homes, since they will only die if they remain at the barricades.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n* 1999 Spanish Cathedral Version&nbsp;- This song never appeared and was never mentioned.\n\n=== The Second Attack ===\n\n\"The Second Attack\" or \"Death of Gavroche\"  is important to the plot. Gavroche runs into the enemy line of fire to retrieve ammunition for the revolutionaries, but is killed during a reprise of his \"Little People\" solo.\n\nJames Fenton had written another song for Gavroche's death, called \"Ten Little Bullets\", using the melody of Gavroche's solo in \"Look Down\".<ref name=\"The complete book of Les Mis\u00e9rables\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&printsec=frontcover&q=|title=The Complete Book of Les Miserables|first=Edward|last=Behr|year=1993|publisher= Arcade Publishing|isbn= 978-1-55970-156-3}}</ref> The song did not make it past recordings, probably not even there. Only the Broadway Revival version restarted using it in 2006.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''La mort de Gavroche'' (The Death of Gavroche).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Final Battle ===\n\n\"The Final Battle\" is a mostly instrumental number, often omitted from recordings. It repeats the first [[Bar (music)|bar]] of the theme from \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" with some variations and key changes, before erupting into a final reprise of the \"Red and Black\" theme, ending on a discordant chord instead of the major chord of that theme.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Sewers / Dog Eats Dog ===\n\"The Sewers\" is mostly a lengthy completely instrumental reprise of \"Bring Him Home\", though it also incorporates \"Dog Eats Dog\", a solo performed by Th\u00e9nardier. In it, Th\u00e9nardier describes his robbing the dead bodies from the battle at the barricades and justifies his actions by saying that somebody has to \"clean them up...as a service to the town\". He also declares that God is dead and that the only thing looking down from the heavens is the \"[[Full moon#Harvest moon|harvest moon]]\". It is one of the darkest songs of the musical.\n\nThe song was notably absent in the 2012 film adaptation, which instead contained a shorter chase-action sequence, scored primarily to \"Look Down\", in its place. The omission of the song allows Th\u00e9nardier's character in the film to remain somewhat comical, though he is still shown in the sewers robbing dead bodies.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Fureurs cannibales'' (Cannibal Frenzy).\n\n=== Javert's Suicide ===\n\n\"Javert's Suicide\" is the second and last chief song performed solely by Javert. It is preceded by a repeat of the beginning of \"The Confrontation\" theme (which is sometimes cut from recordings or incorporated into \"The Sewers\"), in which Valjean asks Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a hospital, a request to which Javert, this time, agrees. After Valjean leaves, Javert contemplates the paradox of hunting the man who has spared him his life; he proceeds to jump to his death in the river. The song is instrumentally an exact reprise of Valjean's Soliloquy, though sung by Javert with changed lyrics. Part of an instrumental from Stars is heard at the end of song as he is falling.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Noir ou blanc'' (Black or White).\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Le suicide de Javert'' (Javert's Suicide).\n\n=== Turning ===\n\nIn \"Turning\", the women of Paris mourn the loss of the students and their own hopeless cycles of childbirth and misery. It is set to the melody of \"Lovely Ladies\". It is also the only song in the musical not sung by a major character.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Tourne, tourne'' (Turn, Turn).\n\n=== Empty Chairs at Empty Tables ===\n\n\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\" is a [[solo (music)|solo]] sung by the character [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]], who is mourning the death of all of his friends who were killed at the barricade. Part of it is to the tune of \"The Bishop of Digne\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Seul devant ces tables vides'' (Alone in Front of These Empty Tables).\n\n=== Every Day ===\n\n\"Every Day\" or \"Marius and Cosette\" is a two-part song sung by Cosette, Marius and Valjean. The second part is often known as \"A Heart Full of Love (Reprise)\". Gillenormand sings part of the song in the 2012 film.\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, but identical music sections were present in a former exchange between Marius and the Gillenormands in the stage show.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== Valjean's Confession ===\n\n\"Valjean's Confession\" is sung by Valjean and Marius. Though important for the plot, the music is more important as an introduction to \"Who Am I?\".\n\n''' French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''L'aveu de Jean Valjean'' (Jean Valjean's Confession) and was much longer. It explains Valjean's motives more clearly. When Marius asks why Valjean confesses to him, Valjean explains that his conscience will not let him rest until he has done so. Valjean asks Marius if it would be better if he (Valjean) did not see Cosette again and Marius says that he thinks so. This fits much better with the description in the book.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song was cut from the recording.\n\n=== The Wedding ===\n\n\"The Wedding\" is a very brief song, also known as the \"Wedding Chorale\", and is sung by the guests on Cosette and Marius's wedding. The second part is a dialogue-heavy song that is often abridged or cut, sung by Marius and the Th\u00e9nardiers. This part is sometimes called \"The Waltz of Treachery (Reprise)\" as it is sung to a similar melody.\n\n''' French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 The first part of this song is known as ''Le mariage: soyez heureux'' (The Marriage: Be Happy). It was longer than all other versions, featuring an additional refrain. The second part is known as ''Marchandage et r\u00e9v\u00e9lation'' (Bargaining and Revelation), where it is more than only slightly longer. It included another subplot from the book. Here, Th\u00e9nardier first tries to shock Marius with the revelation that Valjean is an ex-convict, which Marius already knows. When Th\u00e9nardier says that Valjean is also a murderer, Marius claims to know that as well. He believes Valjean to have killed both Javert (on the barricade) and a certain M. Madeleine, a rich factory owner. Th\u00e9nardier proves to him (with the help of newspaper clippings), that Javert committed suicide and that Madeleine and Valjean are the same person&nbsp;\u2013 Marius's false source of information is unknown&nbsp;\u2013 and then tells him about the sewers.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Sonnez, sonnez'' (Ring, Ring).\n\n=== Beggars at the Feast ===\n\n\"Beggars at the Feast\" is the second big musical number sung by the Th\u00e9nardiers, in which they proclaim how through their treacherous ways they always manage to come out on top before waving the audience goodbye with the mocking line \"When we're rich as Croesus, Jesus, won't we see you all in hell\". It is a reprise of the \"Master of the House\" theme.\n\n'''French Versions''''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Mendiants \u00e0 la f\u00eate'' (Beggars at the Party).\n\n== Epilogue ==\n\n=== Valjean's Death ===\n\n\"Valjean's Death\" is the penultimate (or last, depending on the song organization) musical number in ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''. This and the \"Finale\", into which it flows without pause, are sometimes counted as one song. The combination is often known as \"The Epilogue\" (as the musical also has a Prologue). Fantine and \u00c9ponine come to welcome him into salvation. \"Valjean's Death\" borrows the tune from \"Fantine's Death\" and \"On My Own\", and towards the end, \"Bring Him Home\".\n\n'''French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''\u00c9pilogue: la lumi\u00e8re'' (Epilogue: The Light). Fantine and Eponine do not appear, as the song ends alternatively with Valjean emploring Cosette and Marius to love and cherish each other, before he peacefully passes away.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Final: c'est pour demain'' (Finale: It is For Tomorrow).\n\n=== Finale ===\n\n\"The Finale\", also known as \"Do You Hear the People Sing? (Reprise)\", is the last song in the musical; it is often incorporated with \"Valjean's Death\" into a single track on recordings, simply entitled \"Epilogue\".\n\n''' French Versions'''\n\n* 1980 Original French Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song did not appear, instead ending with Valjean's Death.\n* 1991 Parisian Revival Version&nbsp;\u2013 This song is known as ''Final: c'est pour demain'' (Finale: It is For Tomorrow).\n\n== Song appearances in recordings ==\n'''Key'''\n{{Plainlist}}\n*[[File:Yes check.svg|15px|Yes]]&nbsp;\u2013 All or almost all of song included\n*[[File:Check.svg|15px|Partially]]&nbsp;\u2013 Part of song included\n*[[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]&nbsp;\u2013 Song excluded\n{{Endplainlist}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The murder leads to the discovery of the dumping ground for victims of Masucci's crime syndicate. As they re-arrest the mob boss, his grieving sister supports her brother in court by putting up the money for his bail. However, within hours of leaving the courtroom, Frank Masucci is killed by an unknown hitman.

It is the second [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] line to be built in [[Singapore]]. The {{convert|57.2|km|mi}} line is the longest on the MRT network, with 35 stations, 8 of which (from [[Lavender MRT station|Lavender]] to [[Tiong Bahru MRT station|Tiong Bahru]] and [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi Airport]] stations) are below ground.<ref name=lta-ewl>{{cite web |url=http://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/public-transport/projects/east-west-line.html |title=East-West Line |publisher=[[Land Transport Authority]] |location= Singapore |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> The line is coloured green on the rail map. \n\nConstructed and opened as part of the [[North South MRT line|North South line]] (NSL) in the early stages of development, the East West line is formed after the opening of the eastern extension to [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]] in 1989. Nevertheless, till today, both lines used identical [[Railway signal|signalling]] equipment and [[rolling stock]]. The EWL signalling systems have been upgraded along with the NSL and is the second line to have its signalling upgraded completely, converting it from semi-automatic to fully automated operations.\n\n==Overview==\n\n<mapframe text=\"Location of East West MRT line\" width=520 height=200 zoom=11 latitude=1.32515 longitude=103.81187>\n{\n  \"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n  \"service\": \"geoline\",\n  \"ids\": \"Q1895425\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"stroke\": \"#009645\",\n    \"stroke-width\": 6\n  }\n}\n</mapframe>\n\nAs its name implies, the East West line connects central Singapore to both eastern and western parts of the island, with an additional branch between [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi Airport]] and [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]], which operates as a separate shuttle service. Some stations are commonly placed at the middle of the roads such as [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]], [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Queenstown MRT station|Queenstown]], [[Commonwealth MRT station|Commonwealth]], [[Dover MRT station|Dover]], [[Clementi MRT station|Clementi]], [[Pioneer MRT station|Pioneer]], [[Joo Koon MRT station|Joo Koon]], [[Gul Circle MRT station|Gul Circle]], [[Tuas Crescent MRT station|Tuas Crescent]] and [[Tuas West Road MRT station|Tuas West Road]]. The line runs mostly on overhead viaducts but goes underground in the city area between [[Kallang MRT station|Kallang]] and [[Redhill MRT station|Redhill]], [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]] and [[Kembangan MRT station|Kembangan]], and between [[Expo MRT station|Expo]] and [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi Airport]]. Travelling from one end of the line to the other takes about 78 minutes.\n\nThe East West line was constructed alongside [[North South MRT line|North South line]]; as such, both lines used identical [[Railway signal|signalling]] equipment and [[rolling stock]].\n\n==History==\nThe first segment of what will be the East West line, between [[City Hall MRT station|City Hall]] to [[Outram Park MRT station|Outram Park]] stations, was opened on 12 December 1987 as part of the North South line.<ref>{{Cite

They are: The [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151|C151,]] the oldest rolling stock which was introduced in tandem with the opening of the line in 1987, along with the [[Siemens C651|C651]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & Nippon Sharyo C751B|C751B]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Qingdao Sifang C151A|C151A]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Qingdao Sifang C151B|C151B]] which were introduced in the later years. These models of rolling stock were introduced to boost the capacity on both the North South and the East West lines in order to cope with increasing ridership.\n\nThe East West Line and the North South Line utilized identical rolling stock up until the recent years, when the C151A was temporary suspended from operating on the North South Line between January 2012 and November 2013 following the 2011 Train Disruptions. The C151B, which was introduced in April 2017, did not begin revenue service on the full-stretch of the EWL until the line's trial of the CBTC signalling system in May 2018.

Some stations are commonly placed at the middle of the roads such as [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]], [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Queenstown MRT station|Queenstown]], [[Commonwealth MRT station|Commonwealth]], [[Dover MRT station|Dover]], [[Clementi MRT station|Clementi]], [[Pioneer MRT station|Pioneer]], [[Joo Koon MRT station|Joo Koon]], [[Gul Circle MRT station|Gul Circle]], [[Tuas Crescent MRT station|Tuas Crescent]] and [[Tuas West Road MRT station|Tuas West Road]]. The line runs mostly on overhead viaducts but goes underground in the city area between [[Kallang MRT station|Kallang]] and [[Redhill MRT station|Redhill]], [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]] and [[Kembangan MRT station|Kembangan]], and between [[Expo MRT station|Expo]] and [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi Airport]]. Travelling from one end of the line to the other takes about 78 minutes.\n\nThe East West line was constructed alongside [[North South MRT line|North South line]]; as such, both lines used identical [[Railway signal|signalling]] equipment and [[rolling stock]].\n\n==History==\nThe first segment of what will be the East West line, between [[City Hall MRT station|City Hall]] to [[Outram Park MRT station|Outram Park]] stations, was opened on 12 December 1987 as part of the North South line.<ref>{{Cite

The [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CRRC Qingdao Sifang C151C|C151C]], which was introduced in September 2018, is currently operating on the North South Line only.\n\nThe [[Bombardier Movia CR151|CR151]], will arrive in batches from 2021 and will gradually replace the first-generation C151 trains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2018/7/2/bombardier-to-supply-66-new-trains-for-north-south-and-east-west-lines.html|title=LTA {{!}} News Room {{!}} News Releases {{!}} Bombardier to Supply 66 New Trains for North-South and East-West Lines|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-fleet-to-replace-66-oldest-mrt-trains-from-2021-10561652|title=New fleet to replace 66 oldest MRT trains from 2021|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/bombardier-awarded-12-billion-contract-to-replace-66-oldest-mrt-trains|title=Bombardier awarded $1.2 billion contract to replace 66 oldest MRT trains|last=hermesauto|date=2018-07-25|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThese trains operate from the three depots along the line, the [[Ulu Pandan Depot]] between [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East]] and [[Clementi MRT station|Clementi]], the [[Changi Depot]] near [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]] and the [[Tuas Depot]] located near [[Tuas Link MRT station|Tuas Link.]]\n\n==Train control==\n[[File:C151 tnm cgl.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Half-Platform Screen Doors installed in Tanah Merah station]]\nThe East West line is currently equipped with [[Thales Rail Signalling Solutions|Thales]] [[SelTrac]] [[Communications-based train control]] (CBTC) [[moving block]] signalling system<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/press-release/thales-awarded-signalling-contracts-singapore-north-south-east-west-lines-and-tuas|title=Thales awarded signalling contracts for Singapore North-South, East-West lines and Tuas West Extension {{!}} Thales Group|website=www.thalesgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820160452/https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/press-release/thales-awarded-signalling-contracts-singapore-north-south-east-west-lines-and-tuas|archive-date=20 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> with [[Automatic train control]] (ATC) under [[Automatic train operation]] (ATO) GoA 3 (DTO).<ref>http://www.uitp.org/sites/default/files/Metro%20automation%20-%20facts%20and%20figures.pdf</ref> The subsystems consist of [[Automatic train protection]] (ATP) to govern train speed, NetTrac MT Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and a [[Computer-based interlocking]] (CBI) system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/content/thales-awarded-signalling-contracts-singapore-north-south-east-west-lines-and-tuas-west |title= Thales awarded signalling contracts for Singapore North-South, East-West lines and Tuas West Extension |date= 6 February 2012 |publisher= Thales Group |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150630183155/https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/content/thales-awarded-signalling-contracts-singapore-north-south-east-west-lines-and-tuas-west |archivedate= 30 June 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe old signalling system has undergone decommissioning work from August 2018 and was completed on 23 November 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-signalling-system-trial-ewl-mrt-10169938|title=New MRT signalling system to be trialled on EWL for 5 Sundays from Apr 29|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}</ref>  It consists of [[Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd|Westinghouse]] [[Railway Signalling|fixed block signalling system]] with [[Automatic train control]] (ATC) under [[Automatic train operation]] (ATO) GoA 2 (STO).

As the section of track between Pioneer and Joo Koon support 'mixed-mode' of both signalling systems, trains terminating at either Joo Koon or Tuas Link would have to change signalling modes at [[Pioneer MRT station]] as trains terminating at Joo Koon would proceed to a turn back siding which was built as part of the TWE which only supports the new signalling system. Eastbound trains towards Pasir Ris would have to change back to the old signalling system at Pioneer MRT station. This procedure was removed after the [[Joo Koon rail accident|train collision at Joo Koon]] as trains terminated at Joo Koon. The new signalling system became fully operational on 28 May 2018.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAutomatic full-height [[platform screen doors]] by Westinghouse were originally installed in all underground stations since opening, and half-height [[platform screen doors]] by ST Engineering's Electronics sector were installed by August 2011 on elevated stations.
