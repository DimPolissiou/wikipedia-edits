After [[John Wycliffe]]{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, the theorist of ecclesiastical reform, Hus is considered the second church reformer, as he lived before [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]].{{refn|group=note|name=first|The dates of birth of these five are: Wycliffe, 1330. Hus, c.1372, Luther, 1483, Zwingli, 1484,  and Calvin, 1509.}} His teachings had a strong influence on the states of Western Europe, most immediately in the approval of a reformed [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] [[Christian denomination|religious denomination]], and, over a century later, on [[Martin Luther]]. Hus was a master, dean, and rector at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].\n\nJan Hus was born in [[Husinec (Prachatice District)|Husinec]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] to poor parents. In order to escape poverty, Hus trained for the priesthood. At an early age he traveled to [[Prague]], where he supported himself by singing and serving in churches. His conduct was positive and, reportedly, his commitment to his studies was remarkable. After earning a bachelor of arts degree and being ordained as a priest, Hus began to preach in Prague. He opposed many aspects of the Catholic Church in Bohemia, such as their views on [[ecclesiology]], [[simony]], the [[Eucharist]], and other theological topics.\n\nWhen [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] was elected as a pope, he was persuaded to side with Bohemian church authorities against Hus and his disciples. He issued a [[Papal bull]] that excommunicated Hus; however, it was not enforced, and Hus continued to preach. Hus then spoke out against Alexander V successor [[Antipope John XXIII]], for his selling of indulgences. Hus's excommunication was then reinforced, and he spent the next two years living in exile. When the [[Council of Constance]] assembled, Hus was asked to be there and present his views on the dissension within the church. When he arrived, he was immediately arrested and put in prison. He was eventually taken in front of the council and asked to recant his views. He replied, \"I would not for a chapel of gold retreat from the truth!\". When he refused, he was put back in prison. On July 6, 1415, he was [[Burned at the stake#Historical usage|burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]] against the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Catholic Church]]. He could be heard singing Psalms as he was burning.\n\nAfter Hus was executed, the followers of his religious teachings (known as [[Hussite]]s) refused to elect another Catholic monarch and defeated five consecutive papal [[crusades]] between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the [[Hussite Wars]]. Both the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] and the [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravian]] populations remained majority [[Hussite]] until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the [[Battle of the White Mountain]] resulted in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] coming under [[Habsburg]] dominion for the next 300 years and being subject to immediate and forced conversion in an intense [[Counter-Reformation|campaign]] of return to Catholicism.\n\n==Early life==\nThe exact date of Hus's birth is disputed. Some claim he was born around 1369,{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=40}} while others claim he was born sometime between 1373 and 1375.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=64}} The \"oldest  chiken\" state the latter,{{sfn|Gillett|1863|p=43}} but more contemporary research states that 1372 is more likely.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=64}} The belief that he was born on July 6, also his deathday, has no factual basis and is likely a myth.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=64}} Hus was born in Husinec, to peasant parents.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=65}} We know that Hus took his name from the village where he lived (Husinec). Why Hus did not take the name of his father is up to speculation; some believe that it was because Hus did not know his father, while other say it was simply the custom at the time.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|p=44}} Nearly all other information we have about Hus's very early life is either myth or completely unreliable.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=43\u201344}} Similarly, we know little of Hus's family. His father's name was Michael; his mother's name is unknown. We know that Hus had a brother due to him expressing concerns for his nephew while awaiting execution at Constance. Whether or not Hus had any other family is unknown.{{sfn|Fudge|2010|p=9}}\n\nAt the age of roughly 10, Hus was sent away to a monastery. Again, the exact reason is not known; some claim his father had died,{{sfn|Gilpin|1809|p=141}} other say he simply went due to his devoutness.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=44\u201345}} He impressed the teachers with his studies, and they recommended that he move to [[Prague]], one of the largest cities in Bohemia at the time. Hus apparently supported himself by securing a job with someone in Prague,{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=46\u201348}} which allowed him access to food, shelter, clothing, and the Prague Library.\n\n3 years later,{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=47\u201350}} he was admitted to the [[Charles University of Prague|University of Prague]]. Though he was not an exceptional student, he was said to have pursued his studies with ferocity.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|pp=70\u201371}} In 1393, Hus earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at the University of Prague, and he earned his master's degree in 1396.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=40}} The strongly anti-papal views that were held by many of the professors there likely influenced Hus's future work.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|pp=73\u201376}}\n\n==Career==\nHus began teaching at the university in 1398 and in 1399, he first publicly defended propositions of Wycliffe.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=40}} In 1401, his students and faculty promoted him to dean of the philosophical department, and a year later, he became a  [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Prague. He was appointed a preacher at the newly built Bethlehem Chapel the same year. Hus was a strong advocate for the Czechs and the [[Philosophical realism|Realists]], and he was influenced by the writings of [[John Wycliffe]]. Although church authorities banned many works of Wycliffe in 1403, Hus translated ''Trialogus'' into [[Czech language|Czech]] and helped to distribute it.{{sfn|Wilhelm|1910}}[[File:Hus na kazatelne.jpg|thumb|left|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]\n\nHus denounced the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=76\u201378}} Archbishop [[Zbyn\u011bk Zaj\u00edc]] tolerated this, and even appointed Hus a preacher at the clergy's biennial synod. On June 24, 1405, [[Pope Innocent VII]] directed the Archbishop to counter Wycliffe's teachings, especially the doctrine of [[impanation]] in the [[Eucharist]]. The archbishop complied by issuing a [[synod]] decree against Wycliffe, as well as forbidding any further attacks on the clergy.{{sfn|Wilhelm|1910}}\n\nIn 1406, two Bohemian students brought to Prague a document bearing the seal of the [[University of Oxford]] and praising Wycliffe. Hus proudly read the document from his pulpit. Then, in 1408, [[Pope Gregory XII]] warned Archbishop Zajic that the Church in Rome had been informed of Wycliffe's heresies and of the sympathies of King [[Wenceslaus IV]] for non-conformists.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=140-141}} In response, the king and university ordered all of Wycliffe's writings surrendered to the archdiocesan chancery for correction. Hus obeyed, declaring that he condemned the errors in those writings.{{sfn|Hus|1372\u20131415|p=69}}\n\n===Papal Schism===\nIn 1408, the [[Charles University in Prague]] was divided by the [[Western Schism]], in which Gregory XII in Rome and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] in [[Avignon]] both claimed the papacy. Wenceslaus felt Gregory XII might interfere with his plans to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. He denounced Gregory, ordered the clergy in Bohemia to observe a strict neutrality in the schism, and said that he expected the same of the University. Archbishop Zaj\u00edc remained faithful to Gregory. At the University, only the scholars of the Bohemian \"nation\" (one of the four governing sections), with Hus as their leader, vowed neutrality.<ref>Oscar Kuhns and Robert Dickie, ''Jan Hus: Reformation in Bohemia'' (Morrisville, NC: Lulu, 2017), 67-70. books.google.com/books?id=3r4yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA67 {{ISBN|9781872556291}}</ref>\n\n====Kutn\u00e1 Hora Decree====\n[[File:Jan Hus-Bible Martinicka.jpg|thumb|The oldest known representation of Jan Hus is from Martinick\u00e1 bible.]]\n{{see|Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora}}\nIn January 1409, [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]] summoned representatives of the four nations comprising the university to the Czech city of [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]] to demand statements of allegiance. The Czech nation agreed, but the other three nations declined. The king then decreed that the Czech nation would have three votes in University affairs, while the \"German nation\" (composed of the former [[Bavaria]]n, [[Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Poland|Polish]] nations) would have one vote in total. As a consequence of the changed voting, by May 1409 the German dean and rector were deposed and replaced by Czechs. The [[Rupert, King of Germany|Palatine Elector]] called the Germans to his own University of Heidelberg, while the [[William II, Margrave of Meissen|Margrave of Meissen]] started a new [[University of Leipzig|university]] in Leipzig. It is estimated that over one thousand students and masters left Prague. The emigrants also spread accusations of Bohemian heresy.{{sfn|Fudge|2010|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\n====Antipope Alexander V====\nIn 1409, the [[Council of Pisa]] tried to end the schism by electing [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as Pope, but Gregory and Benedict did not submit. (Alexander was declared an \"[[antipope]]\" by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1418.) Hus, his followers, and Wenceslaus IV transferred their allegiance to Alexander V. Under pressure from king Wenceslaus IV, Archbishop Zaj\u00edc did the same. Zaj\u00edc then lodged an accusation of \"ecclesiastical disturbances\" against Wycliffites in Prague with Alexander V.\n\nOn 20 December 1409, Alexander V issued a [[papal bull]] that empowered the Archbishop to proceed against Wycliffism in Prague. All copies of Wycliffe's writings were to be surrendered and his doctrines repudiated, and free preaching discontinued. After the publication of the bull in 1410, Hus appealed to Alexander V, but in vain. The Wycliffe books and valuable manuscripts were burned, and Hus and his adherents were [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by Alexander V.\n\n====Crusade against Naples====\nAlexander V died in 1410, and was succeeded by [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (also later declared an antipope). In 1411,  John XXIII proclaimed a [[crusade]] against King [[Ladislaus of Naples]], the protector of rival [[Pope Gregory XII]]. This crusade was preached in Prague as well. John XXIII also authorized [[indulgence]]s to raise money for the war. Priests urged the people on and these crowded into churches to give their offerings. This traffic in indulgences was to some a sign of the corruption of the church needing remediation.{{citation needed|reason=The anti-church?|date=July 2012}}\n\n====Condemnation of indulgences and Crusade====\n[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|right|Hus by an unknown artist, 16th century]]\nArchbishop Zaj\u00edc died in 1411, and with his death the [[Bohemian Reformation|religious movement in Bohemia]] entered a new phase, during which the disputes concerning [[indulgences]] assumed great importance. Hus spoke out against indulgences, but he could not carry with him the men of the university. In 1412, a dispute took place, on which occasion Hus delivered his address ''Quaestio magistri Johannis Hus de indulgentiis''. It was taken literally from the last chapter of Wycliffe's book, ''De ecclesia'', and his treatise, ''De absolutione a pena et culpa''. Hus asserted that no Pope or bishop had the right to take up the sword in the name of the Church; he should pray for his enemies and bless those that curse him; man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money. The doctors of the theological faculty replied, but without success. A few days afterward, some of Hus's followers, led by Vok Voksa z Vald\u0161tejna, burnt the [[Papal bull]]s. Hus, they said, should be obeyed rather than the Church, which they considered a fraudulent mob of adulterers and [[Simony|Simonists]].{{sfn|Schaff|1953|pp=415-420}}\n\nIn response, three men from the lower classes who openly called the indulgences a fraud were beheaded. They were later considered the first martyrs of the [[Hussite]] Church. In the meantime, the faculty had condemned the forty-five articles and added several other theses, deemed heretical, which had originated with Hus. The king forbade the teaching of these articles, but neither Hus nor the university complied with the ruling, requesting that the articles should be first proven to be un-scriptural. The tumults at Prague had stirred up a sensation; papal legates and Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newschaffherzog26haucgoog|quote=Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.|title=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge: Embracing Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology and Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Biography from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|last=Herzog|first=Johann Jakob|last2=Hauck|first2=Albert|last3=Jackson|first3=Samuel Macauley|last4=Sherman|first4=Charles Colebrook|last5=Gilmore|first5=George William|date=1909|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newschaffherzog26haucgoog/page/n438 416]|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Attempts at reconciliation====\nKing Wenceslaus IV made efforts to harmonize the opposing parties. In 1412, he convoked the heads of his kingdom for a consultation and, at their suggestion, ordered a [[synod]] to be held at [[\u010cesk\u00fd Brod]] on 2 February 1412. It did not take place there, but in the palace of the archbishops at Prague, in order to exclude Hus from participation. Propositions were made to restore peace in the Church. Hus declared that Bohemia should have the same freedom in regard to ecclesiastical affairs as other countries <!-- what other countries?? --> and that approbation and condemnation should therefore be announced only with the permission of the state power. This was the doctrine of Wycliffe (''Sermones'', iii. 519, etc.).\n\nThere followed treatises from both parties, but no harmony was obtained. \"Even if I should stand before the stake which has been prepared for me,\" Hus wrote at the time, \"I would never accept the recommendation of the theological faculty.\" The synod did not produce any results, but the King ordered a commission to continue the work of reconciliation. The doctors of the university demanded approval of their conception of the Church, according to which the Pope is the head, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] are the body of the Church, from Hus and his followers. Hus protested vigorously. The Hussite party seems to have made a great effort toward reconciliation. To the article that the Roman Church must be obeyed, they added only \"so far as every pious Christian is bound\".{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=75}} Stanislav ze Znojma and \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n P\u00e1le\u010d protested against this addition and left the convention; they were exiled by the king, with two others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==== Hus leaves Prague and appeals to Jesus Christ ====\nBy this time, Hus's ideas had become widely accepted in Bohemia, and there was broad resentment against the Church hierarchy. The attack on Hus by the Pope and Archbishop caused riots in parts of Bohemia. King Wenceslaus IV and his government took the side of Hus, and the power of his adherents increased from day to day. Hus continued to preach in the [[Bethlehem Chapel]]. The churches of the city were put under the ban, and the [[interdict]] was pronounced against [[Prague]]. To protect the city, Hus left and went into the countryside, where he continued to preach and write.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|pp=77-78}}\n\nBefore Hus left Prague, he decided to take a step which gave a new dimension to his endeavors. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an ineffective Council. On October 18, 1412, he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church.<ref name=ap>{{cite web |title=Magistri Ioannis Hus appelatio ad supremum iudicem |trans-title=Master John Hus, appeal to the final judge |language=Latin, Czech |url=http://etfuk.sweb.cz/hus.htm |website=etfuk.sweb.cz |accessdate=23 July 2015}}{{self-published inline|date=July 2018}}{{psc|date=July 2018}}</ref> For the [[Bohemian Reformation]], this step was as significant as the [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 theses]] posted in Wittenberg by Martin Luther in 1517.\n\nAfter Hus left Prague for the country, he realized what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation on one hand, and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care on the other.{{sfn|Nodl|2010|pp=530-531}} Therefore, he started to write many texts in Czech, such as basics of the Christian faith or preachings, intended mainly for the priests whose knowledge of Latin was poor.{{sfn|\u0160mahel|2013|p=143}}\n\n====Writings of Hus and Wycliffe====\nOf the writings occasioned by these controversies, those of Hus on the Church, entitled ''De Ecclesia'', were written in 1413 and have been most frequently quoted and admired or criticized, and yet their first ten chapters are but an epitome of Wycliffe's work of the same title, and the following chapters are but an abstract of another of Wycliffe's works (''De potentate papae'') on the power of the Pope. Wycliffe had written his book to oppose the common position that the Church consisted primarily of the clergy, and Hus now found himself making the same point.

Hus wrote his treatises and preached in the neighborhood of Koz\u00ed Hr\u00e1dek. Bohemian Wycliffism was carried into Poland, Hungary, [[Croatia]], and Austria. But in January 1413, a general council in Rome condemned the writings of Wycliffe and ordered them to be burned.<ref>{{cite book |title=Church Schism & Corruption |last=Maseko |first=Achim Nkosi |publisher=Lulu |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4092-2186-9 |pages= }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{self-published source|date=July 2018}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Council of Constance===\nKing Wenceslaus's brother [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], who was \"[[King of the Romans]]\" (that is, head of the Holy Roman Empire, though not then Emperor), and heir to the Bohemian crown, was anxious to put an end to religious dissension within the Church. To put an end to the papal schism and to take up the long desired reform of the Church, he arranged for a general council to convene on 1 November 1414, at [[Konstanz]] (Constance).{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=224-228}} The [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418) became the 16th ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church. Hus, willing to make an end of all dissensions, agreed to go to Constance, under Sigismund's promise of [[safe conduct]].{{sfn|Gillett|1863|p=464-466}}\n\n====Imprisonment and preparations for trial====\n[[File:Hus (Lessing 1842).jpg|thumb|280px|Jan Hus at the Council of Constance, 19th century painting by Karl Friedrich Lessing]]\n\nIt is not known whether Hus knew what his fate would be, but he made his [[last will and testament|will]] before setting out. He started on his journey on 11 October 1414, arriving in Constance on 3 November 1414. The following day, the bulletins on the church doors announced that Michal z N\u011bmeck\u00e9ho Brodu would be opposing Hus. In the beginning, Hus was at liberty, under his safe conduct from Sigismund, and lived at the house of a widow. But he continued celebrating Mass and preaching to the people, in violation of restrictions decreed by the Church. After a few weeks on 28 November 1414, his opponents succeeded in imprisoning him, on the strength of a rumor that he intended to flee. He was first brought into the residence of a canon and then, on 6 December 1414, into the prison of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery. Sigismund, as the guarantor of Hus's safety, was greatly angered and threatened the prelates with dismissal; however, the prelates convinced him that he could not be bound by promises to a heretic.{{sfn|Fudge|2010|pp=125-127}}\n\nOn 4 December 1414, John XXIII entrusted a committee of three bishops with a preliminary investigation against Hus. As was common practice, witnesses for the prosecution were heard, but Hus was not allowed an advocate for his defense. His situation became worse after the downfall of John XXIII, who had left Constance to avoid abdicating. Hus had been the captive of John XXIII and in constant communication with his friends, but now he was delivered to the bishop of Constance and brought to his castle, ''Gottlieben on the Rhine''. Here he remained for 73 days, separated from his friends, chained day and night, poorly fed, and ill.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Trial===\n\nOn 5 June 1415, he was tried for the first time, and was transferred to a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] monastery, where he spent the last weeks of his life. Extracts from his works were read, and witnesses were heard. He refused all formulae of submission, but declared himself willing to recant if his errors should be proven to him from the Bible. Hus conceded his veneration of Wycliffe, and said that he could only wish his soul might some time attain unto that place where Wycliffe's was. On the other hand, he denied having defended Wycliffe's doctrine of [[The Lord's Supper]] or the forty-five articles; he had only opposed their summary condemnation. King Sigismund admonished him to deliver himself up to the mercy of the Council, as he did not desire to protect a heretic.{{sfn|Shahan|1913|p=}}\n\nAt the last trial, on 8 June 1415, thirty-nine sentences were read to him, twenty-six of which had been excerpted from his book on the Church (''De ecclesia''), seven from his treatise against P\u00e1le\u010d (Contra Palecz), and six from that against Stanislav ze Znojma (''Contra Stanislaum''). The danger of some of these doctrines to worldly power was explained to Sigismund to incite him against Hus. Hus again declared himself willing to submit if he could be convinced of errors. This declaration was considered an unconditional surrender, and he was asked to confess:\n# that he had erred in the theses which he had hitherto maintained;\n# that he renounced them for the future;\n# that he recanted them; and\n# that he declared the opposite of these sentences.\n\nHe asked to be exempted from recanting doctrines which he had never taught; others, which the assembly considered erroneous, he was not willing to revoke; to act differently would be against his conscience. These words found no favorable reception. After the trial on 8 June, several other attempts were purportedly made to induce him to recant, which he resisted.<ref>Di Mauro, Dennis.

After the [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]] and Liturgy, Hus was led into the church. The [[Bishop of Lodi]] (then [[Giacomo Balardi Arrigoni]]) delivered an oration on the duty of eradicating heresy; various theses of Hus and Wycliffe and a report of his trial were then read.\n\nAn Italian prelate pronounced the sentence of condemnation upon Hus and his writings. Hus protested, saying that even at this hour he did not wish anything but to be convinced from Scripture. He fell upon his knees and asked God with a soft voice to forgive all his enemies. Then followed his degradation \u2014 he was dressed in priestly vestments and again asked to recant; again he refused. With curses, Hus's ornaments were taken from him, his priestly [[tonsure]] was destroyed, and the sentence of the Church was pronounced, stripping him of all rights, and he was delivered to secular authorities. Then a tall paper hat was put upon his head, with the inscription \"''[[Heresiarch|Haeresiarcha]]''\" (i.e., the leader of a heretical movement). Hus was led away to the stake under a strong guard of armed men.\n\n==Execution==\n[[File:Jan Hus at the Stake.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Jan Hus at the [[Death by burning|stake]], Jena codex (c. 1500)]]\nAt the place of execution, he knelt down, spread out his hands, and prayed aloud. The executioner undressed Hus and tied his hands behind his back with ropes, and bound his neck with a chain to a stake around which wood and straw had been piled up so that it covered him to the neck. At the last moment, the imperial marshal, von Pappenheim, in the presence of the [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Count Palatine]], asked Hus to recant and thus save his own life. Hus declined, stating:\n\n{{quote|God is my witness that the things charged against me I never preached. In the same truth of the Gospel which I have written, taught, and preached, drawing upon the sayings and positions of the holy doctors, I am ready to die today.{{sfn|Schaff|1915|p=257}}}}\n\nAnecdotally, it has been claimed that the executioners had trouble intensifying the fire. An old woman then came to the stake and threw a relatively small amount of [[:wikt:brushwood|brushwood]] on it. Upon seeing her act, a suffering Hus then exclaimed, \"''O Sancta Simplicitas!''\". The phrase's [[Czech language|Czech]] equivalent, \"''Svat\u00e1 prostota!''\" ([[Vocative case#Czech|vocative form]]: \"''Svat\u00e1 prostoto!''\", Translated \"''Holy simplicity!''\") is still used today when commenting on a person's foolish action coming from the belief that he or she is doing something righteous.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\nIt is said that when he was about to expire, he cried out, ''\"Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on us!\"'' (a variant of the [[Jesus Prayer]]). Hus's ashes were later thrown into the [[Rhine River]] as a means of preventing the veneration of his remains.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Hussite Wars===\n{{Main|Hussite Wars}}\n[[File:Jensky kodex Zizka.jpg|thumb|[[Jan \u017di\u017eka]] leading troops of Hussites]]\n[[File:Vrh\u00e1n\u00ed husit\u016f do \u0161achet.gif|thumb|Some two thousand of Hus's followers thrown into the [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]] mines by pro-Catholic townsmen]]\nResponding with horror to the execution of Hus, the people of Bohemia moved even more rapidly away from Papal teachings, provoking Rome to pronounce a [[crusade]] against them (1 March 1420): [[Pope Martin V]] issued a [[Papal bull]] authorizing the execution of all supporters of Hus and Wycliffe. King Wenceslaus IV died in August 1419 and his brother, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], was unable to establish a real government in Bohemia due to the Hussite revolt.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1914|pp=177-179}}\n\nThe Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia, and became a major military power. Under the leadership of [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]] (c. 1360 \u2013 1424) and later of [[Prokop the Great]] (c. 1380 \u2013 1434) \u2013 both  excellent commanders \u2013 the Hussites defeated the crusade and the other three crusades that followed (1419\u20131434). Fighting ended after a compromise between the Utraquist Hussites and the Catholic [[Council of Basel]] in 1436. It resulted in the [[Basel Compacts]], in which the Catholic Church officially allowed Bohemia to practice its own version of Christianity (Hussitism). A century later, as much as ninety percent of the inhabitants of the [[Czech Crown lands]] still followed Hussite teachings.\n\n===Hus's scholarship and teachings===\n[[File:Luther und Hus-Abendmahl.jpg|thumb|Luther and Hus serving [[Communion under both kinds]] together, picture from 16th-century Saxony demonstrating the affinity of Lutherans with Hussites]]\nHus left only a few reformatory writings in the proper sense of the word, most of his works being polemical treatises against Stanislav ze Znojma and \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n P\u00e1le\u010d. He translated Wycliffe's ''Trialogus'', and was very familiar with his works on the body of [[Jesus]], on the Church, on the power of the pope, and especially with his sermons. There are reasons to suppose that Wycliffe's doctrine of the Lord's Supper ([[consubstantiation]] rather than [[transubstantiation]]{{sfn|Lechler|1904|p=381}} had spread to Prague as early as 1399, with strong evidence that students returning from England had brought the work back with them. It gained an even wider circulation after it had been prohibited in 1403, and Hus preached and taught it, although it is possible that he simply repeated it without advocating it. But the doctrine was seized eagerly by the radical party, the [[Taborites]], who made it the central point of their system. According to their book, the Church is not the clerical hierarchy which was generally accepted as \u2018the Church;\u2019 the Church is the entire body of those who from eternity have been predestined for salvation. Christ, not the pope, is its head. It is no article of faith that one must obey the pope to be saved. Neither internal membership in the Church nor churchly offices and dignities are a surety that the persons in question are members of the true Church.\n\nTo some, Hus's efforts were predominantly designed to rid the Church of its ethical abuses, rather than a campaign of sweeping theological change. To others, the seeds of the Reformation are clear in Hus's and Wycliffe's writings. In explaining the plight of the average Christian in Bohemia, Hus wrote, \"One pays for confession, for mass, for the sacrament, for indulgences, for churching a woman, for a blessing, for burials, for funeral services and prayers. The very last penny which an old woman has hidden in her bundle for fear of thieves or robbery will not be saved. The villainous priest will grab it.\" (Macek, 16) After Hus's death, his followers, known as [[Hussite]]s, split off into several groups including the [[Utraquists]], [[Taborite]]s and [[Sirotci|Orphans]].\n\n===Apology of the Catholic Church===\nNearly six centuries later in 1999,  [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed \"deep regret for the cruel death inflicted\" on Hus and added \"deep sorrow\" for Hus's death and praised his \"moral courage\".<ref name=JohnLAllenJr />  Cardinal [[Miloslav Vlk]] of the Czech Republic was instrumental in crafting John Paul II's statement.<ref name=JohnLAllenJr>{{cite news |last=Allen Jr. |first=John L. |date=15 September 2009 |title=The German shepherd bids farewell to a 'wolf in winter' |url=http://ncronline.org/news/german-shepherd-bids-farewell-wolf-winter |website=National Catholic Reporter }}</ref>\n\n===Hus and Feminism===\nHus was also, unlike the vast majority of preachers at the time, an advocate for women and [[feminism]]. He believed women were given rights in the Bible. Hus stated that \"Women were made in the image of God and should fear no man.\"{{sfn|Peterson|Shreeves|2014|p=34}} He allowed women to preach and serve in battle, and they later fought in the Hussite wars.{{sfn|Peterson|Shreeves|2014|p=35}}\n\n===Hus and the Czech language===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nJan Hus introduced reforms to medieval [[Czech orthography]], including the \"hook\" ([[h\u00e1\u010dek]]) diacritic which was used to form the [[grapheme]]s {{angle bracket|\u010d}}, {{angle bracket|\u011b}}, {{angle bracket|\u0161}}, {{angle bracket|\u0159}} and {{angle bracket|\u017e}}, which replaced [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] like {{angle bracket|cz}}, {{angle bracket|ie}}, {{angle bracket|sch}}, {{angle bracket|rz}} and {{angle bracket|zs}}; the \"dot\" above letters for strong accent,{{clarify|date=October 2019}} as well as the acute accent to mark long vowels {{angle bracket|\u00e1}}, {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, {{angle bracket|\u00ed}}, {{angle bracket|\u00f3}}, and {{angle bracket|\u00fa}}, in order to represent each [[phoneme]] by a single [[grapheme|symbol]]. Some sources mention documented use of the special symbols in Bible translations (1462), the Schaffhausen Bible, and handwritten notes in the bible. The symbol {{angle bracket|\u016f}} (instead of {{angle bracket|uo}}) came later. The book ''Orthographia Bohemica'' (1406) may have been written by Jan Hus, or by another author from Charles University.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Jan Hus Statue and Tyn Church, Old Town Square, Prague - 8190.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Hus Memorial]] at [[Old Town Square (Prague)|Old Town Square]] in [[Prague]] built in 1915]]\nA century after the Hussite Wars began, as many as 90% of inhabitants of the [[Czech lands]] were Hussites (although in the [[Utraquist]] tradition following a joint Utraquist\u2014Catholic victory in the Hussite Wars).{{sfn|V\u00e1clav\u00edk|2010|p=53}} Although [[Czech Republic|Bohemia]] was the site of [[Hussites|one of the most significant pre-reformation movements]],<ref name=\"museeprotestant.org\">[http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/protestantism-in-the-republic-of-czechoslovakia/ Protestantism in Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic)]</ref> there are only few Protestant adherents remaining in modern times;<ref>{{cite web|language=cs |url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_1_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_municipality_size_groups/$File/PVCR071_ENG.pdf |title=Tab 7.1 Population by religious belief and by municipality size groups |publisher=Czso.cz |accessdate=2013-11-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184947/http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_1_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_municipality_size_groups/%24File/PVCR071_ENG.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|language=cs |url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_2_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_regions/$File/PVCR072_ENG.pdf |title=Tab 7.2 Population by religious belief and by regions |publisher=Czso.cz |accessdate=2013-11-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104224923/http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_2_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_regions/%24File/PVCR072_ENG.pdf |archivedate= 4 November 2013 }}</ref> mainly due to historical reasons such as persecution of Protestants by the [[Catholic]] [[Habsburgs]],<ref>{{cite book |isbn=978-0-470-29323-2 |first1=Hana |last1=Mastrini |title=Frommer's Prague & the Best of the Czech Republic |year=2008 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |pages= }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>  particularly after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620; restrictions during the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Communist rule]]; and also the ongoing [[secularization]].<ref name=\"museeprotestant.org\"/>\n\nJan Hus was a key contributor to [[Protestantism]], whose teachings had a strong influence on the states of Europe and on [[Martin Luther]].{{sfn|Oberman|Walliser-Schwarzbart|2006|pp=54\u201355}} The [[Hussite Wars]] resulted in the Basel Compacts which allowed for a reformed church in the Kingdom of Bohemia\u2014almost a century before such developments would take place in the Lutheran Reformation.

After [[John Wycliffe]]{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, the theorist of ecclesiastical reform, Hus is considered the second church reformer, as he lived before [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]].{{refn|group=note|name=first|The dates of birth of these five are: Wycliffe, 1330. Hus, c.1372, Luther, 1483, Zwingli, 1484,  and Calvin, 1509.}} His teachings had a strong influence on the states of Western Europe, most immediately in the approval of a reformed [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] [[Christian denomination|religious denomination]], and, over a century later, on [[Martin Luther]]. Hus was a master, dean, and rector at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].\n\nJan Hus was born in [[Husinec (Prachatice District)|Husinec]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] to poor parents. In order to escape poverty, Hus trained for the priesthood. At an early age he traveled to [[Prague]], where he supported himself by singing and serving in churches. His conduct was positive and, reportedly, his commitment to his studies was remarkable. After earning a bachelor of arts degree and being ordained as a priest, Hus began to preach in Prague. He opposed many aspects of the Catholic Church in Bohemia, such as their views on [[ecclesiology]], [[simony]], the [[Eucharist]], and other theological topics.\n\nWhen [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] was elected as a pope, he was persuaded to side with Bohemian church authorities against Hus and his disciples. He issued a [[Papal bull]] that excommunicated Hus; however, it was not enforced, and Hus continued to preach. Hus then spoke out against Alexander V successor [[Antipope John XXIII]], for his selling of indulgences. Hus's excommunication was then reinforced, and he spent the next two years living in exile. When the [[Council of Constance]] assembled, Hus was asked to be there and present his views on the dissension within the church. When he arrived, he was immediately arrested and put in prison. He was eventually taken in front of the council and asked to recant his views. He replied, \"I would not for a chapel of gold retreat from the truth!\". When he refused, he was put back in prison. On July 6, 1415, he was [[Burned at the stake#Historical usage|burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]] against the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Catholic Church]]. He could be heard singing Psalms as he was burning.\n\nAfter Hus was executed, the followers of his religious teachings (known as [[Hussite]]s) refused to elect another Catholic monarch and defeated five consecutive papal [[crusades]] between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the [[Hussite Wars]]. Both the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] and the [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravian]] populations remained majority [[Hussite]] until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the [[Battle of the White Mountain]] resulted in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] coming under [[Habsburg]] dominion for the next 300 years and being subject to immediate and forced conversion in an intense [[Counter-Reformation|campaign]] of return to Catholicism.\n\n==Early life==\nThe exact date of Hus's birth is disputed. Some claim he was born around 1369,{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=40}} while others claim he was born sometime between 1373 and 1375.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=64}} The \"oldest  chiken\" state the latter,{{sfn|Gillett|1863|p=43}} but more contemporary research states that 1372 is more likely.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=64}} The belief that he was born on July 6, also his deathday, has no factual basis and is likely a myth.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=64}} Hus was born in Husinec, to peasant parents.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=65}} We know that Hus took his name from the village where he lived (Husinec). Why Hus did not take the name of his father is up to speculation; some believe that it was because Hus did not know his father, while other say it was simply the custom at the time.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|p=44}} Nearly all other information we have about Hus's very early life is either myth or completely unreliable.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=43\u201344}} Similarly, we know little of Hus's family. His father's name was Michael; his mother's name is unknown. We know that Hus had a brother due to him expressing concerns for his nephew while awaiting execution at Constance. Whether or not Hus had any other family is unknown.{{sfn|Fudge|2010|p=9}}\n\nAt the age of roughly 10, Hus was sent away to a monastery. Again, the exact reason is not known; some claim his father had died,{{sfn|Gilpin|1809|p=141}} other say he simply went due to his devoutness.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=44\u201345}} He impressed the teachers with his studies, and they recommended that he move to [[Prague]], one of the largest cities in Bohemia at the time. Hus apparently supported himself by securing a job with someone in Prague,{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=46\u201348}} which allowed him access to food, shelter, clothing, and the Prague Library.\n\n3 years later,{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=47\u201350}} he was admitted to the [[Charles University of Prague|University of Prague]]. Though he was not an exceptional student, he was said to have pursued his studies with ferocity.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|pp=70\u201371}} In 1393, Hus earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at the University of Prague, and he earned his master's degree in 1396.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=40}} The strongly anti-papal views that were held by many of the professors there likely influenced Hus's future work.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|pp=73\u201376}}\n\n==Career==\nHus began teaching at the university in 1398 and in 1399, he first publicly defended propositions of Wycliffe.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=40}} In 1401, his students and faculty promoted him to dean of the philosophical department, and a year later, he became a  [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Prague. He was appointed a preacher at the newly built Bethlehem Chapel the same year. Hus was a strong advocate for the Czechs and the [[Philosophical realism|Realists]], and he was influenced by the writings of [[John Wycliffe]]. Although church authorities banned many works of Wycliffe in 1403, Hus translated ''Trialogus'' into [[Czech language|Czech]] and helped to distribute it.{{sfn|Wilhelm|1910}}[[File:Hus na kazatelne.jpg|thumb|left|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]\n\nHus denounced the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=76\u201378}} Archbishop [[Zbyn\u011bk Zaj\u00edc]] tolerated this, and even appointed Hus a preacher at the clergy's biennial synod. On June 24, 1405, [[Pope Innocent VII]] directed the Archbishop to counter Wycliffe's teachings, especially the doctrine of [[impanation]] in the [[Eucharist]]. The archbishop complied by issuing a [[synod]] decree against Wycliffe, as well as forbidding any further attacks on the clergy.{{sfn|Wilhelm|1910}}\n\nIn 1406, two Bohemian students brought to Prague a document bearing the seal of the [[University of Oxford]] and praising Wycliffe. Hus proudly read the document from his pulpit. Then, in 1408, [[Pope Gregory XII]] warned Archbishop Zajic that the Church in Rome had been informed of Wycliffe's heresies and of the sympathies of King [[Wenceslaus IV]] for non-conformists.{{sfn|Gillett|1863|pp=140-141}} In response, the king and university ordered all of Wycliffe's writings surrendered to the archdiocesan chancery for correction. Hus obeyed, declaring that he condemned the errors in those writings.{{sfn|Hus|1372\u20131415|p=69}}\n\n===Papal Schism===\nIn 1408, the [[Charles University in Prague]] was divided by the [[Western Schism]], in which Gregory XII in Rome and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] in [[Avignon]] both claimed the papacy. Wenceslaus felt Gregory XII might interfere with his plans to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. He denounced Gregory, ordered the clergy in Bohemia to observe a strict neutrality in the schism, and said that he expected the same of the University. Archbishop Zaj\u00edc remained faithful to Gregory. At the University, only the scholars of the Bohemian \"nation\" (one of the four governing sections), with Hus as their leader, vowed neutrality.<ref>Oscar Kuhns and Robert Dickie, ''Jan Hus: Reformation in Bohemia'' (Morrisville, NC: Lulu, 2017), 67-70. books.google.com/books?id=3r4yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA67 {{ISBN|9781872556291}}</ref>\n\n====Kutn\u00e1 Hora Decree====\n[[File:Jan Hus-Bible Martinicka.jpg|thumb|The oldest known representation of Jan Hus is from Martinick\u00e1 bible.]]\n{{see|Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora}}\nIn January 1409, [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]] summoned representatives of the four nations comprising the university to the Czech city of [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]] to demand statements of allegiance. The Czech nation agreed, but the other three nations declined. The king then decreed that the Czech nation would have three votes in University affairs, while the \"German nation\" (composed of the former [[Bavaria]]n, [[Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Poland|Polish]] nations) would have one vote in total. As a consequence of the changed voting, by May 1409 the German dean and rector were deposed and replaced by Czechs. The [[Rupert, King of Germany|Palatine Elector]] called the Germans to his own University of Heidelberg, while the [[William II, Margrave of Meissen|Margrave of Meissen]] started a new [[University of Leipzig|university]] in Leipzig. It is estimated that over one thousand students and masters left Prague. The emigrants also spread accusations of Bohemian heresy.{{sfn|Fudge|2010|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\n====Antipope Alexander V====\nIn 1409, the [[Council of Pisa]] tried to end the schism by electing [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as Pope, but Gregory and Benedict did not submit. (Alexander was declared an \"[[antipope]]\" by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1418.) Hus, his followers, and Wenceslaus IV transferred their allegiance to Alexander V. Under pressure from king Wenceslaus IV, Archbishop Zaj\u00edc did the same. Zaj\u00edc then lodged an accusation of \"ecclesiastical disturbances\" against Wycliffites in Prague with Alexander V.\n\nOn 20 December 1409, Alexander V issued a [[papal bull]] that empowered the Archbishop to proceed against Wycliffism in Prague. All copies of Wycliffe's writings were to be surrendered and his doctrines repudiated, and free preaching discontinued. After the publication of the bull in 1410, Hus appealed to Alexander V, but in vain. The Wycliffe books and valuable manuscripts were burned, and Hus and his adherents were [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by Alexander V.\n\n====Crusade against Naples====\nAlexander V died in 1410, and was succeeded by [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (also later declared an antipope). In 1411,  John XXIII proclaimed a [[crusade]] against King [[Ladislaus of Naples]], the protector of rival [[Pope Gregory XII]]. This crusade was preached in Prague as well. John XXIII also authorized [[indulgence]]s to raise money for the war. Priests urged the people on and these crowded into churches to give their offerings. This traffic in indulgences was to some a sign of the corruption of the church needing remediation.{{citation needed|reason=The anti-church?|date=July 2012}}\n\n====Condemnation of indulgences and Crusade====\n[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|right|Hus by an unknown artist, 16th century]]\nArchbishop Zaj\u00edc died in 1411, and with his death the [[Bohemian Reformation|religious movement in Bohemia]] entered a new phase, during which the disputes concerning [[indulgences]] assumed great importance. Hus spoke out against indulgences, but he could not carry with him the men of the university. In 1412, a dispute took place, on which occasion Hus delivered his address ''Quaestio magistri Johannis Hus de indulgentiis''. It was taken literally from the last chapter of Wycliffe's book, ''De ecclesia'', and his treatise, ''De absolutione a pena et culpa''. Hus asserted that no Pope or bishop had the right to take up the sword in the name of the Church; he should pray for his enemies and bless those that curse him; man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money. The doctors of the theological faculty replied, but without success. A few days afterward, some of Hus's followers, led by Vok Voksa z Vald\u0161tejna, burnt the [[Papal bull]]s. Hus, they said, should be obeyed rather than the Church, which they considered a fraudulent mob of adulterers and [[Simony|Simonists]].{{sfn|Schaff|1953|pp=415-420}}\n\nIn response, three men from the lower classes who openly called the indulgences a fraud were beheaded. They were later considered the first martyrs of the [[Hussite]] Church. In the meantime, the faculty had condemned the forty-five articles and added several other theses, deemed heretical, which had originated with Hus. The king forbade the teaching of these articles, but neither Hus nor the university complied with the ruling, requesting that the articles should be first proven to be un-scriptural. The tumults at Prague had stirred up a sensation; papal legates and Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newschaffherzog26haucgoog|quote=Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.|title=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge: Embracing Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology and Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Biography from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|last=Herzog|first=Johann Jakob|last2=Hauck|first2=Albert|last3=Jackson|first3=Samuel Macauley|last4=Sherman|first4=Charles Colebrook|last5=Gilmore|first5=George William|date=1909|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newschaffherzog26haucgoog/page/n438 416]|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Attempts at reconciliation====\nKing Wenceslaus IV made efforts to harmonize the opposing parties. In 1412, he convoked the heads of his kingdom for a consultation and, at their suggestion, ordered a [[synod]] to be held at [[\u010cesk\u00fd Brod]] on 2 February 1412. It did not take place there, but in the palace of the archbishops at Prague, in order to exclude Hus from participation. Propositions were made to restore peace in the Church. Hus declared that Bohemia should have the same freedom in regard to ecclesiastical affairs as other countries <!-- what other countries?? --> and that approbation and condemnation should therefore be announced only with the permission of the state power. This was the doctrine of Wycliffe (''Sermones'', iii. 519, etc.).\n\nThere followed treatises from both parties, but no harmony was obtained. \"Even if I should stand before the stake which has been prepared for me,\" Hus wrote at the time, \"I would never accept the recommendation of the theological faculty.\" The synod did not produce any results, but the King ordered a commission to continue the work of reconciliation. The doctors of the university demanded approval of their conception of the Church, according to which the Pope is the head, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] are the body of the Church, from Hus and his followers. Hus protested vigorously. The Hussite party seems to have made a great effort toward reconciliation. To the article that the Roman Church must be obeyed, they added only \"so far as every pious Christian is bound\".{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|p=75}} Stanislav ze Znojma and \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n P\u00e1le\u010d protested against this addition and left the convention; they were exiled by the king, with two others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==== Hus leaves Prague and appeals to Jesus Christ ====\nBy this time, Hus's ideas had become widely accepted in Bohemia, and there was broad resentment against the Church hierarchy. The attack on Hus by the Pope and Archbishop caused riots in parts of Bohemia. King Wenceslaus IV and his government took the side of Hus, and the power of his adherents increased from day to day. Hus continued to preach in the [[Bethlehem Chapel]]. The churches of the city were put under the ban, and the [[interdict]] was pronounced against [[Prague]]. To protect the city, Hus left and went into the countryside, where he continued to preach and write.{{sfn|Kuhns|1907|pp=77-78}}\n\nBefore Hus left Prague, he decided to take a step which gave a new dimension to his endeavors. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an ineffective Council. On October 18, 1412, he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church.<ref name=ap>{{cite web |title=Magistri Ioannis Hus appelatio ad supremum iudicem |trans-title=Master John Hus, appeal to the final judge |language=Latin, Czech |url=http://etfuk.sweb.cz/hus.htm |website=etfuk.sweb.cz |accessdate=23 July 2015}}{{self-published inline|date=July 2018}}{{psc|date=July 2018}}</ref> For the [[Bohemian Reformation]], this step was as significant as the [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 theses]] posted in Wittenberg by Martin Luther in 1517.\n\nAfter Hus left Prague for the country, he realized what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation on one hand, and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care on the other.{{sfn|Nodl|2010|pp=530-531}} Therefore, he started to write many texts in Czech, such as basics of the Christian faith or preachings, intended mainly for the priests whose knowledge of Latin was poor.{{sfn|\u0160mahel|2013|p=143}}\n\n====Writings of Hus and Wycliffe====\nOf the writings occasioned by these controversies, those of Hus on the Church, entitled ''De Ecclesia'', were written in 1413 and have been most frequently quoted and admired or criticized, and yet their first ten chapters are but an epitome of Wycliffe's work of the same title, and the following chapters are but an abstract of another of Wycliffe's works (''De potentate papae'') on the power of the Pope. Wycliffe had written his book to oppose the common position that the Church consisted primarily of the clergy, and Hus now found himself making the same point. He wrote his work at the castle of one of his protectors in Koz\u00ed Hr\u00e1dek, and sent it to Prague, where it was publicly read in the Bethlehem Chapel. It was answered by Stanislav ze Znojma and \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n z P\u00e1l\u010de (also \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n P\u00e1le\u010d) with treatises of the same title.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAfter the most vehement opponents of Hus had left Prague, his adherents occupied the whole ground. Hus wrote his treatises and preached in the neighborhood of Koz\u00ed Hr\u00e1dek. Bohemian Wycliffism was carried into Poland, Hungary, [[Croatia]], and Austria. But in January 1413, a general council in Rome condemned the writings of Wycliffe and ordered them to be burned.<ref>{{cite book |title=Church Schism & Corruption |last=Maseko |first=Achim Nkosi |publisher=Lulu |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4092-2186-9 |pages= }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{self-published source|date=July 2018}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Council of Constance===\nKing Wenceslaus's brother [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], who was \"[[King of the Romans]]\" (that is, head of the Holy Roman Empire, though not then Emperor), and heir to the Bohemian crown, was anxious to put an end to religious dissension within the Church. To put an end to the papal schism and to take up the long desired reform of the Church, he arranged for a general council to convene on 1 November 1414, at [[Konstanz]] (Constance).{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1909|p=224-228}} The [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418) became the 16th ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church. Hus, willing to make an end of all dissensions, agreed to go to Constance, under Sigismund's promise of [[safe conduct]].{{sfn|Gillett|1863|p=464-466}}\n\n====Imprisonment and preparations for trial====\n[[File:Hus (Lessing 1842).jpg|thumb|280px|Jan Hus at the Council of Constance, 19th century painting by Karl Friedrich Lessing]]\n\nIt is not known whether Hus knew what his fate would be, but he made his [[last will and testament|will]] before setting out. He started on his journey on 11 October 1414, arriving in Constance on 3 November 1414. The following day, the bulletins on the church doors announced that Michal z N\u011bmeck\u00e9ho Brodu would be opposing Hus. In the beginning, Hus was at liberty, under his safe conduct from Sigismund, and lived at the house of a widow. But he continued celebrating Mass and preaching to the people, in violation of restrictions decreed by the Church. After a few weeks on 28 November 1414, his opponents succeeded in imprisoning him, on the strength of a rumor that he intended to flee. He was first brought into the residence of a canon and then, on 6 December 1414, into the prison of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery. Sigismund, as the guarantor of Hus's safety, was greatly angered and threatened the prelates with dismissal; however, the prelates convinced him that he could not be bound by promises to a heretic.{{sfn|Fudge|2010|pp=125-127}}\n\nOn 4 December 1414, John XXIII entrusted a committee of three bishops with a preliminary investigation against Hus. As was common practice, witnesses for the prosecution were heard, but Hus was not allowed an advocate for his defense. His situation became worse after the downfall of John XXIII, who had left Constance to avoid abdicating. Hus had been the captive of John XXIII and in constant communication with his friends, but now he was delivered to the bishop of Constance and brought to his castle, ''Gottlieben on the Rhine''. Here he remained for 73 days, separated from his friends, chained day and night, poorly fed, and ill.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Trial===\n\nOn 5 June 1415, he was tried for the first time, and was transferred to a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] monastery, where he spent the last weeks of his life. Extracts from his works were read, and witnesses were heard. He refused all formulae of submission, but declared himself willing to recant if his errors should be proven to him from the Bible. Hus conceded his veneration of Wycliffe, and said that he could only wish his soul might some time attain unto that place where Wycliffe's was. On the other hand, he denied having defended Wycliffe's doctrine of [[The Lord's Supper]] or the forty-five articles; he had only opposed their summary condemnation. King Sigismund admonished him to deliver himself up to the mercy of the Council, as he did not desire to protect a heretic.{{sfn|Shahan|1913|p=}}\n\nAt the last trial, on 8 June 1415, thirty-nine sentences were read to him, twenty-six of which had been excerpted from his book on the Church (''De ecclesia''), seven from his treatise against P\u00e1le\u010d (Contra Palecz), and six from that against Stanislav ze Znojma (''Contra Stanislaum''). The danger of some of these doctrines to worldly power was explained to Sigismund to incite him against Hus. Hus again declared himself willing to submit if he could be convinced of errors. This declaration was considered an unconditional surrender, and he was asked to confess:\n# that he had erred in the theses which he had hitherto maintained;\n# that he renounced them for the future;\n# that he recanted them; and\n# that he declared the opposite of these sentences.\n\nHe asked to be exempted from recanting doctrines which he had never taught; others, which the assembly considered erroneous, he was not willing to revoke; to act differently would be against his conscience. These words found no favorable reception. After the trial on 8 June, several other attempts were purportedly made to induce him to recant, which he resisted.<ref>Di Mauro, Dennis.

After the [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]] and Liturgy, Hus was led into the church. The [[Bishop of Lodi]] (then [[Giacomo Balardi Arrigoni]]) delivered an oration on the duty of eradicating heresy; various theses of Hus and Wycliffe and a report of his trial were then read.\n\nAn Italian prelate pronounced the sentence of condemnation upon Hus and his writings. Hus protested, saying that even at this hour he did not wish anything but to be convinced from Scripture. He fell upon his knees and asked God with a soft voice to forgive all his enemies. Then followed his degradation \u2014 he was dressed in priestly vestments and again asked to recant; again he refused. With curses, Hus's ornaments were taken from him, his priestly [[tonsure]] was destroyed, and the sentence of the Church was pronounced, stripping him of all rights, and he was delivered to secular authorities. Then a tall paper hat was put upon his head, with the inscription \"''[[Heresiarch|Haeresiarcha]]''\" (i.e., the leader of a heretical movement). Hus was led away to the stake under a strong guard of armed men.\n\n==Execution==\n[[File:Jan Hus at the Stake.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Jan Hus at the [[Death by burning|stake]], Jena codex (c. 1500)]]\nAt the place of execution, he knelt down, spread out his hands, and prayed aloud. The executioner undressed Hus and tied his hands behind his back with ropes, and bound his neck with a chain to a stake around which wood and straw had been piled up so that it covered him to the neck. At the last moment, the imperial marshal, von Pappenheim, in the presence of the [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Count Palatine]], asked Hus to recant and thus save his own life. Hus declined, stating:\n\n{{quote|God is my witness that the things charged against me I never preached. In the same truth of the Gospel which I have written, taught, and preached, drawing upon the sayings and positions of the holy doctors, I am ready to die today.{{sfn|Schaff|1915|p=257}}}}\n\nAnecdotally, it has been claimed that the executioners had trouble intensifying the fire. An old woman then came to the stake and threw a relatively small amount of [[:wikt:brushwood|brushwood]] on it. Upon seeing her act, a suffering Hus then exclaimed, \"''O Sancta Simplicitas!''\". The phrase's [[Czech language|Czech]] equivalent, \"''Svat\u00e1 prostota!''\" ([[Vocative case#Czech|vocative form]]: \"''Svat\u00e1 prostoto!''\", Translated \"''Holy simplicity!''\") is still used today when commenting on a person's foolish action coming from the belief that he or she is doing something righteous.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\nIt is said that when he was about to expire, he cried out, ''\"Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on us!\"'' (a variant of the [[Jesus Prayer]]). Hus's ashes were later thrown into the [[Rhine River]] as a means of preventing the veneration of his remains.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Hussite Wars===\n{{Main|Hussite Wars}}\n[[File:Jensky kodex Zizka.jpg|thumb|[[Jan \u017di\u017eka]] leading troops of Hussites]]\n[[File:Vrh\u00e1n\u00ed husit\u016f do \u0161achet.gif|thumb|Some two thousand of Hus's followers thrown into the [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]] mines by pro-Catholic townsmen]]\nResponding with horror to the execution of Hus, the people of Bohemia moved even more rapidly away from Papal teachings, provoking Rome to pronounce a [[crusade]] against them (1 March 1420): [[Pope Martin V]] issued a [[Papal bull]] authorizing the execution of all supporters of Hus and Wycliffe. King Wenceslaus IV died in August 1419 and his brother, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], was unable to establish a real government in Bohemia due to the Hussite revolt.{{sfn|L\u00fctzow|1914|pp=177-179}}\n\nThe Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia, and became a major military power. Under the leadership of [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]] (c. 1360 \u2013 1424) and later of [[Prokop the Great]] (c. 1380 \u2013 1434) \u2013 both  excellent commanders \u2013 the Hussites defeated the crusade and the other three crusades that followed (1419\u20131434). Fighting ended after a compromise between the Utraquist Hussites and the Catholic [[Council of Basel]] in 1436. It resulted in the [[Basel Compacts]], in which the Catholic Church officially allowed Bohemia to practice its own version of Christianity (Hussitism). A century later, as much as ninety percent of the inhabitants of the [[Czech Crown lands]] still followed Hussite teachings.\n\n===Hus's scholarship and teachings===\n[[File:Luther und Hus-Abendmahl.jpg|thumb|Luther and Hus serving [[Communion under both kinds]] together, picture from 16th-century Saxony demonstrating the affinity of Lutherans with Hussites]]\nHus left only a few reformatory writings in the proper sense of the word, most of his works being polemical treatises against Stanislav ze Znojma and \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n P\u00e1le\u010d. He translated Wycliffe's ''Trialogus'', and was very familiar with his works on the body of [[Jesus]], on the Church, on the power of the pope, and especially with his sermons. There are reasons to suppose that Wycliffe's doctrine of the Lord's Supper ([[consubstantiation]] rather than [[transubstantiation]]{{sfn|Lechler|1904|p=381}} had spread to Prague as early as 1399, with strong evidence that students returning from England had brought the work back with them. It gained an even wider circulation after it had been prohibited in 1403, and Hus preached and taught it, although it is possible that he simply repeated it without advocating it. But the doctrine was seized eagerly by the radical party, the [[Taborites]], who made it the central point of their system. According to their book, the Church is not the clerical hierarchy which was generally accepted as \u2018the Church;\u2019 the Church is the entire body of those who from eternity have been predestined for salvation. Christ, not the pope, is its head. It is no article of faith that one must obey the pope to be saved. Neither internal membership in the Church nor churchly offices and dignities are a surety that the persons in question are members of the true Church.\n\nTo some, Hus's efforts were predominantly designed to rid the Church of its ethical abuses, rather than a campaign of sweeping theological change. To others, the seeds of the Reformation are clear in Hus's and Wycliffe's writings. In explaining the plight of the average Christian in Bohemia, Hus wrote, \"One pays for confession, for mass, for the sacrament, for indulgences, for churching a woman, for a blessing, for burials, for funeral services and prayers. The very last penny which an old woman has hidden in her bundle for fear of thieves or robbery will not be saved. The villainous priest will grab it.\" (Macek, 16) After Hus's death, his followers, known as [[Hussite]]s, split off into several groups including the [[Utraquists]], [[Taborite]]s and [[Sirotci|Orphans]].\n\n===Apology of the Catholic Church===\nNearly six centuries later in 1999,  [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed \"deep regret for the cruel death inflicted\" on Hus and added \"deep sorrow\" for Hus's death and praised his \"moral courage\".<ref name=JohnLAllenJr />  Cardinal [[Miloslav Vlk]] of the Czech Republic was instrumental in crafting John Paul II's statement.<ref name=JohnLAllenJr>{{cite news |last=Allen Jr. |first=John L. |date=15 September 2009 |title=The German shepherd bids farewell to a 'wolf in winter' |url=http://ncronline.org/news/german-shepherd-bids-farewell-wolf-winter |website=National Catholic Reporter }}</ref>\n\n===Hus and Feminism===\nHus was also, unlike the vast majority of preachers at the time, an advocate for women and [[feminism]]. He believed women were given rights in the Bible. Hus stated that \"Women were made in the image of God and should fear no man.\"{{sfn|Peterson|Shreeves|2014|p=34}} He allowed women to preach and serve in battle, and they later fought in the Hussite wars.{{sfn|Peterson|Shreeves|2014|p=35}}\n\n===Hus and the Czech language===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nJan Hus introduced reforms to medieval [[Czech orthography]], including the \"hook\" ([[h\u00e1\u010dek]]) diacritic which was used to form the [[grapheme]]s {{angle bracket|\u010d}}, {{angle bracket|\u011b}}, {{angle bracket|\u0161}}, {{angle bracket|\u0159}} and {{angle bracket|\u017e}}, which replaced [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] like {{angle bracket|cz}}, {{angle bracket|ie}}, {{angle bracket|sch}}, {{angle bracket|rz}} and {{angle bracket|zs}}; the \"dot\" above letters for strong accent,{{clarify|date=October 2019}} as well as the acute accent to mark long vowels {{angle bracket|\u00e1}}, {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, {{angle bracket|\u00ed}}, {{angle bracket|\u00f3}}, and {{angle bracket|\u00fa}}, in order to represent each [[phoneme]] by a single [[grapheme|symbol]]. Some sources mention documented use of the special symbols in Bible translations (1462), the Schaffhausen Bible, and handwritten notes in the bible. The symbol {{angle bracket|\u016f}} (instead of {{angle bracket|uo}}) came later.

The discoverer of the piece, [[Ludwig Nohl]], affirmed that the original autograph manuscript, now lost, had the title: \"F\u00fcr Elise am 27 April [1810] zur Erinnerung von L. v.

There is a later version, with drastic changes to the accompaniment which was transcribed from a later manuscript by the Beethoven scholar [[Barry Cooper (musicologist)|Barry Cooper]]. The most notable difference is in the first theme, the left-hand [[arpeggio]]s are delayed by a 16th note. There are a few extra [[Bar (music)|bars]] in the transitional section into the B section; and finally, the rising A minor arpeggio figure is moved later into the piece. The tempo marking ''Poco moto'' is believed to have been on the manuscript that Ludwig Nohl transcribed (now lost). The later version includes the marking ''Molto grazioso''. It is believed that Beethoven intended to add the piece to a cycle of bagatelles.<ref>''Ludwig van Beethoven, Klavierst\u00fcck a-Moll WoO 59 \"F\u00fcr Elise\"''. Kritische Ausgabe mit Faksimile der Handschrift BH 116, Skizzentranskription und Kommentar. {{ill|Sieghard Brandenburg|de}}, Bonn 2002, pp. 8 and 15</ref>\n\nWhatever the validity of Nohl's edition, an editorial peculiarity contained in it involves the second right hand note in bar 7, that is, the first note of the three-note upbeat figure that characterizes the main melody. Is it E4 or D4? Nohl's score gives E4 in bar7 but D4 thereafter in all parallel passages. Many editions change all of the figures to beginning with E4 until the final bars, where D4 is used and resolved by adding a C to the final A octave. \n\nThe pianist and musicologist {{ill|Luca Chiantore|es}} argued in his [[thesis]] and his 2010 book ''Beethoven al piano'' (new Italian edition: ''Beethoven al pianoforte'', 2014) that Beethoven might not have been the person who gave the piece the form that we know today. Chiantore suggested that the original signed manuscript, upon which Ludwig Nohl claimed to base his transcription, may never have existed.<ref>Luca Chiantore: ''Beethoven al piano''.

Born in [[Regensburg]] and treated for a while as a [[child prodigy]], she first travelled on concert tours with Beethoven's friend [[Johann Nepomuk M\u00e4lzel]], also from Regensburg, and then lived with him for some time in Vienna, where she received singing lessons from [[Antonio Salieri]]. Steblin argues that Beethoven dedicated this work to the 13-year-old Elise Barensfeld as a favour to Therese Malfatti who lived opposite M\u00e4lzel's and Barensfeld's residence and who might have given her piano lessons.<ref>[http://www.nmz.de/online/war-maelzels-saengerin-auch-beethovens-elise-die-kanadische-musikforscherin-rita-steblin-ist- \"War M\u00e4lzels S\u00e4ngerin auch Beethovens 'Elise'?\"] by Juan Martin Koch, ''[[Neue Musikzeitung]]'', 15 November 2012 {{in lang|de}}</ref> Steblin admits that question marks remain for her hypothesis.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article111178742/Geheimnis-um-Beethovens-Elise-gelueftet.html \"Geheimnis um Beethovens 'Elise' gel\u00fcftet?\"], ''[[Die Welt]]'', 16 November 2012 {{in lang|de}}; [[Rita Steblin|Steblin, Rita]]: \"Who was Beethoven's 'Elise'? A new solution to the mystery.\" In: ''[[The Musical Times]]'' 155 (2014), pp. 3\u201339</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nThe piece can be heard as a five-part rondo, with the form A-B-A-C-A. It is in [[A minor]] and in [[time signature|{{music|time|3|8}} time]]. It begins with the refrain A, a flowing melody in binary form marked ''Poco moto'' (literally \"a little motion,\" a tempo indication that does not appear elsewhere in Beethoven's works), with an arpeggiated left hand accompaniment. The unaccompanied oscillation between the dominant E and its chromatic lower neighbor D-sharp that begins the melody has become one of the most recognizable openings in classical music, but it also serves as a main topic of musical discussion. The digression at measure 9 glances at the relative major before returning to the original theme and key, preceded by a prolongation of the dominant, E that extends the opening lower-neighbor oscillation. The pitch outline of these bars, E-F-E-D-C-B, i.e. an upper-neighbor ascent to F5 followed by a descending scale, also forms the basis of the two episodes B and C, thus unifying the piece. The B section is in the [[submediant]], [[F major]]. Its theme begins by tracing the outline mentioned above in somewhat elaborated fashion and modulates to the dominant, followed by [[Thirty-second note|32nd-note]] runs repeating a cadential progression in C major in a codetta-like passage. (The chordal three-note upbeats in the left hand have been anticipated by the transition to this episode in bar 22, a clever unifying touch.) This suggests a rather expansive form, but Beethoven suddenly returns to the dominant of A minor in bar 34, once again lingering on the dominant E and its lower neighbor and leading to an exact repeat of the A section. Although another nominal episode follows (C) at bar 59, it does not leave the tonic and is rather coda-like in feel, unfolding over a dramatic, throbbing tonic pedal in the bass and emphatically cadencing in the home key. Once again, there are unifying relationships with previously heard material. The melody retraces the descending outline alluded to earlier, and the cadence in bars 66-67 is an augmented version of the theme's cadence in bars 7-8. After a glance at a Neapolitan harmony (B-flat major) and a cadence at bar 76 that brings the music to a complete halt for the first and only time, an ascending A minor arpeggio and a [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] descent over two octaves follows, sort of a ''cadenza in tempo'', leading to a final repetition of the A section. The piece concludes without an added postlude.\n\nKopitz presents the finding by the German organ scholar {{ill|Johannes Quack (organist)|de|Johannes Quack|lt=Johannes Quack}} that the letters that spell Elise can be decoded as the first three notes of the piece.

The discoverer of the piece, [[Ludwig Nohl]], affirmed that the original autograph manuscript, now lost, had the title: \"F\u00fcr Elise am 27 April [1810] zur Erinnerung von L. v.

There is a later version, with drastic changes to the accompaniment which was transcribed from a later manuscript by the Beethoven scholar [[Barry Cooper (musicologist)|Barry Cooper]]. The most notable difference is in the first theme, the left-hand [[arpeggio]]s are delayed by a 16th note. There are a few extra [[Bar (music)|bars]] in the transitional section into the B section; and finally, the rising A minor arpeggio figure is moved later into the piece. The tempo marking ''Poco moto'' is believed to have been on the manuscript that Ludwig Nohl transcribed (now lost). The later version includes the marking ''Molto grazioso''. It is believed that Beethoven intended to add the piece to a cycle of bagatelles.<ref>''Ludwig van Beethoven, Klavierst\u00fcck a-Moll WoO 59 \"F\u00fcr Elise\"''. Kritische Ausgabe mit Faksimile der Handschrift BH 116, Skizzentranskription und Kommentar. {{ill|Sieghard Brandenburg|de}}, Bonn 2002, pp. 8 and 15</ref>\n\nWhatever the validity of Nohl's edition, an editorial peculiarity contained in it involves the second right hand note in bar 7, that is, the first note of the three-note upbeat figure that characterizes the main melody. Is it E4 or D4? Nohl's score gives E4 in bar7 but D4 thereafter in all parallel passages. Many editions change all of the figures to beginning with E4 until the final bars, where D4 is used and resolved by adding a C to the final A octave. \n\nThe pianist and musicologist {{ill|Luca Chiantore|es}} argued in his [[thesis]] and his 2010 book ''Beethoven al piano'' (new Italian edition: ''Beethoven al pianoforte'', 2014) that Beethoven might not have been the person who gave the piece the form that we know today.
