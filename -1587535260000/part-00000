In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 [[oil painting]]s, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include [[Trees and Undergrowth (Van Gogh series)|landscapes]], [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)|still lifes]], [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh|portraits]] and [[Portraits of Vincent van Gogh|self-portraits]], and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive [[paintwork|brushwork]] that contributed to the foundations of [[modern art]]. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.\n\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a [[Protestant]] missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] supported him financially, and the two kept up a [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|long correspondence by letter]]. His early works, mostly [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)|still lifes]] and depictions of [[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)|peasant labourers]], contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the ''[[avant-garde]]'', including [[\u00c9mile Bernard (painter)|\u00c9mile Bernard]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], who were reacting against the [[Impressionist]] sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and [[Montmartre (Van Gogh series)|local landscapes]]. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in [[Arles]] in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|olive trees]], [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat fields]] and [[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|sunflowers]].\n\nVan Gogh suffered from [[Psychosis|psychotic episodes]] and [[delusion]]s and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence|Saint-R\u00e9my]]. After he discharged himself and moved to the [[Auberge Ravoux]] in [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] near Paris, he came under the care of the [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] doctor [[Paul Gachet]]. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a [[Lefaucheux]] revolver.<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/le-revolver-avec-lequel-van-gogh-se-serait-mortellement-blesse-en-vente-a-paris-20190402 ''Le revolver avec lequel Van Gogh se serait mortellement bless\u00e9 en vente \u00e0 Paris''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402211847/http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/le-revolver-avec-lequel-van-gogh-se-serait-mortellement-blesse-en-vente-a-paris-20190402 |date=2 April 2019 }} in ''[[Le Figaro]]'' 2 April 2019</ref> He died from his injuries two days later.\n\nVan Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge\".{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 9}} His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and [[German Expressionism|German Expressionists]]. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the [[tortured artist]]. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the [[List of most expensive paintings|world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold]], and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.\n\n==Letters==\n{{See also|The Letters of Vincent van Gogh}}\nThe most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].

He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eug\u00e9nie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger.

Bread, coffee and [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]] became his staple diet. In February 1886, he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful.{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=184}} In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of [[colour theory]] and spent time in museums{{mdash}}particularly studying the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens]]{{mdash}}and broadened his palette to include [[carmine]], [[cobalt blue]] and [[Paris green|emerald green]]. Van Gogh bought Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings.{{sfnp|Hammacher|1985|loc=84}} He was drinking heavily again,{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=253}} and was hospitalised between February and March 1886,{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 477}} when he was possibly also treated for [[syphilis]].{{sfnp|Arnold|1992|loc= 77}}{{efn| group= note |The only evidence for this is from interviews with the grandson of the doctor.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 177\u2013178}} For an overall review see Naifeh and Smith.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc=477 n. 199}}}}\n\nAfter his recovery, and despite his antipathy towards academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Antwerp, and in January 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing. He became ill and run down by overwork, poor diet and excessive smoking.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 173}} He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with [[Charles Verlat]], the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class [[Franz Vinck]]. Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by [[Eug\u00e8ne Siberdt]]. Soon Siberdt and Van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt's requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When Van Gogh was required to draw the [[Venus of Milo]] during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to Van Gogh's drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: 'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like, ''God damn it!'' A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!' According to some accounts this was the last time Van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 448\u2013489}} On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including Van Gogh, had to repeat a year.

In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing [[Pointillism]] and [[Neo-impressionism]] for the first time, and bringing attention to [[Georges Seurat]] and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 212\u2013213}}\n\nConflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be \"almost unbearable\".{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 710}} By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to [[Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine|Asni\u00e8res]], a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of [[complementary colour]]s \u2013 including blue and orange \u2013 to form vibrant contrasts.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=29}}{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 710}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Windmills on Montmartre - Google Art Project.jpg|''Le Moulin de Blute-Fin'' (1886) from the ''[[Le Moulin de la Galette (Van Gogh series)|Le Moulin de la Galette]]'' and ''[[Montmartre (Van Gogh series)|Montmartre]]'' series'.

The Danish artist [[Christian Mourier-Petersen]] became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The [[Zouave]]s, the brothels, the adorable little Arl\u00e9sienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=144}}\n\nThe time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 11}} He was enchanted by the local countryside and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, [[ultramarine]] and [[mauve]]. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including ''The Old Mill'' (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 177}} This was one of seven canvases sent to [[Pont-Aven]] on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, \u00c9mile Bernard, [[Charles Laval]] and others.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 177}}\n\nThe portrayals of Arles are informed by Van Gogh's Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], but excel in their use of colour.{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=143\u2013144}} His new-found appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work. In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded \"perspective frame\"; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants]].

Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-R\u00e9my, located less than {{convert|30|km|mi}} from Arles, and was run by a former naval doctor, [[Th\u00e9ophile Peyron]]. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio.{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=246}} The clinic and [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-R\u00e9my (Van Gogh series)#The garden|its garden]] became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as ''Vestibule of the Asylum'' and ''Saint-R\u00e9my (September 1889)''. Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as ''[[The Starry Night]]''. He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted [[Cupressus|cypresses]] and olive trees, including [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|''Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889,'']] ''[[Cypresses (Metropolitan Museum of Art)|Cypresses 1889]],'' ''Cornfield with Cypresses'' (1889), ''Country road in Provence by Night'' (1890).

Van Gogh instead worked on [[Copies by Vincent van Gogh|interpretations of other artist's paintings]], such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet|Millet]]'s ''The Sower'' and ''Noonday Rest'', and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the [[Realism (visual art)|Realism]] of [[Jules Breton]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and Millet,{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=23}} and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 154\u2013157}}\n\nHis ''[[Prisoners' Round (after Gustave Dor\u00e9)]]'' (1890) was painted after an [[engraving]] by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1832\u20131883).

In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures&nbsp;\u2013 highly elaborate studies in black and white,{{efn|group=note|Artists working in black and white, e.g. for illustrated papers like ''[[The Graphic]]'' or ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' were among Van Gogh's favourites.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1974}}}} which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.{{sfnp|Dorn|Keyes|2000}}\n\nIn August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working ''[[en plein air]]''.

The Hague, Saturday, 5 August 1882.}} From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known [[Hague School]] artists like [[Johan Hendrik Weissenbruch|Weissenbruch]] and [[Bernard Blommers|Blommers]], and received technical advice from them, as well as from painters like [[Th\u00e9ophile de Bock|De Bock]] and [[Herman Johannes van der Weele|Van der Weele]], both of the Hague School's second generation.{{sfnp|Dorn|Schr\u00f6der|Sillevis|1996}} When he moved to Nuenen after the period in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them.

Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that \"colour expresses something in itself\".{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=666}}{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let537/letter.html Letter 537]|ps= . Vincent to Theo, Nuenen, on or about Wednesday, 28 October 1885.}} According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a \"psychological and moral weight\", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of ''[[The Night Cafe]]'', a work he wanted to \"express the terrible passions of humanity\".{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 7}} Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 11}}\n\nVan Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature,{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 232}} and during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=20}} His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 8\u20139}} His renditions of the sower, at first copied from [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun.{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=668}} These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop.{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 236}} His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian [[iconography]] he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 12}} In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint ''The Sower''.{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=666}}\n\n[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 098.jpg|thumb|''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden at Etten]]'', 1888.

He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word \"purposeful\" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=16\u201317}} He painted many series of studies;{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 223}} most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends.{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 242}} The work in Arles contributed considerably to his ''oeuvre'': those he thought the most important from that time were ''The Sower'', ''Night Cafe'', ''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden in Etten]]'' and ''Starry Night''. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=21}}\n\n===Major series===\n{{Main|List of works by Vincent van Gogh}}\n[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 059.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[L'Arl\u00e9sienne (painting)|L'Arl\u00e9sienne: Madame Ginoux with Books]]'', November 1888.

She has two books on her lap, and is dressed in dark clothes vividly contrasted against a yellow background.]]\n\nVan Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc=138}} Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 193}}\n\n====Portraits====\n{{See also|Portraits by Vincent van Gogh|Paintings of Children (Van Gogh series)|Van Gogh's family in his art}}\n\nThe portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn.

The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888: \"I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers&nbsp;... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go.\"{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let666/letter.html Letter 666]|ps= . Vincent to Theo van Gogh.

Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 411}} After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the ''Berceuse Triptych'', and included them in his [[Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890|''Les XX'' in Brussels exhibit]]. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 417}}\n{{clear}}\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 128.jpg|alt=A ceramic vase with sunflowers on a yellow surface against a pale blue background.|''[[Sunflowers (painting)|Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers]]'', August 1888.

The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\".{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 331\u2013333}} Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled\".{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc=45\u201353}}\n\nDuring this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light \u2013 almost in a sacred manner.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 331\u2013333}} Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including ''[[View of Arles, Flowering Orchards]]''.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1980|loc=385}} Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles.

He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including ''The Old Mill'' (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 177}} At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window \u2013 at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris.

In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 [[oil painting]]s, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include [[Trees and Undergrowth (Van Gogh series)|landscapes]], [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)|still lifes]], [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh|portraits]] and [[Portraits of Vincent van Gogh|self-portraits]], and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive [[paintwork|brushwork]] that contributed to the foundations of [[modern art]]. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.\n\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a [[Protestant]] missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] supported him financially, and the two kept up a [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|long correspondence by letter]]. His early works, mostly [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)|still lifes]] and depictions of [[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)|peasant labourers]], contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the ''[[avant-garde]]'', including [[\u00c9mile Bernard (painter)|\u00c9mile Bernard]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], who were reacting against the [[Impressionist]] sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and [[Montmartre (Van Gogh series)|local landscapes]]. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in [[Arles]] in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|olive trees]], [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat fields]] and [[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|sunflowers]].\n\nVan Gogh suffered from [[Psychosis|psychotic episodes]] and [[delusion]]s and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence|Saint-R\u00e9my]]. After he discharged himself and moved to the [[Auberge Ravoux]] in [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] near Paris, he came under the care of the [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] doctor [[Paul Gachet]]. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a [[Lefaucheux]] revolver.<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/le-revolver-avec-lequel-van-gogh-se-serait-mortellement-blesse-en-vente-a-paris-20190402 ''Le revolver avec lequel Van Gogh se serait mortellement bless\u00e9 en vente \u00e0 Paris''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402211847/http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/le-revolver-avec-lequel-van-gogh-se-serait-mortellement-blesse-en-vente-a-paris-20190402 |date=2 April 2019 }} in ''[[Le Figaro]]'' 2 April 2019</ref> He died from his injuries two days later.\n\nVan Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge\".{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 9}} His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and [[German Expressionism|German Expressionists]]. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the [[tortured artist]]. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the [[List of most expensive paintings|world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold]], and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.\n\n==Letters==\n{{See also|The Letters of Vincent van Gogh}}\nThe most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].

Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth.{{efn|group=note|It has been suggested that being given the same name as his dead elder brother might have had a deep psychological impact on the young artist, and that elements of his art, such as the portrayal of pairs of male figures, can be traced back to this.{{sfnp|Lubin|1972|loc=82\u201384}}}} Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789\u20131874), who received a degree in theology at the [[University of Leiden]] in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729\u20131802).{{sfnp|Erickson|1998|loc= 9}}\n\nVan Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in [[The Hague]],{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 14\u201316}} and his father was the youngest son of a minister.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 59}} The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent).

Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eug\u00e9nie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 35\u201347}}\n\n[[File:Cuesmes JPG001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maison Van Gogh|Van Gogh's home in Cuesmes]]; while there he decided to become an artist|alt=Photo of a two-storey brick house on the left partially obscured by trees with a front lawn and with a row of trees on the right]]\nIn April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small [[boarding school]] in [[Ramsgate]].

Bread, coffee and [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]] became his staple diet. In February 1886, he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful.{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=184}} In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of [[colour theory]] and spent time in museums{{mdash}}particularly studying the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens]]{{mdash}}and broadened his palette to include [[carmine]], [[cobalt blue]] and [[Paris green|emerald green]]. Van Gogh bought Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings.{{sfnp|Hammacher|1985|loc=84}} He was drinking heavily again,{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=253}} and was hospitalised between February and March 1886,{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 477}} when he was possibly also treated for [[syphilis]].{{sfnp|Arnold|1992|loc= 77}}{{efn| group= note |The only evidence for this is from interviews with the grandson of the doctor.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 177\u2013178}} For an overall review see Naifeh and Smith.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc=477 n. 199}}}}\n\nAfter his recovery, and despite his antipathy towards academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Antwerp, and in January 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing. He became ill and run down by overwork, poor diet and excessive smoking.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 173}} He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with [[Charles Verlat]], the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class [[Franz Vinck]]. Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by [[Eug\u00e8ne Siberdt]]. Soon Siberdt and Van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt's requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When Van Gogh was required to draw the [[Venus of Milo]] during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to Van Gogh's drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: 'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like, ''God damn it!'' A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!' According to some accounts this was the last time Van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 448\u2013489}} On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including Van Gogh, had to repeat a year.

In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|Japonaiserie]], tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine ''Paris Illustre'', ''[[Copies by Vincent van Gogh#Copy after Keisai Eisen|The Courtesan or Oiran]]'' (1887), after [[Keisai Eisen]], which he then graphically enlarged in a painting.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 38\u201339}}\n\nAfter seeing the portrait of [[Adolphe Monticelli]] at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his ''[[Saintes-Maries (Van Gogh series)|Seascape at Saintes-Maries]]'' (1888).{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 135}}{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let853/letter.html Letter 853]|ps= .

In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing [[Pointillism]] and [[Neo-impressionism]] for the first time, and bringing attention to [[Georges Seurat]] and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 212\u2013213}}\n\nConflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be \"almost unbearable\".{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 710}} By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to [[Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine|Asni\u00e8res]], a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues.

The Danish artist [[Christian Mourier-Petersen]] became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The [[Zouave]]s, the brothels, the adorable little Arl\u00e9sienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=144}}\n\nThe time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 11}} He was enchanted by the local countryside and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, [[ultramarine]] and [[mauve]]. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including ''The Old Mill'' (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 177}} This was one of seven canvases sent to [[Pont-Aven]] on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, \u00c9mile Bernard, [[Charles Laval]] and others.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 177}}\n\nThe portrayals of Arles are informed by Van Gogh's Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], but excel in their use of colour.{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=143\u2013144}} His new-found appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work.

Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-R\u00e9my, located less than {{convert|30|km|mi}} from Arles, and was run by a former naval doctor, [[Th\u00e9ophile Peyron]]. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio.{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=246}} The clinic and [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-R\u00e9my (Van Gogh series)#The garden|its garden]] became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as ''Vestibule of the Asylum'' and ''Saint-R\u00e9my (September 1889)''. Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as ''[[The Starry Night]]''. He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted [[Cupressus|cypresses]] and olive trees, including [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|''Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889,'']] ''[[Cypresses (Metropolitan Museum of Art)|Cypresses 1889]],'' ''Cornfield with Cypresses'' (1889), ''Country road in Provence by Night'' (1890).

Van Gogh instead worked on [[Copies by Vincent van Gogh|interpretations of other artist's paintings]], such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet|Millet]]'s ''The Sower'' and ''Noonday Rest'', and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the [[Realism (visual art)|Realism]] of [[Jules Breton]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and Millet,{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=23}} and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 154\u2013157}}\n\nHis ''[[Prisoners' Round (after Gustave Dor\u00e9)]]'' (1890) was painted after an [[engraving]] by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1832\u20131883).

In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures&nbsp;\u2013 highly elaborate studies in black and white,{{efn|group=note|Artists working in black and white, e.g. for illustrated papers like ''[[The Graphic]]'' or ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' were among Van Gogh's favourites.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1974}}}} which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.{{sfnp|Dorn|Keyes|2000}}\n\nIn August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working ''[[en plein air]]''.

The Hague, Saturday, 5 August 1882.}} From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known [[Hague School]] artists like [[Johan Hendrik Weissenbruch|Weissenbruch]] and [[Bernard Blommers|Blommers]], and received technical advice from them, as well as from painters like [[Th\u00e9ophile de Bock|De Bock]] and [[Herman Johannes van der Weele|Van der Weele]], both of the Hague School's second generation.{{sfnp|Dorn|Schr\u00f6der|Sillevis|1996}} When he moved to Nuenen after the period in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them.

Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that \"colour expresses something in itself\".{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=666}}{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let537/letter.html Letter 537]|ps= .

He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 11}}\n\nVan Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature,{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 232}} and during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=20}} His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 8\u20139}} His renditions of the sower, at first copied from [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun.{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=668}} These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop.{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 236}} His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian [[iconography]] he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 12}} In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint ''The Sower''.{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=666}}\n\n[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 098.jpg|thumb|''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden at Etten]]'', 1888.

He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word \"purposeful\" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=16\u201317}} He painted many series of studies;{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 223}} most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends.{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 242}} The work in Arles contributed considerably to his ''oeuvre'': those he thought the most important from that time were ''The Sower'', ''Night Cafe'', ''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden in Etten]]'' and ''Starry Night''. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=21}}\n\n===Major series===\n{{Main|List of works by Vincent van Gogh}}\n[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 059.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[L'Arl\u00e9sienne (painting)|L'Arl\u00e9sienne: Madame Ginoux with Books]]'', November 1888.

She has two books on her lap, and is dressed in dark clothes vividly contrasted against a yellow background.]]\n\nVan Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc=138}} Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 193}}\n\n====Portraits====\n{{See also|Portraits by Vincent van Gogh|Paintings of Children (Van Gogh series)|Van Gogh's family in his art}}\n\nThe portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn.

His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 15}}\n\nVan Gogh's gaze is seldom directed at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin.{{sfnp|Sund|2002|loc= 261}} Some depict the artist with a beard, others without.

The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888: \"I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers&nbsp;... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go.\"{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let666/letter.html Letter 666]|ps= . Vincent to Theo van Gogh. Arles, Tuesday, 21 or Wednesday, 22 August 1888.}}\n\nThe sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the ''[[D\u00e9coration for the Yellow House|Yellow House's guest room]]'' in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 411}} After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the ''Berceuse Triptych'', and included them in his [[Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890|''Les XX'' in Brussels exhibit]]. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 417}}\n{{clear}}\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Vincent Willem van Gogh 128.jpg|alt=A ceramic vase with sunflowers on a yellow surface against a pale blue background.|''[[Sunflowers (painting)|Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers]]'', August 1888.

The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\".{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 331\u2013333}} Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled\".{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc=45\u201353}}\n\nDuring this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light \u2013 almost in a sacred manner.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 331\u2013333}} Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including ''[[View of Arles, Flowering Orchards]]''.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1980|loc=385}} Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles.

The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and perform institutional leadership.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nHeated wrangling took place between the cities of [[Calgary]] and Edmonton over the location of the provincial capital and of the university. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it.<ref name=Rutherford/> The city of Edmonton became the capital and the then-separate city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university. When the two cities were [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] in 1912, Edmonton became both the political and academic capital.\n\nWith [[Henry Marshall Tory]] as its first president, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona, while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction.<ref name=MacLeod>\"All True Things: A History of the University of Alberta, 1908\u20132008\", Rod Macleod, The University of Alberta Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-88864-444-2}}</ref> In a letter to [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up [[University of British Columbia|McGill University College]] in [[Vancouver]], Tory wrote, ''\"If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis.\"''<ref name=ToryQuote>Tory to Rutherford,  March 6, 1906.

But along with these early milestones came the First World War and the global influenza pandemic of 1918, whose toll on the university resulted in a two-month suspension of classes in the fall of 1918.<ref name=MacLeod /> Despite these setbacks, the university continued to grow. By 1920, it had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy).

Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> In 1929, the university established a College of Education. This period of growth was to be short-lived, though, as the Great Depression and the Second World War curtailed enrolment and expansion until 1945.<ref name=Centenary /> The university also gained new public powers.

In addition, the single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary.<ref name=\"pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> By 1966, the [[University of Calgary]] had been established as an autonomous institution.<ref name=\"MacLeod\" />\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, the university enjoyed sustained growth. In 1970, the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Jean began offering French-language instruction in arts, science and education. In 1984, the School of Native Studies was established. Buildings that had been started in the 1960s, such as Biological Sciences and the Central Academic Building, were completed in the early 1970s. Extensive renovations restored the venerable Arts Building, as well as the Athabasca and Pembina halls.<ref name=Centenary /> New buildings completed in the early 1980s included the Business Building and the first phase of the Walter C.

T\u00f6pffe created 7 known comic books, that were extremely succesful, and were translated to many languages in Europe. Comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the US in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.<ref>[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525003144/http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html |date=25 May 2013 }}.

Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 199\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n==American comic books==\n{{main|American comic book}}\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of an english version of the classic european<ref>https://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html</ref> comic book ''[[Histoire de M.

The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"[[small press]]\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"[[minicomic]]s\" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055024/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].\n\n===Graphic novels===\n[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]\n{{Main|Graphic novel}}\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger.

Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974.

(See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\n\n===Advertisements===\n[[Advertising in comic books|Comic book advertisement]]s were a common feature in American comic books from the 1950s to the 1980s. They were typically grouped together on the inside back cover in, displayed in black and white with an illustration of the product. As these advertisements were directed at young people, many made sensational claims and sold the products for a few dollars to be sent to a post office box. Products offered included novelty items and toys.\n\n===History of Race in Comic Books===\n{{Cleanup section|reason=re-write to make less reliant on quotes, better fit WP's style|date=July 2019}}\nMany early iterations of black characters in comics  \"became variations on the 'single stereotypical image of Sambo'.\"<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodall|first=Lowery Anderson|date=2010|title=The Secret Identity of Race: Exploring Ethnic and Racial Portrayals in Superhero Comic Book|url=http://aquila.usm.edu/dissertations/478}}</ref> Sambo was closely related to the coon stereotype but had some subtle differences.

There was a comic created about the 99th squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story the comic the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th squadron defeating his man and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and can't believe they bested his men.\"...[The] Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels...[the] pilots of the 99th squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fighting for equality within America. \"Spider-Man 'made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice'.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> \"The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating' maybe it's important fo[sic] us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin' for'.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This poor portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, \"there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nAsian characters faced some of the same treatment in comics as black characters did.

The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunts the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\n===Webtoons===\n{{Main|Webtoons}}\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwa]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include [[Lezhin]], [[Naver]], and [[Kakao]].\n\n===Chinese manhua===\n{{Main|Manhua}}\n\n==European comics==\n{{Main|European comics}}\n\n===Franco-Belgian comics===\n\n{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] (1926\u20131977), writer of the ''[[Ast\u00e9rix]]'' comic book series.]] \nFrance and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessin\u00e9es'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvi\u00e8me art'' (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, the authors control the publication of most comics.

The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.<ref>Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), \"Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero\", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished.

Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972.

The magazine ''[[TBO (comics)|TBO]]'' was influential in popularizing the medium.

Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 199\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n==American comic books==\n{{main|American comic book}}\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M.

The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"[[small press]]\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"[[minicomic]]s\" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055024/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].\n\n===Graphic novels===\n[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]\n{{Main|Graphic novel}}\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger.

Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974.

(See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\n\n===Advertisements===\n[[Advertising in comic books|Comic book advertisement]]s were a common feature in American comic books from the 1950s to the 1980s. They were typically grouped together on the inside back cover in, displayed in black and white with an illustration of the product. As these advertisements were directed at young people, many made sensational claims and sold the products for a few dollars to be sent to a post office box.

The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunts the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\n===Webtoons===\n{{Main|Webtoons}}\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwa]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include [[Lezhin]], [[Naver]], and [[Kakao]].\n\n===Chinese manhua===\n{{Main|Manhua}}\n\n==European comics==\n{{Main|European comics}}\n\n===Franco-Belgian comics===\n\n{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] (1926\u20131977), writer of the ''[[Ast\u00e9rix]]'' comic book series.]] \nFrance and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessin\u00e9es'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvi\u00e8me art'' (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, the authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\n===British comics===\n{{Main|British comics}}\n\n[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|upright|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.<ref>Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), \"Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero\", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished.

Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972.

It also features cameos from [[RuPaul]], [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Rosie O' Donnell]], [[Barbara Eden]], [[David Spade]], and [[Richard Belzer]]. [[Sequel]] to ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' (1995), it followed its predecessor by placing the 1970s Brady Bunch family in a contemporary 1990s setting, where much of the humor is derived from the resulting culture clash and the utter lack of awareness they show toward their relatively unusual lifestyle.\n\n''A Very Brady Sequel'' was released on August 23, 1996. The film received mixed reviews and was a [[box office]] success, although not as successful as ''The Brady Bunch Movie''. A second sequel, the made-for-television feature ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]'', aired in November 2002.\n\n== Plot ==\nOne evening, a man claiming to be Carol's long-lost first husband, Roy Martin, shows up at the suburban Brady residence. The Bradys believe his story about suffering from amnesia and having plastic surgery after being injured. Mike has been planning a second wedding/renewal of vows for himself and Carol, for an anniversary present without her knowing, although Roy's arrival throws a monkey wrench into things. Throughout Roy's stay, he is openly hostile to them, his sarcasm and insults completely going over their heads. Peter, who is trying to decide what career path to choose, starts idolizing and emulating Roy, which frequently gets him in trouble at the architect firm where Mike works.\n\nGreg and Marcia both want to move out of their shared rooms and when neither wants to back down, they have to share the attic together. When Roy's arrival suggests that Carol and Mike might not be married, Greg and Marcia believe that they are technically not related. This leads them to realize they are in love with each other, but try to hide it from one another throughout the movie. Eventually both cave in and they share a kiss at the end of the movie, but Marcia agrees to let Greg have the attic to himself, until he goes to college.\n\nBobby and Cindy start a \"Detective Agency\" hunting down her missing doll and stumble upon Roy's true intentions. He is actually a con man named Trevor Thomas and is there to steal a familiar horse statue that is actually a $20 million dollar ancient artifact. When they reveal his plans, he kidnaps Carol and takes her and the artifact to Dr. Whitehead, a buyer in [[Hawaii]]. The remaining Brady family travels to Hawaii to save her and foil his plans. Trevor is revealed to have been responsible for the [[Gilligan's Island|boating accident that led to the disappearance]] of Dr. Whitehead's son [[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]] and Carol's first husband, [[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|a professor]], and, in Dr. Whitehead's words \"The Minnow is lost\". Trevor attempts to hold Dr. Whitehead and Carol at gunpoint, but Mike arrives just in time to intervene, and Trevor is arrested and taken to jail. Jan, who made up a pretend boyfriend named George Glass in order to make herself seem more popular, meets a real boy named George Glass during the family's trip to Hawaii, and they become a couple.\n\nAs Mike and Carol renew their vows in a ceremony held at their home, a genie named [[I Dream of Jeannie|Jeannie]] appears, claiming to be Mike's wife.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gary Cole]] as [[Mike Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Mike Brady]]\n* [[Shelley Long]] as [[Carol Brady]]\n* [[Henriette Mantel]] as [[Alice Nelson]]\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[Greg Brady (Brady Bunch)|Greg Brady]]\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as [[Marcia Brady]]\n* Paul Sutera as [[Peter Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Peter Brady]]\n* [[Jennifer Elise Cox]] as [[Jan Brady]]\n* [[Jesse Lee Soffer|Jesse Lee Soffer]] as [[Bobby Brady]]\n* [[Olivia Hack]] as [[Cindy Brady]]\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Roy Martin/Trevor Thomas\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Dr. Whitehead\n\nThe film featured [[cameo appearance]]s from [[RuPaul]] (reprising his role as Mrs. Cummings from the first film), [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] (in her last screen role), [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Barbara Eden]] (reprising her role as Jeannie from ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''), [[David Spade]], and [[Richard Belzer]].\n\n== Release ==\n===Box office===\n''A Very Brady Sequel'' was released in theaters on August 23, 1996.
