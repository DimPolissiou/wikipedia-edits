The film is set in France in the 16th century during one of the [[Second plague pandemic|periodic plague outbreaks]]. Nostradmus meets up with Scaliger in [[Agen]], France.\n\nNostradamus prophecies the [[Henry_II_of_France#Death|death of Henry II]] of France in a jousting match.

[[Ghatotkacha]] was the son of [[Bhima]] and [[Hidimbi]]. Even in his childhood, [https://shyambabadham.com/ Barbarika] was a very brave warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from his mother. The gods (''ashtadeva'') gave him the three infallible arrows.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&lpg=PA431 |title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics |author=[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780226340555 |page=431 |access-date=28 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012600/https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&lpg=PA431 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Hence, Barbarika came to be known as \"Bearer of Three Arrows\".\nWhen Barbarika learnt that battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas had become inevitable, he wanted to witness what was to be the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata War. He promised his mother that if he felt the urge to participate in the battle, he would join the side which would be losing. He rode to the field on his Blue Horse equipped with his three arrows and bow.\n\nBefore the [[Mahabharata]] war began, Lord [[Krishna]] asked all the warriors how many days they would take to finish Mahabharata war alone. [[Bhishma]] answered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. [[Dronacharya]] replied that it would take him 25 days. When [[Karna]] was asked, he said he would take 24 days. [[Arjuna]] told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner, Lord Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nKrishna disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute. Krishna then asked Barbarika how he'd finish the great battle with just three arrows. Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that, the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. If he uses the second arrow, then the second arrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow, it will destroy all the things that are not marked and then return to his quiver. In other words, with one arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other he can destroy them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nKrishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of the Peepal tree under which he was standing, using his arrows. Barbarika Baliyadev accepts the challenge and starts meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. As Barbarika starts meditating, Krishna quietly plucks a leaf from the tree and hides it under his foot. When Barbarika releases his first arrow, it marks all the leaves of the tree and finally started hovering around the leg of Krishna. Krishna asks Barbarika why the arrow was hovering over his foot. [https://shyambabadham.com/ Barbarika] replies that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting his foot to mark the leaf that is hidden underneath. Barbarika advises Krishna to lift his leg, otherwise the arrow would mark the leaf by piercing Krishna's foot. Krishna then lifts his foot and the first arrow also marks the hidden leaf. The third arrow then collects all the leaves (including the hidden leaf ) and ties them together. By this Krishna concludes that the arrows are so powerful and infallible, that even if Barbarika is unaware of the whereabouts of his targets, his arrows can still navigate and trace his intended targets. The moral of this incident is that, in a real battle field, if Krishna wants to isolate someone (for example: the 5 Pandava brothers) and hide them elsewhere in order to prevent them from being Barbarika's victim, he would not be successful as the arrows could trace even the hidden targets and destroy them. So, nobody would be able to escape from these arrows. Thus Krishna gets a deeper insight about Barbarika's phenomenal power.\n\nKrishna then asks the boy whom he would favour in the war. [https://shyambabadham.com/ Barbarika] reveals that he intends to fight for the side whichever is weak. As the Pandavas have only seven [[Akshauhini]] armies compared to the eleven of the Kauravas, he considers that the Pandavas to be relatively the weaker side and hence wants to support them. But Krishna asks him, if he had seriously given a thought about the consequences, before giving such a word to his mother (about supporting the weaker side). Barbarika assumes that his support, to the relatively weaker Pandava side, will make them victorious. But, Krishna reveals the actual consequences of his word to his mother:\n\nKrishna tells that whichever side he supports will end up making the other side weaker due to his power. Nobody will be able to defeat him. Hence, as he will be forced switch sides to support the other side that has become weaker (due to his word to his mother). Thus, in an actual war, he will keep oscillating between two sides, thereby destroying the entire army of both sides and eventually only he would remain. Subsequently, none of the sides would become victorious and he would be the lone survivor. Hence, Krishna avoids his participation in the war by seeking his head in charity.\n\n==Krishna's leg==\nThe other version of story tells that the first arrow indeed pierces Krishna's leg and marks the leaf that is hidden under Krishna's foot. This becomes a weak spot of Sri Krishna. Prior to this event, Krishna also gets a boon from sage [[Durvasa]] by which his entire body with the exception of his leg, will be immune to all weapons. Hence, only his leg will be vulnerable. Sri Krishna who is a perfect manifestation of Vishnu, is said to have allowed this to occur by his own will. Later, in the Mausala Parva, a hunter by name Jara, hits Krishna's heel with an arrow, mistaking him for a deer. This led to the disappearance of Sri Krishna and because Krishna wanted to wrap up his transcendental pastime on the Earth, this incident took place by the supreme will of Krishna himself. This weak spot on Krishna's foot was first created by Barbarika's arrow in summary.\n\n==The other interpretation of three arrows==\nThe three arrows are signs of three 'taapa's that a human being experiences. These include the physical, the mental and the emotional turmoils, conflicts and confusions that are found almost everywhere. These three 'taapa's are cleared with chanting of name of Shri Krishna. Thus, giving Barabarika the name [https://shyambabadham.com/ \"Shyaam\"], the Lord intended to remove the three 'taapa's of human life, symbolized by the three arrows, without which it might not be possible to destroy or overcome the 'taapa's.\n\nOne another legend says that the three arrows of Barabarika can be used as follows: First arrow to mark all the near and dear ones, relatives, etc., Second arrow to mark the people who are not part of the war or who are not taking any side in the war, and the third arrow to destroy everything that is not marked by first and second arrows. This was the speciality of Barbarika's three arrows.\n\n==Act of charity==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Reengus Temple Art6.JPG|thumb|Barbarika donates his head to [[Krishna]].]]\n\nKrishna then explained to him that before a battle, the head of the bravest Kshatriya needs to be sacrificed, in order to worship/sanctify the battlefield. Krishna said that he considered Barbarika to be the bravest among Kshatriyas, and was hence asking for his head in charity. In fulfillment of his promise, and in compliance with the Krishna's command, Barbarika gave his head to him in charity. This happened on the 12th day of the Shukla Paksha (bright half) of the month of Phalgun on Tuesday. Barbarika was a Yaksha in his previous birth. Once Lord [[Brahma]] and several other Devas came to [[Vaikuntha]] and complained to Lord [[Vishnu]] that the [[Adharma]] on Earth was increasing; it was not possible for them to bear the tortures causes by the wicked people. Hence they came to seek the help of Lord Vishnu to check them. Lord Vishnu told the Devas that he will soon be incarnated on Earth as a human being and destroy all the evil forces. Then, a Yaksha told the Devas that he alone is enough to kill all evil elements on the Earth, and it was not necessary for Lord Vishnu to descend to Earth. This hurt Lord Brahma very much. Lord Brahma cursed this Yaksha that whenever the time comes to eliminate all the evil forces on Earth, then Lord Vishnu will first kill him. Later, the [[Yaksha]] takes birth as Barbarika and Lord Krishna seeks his head in charity as a result of this curse. Since that day Human Barbarika become the Khatu Shyam, The Incarnation of Lord Krishna as Barbarika given his head and God Krishna himself entered in him called as Manifest.\n\n==Bearing witness to the war==\nBefore decapitating himself, Barbarika told Krishna of his great desire to view the forthcoming battle and requested him to facilitate the same. Krishna agreed and placed the head on top of a hill overlooking the battlefield. From the hill, the head of Barbarika watched the entire battle.\n\nAt the end of the battle, the victorious Pandava brothers argued among themselves as to who was responsible for their victory. Krishna suggested that Barbarika's head, which had watched the whole battle should be allowed to judge. Barbarika's head suggested that it was Krishna alone who was responsible for the victory.\nBarbarika replies, \u201cAll I could see were two things. One, a divine chakra spinning all around the battle field, killing all those who were not on the side of Dharma. The other was the [[Draupadi]] who has taken her original form of Goddess [[Mahakali]], who spread out her tongue on the battle field and consumed all the sinners as her sacrifice\". Listening to this, [[Pandava]]s realized that it was Lord [[Narayana]] and Goddess [[Parvati]] (Mahakali) who actually cleaned up the world from Adharma, and the Pandavas were mere instruments. After the war Barbarika\u2019s head was joined with the his body and he left that place for narrating the whole world to maintain peace. \n\nHis other name is God Kamrunaag and is venerated as the preeminent deity in District Mandi, in Himachal Pradesh. A pond and a temple are situated in Kamru hill in Sundernagar, District Mandi. He witnessed the entire battle of Kurukshetra from the hill which is now known as [[Khatushyam Temple]], located in [[Khatu]] village in [[Sikar district|Sikar District]], [[Rajasthan]]. An impressive and especially sacred Temple of Baliyadev, Barbarik is situated at village [[Lambha]] in [[Ahmedabad District]], [[Gujarat]].\n\n==Observances and festivals==\nBarbarika is worshiped as Shyam, he is not the supreme personality of godhead Sri krishna. Or any of krishna's incarnation but maybe considered as the great devotee of Krishna. And since the glories of krishna's devotee is more than krishna himself people worships khatushyam also. Therefore, the flavour of the festivities reflects the playful and vibrant nature of Krishna. The festivals of [[Krishna Janmaashtami]], ''Jhool Jhulani Ekadashi'', [[Holi]] and ''[[Vasant Panchami]]'' are celebrated with gusto in the temple. The ''Phalguna Mela'' detailed below is the principal annual festival.\n\nLacs of devotees visit the temple every day. Newly married couples come to pay homage and newborn babies are brought to the temple for their ''mundan'' (the first hair-shaving) ceremony. An elaborate [[aarti]] is performed at the temple five times a day. These are:\n* ''Mangala Aarti'': performed in the early morning, when temple is open.\n* ''Shringaar Aarti'': performed at the time of make-up of Baba Shyam. The idol is grandly ornamented for this aarti.\n* ''Bhog Aarti'': performed at noon when ''bhog'' ([[Prasadam]]) is served to the Lord.\n* ''Sandhya Aarti'': performed in the evening, at sunset.\n\nTwo special hymns, the \"Shri Shyam Aarti\" and the \"Shri Shyam Vinati,\" are chanted on all these occasions. The Shyam mantra is another litany of the Lord's names that is chanted by devotees.\n\nOther particular observances include:\n\n'''Shukla Ekadashi and Dwadashi:''' The 11th and 12th days of the bright half of every month in the Hindu calendar is of special significance to the temple. This is because Barbarika was born on the 11th day of the bright half of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], and he donated his head (''Sheesh'') to Krishna on the 12th day of the bright half of the month of phaagun on Tuesday. ''Darshan'' on these two days is therefore considered auspicious and devotees come in their thousands every month. The temple remains open throughout the night that falls between these days. Night-long ''[[Bhajan]]'' sessions are organised since devotees traditionally pass the night in singing the praises of the Lord. Devotees organise Bhajan programmes and invite Bhajan singers to sing devotional songs.\n\n'''Bathing in the Shyam Kund:''' This is the holy pond near the temple from which the idol was retrieved. It is believed that a dip in this pond cures a person from ailments and brings good health. Filled with devotional fervor, people take ritual dips in the ''Shyam Kund.'' They believe that this will relieve them of diseases and contagion. Bathing during the annual [[Phalguna Mela in Khatushyamji|Phalguna Mela]] festival is deemed specially salutary.\n\n'''Nishan Yatra:''' It is believed that your wishes are granted if you offer a ''Nishan'' at the temple. A ''Nishan'' is a triangular flag of a particular size, made of cloth, which is hoisted on a bamboo stick. It is carried in one's hands while covering the route from the town of Ringas to Khatu (17&nbsp;km) on (bare) foot. ''Nishans'' are offered in millions during the ''Phalguna Mela.''\n\n'''[[Phalguna Mela]]:''' The most important festival associated with the temple is the [[Phalguna Mela in Khatushyamji|Phalguna Mela]] which occurs just 8\u20139 days before from the festival of [[Holi]]. Barbarika's head appeared on ''Phalguna Shuddha Ekadashi,'' the 11th day of the bright half of the Hindu month of [[Phalguna]]. Therefore, the fair is held from the 9th to the 12th of that month. The fair has now been extended to nearly 12\u201315 days of the bright half of the Phalguna Month.\n\n[[File:Khatushyamji Rath1.JPG|thumb|200px|Khatushyamji Rath idol during [[Padayatra|Pad Yatra]] from [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] to Khatushyamji in 2008 ]]\n\nOn this holy occasion pilgrims all over the country come here on foot with [[nishaan]]s (holy mark - [[flag]]s) in their hands. People enjoy their holy journey by singing ''[[Khatushyamji|shyam]] [[bhajan]]s'' and playing various musical instruments. They enjoy the journey by playing ''holi'' with [[gulal]]. Many Shyam [[Bhakta]]s supply food to pedestrians in the shade of tents. They encourage also to complete their journey with full enthusiasm. They enjoy this occasion as the marriage of Khatushyamji.

The original Sanskrit name ''Barbar\u012bka'' is often replaced in Rajasthan by the [[Hindi]] version, ''Barbar\u012bk'', often written as ''Barbareek''.\n\nIn the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', '''Barbareeka''', '''Baliyadev''' ([[IAST]] Barbar\u012bka) was the son of [[Ghatotkacha]] and Maurvi, daughter of Daitya Moor, a [[Yadu|Yadava]] king,<ref name=\"Parmeshwaranand2001\">{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|first=Swami|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6F0ZIBIL2ZAC|year=2001|publisher=Sarup & Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-226-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6F0ZIBIL2ZAC/page/n161 155]}}</ref> though other references state he is a warrior from the south. Barbareeka was originally a [[yaksha]], reborn as a man. He was bound by his principle of always fighting on the losing side, which led him to stand witness to the battle of [[Mahabharata]] without taking part in it. In Nepali culture, Kirata King [[Yalamber]] of [[Nepal]], is portrayed as Barbareeka while Native of Kathmandu Valley portray him as [[Akash Bhairav]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/02-13/features2739.htm |title={title} |access-date=17 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225033948/http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/02-13/features2739.htm |archive-date=25 February 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Rajasthan]], he is worshipped as Khatushyamji, and in [[Gujarat]], he is worshipped as Baliyadev is believed to have been sacrificed before the Mahabharata war to ensure the victory of his grandfathers, the [[Pandavas]]. In return for his sacrifice, he was deified by a boon given by [[Krishna]]. He is much worshipped in Rajasthan.\n\n==Other names==\n*'''Barbarika:''' Khatushyam's childhood name was Barbarika. His mother and relatives used to call him by this name before the name Shyam was given by Krishna.\n*'''Sheesh Ke Daani:''' Literally: \"Donor of Head\"; As per the legend related above.\n*'''Haare Ka Sahara:''' Literally: \"Support of the defeated\"; Upon his mother's advise, Barbarika resolved to support whoever has less power and is losing. Hence he is known by this name.\n*'''Teen Baan Dhaari:''' Literally: \"Bearer of three arrows\"; Reference is to the three infallible arrows that he received as boon from God [[Shiva]].

[[Ghatotkacha]] was the son of [[Bhima]] and [[Hidimba]]. Even in his childhood, [https://shyambabadham.com/ Barbarika] was a very brave warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from his mother. The gods (''ashtadeva'') gave him the three infallible arrows.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&lpg=PA431 |title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics |author=[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780226340555 |page=431 |access-date=28 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012600/https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&lpg=PA431 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Hence, Barbarika came to be known as \"Bearer of Three Arrows\".\nWhen Barbarika learnt that battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas had become inevitable, he wanted to witness what was to be the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata War. He promised his mother that if he felt the urge to participate in the battle, he would join the side which would be losing. He rode to the field on his Blue Horse equipped with his three arrows and bow.\n\nBefore the [[Mahabharata]] war began, Lord [[Krishna]] asked all the warriors how many days they would take to finish Mahabharata war alone. [[Bhishma]] answered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. [[Dronacharya]] replied that it would take him 25 days. When [[Karna]] was asked, he said he would take 24 days. [[Arjuna]] told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner, Lord Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nKrishna disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute. Krishna then asked Barbarika how he'd finish the great battle with just three arrows. Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that, the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. If he uses the second arrow, then the second arrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow, it will destroy all the things that are not marked and then return to his quiver. In other words, with one arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other he can destroy them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nKrishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of the Peepal tree under which he was standing, using his arrows. Barbarika Baliyadev accepts the challenge and starts meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. As Barbarika starts meditating, Krishna quietly plucks a leaf from the tree and hides it under his foot. When Barbarika releases his first arrow, it marks all the leaves of the tree and finally started hovering around the leg of Krishna. Krishna asks Barbarika why the arrow was hovering over his foot. [https://shyambabadham.com/ Barbarika] replies that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting his foot to mark the leaf that is hidden underneath. Barbarika advises Krishna to lift his leg, otherwise the arrow would mark the leaf by piercing Krishna's foot. Krishna then lifts his foot and the first arrow also marks the hidden leaf. The third arrow then collects all the leaves (including the hidden leaf ) and ties them together. By this Krishna concludes that the arrows are so powerful and infallible, that even if Barbarika is unaware of the whereabouts of his targets, his arrows can still navigate and trace his intended targets. The moral of this incident is that, in a real battle field, if Krishna wants to isolate someone (for example: the 5 Pandava brothers) and hide them elsewhere in order to prevent them from being Barbarika's victim, he would not be successful as the arrows could trace even the hidden targets and destroy them. So, nobody would be able to escape from these arrows. Thus Krishna gets a deeper insight about Barbarika's phenomenal power.\n\nKrishna then asks the boy whom he would favour in the war. [https://shyambabadham.com/ Barbarika] reveals that he intends to fight for the side whichever is weak. As the Pandavas have only seven [[Akshauhini]] armies compared to the eleven of the Kauravas, he considers that the Pandavas to be relatively the weaker side and hence wants to support them. But Krishna asks him, if he had seriously given a thought about the consequences, before giving such a word to his mother (about supporting the weaker side). Barbarika assumes that his support, to the relatively weaker Pandava side, will make them victorious. But, Krishna reveals the actual consequences of his word to his mother:\n\nKrishna tells that whichever side he supports will end up making the other side weaker due to his power. Nobody will be able to defeat him. Hence, as he will be forced switch sides to support the other side that has become weaker (due to his word to his mother). Thus, in an actual war, he will keep oscillating between two sides, thereby destroying the entire army of both sides and eventually only he would remain. Subsequently, none of the sides would become victorious and he would be the lone survivor. Hence, Krishna avoids his participation in the war by seeking his head in charity.\n\n==Krishna's leg==\nThe other version of story tells that the first arrow indeed pierces Krishna's leg and marks the leaf that is hidden under Krishna's foot. This becomes a weak spot of Sri Krishna. Prior to this event, Krishna also gets a boon from sage [[Durvasa]] by which his entire body with the exception of his leg, will be immune to all weapons. Hence, only his leg will be vulnerable. Sri Krishna who is a perfect manifestation of Vishnu, is said to have allowed this to occur by his own will. Later, in the Mausala Parva, a hunter by name Jara, hits Krishna's heel with an arrow, mistaking him for a deer. This led to the disappearance of Sri Krishna and because Krishna wanted to wrap up his transcendental pastime on the Earth, this incident took place by the supreme will of Krishna himself. This weak spot on Krishna's foot was first created by Barbarika's arrow in summary.\n\n==The other interpretation of three arrows==\nThe three arrows are signs of three 'taapa's that a human being experiences. These include the physical, the mental and the emotional turmoils, conflicts and confusions that are found almost everywhere. These three 'taapa's are cleared with chanting of name of Shri Krishna. Thus, giving Barabarika the name [https://shyambabadham.com/ \"Shyaam\"], the Lord intended to remove the three 'taapa's of human life, symbolized by the three arrows, without which it might not be possible to destroy or overcome the 'taapa's.\n\nOne another legend says that the three arrows of Barabarika can be used as follows: First arrow to mark all the near and dear ones, relatives, etc., Second arrow to mark the people who are not part of the war or who are not taking any side in the war, and the third arrow to destroy everything that is not marked by first and second arrows. This was the speciality of Barbarika's three arrows.\n\n==Act of charity==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Reengus Temple Art6.JPG|thumb|Barbarika donates his head to [[Krishna]].]]\n\nKrishna then explained to him that before a battle, the head of the bravest Kshatriya needs to be sacrificed, in order to worship/sanctify the battlefield. Krishna said that he considered Barbarika to be the bravest among Kshatriyas, and was hence asking for his head in charity. In fulfillment of his promise, and in compliance with the Krishna's command, Barbarika gave his head to him in charity. This happened on the 12th day of the Shukla Paksha (bright half) of the month of Phalgun on Tuesday. Barbarika was a Yaksha in his previous birth. Once Lord [[Brahma]] and several other Devas came to [[Vaikuntha]] and complained to Lord [[Vishnu]] that the [[Adharma]] on Earth was increasing; it was not possible for them to bear the tortures causes by the wicked people. Hence they came to seek the help of Lord Vishnu to check them. Lord Vishnu told the Devas that he will soon be incarnated on Earth as a human being and destroy all the evil forces. Then, a Yaksha told the Devas that he alone is enough to kill all evil elements on the Earth, and it was not necessary for Lord Vishnu to descend to Earth. This hurt Lord Brahma very much. Lord Brahma cursed this Yaksha that whenever the time comes to eliminate all the evil forces on Earth, then Lord Vishnu will first kill him. Later, the [[Yaksha]] takes birth as Barbarika and Lord Krishna seeks his head in charity as a result of this curse. Since that day Human Barbarika become the Khatu Shyam, The Incarnation of Lord Krishna as Barbarika given his head and God Krishna himself entered in him called as Manifest.\n\n==Bearing witness to the war==\nBefore decapitating himself, Barbarika told Krishna of his great desire to view the forthcoming battle and requested him to facilitate the same. Krishna agreed and placed the head on top of a hill overlooking the battlefield. From the hill, the head of Barbarika watched the entire battle.\n\nAt the end of the battle, the victorious Pandava brothers argued among themselves as to who was responsible for their victory. Krishna suggested that Barbarika's head, which had watched the whole battle should be allowed to judge. Barbarika's head suggested that it was Krishna alone who was responsible for the victory.\nBarbarika replies, \u201cAll I could see were two things. One, a divine chakra spinning all around the battle field, killing all those who were not on the side of Dharma. The other was the [[Draupadi]] who has taken her original form of Goddess [[Mahakali]], who spread out her tongue on the battle field and consumed all the sinners as her sacrifice\". Listening to this, [[Pandava]]s realized that it was Lord [[Narayana]] and Goddess [[Parvati]] (Mahakali) who actually cleaned up the world from Adharma, and the Pandavas were mere instruments. After the war Barbarika\u2019s head was joined with the his body and he left that place for narrating the whole world to maintain peace. \n\nHis other name is God Kamrunaag and is venerated as the preeminent deity in District Mandi, in Himachal Pradesh. A pond and a temple are situated in Kamru hill in Sundernagar, District Mandi. He witnessed the entire battle of Kurukshetra from the hill which is now known as [[Khatushyam Temple]], located in [[Khatu]] village in [[Sikar district|Sikar District]], [[Rajasthan]]. An impressive and especially sacred Temple of Baliyadev, Barbarik is situated at village [[Lambha]] in [[Ahmedabad District]], [[Gujarat]].\n\n==Observances and festivals==\nBarbarika is worshiped as Shyam, he is not the supreme personality of godhead Sri krishna. Or any of krishna's incarnation but maybe considered as the great devotee of Krishna. And since the glories of krishna's devotee is more than krishna himself people worships khatushyam also. Therefore, the flavour of the festivities reflects the playful and vibrant nature of Krishna. The festivals of [[Krishna Janmaashtami]], ''Jhool Jhulani Ekadashi'', [[Holi]] and ''[[Vasant Panchami]]'' are celebrated with gusto in the temple. The ''Phalguna Mela'' detailed below is the principal annual festival.\n\nLacs of devotees visit the temple every day. Newly married couples come to pay homage and newborn babies are brought to the temple for their ''mundan'' (the first hair-shaving) ceremony. An elaborate [[aarti]] is performed at the temple five times a day. These are:\n* ''Mangala Aarti'': performed in the early morning, when temple is open.\n* ''Shringaar Aarti'': performed at the time of make-up of Baba Shyam. The idol is grandly ornamented for this aarti.\n* ''Bhog Aarti'': performed at noon when ''bhog'' ([[Prasadam]]) is served to the Lord.\n* ''Sandhya Aarti'': performed in the evening, at sunset.\n\nTwo special hymns, the \"Shri Shyam Aarti\" and the \"Shri Shyam Vinati,\" are chanted on all these occasions. The Shyam mantra is another litany of the Lord's names that is chanted by devotees.\n\nOther particular observances include:\n\n'''Shukla Ekadashi and Dwadashi:''' The 11th and 12th days of the bright half of every month in the Hindu calendar is of special significance to the temple. This is because Barbarika was born on the 11th day of the bright half of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], and he donated his head (''Sheesh'') to Krishna on the 12th day of the bright half of the month of phaagun on Tuesday. ''Darshan'' on these two days is therefore considered auspicious and devotees come in their thousands every month. The temple remains open throughout the night that falls between these days. Night-long ''[[Bhajan]]'' sessions are organised since devotees traditionally pass the night in singing the praises of the Lord. Devotees organise Bhajan programmes and invite Bhajan singers to sing devotional songs.\n\n'''Bathing in the Shyam Kund:''' This is the holy pond near the temple from which the idol was retrieved.

However, by late 2007, despite the centre not yet having opened, the costs had blown out to over A$41.7 million, with interest repayments likely to extend the council's liability to A$66 million.\n\nOn 27 July 2007, a full public inquiry was announced by the [[Minister for Local Government (New South Wales)|Minister for Local Government]], [[Paul Lynch (politician)|Paul Lynch]]. The inquiry reported its findings in February 2008.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.dlg.nsw.gov.au/dlg/dlghome/documents/Information/PMHC%20Public%20Inquiry%20Report%20Volume%201.pdf|title=Port Macquarie-Hastings Council - Public Inquiry - Inquiry Report Volume 1|last=Willan|first=Frank|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|isbn=1-920766-69-3|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref> It found that the council had failed to provide appropriate financial and project management and had lost control of the costs, that the project costs had harmed the council's ability to provide services and amenities to the community, and that the council's communications management strategy had resulted in inadequate consultation with the public and inappropriate regard to their concerns. The Minister for Local Government dismissed the council and its mayor, Rob Drew, and appointed an administrator upon receiving the inquiry's report. Drew was critical of the process throughout, maintaining that errors had been made and misinformation had been accepted as fact; however, the New South Wales Urban Task Force, a property development lobby group, believed the sacking served as a warning to other councils to stick to \"core responsibilities\".<ref name=abc_6mar08/>\n\nThe events continued to impact upon the community and the individuals involved. At a [[Lyne by-election, 2008|federal by-election]] for the normally safe [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] seat of [[Division of Lyne|Lyne]] in which Port Macquarie is located, the former mayor, who was the endorsed National candidate, failed to win against [[Rob Oakeshott]], an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] politician, and a former state member of parliament who had been openly critical of the council throughout the drama. During the period under administration, voluntary redundancies were offered to 27 staff in order to improve the council's financial position.\n\nIn 2012, the community elected a representative council and mayor, replacing the administrator appointed in 2008.\n\n==Background==\nOn 30 March 1999, the Council met to initiate planning for a centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie [[central business district]]. It recommended a project plan be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached the management of the neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million.<ref name=chap3>Inquiry report, chapter 3.</ref> The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to go it alone. The new centre became an icon building under the direction of the Council's General Manager, managed by a Project Control group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15&ndash;A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million.<ref name=\"chap3\"/> This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.<ref name=stateline>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/nsw/content/2006/s2002408.htm|work=Stateline |title=People in glasshouses...|publisher=ABCTV |location=Australia |format=transcript |date=10 August 2007 |last=Dempster |first=Quentin |authorlink=Quentin Dempster |accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n==The Payne report==\nIn October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government announced it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try to determine whether it properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/10/27/1774711.htm|title=Govt to investigate Macquarie-Hastings cultural centre costs|work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=27 October 2006|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref> The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the {{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Local Government Act, 1993}}, which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate any aspect of a Council or of its work or activities.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s430.html Section 430], Local Government Act 1993</ref> The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and that there had been a failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a [[Royal Commission]],<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s740.html Section 740] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408152603/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s740.html |date=8 April 2008 }}, Local Government Act 1993</ref> be held.

The key finding was that the Council and its Councillors had not been rigorous in seeking accurate information about the project, had been swayed by developers and supporters and had failed to plan and manage the project and had lost control of the \"uncontrollably escalating\" cost. The result was an adverse impact upon works and services in other areas of the Council's operation. The Glasshouse, in the commissioner's view, would not have been able to generate the projected income once it opened. It further found that the community had been \"consistently misled\", that the Council had improperly used its support group to campaign against critics and its \"communication strategies have driven its processes\". The Council had therefore failed to meet its charter. Willan recommended to the Minister that all civic offices be declared vacant, an administrator be appointed, and that changes to the way Councils dealt with their own proposals be enacted.<ref>Inquiry Report, pp. 322&ndash;337.</ref>\n\n==Sacking and aftermath==\nUpon the report's release, the Local Government Minister, Paul Lynch, concluded on 27 February 2008 that it gave him no choice but to dismiss the Council and appoint [[Dick Persson]], who had administered [[Warringah Council]] in 2003, to serve as administrator. He said of the development, \"What seems to have happened is that a reasonable community facility has been treated by the Council as an icon which must be built come hell or high water, regardless of the cost to ratepayers.\" He emphasised that in his view, incompetence rather than corruption was the reason for the cost blowout, which would reach A$66 million once interest repayments were accounted for. The outgoing Mayor, Rob Drew, criticised the dismissal, calling it \"atrocious\".<ref name=\"abc-sacking\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://wauchope.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/council-sacked/268504.aspx?storypage=0|title=Council sacked|work=Wauchope Gazette|date=27 February 2008|accessdate=14 February 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717161903/http://wauchope.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/council-sacked/268504.aspx?storypage=0|archive-date=17 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe New South Wales Urban Task Force, a property development lobby group, believed the sacking served as a warning to other Councils to stick to \"core responsibilities\",<ref name=abc_6mar08>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/06/2181446.htm|title=Task force says council sacking a warning to others|work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=6 March 2008|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref> and in late March, the administrator adopted stricter financial measures listed in an independent review of the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/28/2201312.htm|title=Glasshouse failings prompt stricter financial measures |work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=28 March 2008|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn September and October 2008, by-elections in the Port Macquarie area at both federal and state level gave a new forum to some of the players in the controversy.

The inquiry reported its findings in February 2008.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.dlg.nsw.gov.au/dlg/dlghome/documents/Information/PMHC%20Public%20Inquiry%20Report%20Volume%201.pdf|title=Port Macquarie-Hastings Council - Public Inquiry - Inquiry Report Volume 1|last=Willan|first=Frank|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|isbn=1-920766-69-3|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref> It found that the Council had failed to provide appropriate financial and project management and had lost control of the costs, that the project costs had harmed the Council's ability to provide services and amenities to the community, and that the Council's communications management strategy had resulted in inadequate consultation with the public and inappropriate regard to their concerns. The Minister for Local Government dismissed the Council and its Mayor, Rob Drew, and appointed an administrator upon receiving the inquiry's report. Drew was critical of the process throughout, maintaining that errors had been made and misinformation had been accepted as fact; however, the New South Wales Urban Task Force, a property development lobby group, believed the sacking served as a warning to other Councils to stick to \"core responsibilities\".<ref name=abc_6mar08/>\n\nThe events continued to impact upon the community and the individuals involved. At a [[Lyne by-election, 2008|federal by-election]] for the normally safe [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] seat of [[Division of Lyne|Lyne]] in which Port Macquarie is located, the former mayor, who was the endorsed National candidate, failed to win against [[Rob Oakeshott]], an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] politician, and a former state member of parliament who had been openly critical of the Council throughout the drama. During the period under administration, voluntary redundancies were offered to 27 staff in order to improve the Council's financial position.\n\nIn 2012, the community elected a representative Council and Mayor; replacing the administrator appointed in 2008.\n\n==Background==\nOn 30 March 1999, the Council met to initiate planning for a centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie [[central business district]]. It recommended a project plan be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached the management of the neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million.<ref name=chap3>Inquiry report, chapter 3.</ref> The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to go it alone. The new centre became an icon building under the direction of the Council's General Manager, managed by a Project Control group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15&ndash;A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million.<ref name=\"chap3\"/> This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.<ref name=stateline>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/nsw/content/2006/s2002408.htm|work=Stateline |title=People in glasshouses...|publisher=ABCTV |location=Australia |format=transcript |date=10 August 2007 |last=Dempster |first=Quentin |authorlink=Quentin Dempster |accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n==The Payne report==\nIn October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government announced it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try to determine whether it properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/10/27/1774711.htm|title=Govt to investigate Macquarie-Hastings cultural centre costs|work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=27 October 2006|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref> The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the {{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Local Government Act, 1993}}, which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate any aspect of a Council or of its work or activities.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s430.html Section 430], Local Government Act 1993</ref> The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and that there had been a failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a [[Royal Commission]],<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s740.html Section 740] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408152603/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s740.html |date=8 April 2008 }}, Local Government Act 1993</ref> be held.

The key finding was that the Council and its Councillors had not been rigorous in seeking accurate information about the project, had been swayed by developers and supporters and had failed to plan and manage the project and had lost control of the \"uncontrollably escalating\" cost. The result was an adverse impact upon works and services in other areas of the Council's operation. The Glasshouse, in the commissioner's view, would not have been able to generate the projected income once it opened. It further found that the community had been \"consistently misled\", that the Council had improperly used its support group to campaign against critics and its \"communication strategies have driven its processes\". The Council had therefore failed to meet its charter. Willan recommended to the Minister that all civic offices be declared vacant, an administrator be appointed, and that changes to the way Councils dealt with their own proposals be enacted.<ref>Inquiry Report, pp. 322&ndash;337.</ref>\n\n==Sacking and aftermath==\nUpon the report's release, the Local Government Minister, Paul Lynch, concluded on 27 February 2008 that it gave him no choice but to dismiss the Council and appoint [[Dick Persson]], who had administered [[Warringah Council]] in 2003, to serve as administrator. He said of the development, \"What seems to have happened is that a reasonable community facility has been treated by the Council as an icon which must be built come hell or high water, regardless of the cost to ratepayers.\" He emphasised that in his view, incompetence rather than corruption was the reason for the cost blowout, which would reach A$66 million once interest repayments were accounted for.

Nevertheless, prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. The Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in, addressing the matter together.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by National Democracy's far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}} According to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}}\n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

Most of the \"enthusiastic greeters\" of the Red Army were [[Belarusians]].{{sfn|Tec|1993|p=17}} In what [[Jan Gross]] has termed \"the institutionalization of resentment\", the occupiers used privileges and punishments to accommodate and encourage ethnic and religious differences among the local population.{{sfn|Holc|2002|p=454}}\n\nAccording to Anna Bikont, the Soviets brought in Russian and atheistic anti-religious policies: Poland's Hebrew schools were shut by the Soviets, who banned holy days that Poland had recognized, such as [[Yom Kippur]], and appropriated shops and businesses, which were mostly Jewish.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|pp=146\u2013148}} Some Jews and Belarusians formed militias (known as ''\"opaskowcy\"'' for their red armbands).{{sfn|Wierzbicki|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BbvQbiaqAEC&pg=PA151 151]}} Local people said Jews had helped the [[NKVD]] compile lists of Poles to be sent to the \"Soviet interior\".{{sfn|Strzembosz|2002|p=6}} A total of 22,353 Poles (entire families) were deported from the vicinity.{{efn|\"Following his detailed Report of the Jedwabne Investigation, [[Leon Kieres]] responds to questions from the Senate.

The Nazis distributed antisemitic propaganda, and there were reports that Jews had welcomed the Soviets; this \"strengthened the widely held stereotype of [[Judaeo-communism]] which had been promoted by right-wing parties before the war\".{{sfn|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2019|p=334}} In parallel, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] organized special ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (\"task forces\") to murder Jews in these areas, and a few massacres were carried out. The guidelines for such massacres were formulated by [[Reinhard Heydrich]],{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d9Wg4gjtP3cC&pg=PA262 262]}} who ordered his officers to induce anti-Jewish incidents in the territories newly occupied by the German forces, including pogroms. \"Hooliganism set the tone\", according to [[Michael C. Steinlauf]].{{sfn|Steinlauf|1997|p=31}}\n\n===Tension in Jedwabne===\nThree days into the invasion, six Poles (three ethnic Poles and three Jews) who had collaborated with the Soviets were lynched in Jedwabne; they were reportedly either tortured to death by the locals or beaten by locals then shot by the Germans. The same day, two wives of Jewish activists for the Soviets who had evacuated with the Red Army committed suicide with their children. Other Jews faced robberies and attacks, which the Germans tolerated. Anti-Jewish sentiment was high in Jedwabne and antisemitic violence broke out in pogroms across the newly German-occupied [[Podlasie]] region.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=411}} In the first days of the occupation of Jedwabne, Persak writes, the Germans set up a Field Gendarmerie (''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]''), staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} These established cooperation with a new town council, headed by the brother-in-law of a previous mayor, Marian Karolak. According to Persak, the Germans probably also allowed the formation of a Polish volunteer [[town guard]]. Some of these may have been resistance fighters during the Soviet occupation who later joined the German auxiliary police, because Polish testimonials refer to them as ''szucman'', from ''[[Schutzmannschaft]]''.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}\n\n===Pogroms===\nPolish villagers participated in massacres of Jews, with varying degrees of German involvement, in 23 localities of the \u0141om\u017ca and Bia\u0142ystok areas of the [[Podlasie]] region after the occupation.

In his view it was a reference to functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' or ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'') meeting with town-hall officials. The witnesses said after the pogrom that they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews. The mayor, Marian Karolak, is said by witnesses to have played a central role; his brother-in-law ran the town's temporary municipal board.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014 functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before the pogrom that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Findings of Investigation S1/00/Zn, July 2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AfeGB5yz0ooC&pg=PA133 133]}} According to another account, by historian [[Tomasz Strzembosz]], men from nearby villages arrived by order of the German-appointed Jedwabne mayor Marian Karolak and the German paramilitaries (''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]'') billeted to the town.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} According to [[Peter Longerich]], \"closer analysis of the crime\" shows that the pogrom was \"engineered by a unit of the German Security Police\", probably a unit from the [[Zichenau]] Gestapo office that had been assigned to ''[[Einsatzgruppe B]]'', and which \"had recruited local Poles as auxiliary 'pogrom police'\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=196}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre.

They therefore saw Germans as liberators when they arrived in 1941; paired with historical antisemitism, the conditions were right for German incitement according to the [[Reich Main Security Office]] directive on \"folk pogroms\" of 29 June.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<!--primary sources: Several Jewish eyewitnesses reported that the Germans were directly involved in rounding up and abusing Jews in the town square, and that they shot at Jews who tried to escape from the burning barn.

The book includes articles from Polish and other historians, the IPN's ''Findings of Investigation S1/00/Zn into the Murder of Polish Citizens of Jewish Origin in the Town of Jedwabne on 10 July 1941'' (July 2002), and essays from Polish newspapers such as ''[[Rzeczpospolita]]'' and ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''. The collection features archival documents and essays covering the entire 1939\u20131941 period. Contributors include [[Anna Bikont]], [[David Engel (historian)|David Engel]], [[Israel Gutman]], [[Adam Michnik]], [[Bogdan Musial]], [[Dariusz Stola]], and [[Tomasz Strzembosz]].{{sfn|Polonsky|Michlic|2003}}\n\n===''The Massacre in Jedwabne, 10 July 1941'' (2005)===\n[[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]]'s book ''The Massacre in Jedwabne, 10 July 1941: Before, During, and After'' challenges Gross's interpretation of the events.{{sfn|Holc|2008}} It suggests that four or five truckloads of armed [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men from [[\u0141om\u017ca]] terrorized the local population before leading Jews and Poles to the crime scene.{{sfn|Chodakiewicz|2005}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nChodakiewicz argues that all the primary sources are wrong or worthless, including the testimony of Szmul Wassersztajn, the investigation of the 22 suspects for the 1949 trial, and the partial exhumation of the bodies. \"And yet,\" [[Piotr Wr\u00f3bel]] wrote in ''The Sarmatian Review'', \"Chodakiewicz is able to present his recreation of the crime. It was well preplanned, initiated by the Germans, and utterly lacked any pogrom-like spontaneity.\" Chodakiewicz good arguments, Wr\u00f3bel wrote, are \"overshadowed by numerous flaws\", lack a sense of proportion, and make selective use of information from sources that support Chodakiewicz's view. According to Wr\u00f3bel, the book has a \"visible political agenda\" and is \"difficult to read, unoriginal, irritating, and unconvincing\".{{sfn|Wr\u00f3bel|2006b}}\n\nReviewing the book for ''[[History (journal)|History]]'', [[Peter D. Stachura]] agreed with Chodakiewicz that the pogrom had been \"conceived, supervised and executed by German police, with only limited involvement from a very small number of Poles\". He alleged that the Polish collaborators had included \"''Volksdeutsche'' (Polish citizens of German origin) and petty criminals\".{{sfn|Stachura|2007}} In response, [[Joanna Michlic]] and [[Antony Polonsky]] wrote a letter in 2008 to the editor of ''History'', expressing their strong disagreement with the \"content and tone\" of Stachura's review. According to Michlic and Polonsky, Chodakiewicz's and Stachura's conclusions were \"very far from those reached by most historians\", including Poland's [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. They wrote that Chodakiewicz and Stachura \"uphold a view of the Polish past which seeks to return to an untenable vision of modern Poland as solely victim and hero&nbsp;... It is a matter of considerable regret to us that you have allowed your journal to be used to advance this neo-nationalist agenda.\"{{sfn|Michlic|Polonsky|2008}} Stachura took exception to their letter.

Nevertheless, prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. The Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in, addressing the matter together.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by National Democracy's far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}} According to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}}\n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

At first, [[Polish Jews]] were relieved to learn that the Soviets, rather than the Germans, were to occupy their town. Unlike most ethnic Poles, some Jews welcomed the [[Red Army]] as protectors from Nazism. Most of the \"enthusiastic greeters\" of the Red Army were [[Belarusians]].{{sfn|Tec|1993|p=17}} In what [[Jan Gross]] has termed \"the institutionalization of resentment\", the occupiers used privileges and punishments to accommodate and encourage ethnic and religious differences among the local population.{{sfn|Holc|2002|p=454}}\n\nAccording to Anna Bikont, the Soviets brought in Russian and atheistic anti-religious policies: Poland's Hebrew schools were shut by the Soviets, who banned holy days that Poland had recognized, such as [[Yom Kippur]], and appropriated shops and businesses, which were mostly Jewish.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|pp=146\u2013148}} Some Jews and Belarusians formed militias (known as ''\"opaskowcy\"'' for their red armbands).{{sfn|Wierzbicki|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BbvQbiaqAEC&pg=PA151 151]}} Local people said Jews had helped the [[NKVD]] compile lists of Poles to be sent to the \"Soviet interior\".{{sfn|Strzembosz|2002|p=6}} A total of 22,353 Poles (entire families) were deported from the vicinity.{{efn|\"Following his detailed Report of the Jedwabne Investigation, [[Leon Kieres]] responds to questions from the Senate. Statement by Senator Jadwiga Stokarska (translation): 'With the Soviet arrival, Poles were laid off immediately, and all administrative offices, including municipal, were staffed by Jews who were also handed out weapons and formed the local militia. Many joined the [[NKVD]], the [[Komsomol]] and the Bolshevik Party, compiled the list of Poles to be sent to Siberia, and performed their deportations directly.'

The Nazis distributed antisemitic propaganda, and there were reports that Jews had welcomed the Soviets; this \"strengthened the widely held stereotype of [[Judaeo-communism]] which had been promoted by right-wing parties before the war\".{{sfn|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2019|p=334}} In parallel, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] organized special ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (\"task forces\") to murder Jews in these areas, and a few massacres were carried out. The guidelines for such massacres were formulated by [[Reinhard Heydrich]],{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d9Wg4gjtP3cC&pg=PA262 262]}} who ordered his officers to induce anti-Jewish incidents in the territories newly occupied by the German forces, including pogroms. \"Hooliganism set the tone\", according to [[Michael C. Steinlauf]].{{sfn|Steinlauf|1997|p=31}}\n\n===Tension in Jedwabne===\nThree days into the invasion, six Poles (three ethnic Poles and three Jews) who had collaborated with the Soviets were lynched in Jedwabne; they were reportedly either tortured to death by the locals or beaten by locals then shot by the Germans. The same day, two wives of Jewish activists for the Soviets who had evacuated with the Red Army committed suicide with their children. Other Jews faced robberies and attacks, which the Germans tolerated. Anti-Jewish sentiment was high in Jedwabne and antisemitic violence broke out in pogroms across the newly German-occupied [[Podlasie]] region.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=411}} In the first days of the occupation of Jedwabne, Persak writes, the Germans set up a Field Gendarmerie (''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]''), staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} These established cooperation with a new town council, headed by the brother-in-law of a previous mayor, Marian Karolak. According to Persak, the Germans probably also allowed the formation of a Polish volunteer [[town guard]]. Some of these may have been resistance fighters during the Soviet occupation who later joined the German auxiliary police, because Polish testimonials refer to them as ''szucman'', from ''[[Schutzmannschaft]]''.{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}\n\n===Pogroms===\nPolish villagers participated in massacres of Jews, with varying degrees of German involvement, in 23 localities of the \u0141om\u017ca and Bia\u0142ystok areas of the [[Podlasie]] region after the occupation.

In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform.

Responsibility for the crime ''sensu largo'' (\"in the broad sense\") could be ascribed to the Germans because of the presence of German military policemen at the Jedwabne police station. Their presence, \"though passive, was tantamount to consent to and tolerance of the crime against the Jewish inhabitants of the town\".{{sfn|Findings of Investigation S1/00/Zn, July 2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AfeGB5yz0ooC&pg=PA135 135]}} The IPN found that the \"Polish population\" played a \"decisive role in the execution of the criminal plan\".{{sfn|Findings of Investigation S1/00/Zn, July 2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AfeGB5yz0ooC&pg=PA134 134]}} The IPN wrote: \"On the basis of the evidence gathered in the investigation, it is not possible to determine the reasons for the passive behavior of the majority of the town's population in the face of the crime.

The first group contained 40 to 50 men, and the second about 300 persons. The second group consisted of \"both sexes of various ages, including children and infants. These people were led into a wooden, thatched barn owned by Bronis\u0142aw \u015aleszy\u0144ski. After the building had been closed, it was doused, probably with kerosene from the former Soviet warehouse.\" Individuals were also murdered before the group in the barn.

The latter half of the season explored her developing role, such as encouraging Huey to explore more varied activities and grounding Louie after his latest get-rich-quick scheme to steal lost treasures from the past nearly causes a serious temporal paradox.

In the Dutch comic ''80 is Prachtig!'', Della is depicted in flashbacks as a brave and adventurous pilot. In fact, she first declared she wanted to be a pilot at the same time her brother Donald declared he wanted to be a sailor. Della's accomplishments as a pilot included being the first female pilot to fly across the Atlantic, flying as a test pilot (and successfully landing a plane that caught fire), and piloting an experimental rocket ship. She is also depicted as caring about and missing her family while she was adventuring. Due to the effects of [[time dilation]] from Della's near-lightspeed rocket travel while Huey, Dewey, and Louie lived with Donald for several years, Della believed she had been gone for less than an hour. Through radio transmissions, Della revealed she was eager to finish her test flight and get home to her boys, unaware that several more years will pass on Earth by the time she does so.<ref name=\"80 is Prachtig\"/>\n\nIn 2017's ''DuckTales'', Della is similarly depicted as an adventurous pilot and as a mother who cares for and loves her family,<ref name=\"Den of Geek 2020.03.09\"/> but the show also establishes that Della shares personality traits with the new series' versions of her relatives.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Like her twin brother Donald, Della can be temperamental. For example, after seeing a taunting illustration by [[Gyro Gearloose]] in a rocket instruction manual, Della flies into a rage; not only tearing the manual apart, but also stomping on the remains.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Della also shares personality traits with her sons, including their fearlessness and mischief. These common traits are what allow them to accept and bond with her once she returns home.<ref name=\"GMA Della Inspires\"/> Like her son Huey, Della was a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]], as evidenced by her bringing her Junior Woodchuck Guidebook with her to the moon and quoting Junior Woodchuck rules by heart.<ref name=\"NostalgiaSpot Della Comes Home\"/><ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\">{{cite episode|title=Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!|series=DuckTales|airdate=May 13, 2019|season=2|number=35}}</ref> Della also shares Dewey's adventurous spirit and Louie's quick-talking cleverness.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Della is also shown to have an unstoppable attitude. This is established early in \"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\", which opens with Della having crashed her rocket on the moon, and awakening to her leg trapped underneath the wreckage. After seeing a photo of her family and assessing the situation, she determines the wreckage is too heavy for her to move on her own, amputates her leg, and declares her intent to return home.<ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/><ref name=\"EW DT Keeps Getting Better\"/> As described by ''DuckTales'' producer Francisco Angones, \"she's gonna beat every odd, she's gonna take charge of her decisions. She made the choice to amputate her leg [on the moon] and it proved, nothing would stop her.\"<ref name=\"GMA Della Inspires\"/>\n\nWhile Della is tenacious and determined, after finally making it back home, she struggles with returning to civilization and her family. While she has ample experience as an adventurer, she had little experience being a mom, and needed time to adjust to the responsibilities of being a parent.<ref name=\"AVClub Nothing Can Stop\">{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/della-duck-finally-returns-home-in-an-emotional-advent-1834534925 |title=Della Duck finally returns home in an emotional, adventurous, Mother's Day ''DuckTales'' |last=Johnson |first=Kevin |publisher=[[The A.V.

The latter half of the season explored her developing role, such as encouraging Huey to explore more varied activities and grounding Louie after his latest get-rich-quick scheme to steal lost treasures from the past nearly causes a serious temporal paradox. In the season two finale, the Moon aliens Della encountered attempt to mount an invasion using technology reverse-engineered from Della's rocket, but although she tries to hide her children away, the returned Donald convinces her to join them in fighting off the invasion, leaving the alien mothership stuck in orbit between Earth and the Moon while the rest of the invasion fleet surrender.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Voice===\nDella's first speaking appearance was in the season 1 finale of 2017's ''DuckTales''.

In the Dutch comic ''80 is Prachtig!'', Della is depicted in flashbacks as a brave and adventurous pilot. In fact, she first declared she wanted to be a pilot at the same time her brother Donald declared he wanted to be a sailor. Della's accomplishments as a pilot included being the first female pilot to fly across the Atlantic, flying as a test pilot (and successfully landing a plane that caught fire), and piloting an experimental rocket ship. She is also depicted as caring about and missing her family while she was adventuring. Due to the effects of [[time dilation]] from Della's near-lightspeed rocket travel while Huey, Dewey, and Louie lived with Donald for several years, Della believed she had been gone for less than an hour. Through radio transmissions, Della revealed she was eager to finish her test flight and get home to her boys, unaware that several more years will pass on Earth by the time she does so.<ref name=\"80 is Prachtig\"/>\n\nIn 2017's ''DuckTales'', Della is similarly depicted as an adventurous pilot and as a mother who cares for and loves her family,<ref name=\"Den of Geek 2020.03.09\"/> but the show also establishes that Della shares personality traits with the new series' versions of her relatives.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Like her twin brother Donald, Della can be temperamental. For example, after seeing a taunting illustration by [[Gyro Gearloose]] in a rocket instruction manual, Della flies into a rage; not only tearing the manual apart, but also stomping on the remains.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Della also shares personality traits with her sons, including their fearlessness and mischief. These common traits are what allow them to accept and bond with her once she returns home.<ref name=\"GMA Della Inspires\"/> Like her son Huey, Della was a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]], as evidenced by her bringing her Junior Woodchuck Guidebook with her to the moon and quoting Junior Woodchuck rules by heart.<ref name=\"NostalgiaSpot Della Comes Home\"/><ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\">{{cite episode|title=Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!|series=DuckTales|airdate=May 13, 2019|season=2|number=35}}</ref> Della also shares Dewey's adventurous spirit and Louie's quick-talking cleverness.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Della is also shown to have an unstoppable attitude. This is established early in \"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\", which opens with Della having crashed her rocket on the moon, and awakening to her leg trapped underneath the wreckage. After seeing a photo of her family and assessing the situation, she determines the wreckage is too heavy for her to move on her own, amputates her leg, and declares her intent to return home.<ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/><ref name=\"EW DT Keeps Getting Better\"/> As described by ''DuckTales'' producer Francisco Angones, \"she's gonna beat every odd, she's gonna take charge of her decisions. She made the choice to amputate her leg [on the moon] and it proved, nothing would stop her.\"<ref name=\"GMA Della Inspires\"/>\n\nWhile Della is tenacious and determined, after finally making it back home, she struggles with returning to civilization and her family. While she has ample experience as an adventurer, she had little experience being a mom, and needed time to adjust to the responsibilities of being a parent.<ref name=\"AVClub Nothing Can Stop\">{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/della-duck-finally-returns-home-in-an-emotional-advent-1834534925 |title=Della Duck finally returns home in an emotional, adventurous, Mother's Day ''DuckTales'' |last=Johnson |first=Kevin |publisher=[[The A.V.
