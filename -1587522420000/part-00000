The middle two-thirds of the locomotive body is painted ''Armour Yellow'', a color used by [[Armour and Company]] on the packaging of its meat products. A thin band of ''Signal Red'' divides this from the ''Harbor Mist Gray'' (a light gray) used for the body and roof above that point. There is also a thin band of Signal Red along the bottom of the locomotive body, but this color has gradually become yellow as new Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations for reflectorized tape came into effect in 2005; the trucks, underframe, fuel tanks and everything else beneath that line are also Harbor Mist Gray. Lettering and numbering are in Signal Red, with black outlines. Some locomotives have white-outlined blue \"wings\" on the nose, on either side of the renowned shield featuring white lettering on a blue background and, below it, red and white vertical stripes. Beginning in early 2002, a number of units were repainted with a large, billowing [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] with the corporate motto \"Building America\" on the side, where the 'UNION PACIFIC' lettering is normally positioned.

The middle two-thirds of the locomotive body is painted ''Armour Yellow'', a color used by [[Armour and Company]] on the packaging of its meat products. A thin band of ''Signal Red'' divides this from the ''Harbor Mist Gray'' (a light gray) used for the body and roof above that point. There is also a thin band of Signal Red along the bottom of the locomotive body, but this color has gradually become yellow as new Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations for reflectorized tape came into effect in 2005; the trucks, underframe, fuel tanks and everything else beneath that line are also Harbor Mist Gray. Lettering and numbering are in Signal Red, with black outlines. Some locomotives have white-outlined blue \"wings\" on the nose, on either side of the renowned shield featuring white lettering on a blue background and, below it, red and white vertical stripes. Beginning in early 2002, a number of units were repainted with a large, billowing [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] with the corporate motto \"Building America\" on the side, where the 'UNION PACIFIC' lettering is normally positioned.

It was developed as a successor to [[VP9]] by the [[Alliance for Open Media]] (AOMedia), a consortium founded in 2015 that includes semiconductor firms, [[video on demand]] providers, video content producers, software development companies and web browser vendors. The AV1 bitstream specification includes a reference [[video codec]].<ref name=\"av1-spec\"/> In 2018 [[Facebook]] testing that approximates real world conditions, AV1 achieved 34%, 46.2% and 50.3% higher [[data compression]] than libvpx-vp9, x264 high profile, and x264 main profile respectively.\n\nIndustry observers found one of the most compelling features of AV1 to be its royalty-free licensing model, unlike existing technologies such as [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] that require royalty payments and prevent widespread adoption in open-source projects.<ref name=\"eetimes-av1release\"/><ref name=\"arstechnica-aom-announcement\"/>\n\nCisco's [[Thor (video codec)|Thor]] development was started in response to HEVC being perceived as unviable for use in open source and freely distributed products,<ref name=\"thor-announcement\"/> but the work of Google and Mozilla (previously under [[Xiph]]) on royalty-free video predates this event and is not attributed to HEVC's licensing woes,<ref name=\"moz-avc-reluctance\"/> although also seen as a problem by Mozilla.<ref name=\"tax\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe Alliance's motivations for creating AV1 included the high cost and uncertainty involved with the patent licensing of [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]], the [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]]-designed codec expected to succeed [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|AVC]].<ref name=\"cnet-aom-announcement\" /><ref name=\"arstechnica-aom-announcement\" /> Additionally, the Alliance's seven founding members \u2013 Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla and Netflix \u2013 announced that the initial focus of the video format would be delivery of high-quality web video.<ref name=\"cisco-AV1-release\" /> The official announcement of AV1 came with the press release on the formation of the [[Alliance for Open Media]] on 1 September 2015. Only 42 days before, on 21 July 2015, HEVC Advance's initial licensing offer was announced to be an increase over the royalty fees of its predecessor, AVC.<ref name=\"hevc-2015\" /> In addition to the increased cost, the complexity of the licensing process increased with HEVC. Unlike previous MPEG standards where the technology in the standard could be licensed from a single entity, [[MPEG-LA]], when the HEVC standard was finished, two [[patent pool]]s had been formed with a third pool was on the horizon. In addition, various patent holders were refusing to license patents via either pool, increasing uncertainty about HEVC's licensing. According to Microsoft's Ian LeGrow, an open-source, royalty-free technology was seen as the easiest way to eliminate this uncertainty around licensing.<ref name=\"cnet-aom-announcement\"/>\n\nThe negative effect of patent licensing on [[free and open-source software]] has also been cited as a reason for the creation of AV1.<ref name=\"arstechnica-aom-announcement\"/> For example, building a H.264 implementation into [[Firefox]] would prevent it from being distributed free of charge since licensing fees would have to be paid to MPEG-LA.<ref name=\"openh264\"/> [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] has argued that [[FRAND]] patent licensing practices make the free software implementation of standards impossible due to various incompatibilities with [[free software license]]s.<ref name=\"fsfe on frand\"/>\n\nMany of the components of the AV1 project were sourced from previous research efforts by Alliance members. Individual contributors started experimental technology platforms years before: Xiph's/Mozilla's [[Daala]] already published code in 2010, Google's experimental VP9 evolution project VP10 was announced on 12 September 2014,<ref name=\"CNETVP10September2014\" /> and Cisco's [[Thor (video codec)|Thor]] was published on 11 August 2015. Building on the codebase of VP9, AV1 incorporates additional techniques, several of which were developed in these experimental formats.<ref name=\"bitformat\" />\nThe first version 0.1.0 of the AV1 reference codec was published on 7 April 2016.\n\nAlthough a soft [[feature freeze]] came into effect at the end of October 2017, several significant features were decided to continue developing beyond this. One of these in-progress features, the [[bitstream format]], was projected to be frozen in January 2018 but was delayed due to unresolved critical bugs as well as further changes to transformations, syntax, the prediction of motion vectors, and the completion of legal analysis.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The Alliance announced the release of the AV1 bitstream specification on 28 March 2018, along with a reference, software-based encoder and decoder.<ref name=\"Shilov 2018\" /> On 25 June 2018, a validated version 1.0.0 of the specification was released.<ref name=\"Larabel 2018-06-25\" /> On 8 January 2019 a validated ''version 1.0.0 with Errata 1'' of the specification was released.\n\nMartin Smole from AOM member Bitmovin said that the computational efficiency of the reference encoder was the greatest remaining challenge after the bitstream format freeze had been completed.<ref name=\"encoder speed\" /> While still working on the format, the encoder was not targeted for production use and speed optimizations were not prioritized. Consequently, the early version of AV1 was orders of magnitude slower than existing HEVC encoders. Much of the development effort was consequently shifted towards maturing the reference encoder. In March 2019, it was reported that the speed of the reference encoder had improved greatly and within the same order of magnitude as encoders for other common formats.<ref name=\"near-reasonable\" />\n\n==Purpose==\nAV1 aims to be a video format for the web that is both [[state of the art]] and [[royalty free]].{{cn|date=February 2020}} The mission of the Alliance for Open Media is the same as that of the [[WebM]] project.\n\nTo fulfill the goal of being royalty free, the development process requires that no feature can be adopted before it has been confirmed independently by two separate parties to not infringe on patents of competing companies. In cases where an alternative to a patent-protected technique is not available, owners of relevant patents have been invited to join the Alliance (even if they were already members of another patent pool). For example, Alliance members Apple, Cisco, Google, and Microsoft are also licensors in MPEG-LA's patent pool for H.264.<ref name=\"ip remains\"/> As an additional protection for the royalty-free status of AV1, the Alliance has a legal defense fund to aid smaller Alliance members or AV1 licensees in the event they are sued for alleged patent infringement.<ref name=\"ip remains\"/><ref name=\"eetimes-av1release\"/><ref name=\"multichannel-nab2018\"/>\n\nThis development process contrasts with that of its main competitor, [[HEVC]], where a review of the intellectual property rights ([[Intellectual property rights|IPR]] review) was not part of the standardization process.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The reviewing practice used by AV1 is stipulated in the [[Open standard#ITU-T definition|ITU-T's definition of an open standard]].\n\nA recurring concern in the field of royalty-free multimedia formats is the possibility that such formats may infringe upon patents unknown to the their creators and users. The concern has been raised regarding AV1,<ref name=\"ip remains\"/> and previously [[VP8]],<ref name=\"theregister-vp8\"/> VP9,<ref name=\"comes of age\"/> Theora<ref name=\"patents and standards\"/> and [[Internet Video Coding|IVC]].<ref name=\"ivc\"/> The problem of unforeseen patents is not unique to royalty-free formats, but it uniquely threatens their ''status'' as royalty-free. In contrast, IPR avoidance has not traditionally been a priority in MPEG's business model for royalty-bearing formats (although the MPEG chairman argues it has to change).<ref name=\"crisis\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Patent licensing\n! scope=\"col\" | AV1, VP9, Theora, etc.\n! scope=\"col\" | HEVC, AVC, etc.\n! scope=\"col\" | GIF, MP3, MPEG-2, etc.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''By known patent holders'''\n| {{free|Royalty-free}}\n| {{nonfree|Royalty bearing}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #9FF; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"free table-free\" | Expired\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''By unknown patent holders'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ececec; color: #2C2C2C; font-size: smaller; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; \" class=\"unknown table-unknown\"| Impossible to know until expiry\n|}\n\nUnder patent rules adopted from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), technology contributors license their AV1-connected patents to anyone, anywhere, anytime based on reciprocity (i.e. as long as the user does not engage in patent litigation).<ref name=\"patent license\"/> As a defensive condition, anyone engaging in patent litigation loses the right to the patents of ''all'' patent holders.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe creation of royalty-free web standards has been a long-stated pursuit for the industry.\nIn 2007, the proposal for [[HTML5 video]] specified [[Theora]] as mandatory to implement. The reason was that public content should be encoded in freely implementable formats, if only as a \"baseline format\", and that changing such a baseline format later would be hard because of network effects.<ref name=\"video element\"/>\nThe Alliance for Open Media is a continuation of Google's efforts with the WebM project,\nwhich renewed the royalty-free competition after Theora had been surpassed by AVC.\nFor companies such as Mozilla that distribute free software, AVC can be difficult to support as a per-copy royalty easily is unsustainable given the lack of revenue stream to support these payments in free software (see [[FRAND#Excluding costless distribution schemes|FRAND \u00a7 Excluding costless distribution]]).<ref name=\"tax\"/>\nSimilarly, HEVC has not successfully convinced all licensors to allow an exception for freely distributed software (see [[HEVC#Provision for costless software|HEVC \u00a7 Provision for costless software]]).\n\nThe performance goals include \"a step up from VP9 and HEVC\" in efficiency for a low increase in [[analysis of algorithms|complexity]]. NETVC's efficiency goal is 25% improvement over HEVC.<ref name=\"netvc\"/> The primary complexity concern is for software decoding, since hardware support will take time to reach users. However, for [[WebRTC]], live encoding performance is also relevant, which is Cisco's agenda: [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] is a manufacturer of [[videoconferencing]] equipment, and their Thor contributions aim at \"reasonable compression at only moderate complexity\".<ref name=\"integrating-thor\"/>\n\nFeature wise, AV1 is specifically designed for [[real-time application]]s (especially WebRTC) and higher resolutions (wider color [[gamut]]s, higher [[frame rate]]s, [[ultra-high-definition television|UHD]]) than typical usage scenarios of the current generation (H.264) of video formats where it is expected to achieve its biggest efficiency gains. It is therefore planned to support the color space from [[Rec. 2020|ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020]] and up to 12 bits of [[color depth|precision]] per color component.<ref name=\"streamingmedia-2016-06-03\"/> AV1 is primarily intended for [[Lossy compression|lossy encoding]], although [[lossless compression]] is supported as well<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/mbebenita/aom/blob/master/CHANGELOG#L64|title=libaom v1.3.0 changelog|last=|first=|date=|website=AOM Github Repository|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nAV1-based containers have also been proposed as a replacement for [[JPEG]], similar to [[Better Portable Graphics]] and [[High Efficiency Image File Format]] which wrap HEVC.<ref name=\"vsJPEG\"/>\n\n==Technology==\n{{See also|VP9#Technology|Daala#Technology}}\nAV1 is a traditional block-based [[frequency transform]] format featuring new techniques. Based on Google's VP9,<ref name=\"basis\"/> AV1 incorporates additional techniques that mainly give encoders more coding options to enable better adaption to different types of input.\n[[File:The Technology Inside Av1.svg|thumb|314x314px|Processing stages of an AV1 encoder with relevant technologies associated with each stage.]]\n\n{{Infobox software\n|name= libaom\n|screenshot= Aomenc-screenshot-2020-01-23.png\n|developer= Alliance for Open Media\n|released= \n|latest_release_version= \n|latest_release_date= \n|programming language= [[C (programming language)|C]], [[assembly language|assembly]]\n|license= [[BSD 2-Clause License]] ([[free software]])\n|website= [https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/ aomedia.googlesource.com/aom]\n}}\nThe Alliance published a [[reference implementation]] written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[assembly language]] (<code>aomenc</code>, <code>aomdec</code>) as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[BSD 2-Clause License]].<ref name=\"license\"/>  Development happens in public and is open for contributions, regardless of AOM membership.\n\nThe development process was such that coding tools were added to the reference codebase as ''experiments'', controlled by flags that enable or disable them at build time, for review by other group members as well as specialized teams that helped with and ensured hardware friendliness and compliance with intellectual property rights (TAPAS). When the feature gained some support in the community, the experiment was enabled by default, and ultimately had its flag removed when all of the reviews were passed.<ref name=\"streamingmedia-2017-08-30\"/> Experiment names were lowercased in the ''configure'' script and uppercased in [[conditional compilation]] flags.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nTo better and more reliably support HDR and color spaces, corresponding metadata can now be integrated into the video bitstream instead of being signaled in the container.\n\n===Partitioning===\n[[File:AV1 coding unit partitioning.svg|thumb|10 ways for subpartitioning coding units \u2013 into squares (recursively), rectangles, or mixtures thereof (\"T-shaped\").|upright=0.6]]Frame content is separated into adjacent same-sized blocks referred to as superblocks. Similar to the concept of a [[macroblock]], superblocks are square-shaped and can either be of size 128\u00d7128 or 64\u00d764 pixels. Superblocks can be divided in smaller blocks according to different partitioning patterns. The four-way split pattern is the only pattern whose partitions can be recursively subdivided. This allows superblocks to be divided into partitions as small as 4\u00d74 pixels. [[File:AV1 Partitioning.svg|alt=|thumb|Diagram of the AV1 superblock partitioning. It shows how 128\u00d7128 superblocks can be split all the way down to 4\u00d74 blocks. As special cases, 128\u00d7128 and 8\u00d78 blocks can't use 1:4 and 4:1 splits, and 8\u00d78 blocks can't use \"T\"-shaped splits.]]\n\"T-shaped\" partitioning patterns are introduced, a feature developed for VP10, as well as horizontal or vertical splits into four stripes of 4:1 and 1:4 aspect ratio. The available partitioning patterns vary according to the block size, both 128\u00d7128 and 8\u00d78 blocks can't use 4:1 and 1:4 splits. Moreover, 8\u00d78 blocks can't use \"T\" shaped splits.\n\nTwo separate predictions can now be used on spatially different parts of a block using a smooth, oblique transition line (''wedge-partitioned prediction'').{{cn|date=February 2020}} This enables more accurate separation of objects without the traditional staircase lines along the boundaries of square blocks.\n\nMore encoder parallelism is possible thanks to configurable prediction dependency between tile rows (<code>ext_tile</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/>\n\n===Prediction===\nAV1 performs internal processing in higher precision (10 or 12 bits per sample), which leads to compression improvement due to smaller rounding errors in reference imagery.\n\nPredictions can be combined in more advanced ways (than a uniform average) in a block (''compound prediction''), including smooth and sharp transition gradients in different directions (''wedge-partitioned prediction'') as well as implicit masks that are based on the difference between the two predictors. This allows combination of either two inter predictions or an inter and an intra prediction to be used in the same block.<ref name=\"VP10\"/>{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nA frame can reference 6 instead of 3 of the 8 available frame buffers for temporal (inter) prediction while providing more flexibility on bi-prediction<ref name=\"ibc2018-talk-codec-wars\"/> (<code>ext_refs</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}).\n[[File:Bergensbanen 1280x720.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=184|Warped motion as seen from the front of a train.]]\nThe ''Warped Motion'' (<code>warped_motion</code>)<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/> and ''Global Motion'' (<code>global_motion</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}) tools in AV1 aim to reduce redundant information in [[motion vector]]s by recognizing patterns arising from camera motion.<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/> They implement ideas that were tried to be exploited in preceding formats like e.g. MPEG-4 ASP, albeit with a novel approach that works in three dimensions. There can be a set of warping parameters for a whole frame offered in the bitstream, or blocks can use a set of implicit local parameters that get computed based on surrounding blocks.\n\n''Switch frames'' (S-frame) are a new inter-frame type that can be predicted using already decoded reference frames from a higher-resolution version of the same video to allow switching to a lower resolution without the need for a full keyframe at the beginning of a video segment in the [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] use case.<ref name=\"Streaming Media 2017-10-11\"/>\n\n====Intra Prediction ====\n[[Intra-frame coding|Intra prediction]] consists of predicting the pixels of a given blocks only using information available in the current frame. Most often, intra predictions are built from the neighboring pixels above and to the left of the predicted block. The DC predictor builds a prediction by averaging the pixels above and to the left of block.\n\nDirectional predictors extrapolate these neighboring pixels according to a specified angle. In AV1, 8 main directional modes can be chosen. These modes start at an angle of 45 degrees and increase by a step size of 22.5 degrees up until 203 degrees. Furthermore, for each directional mode, six offsets of 3 degree can be signalled for bigger blocks, three above the main angle and three below it, resulting in a total of 56 angles (<code>ext_intra</code>).\n\nThe \"TrueMotion\" predictor got replaced with a [[Paeth filter|Paeth]] predictor which looks at the difference from the known pixel in the above left corner to the pixel directly above and directly left of the new one and then chooses the one that lies in direction of the smaller gradient as predictor. A palette predictor is available for blocks with very few (up to 8, dominant) colors like in some computer screen content. Correlations between the luminosity and the color information can now be exploited with a predictor for chroma blocks that is based on samples from the luma plane (<code>cfl</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/> In order to reduce visible boundaries along borders of inter-predicted blocks, a technique called [[Motion compensation#Overlapped block motion compensation|overlapped block motion compensation]] (OBMC) can be used. This involves extending a block's size so that it overlaps with neighboring blocks by 2 to 32 pixels, and blending the overlapping parts together.<ref name=\"feldman-obmc\"/>\n\n===Data transformation===\nTo transform the error remaining after prediction to the frequency domain, AV1 encoders can use square, 2:1/1:2, and 4:1/1:4 rectangular [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]]s (<code>rect_tx</code>),<ref name=\"ibc2018-talk-codec-wars\"/> as well as an asymmetric [[Discrete sine transform|DST]]<ref name=\"Han Saxena Melkote Rose 2011\"/><ref name=\"negge-depth-packt\"/><ref name=\"negge-depth-slides\"/> for blocks where the top and/or left edge is expected to have lower error thanks to prediction from nearby pixels, or choose to do no transform (identity transform).\n\nIt can combine two one-dimensional transforms in order to use different transforms for the horizontal and the vertical dimension (<code>ext_tx</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/><ref name=\"ibc2018-talk-codec-wars\"/>\n\n===Quantization===\nAV1 has new optimized quantization matrices (<code>aom_qm</code>).{{cn|date=February 2020}} The eight sets of quantization parameters that can be selected and signaled for each frame now have individual parameters for the two chroma planes and can use spatial prediction. On every new superblock, the quantization parameters can be adjusted by signaling an offset.\n\n===Filters===\nFor the in-loop filtering step, the integration of Thor's constrained low-pass filter and Daala's directional deringing filter has been fruitful: The combined ''Constrained Directional Enhancement Filter'' (<code>cdef</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}) exceeds the results of using the original filters separately or together.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt is an edge-directed conditional replacement filter that smoothes blocks with configurable (signaled) strength roughly along the direction of the dominant edge to eliminate [[ringing artifacts]].\n\nThere is also the ''loop restoration filter'' (<code>loop_restoration</code>) based on the [[Wiener filter]] and self-[[guided filter|guided restoration filters]] to remove blur artifacts due to block processing.<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/>\n\n''Film grain synthesis'' (<code>film_grain</code>) improves coding of noisy signals using a parametric video coding approach.\nDue to the randomness inherent to film grain noise, this signal component is traditionally either very expensive to code or prone to get damaged or lost, possibly leaving serious coding artefacts as residue. This tool circumvents these problems using analysis and synthesis, replacing parts of the signal with a visually similar synthetic texture, based solely on subjective visual impression instead of objective similarity. It removes the grain component from the signal, analyzes its non-random characteristics, and instead transmits only descriptive parameters to the decoder, which adds back a synthetic, pseudorandom noise signal that's shaped after the original component. It is the visual equivalent of the Perceptual Noise Substitution technique used in AC3, AAC, Vorbis, and Opus audio codecs.\n\n===Entropy coding===\nDaala's entropy coder (<code>daala_ec</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}), a non-binary [[arithmetic coding|arithmetic coder]], was selected for replacing VP9's binary entropy coder. The use of ''non-binary'' arithmetic coding helps evade patents, but also adds bit-level parallelism to an otherwise serial process, reducing clock rate demands on hardware implementations.{{cn|date=February 2020}} This is to say that the effectiveness of modern binary arithmetic coding like [[CABAC]] is being approached using a greater alphabet than binary, hence greater speed, as in [[Huffman code]] (but not as simple and fast as Huffman code).\nAV1 also gained the ability to adapt the symbol probabilities in the arithmetic coder per coded symbol instead of per frame (<code>ec_adapt</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/>\n\n==Quality and efficiency==\n{{Update section|date=September 2019}}\nA first comparison from the beginning of June 2016<ref name=\"golem20160609\"/> found AV1 roughly on par with HEVC, as did one using code from late January 2017.<ref name=\"elecard_comparison\"/>\n\nIn April 2017, using the 8 enabled experimental features at the time (of 77 total), [[Bitmovin]] was able to demonstrate favorable [[Video quality|objective metrics]], as well as visual results, compared to HEVC on the ''[[Sintel]]'' and ''[[Tears of Steel]]'' animated films.{{cn|date=February 2020}} A follow-up comparison by Jan Ozer of ''Streaming Media Magazine'' confirmed this, and concluded that \"AV1 is at least as good as HEVC now\".<ref name=\"ozer_compares_hevc\"/>\n\nOzer noted that his and Bitmovin's results contradicted a comparison by [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications]] from late 2016<ref name=\"comparison_by_hhi\"/> that had found AV1 38.4% less efficient than HEVC, underperforming even H.264/AVC, and justified this discrepancy by having used encoding parameters endorsed by each encoder vendor, as well as having more features in the newer AV1 encoder.\n\nTests from Netflix showed that, based on measurements with [[Peak signal-to-noise ratio|PSNR]] and [[Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion|VMAF]] at 720p, AV1 was about 25% more efficient than VP9 (libvpx).<ref name=\"Netflix\"/> Similar conclusions with respect to quality were drawn from a test conducted by [[Moscow State University]] researchers, where VP9 was found to require 31% and HEVC 22% more bitrate than AV1 for the same level of quality.<ref name=\"MSU2017-1\"/> The researchers found that the used AV1 encoder was operating at a speed \"2500\u20133500 times lower than competitors\", while admitting that it has not been optimized yet.<ref name=\"MSU2017-2\"/>\n\nIn a comparison of AV1 against H.264 (x264) and VP9 (libvpx), Facebook showed about 45\u201350% bitrate savings over H.264 and about 40% over VP9 when using a constant quality encoding mode.<ref name=\"Baumgartner 2019\"/>\n\nDecoding performance was at about half the speed of VP9 according to internal measurements from 2017.<ref name=\"Streaming Media 2017-10-11\"/>\n\nAOMedia provides a list of test results [https://aomedia.org/news/av1-test-results/ on their website].\n\n==Profiles and levels==\n=== Profiles ===\nAV1 defines three profiles for decoders which are '''Main''', '''High''', and '''Professional'''. The Main profile allows for a bit depth of 8- or 10-bits per sample with 4:0:0 (greyscale) and 4:2:0 [[Chroma subsampling|chroma sampling]]. The High profile further adds support for 4:4:4 chroma sampling.

It was developed as a successor to [[VP9]] by the [[Alliance for Open Media]] (AOMedia), a consortium founded in 2015 that includes semiconductor firms, [[video on demand]] providers, video content producers, software development companies and web browser vendors. The AV1 bitstream specification includes a reference [[video codec]].<ref name=\"av1-spec\"/> In 2018 [[Facebook]] testing that approximates real world conditions, AV1 achieved 34%, 46.2% and 50.3% higher [[data compression]] than libvpx-vp9, x264 high profile, and x264 main profile respectively.\n\nIndustry observers found one of the most compelling features of AV1 to be its royalty-free licensing model, unlike existing technologies such as [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] that require royalty payments and prevent widespread adoption in open-source projects.<ref name=\"eetimes-av1release\"/><ref name=\"arstechnica-aom-announcement\"/>\n\nCisco's [[Thor (video codec)|Thor]] development was started in response to HEVC being perceived as unviable for use in open source and freely distributed products,<ref name=\"thor-announcement\"/> but the work of Google and Mozilla (previously under [[Xiph]]) on royalty-free video predates this event and is not attributed to HEVC's licensing woes,<ref name=\"moz-avc-reluctance\"/> although also seen as a problem by Mozilla.<ref name=\"tax\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe Alliance's motivations for creating AV1 included the high cost and uncertainty involved with the patent licensing of [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]], the [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]]-designed codec expected to succeed [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|AVC]].<ref name=\"cnet-aom-announcement\" /><ref name=\"arstechnica-aom-announcement\" /> Additionally, the Alliance's seven founding members \u2013 Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla and Netflix \u2013 announced that the initial focus of the video format would be delivery of high-quality web video.<ref name=\"cisco-AV1-release\" /> The official announcement of AV1 came with the press release on the formation of the [[Alliance for Open Media]] on 1 September 2015. Only 42 days before, on 21 July 2015, HEVC Advance's initial licensing offer was announced to be an increase over the royalty fees of its predecessor, AVC.<ref name=\"hevc-2015\" /> In addition to the increased cost, the complexity of the licensing process increased with HEVC. Unlike previous MPEG standards where the technology in the standard could be licensed from a single entity, [[MPEG-LA]], when the HEVC standard was finished, two [[patent pool]]s had been formed with a third pool was on the horizon. In addition, various patent holders were refusing to license patents via either pool, increasing uncertainty about HEVC's licensing. According to Microsoft's Ian LeGrow, an open-source, royalty-free technology was seen as the easiest way to eliminate this uncertainty around licensing.<ref name=\"cnet-aom-announcement\"/>\n\nThe negative effect of patent licensing on [[free and open-source software]] has also been cited as a reason for the creation of AV1.<ref name=\"arstechnica-aom-announcement\"/> For example, building a H.264 implementation into [[Firefox]] would prevent it from being distributed free of charge since licensing fees would have to be paid to MPEG-LA.<ref name=\"openh264\"/> [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] has argued that [[FRAND]] patent licensing practices make the free software implementation of standards impossible due to various incompatibilities with [[free software license]]s.<ref name=\"fsfe on frand\"/>\n\nMany of the components of the AV1 project were sourced from previous research efforts by Alliance members. Individual contributors started experimental technology platforms years before: Xiph's/Mozilla's [[Daala]] already published code in 2010, Google's experimental VP9 evolution project VP10 was announced on 12 September 2014,<ref name=\"CNETVP10September2014\" /> and Cisco's [[Thor (video codec)|Thor]] was published on 11 August 2015. Building on the codebase of VP9, AV1 incorporates additional techniques, several of which were developed in these experimental formats.<ref name=\"bitformat\" />\nThe first version 0.1.0 of the AV1 reference codec was published on 7 April 2016.\n\nAlthough a soft [[feature freeze]] came into effect at the end of October 2017, several significant features were decided to continue developing beyond this. One of these in-progress features, the [[bitstream format]], was projected to be frozen in January 2018 but was delayed due to unresolved critical bugs as well as further changes to transformations, syntax, the prediction of motion vectors, and the completion of legal analysis.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The Alliance announced the release of the AV1 bitstream specification on 28 March 2018, along with a reference, software-based encoder and decoder.<ref name=\"Shilov 2018\" /> On 25 June 2018, a validated version 1.0.0 of the specification was released.<ref name=\"Larabel 2018-06-25\" /> On 8 January 2019 a validated ''version 1.0.0 with Errata 1'' of the specification was released.\n\nMartin Smole from AOM member Bitmovin said that the computational efficiency of the reference encoder was the greatest remaining challenge after the bitstream format freeze had been completed.<ref name=\"encoder speed\" /> While still working on the format, the encoder was not targeted for production use and speed optimizations were not prioritized. Consequently, the early version of AV1 was orders of magnitude slower than existing HEVC encoders. Much of the development effort was consequently shifted towards maturing the reference encoder. In March 2019, it was reported that the speed of the reference encoder had improved greatly and within the same order of magnitude as encoders for other common formats.<ref name=\"near-reasonable\" />\n\n==Purpose==\nAV1 aims to be a video format for the web that is both [[state of the art]] and [[royalty free]].{{cn|date=February 2020}} The mission of the Alliance for Open Media is the same as that of the [[WebM]] project.\n\nTo fulfill the goal of being royalty free, the development process requires that no feature can be adopted before it has been confirmed independently by two separate parties to not infringe on patents of competing companies. In cases where an alternative to a patent-protected technique is not available, owners of relevant patents have been invited to join the Alliance (even if they were already members of another patent pool). For example, Alliance members Apple, Cisco, Google, and Microsoft are also licensors in MPEG-LA's patent pool for H.264.<ref name=\"ip remains\"/> As an additional protection for the royalty-free status of AV1, the Alliance has a legal defense fund to aid smaller Alliance members or AV1 licensees in the event they are sued for alleged patent infringement.<ref name=\"ip remains\"/><ref name=\"eetimes-av1release\"/><ref name=\"multichannel-nab2018\"/>\n\nThis development process contrasts with that of its main competitor, [[HEVC]], where a review of the intellectual property rights ([[Intellectual property rights|IPR]] review) was not part of the standardization process.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The reviewing practice used by AV1 is stipulated in the [[Open standard#ITU-T definition|ITU-T's definition of an open standard]].\n\nA recurring concern in the field of royalty-free multimedia formats is the possibility that such formats may infringe upon patents unknown to the their creators and users. The concern has been raised regarding AV1,<ref name=\"ip remains\"/> and previously [[VP8]],<ref name=\"theregister-vp8\"/> VP9,<ref name=\"comes of age\"/> Theora<ref name=\"patents and standards\"/> and [[Internet Video Coding|IVC]].<ref name=\"ivc\"/> The problem of unforeseen patents is not unique to royalty-free formats, but it uniquely threatens their ''status'' as royalty-free. In contrast, IPR avoidance has not traditionally been a priority in MPEG's business model for royalty-bearing formats (although the MPEG chairman argues it has to change).<ref name=\"crisis\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Patent licensing\n! scope=\"col\" | AV1, VP9, Theora, etc.\n! scope=\"col\" | HEVC, AVC, etc.\n! scope=\"col\" | GIF, MP3, MPEG-2, etc.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''By known patent holders'''\n| {{free|Royalty-free}}\n| {{nonfree|Royalty bearing}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #9FF; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"free table-free\" | Expired\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''By unknown patent holders'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ececec; color: #2C2C2C; font-size: smaller; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; \" class=\"unknown table-unknown\"| Impossible to know until expiry\n|}\n\nUnder patent rules adopted from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), technology contributors license their AV1-connected patents to anyone, anywhere, anytime based on reciprocity (i.e. as long as the user does not engage in patent litigation).<ref name=\"patent license\"/> As a defensive condition, anyone engaging in patent litigation loses the right to the patents of ''all'' patent holders.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe creation of royalty-free web standards has been a long-stated pursuit for the industry.\nIn 2007, the proposal for [[HTML5 video]] specified [[Theora]] as mandatory to implement. The reason was that public content should be encoded in freely implementable formats, if only as a \"baseline format\", and that changing such a baseline format later would be hard because of network effects.<ref name=\"video element\"/>\nThe Alliance for Open Media is a continuation of Google's efforts with the WebM project,\nwhich renewed the royalty-free competition after Theora had been surpassed by AVC.\nFor companies such as Mozilla that distribute free software, AVC can be difficult to support as a per-copy royalty easily is unsustainable given the lack of revenue stream to support these payments in free software (see [[FRAND#Excluding costless distribution schemes|FRAND \u00a7 Excluding costless distribution]]).<ref name=\"tax\"/>\nSimilarly, HEVC has not successfully convinced all licensors to allow an exception for freely distributed software (see [[HEVC#Provision for costless software|HEVC \u00a7 Provision for costless software]]).\n\nThe performance goals include \"a step up from VP9 and HEVC\" in efficiency for a low increase in [[analysis of algorithms|complexity]]. NETVC's efficiency goal is 25% improvement over HEVC.<ref name=\"netvc\"/> The primary complexity concern is for software decoding, since hardware support will take time to reach users. However, for [[WebRTC]], live encoding performance is also relevant, which is Cisco's agenda: [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] is a manufacturer of [[videoconferencing]] equipment, and their Thor contributions aim at \"reasonable compression at only moderate complexity\".<ref name=\"integrating-thor\"/>\n\nFeature wise, AV1 is specifically designed for [[real-time application]]s (especially WebRTC) and higher resolutions (wider color [[gamut]]s, higher [[frame rate]]s, [[ultra-high-definition television|UHD]]) than typical usage scenarios of the current generation (H.264) of video formats where it is expected to achieve its biggest efficiency gains. It is therefore planned to support the color space from [[Rec. 2020|ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020]] and up to 12 bits of [[color depth|precision]] per color component.<ref name=\"streamingmedia-2016-06-03\"/> AV1 is primarily intended for [[Lossy compression|lossy encoding]], although [[lossless compression]] is supported as well.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAV1-based containers have also been proposed as a replacement for [[JPEG]], similar to [[Better Portable Graphics]] and [[High Efficiency Image File Format]] which wrap HEVC.<ref name=\"vsJPEG\"/>\n\n==Technology==\n{{See also|VP9#Technology|Daala#Technology}}\nAV1 is a traditional block-based [[frequency transform]] format featuring new techniques. Based on Google's VP9,<ref name=\"basis\"/> AV1 incorporates additional techniques that mainly give encoders more coding options to enable better adaption to different types of input.\n[[File:The Technology Inside Av1.svg|thumb|314x314px|Processing stages of an AV1 encoder with relevant technologies associated with each stage.]]\n\n{{Infobox software\n|name= libaom\n|screenshot= Aomenc-screenshot-2020-01-23.png\n|developer= Alliance for Open Media\n|released= \n|latest_release_version= \n|latest_release_date= \n|programming language= [[C (programming language)|C]], [[assembly language|assembly]]\n|license= [[BSD 2-Clause License]] ([[free software]])\n|website= [https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/ aomedia.googlesource.com/aom]\n}}\nThe Alliance published a [[reference implementation]] written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[assembly language]] (<code>aomenc</code>, <code>aomdec</code>) as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[BSD 2-Clause License]].<ref name=\"license\"/>  Development happens in public and is open for contributions, regardless of AOM membership.\n\nThe development process was such that coding tools were added to the reference codebase as ''experiments'', controlled by flags that enable or disable them at build time, for review by other group members as well as specialized teams that helped with and ensured hardware friendliness and compliance with intellectual property rights (TAPAS). When the feature gained some support in the community, the experiment was enabled by default, and ultimately had its flag removed when all of the reviews were passed.<ref name=\"streamingmedia-2017-08-30\"/> Experiment names were lowercased in the ''configure'' script and uppercased in [[conditional compilation]] flags.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nTo better and more reliably support HDR and color spaces, corresponding metadata can now be integrated into the video bitstream instead of being signaled in the container.\n\n===Partitioning===\n[[File:AV1 coding unit partitioning.svg|thumb|10 ways for subpartitioning coding units \u2013 into squares (recursively), rectangles, or mixtures thereof (\"T-shaped\").|upright=0.6]]Frame content is separated into adjacent same-sized blocks referred to as superblocks. Similar to the concept of a [[macroblock]], superblocks are square-shaped and can either be of size 128\u00d7128 or 64\u00d764 pixels. Superblocks can be divided in smaller blocks according to different partitioning patterns. The four-way split pattern is the only pattern whose partitions can be recursively subdivided. This allows superblocks to be divided into partitions as small as 4\u00d74 pixels. [[File:AV1 Partitioning.svg|alt=|thumb|Diagram of the AV1 superblock partitioning. It shows how 128\u00d7128 superblocks can be split all the way down to 4\u00d74 blocks. As special cases, 128\u00d7128 and 8\u00d78 blocks can't use 1:4 and 4:1 splits, and 8\u00d78 blocks can't use \"T\"-shaped splits.]]\n\"T-shaped\" partitioning patterns are introduced, a feature developed for VP10, as well as horizontal or vertical splits into four stripes of 4:1 and 1:4 aspect ratio. The available partitioning patterns vary according to the block size, both 128\u00d7128 and 8\u00d78 blocks can't use 4:1 and 1:4 splits. Moreover, 8\u00d78 blocks can't use \"T\" shaped splits.\n\nTwo separate predictions can now be used on spatially different parts of a block using a smooth, oblique transition line (''wedge-partitioned prediction'').{{cn|date=February 2020}} This enables more accurate separation of objects without the traditional staircase lines along the boundaries of square blocks.\n\nMore encoder parallelism is possible thanks to configurable prediction dependency between tile rows (<code>ext_tile</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/>\n\n===Prediction===\nAV1 performs internal processing in higher precision (10 or 12 bits per sample), which leads to compression improvement due to smaller rounding errors in reference imagery.\n\nPredictions can be combined in more advanced ways (than a uniform average) in a block (''compound prediction''), including smooth and sharp transition gradients in different directions (''wedge-partitioned prediction'') as well as implicit masks that are based on the difference between the two predictors. This allows combination of either two inter predictions or an inter and an intra prediction to be used in the same block.<ref name=\"VP10\"/>{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nA frame can reference 6 instead of 3 of the 8 available frame buffers for temporal (inter) prediction while providing more flexibility on bi-prediction<ref name=\"ibc2018-talk-codec-wars\"/> (<code>ext_refs</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}).\n[[File:Bergensbanen 1280x720.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=184|Warped motion as seen from the front of a train.]]\nThe ''Warped Motion'' (<code>warped_motion</code>)<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/> and ''Global Motion'' (<code>global_motion</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}) tools in AV1 aim to reduce redundant information in [[motion vector]]s by recognizing patterns arising from camera motion.<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/> They implement ideas that were tried to be exploited in preceding formats like e.g. MPEG-4 ASP, albeit with a novel approach that works in three dimensions. There can be a set of warping parameters for a whole frame offered in the bitstream, or blocks can use a set of implicit local parameters that get computed based on surrounding blocks.\n\n''Switch frames'' (S-frame) are a new inter-frame type that can be predicted using already decoded reference frames from a higher-resolution version of the same video to allow switching to a lower resolution without the need for a full keyframe at the beginning of a video segment in the [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] use case.<ref name=\"Streaming Media 2017-10-11\"/>\n\n====Intra Prediction ====\n[[Intra-frame coding|Intra prediction]] consists of predicting the pixels of a given blocks only using information available in the current frame. Most often, intra predictions are built from the neighboring pixels above and to the left of the predicted block. The DC predictor builds a prediction by averaging the pixels above and to the left of block.\n\nDirectional predictors extrapolate these neighboring pixels according to a specified angle. In AV1, 8 main directional modes can be chosen. These modes start at an angle of 45 degrees and increase by a step size of 22.5 degrees up until 203 degrees. Furthermore, for each directional mode, six offsets of 3 degree can be signalled for bigger blocks, three above the main angle and three below it, resulting in a total of 56 angles (<code>ext_intra</code>).\n\nThe \"TrueMotion\" predictor got replaced with a [[Paeth filter|Paeth]] predictor which looks at the difference from the known pixel in the above left corner to the pixel directly above and directly left of the new one and then chooses the one that lies in direction of the smaller gradient as predictor. A palette predictor is available for blocks with very few (up to 8, dominant) colors like in some computer screen content. Correlations between the luminosity and the color information can now be exploited with a predictor for chroma blocks that is based on samples from the luma plane (<code>cfl</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/> In order to reduce visible boundaries along borders of inter-predicted blocks, a technique called [[Motion compensation#Overlapped block motion compensation|overlapped block motion compensation]] (OBMC) can be used. This involves extending a block's size so that it overlaps with neighboring blocks by 2 to 32 pixels, and blending the overlapping parts together.<ref name=\"feldman-obmc\"/>\n\n===Data transformation===\nTo transform the error remaining after prediction to the frequency domain, AV1 encoders can use square, 2:1/1:2, and 4:1/1:4 rectangular [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]]s (<code>rect_tx</code>),<ref name=\"ibc2018-talk-codec-wars\"/> as well as an asymmetric [[Discrete sine transform|DST]]<ref name=\"Han Saxena Melkote Rose 2011\"/><ref name=\"negge-depth-packt\"/><ref name=\"negge-depth-slides\"/> for blocks where the top and/or left edge is expected to have lower error thanks to prediction from nearby pixels, or choose to do no transform (identity transform).\n\nIt can combine two one-dimensional transforms in order to use different transforms for the horizontal and the vertical dimension (<code>ext_tx</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/><ref name=\"ibc2018-talk-codec-wars\"/>\n\n===Quantization===\nAV1 has new optimized quantization matrices (<code>aom_qm</code>).{{cn|date=February 2020}} The eight sets of quantization parameters that can be selected and signaled for each frame now have individual parameters for the two chroma planes and can use spatial prediction. On every new superblock, the quantization parameters can be adjusted by signaling an offset.\n\n===Filters===\nFor the in-loop filtering step, the integration of Thor's constrained low-pass filter and Daala's directional deringing filter has been fruitful: The combined ''Constrained Directional Enhancement Filter'' (<code>cdef</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}) exceeds the results of using the original filters separately or together.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt is an edge-directed conditional replacement filter that smoothes blocks with configurable (signaled) strength roughly along the direction of the dominant edge to eliminate [[ringing artifacts]].\n\nThere is also the ''loop restoration filter'' (<code>loop_restoration</code>) based on the [[Wiener filter]] and self-[[guided filter|guided restoration filters]] to remove blur artifacts due to block processing.<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/>\n\n''Film grain synthesis'' (<code>film_grain</code>) improves coding of noisy signals using a parametric video coding approach.\nDue to the randomness inherent to film grain noise, this signal component is traditionally either very expensive to code or prone to get damaged or lost, possibly leaving serious coding artefacts as residue. This tool circumvents these problems using analysis and synthesis, replacing parts of the signal with a visually similar synthetic texture, based solely on subjective visual impression instead of objective similarity. It removes the grain component from the signal, analyzes its non-random characteristics, and instead transmits only descriptive parameters to the decoder, which adds back a synthetic, pseudorandom noise signal that's shaped after the original component. It is the visual equivalent of the Perceptual Noise Substitution technique used in AC3, AAC, Vorbis, and Opus audio codecs.\n\n===Entropy coding===\nDaala's entropy coder (<code>daala_ec</code>{{cn|date=February 2020}}), a non-binary [[arithmetic coding|arithmetic coder]], was selected for replacing VP9's binary entropy coder. The use of ''non-binary'' arithmetic coding helps evade patents, but also adds bit-level parallelism to an otherwise serial process, reducing clock rate demands on hardware implementations.{{cn|date=February 2020}} This is to say that the effectiveness of modern binary arithmetic coding like [[CABAC]] is being approached using a greater alphabet than binary, hence greater speed, as in [[Huffman code]] (but not as simple and fast as Huffman code).\nAV1 also gained the ability to adapt the symbol probabilities in the arithmetic coder per coded symbol instead of per frame (<code>ec_adapt</code>).<ref name=\"ittiam-ibc\"/>\n\n==Quality and efficiency==\n{{Update section|date=September 2019}}\nA first comparison from the beginning of June 2016<ref name=\"golem20160609\"/> found AV1 roughly on par with HEVC, as did one using code from late January 2017.<ref name=\"elecard_comparison\"/>\n\nIn April 2017, using the 8 enabled experimental features at the time (of 77 total), [[Bitmovin]] was able to demonstrate favorable [[Video quality|objective metrics]], as well as visual results, compared to HEVC on the ''[[Sintel]]'' and ''[[Tears of Steel]]'' animated films.{{cn|date=February 2020}} A follow-up comparison by Jan Ozer of ''Streaming Media Magazine'' confirmed this, and concluded that \"AV1 is at least as good as HEVC now\".<ref name=\"ozer_compares_hevc\"/>\n\nOzer noted that his and Bitmovin's results contradicted a comparison by [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications]] from late 2016<ref name=\"comparison_by_hhi\"/> that had found AV1 38.4% less efficient than HEVC, underperforming even H.264/AVC, and justified this discrepancy by having used encoding parameters endorsed by each encoder vendor, as well as having more features in the newer AV1 encoder.\n\nTests from Netflix showed that, based on measurements with [[Peak signal-to-noise ratio|PSNR]] and [[Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion|VMAF]] at 720p, AV1 was about 25% more efficient than VP9 (libvpx).<ref name=\"Netflix\"/> Similar conclusions with respect to quality were drawn from a test conducted by [[Moscow State University]] researchers, where VP9 was found to require 31% and HEVC 22% more bitrate than AV1 for the same level of quality.<ref name=\"MSU2017-1\"/> The researchers found that the used AV1 encoder was operating at a speed \"2500\u20133500 times lower than competitors\", while admitting that it has not been optimized yet.<ref name=\"MSU2017-2\"/>\n\nIn a comparison of AV1 against H.264 (x264) and VP9 (libvpx), Facebook showed about 45\u201350% bitrate savings over H.264 and about 40% over VP9 when using a constant quality encoding mode.<ref name=\"Baumgartner 2019\"/>\n\nDecoding performance was at about half the speed of VP9 according to internal measurements from 2017.<ref name=\"Streaming Media 2017-10-11\"/>\n\nAOMedia provides a list of test results [https://aomedia.org/news/av1-test-results/ on their website].\n\n==Profiles and levels==\n=== Profiles ===\nAV1 defines three profiles for decoders which are '''Main''', '''High''', and '''Professional'''.

The High profile further adds support for 4:4:4 chroma sampling. The Professional profile extends capabilities to full support for 4:0:0, 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 chroma sub-sampling with 8, 10 and 12 bit color depths.<ref name=\"Shilov 2018\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Feature comparison between AV1 profiles\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: none;\" |\n!Main (0)\n!High (1)\n!
