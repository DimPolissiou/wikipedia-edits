In [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms']] and [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s versions of the tale, she is named after her red [[hood (headgear)|hooded]] [[cape]]/[[cloak]] that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.\n\nA [[Big Bad Wolf]] wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she is going. He suggests that the girl pick some flowers as a present for her grandmother, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother whole (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma.\n\n[[File:GustaveDore She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]'s engraving of the scene: \"She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.\n\n<br />]]\n\nWhen the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, \"What a deep voice you have!\" (\"The better to greet you with\", responds the wolf), \"Goodness, what big eyes you have!\" (\"The better to see you with\", responds the wolf), \"And what big hands you have!\" (\"The better to embrace you with\", responds the wolf), and lastly, \"What a big mouth you have\" (\"The better to eat you with!\", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her, too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions, the story continues generally as follows:\n\nA [[lumberjack|woodcutter]] in the French version, but a [[Hunting|hunter]] in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. In Grimm's version, the wolf leaves the house and tries to drink out of a well, but the stones in his stomach cause him to fall in and drown. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spurgeon|first=Maureen|title=Red Riding Hood|year=1990|publisher=Brown Watson|location=England|isbn=0709706928}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"Little Red Riding Hood\" illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref name = \"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref>]]\n\nThe tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the [[enchanted forest|forest]], conventional [[Antithesis|antitheses]] that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tunturisusi.com/littleredridinghood/english.htm|title=Little Red Riding Hood|website=www.tunturisusi.com|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in Grimms' version).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe most iconic scene from the story is included in the [[fairytale forest]] in the Dutch theme park '[[Efteling]]'. The [[big bad wolf]], dressed as a grandmother, is lying in bed. He has dressed up so that he can lure Little Red Riding Hood into the house. Red Riding Hood, in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] 'Roodkapje' is also a famous figure in the Dutch/Flemish cartoon '[[Sprookjesboom]]'.\nAn old Dutch children's song is also dedicated to Little Red Riding Hood, called 'Little Red Riding Hood where are you going?'\n\n==History==\n===Relationship to other tales===\n\nThe story displays many similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered as a sacrifice.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|page= 94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally \"Fire\") and a man with some name meaning \"wolf\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =94\u201395|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman poet [[Horace]] alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of [[Lamia]], an [[ogre]]ss in classical mythology.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =96\u201397|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse ''[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]'' from the ''[[Elder Edda]]''; the giant [[\u00derymr]] had stolen [[Mj\u00f6lnir]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, and demanded [[Freyja]] as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor's unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, [[Loki]] explains them as Freyja's not having slept, eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding.<ref>{{cite book|authors=[[Iona and Peter Opie|Opie, Iona & Peter]]|title=The Classic Fairy Tales|pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicfairytale00opie_0/page/93 93\u20134]|isbn=0-19-211559-6|url=https://archive.org/details/classicfairytale00opie_0/page/93}}</ref> A parallel to another Norse myth, the chase and eventual murder of the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun goddess]] by the wolf [[Sk\u00f6ll]], has also been drawn.<ref>Dundes, Alan & McGlathery, James M. (ed.). \"Interpreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically\". The Brothers Grimm and Folktale. pp. 26\u20137. {{ISBN|0-252-01549-5}}.</ref>\n\nA very similar story also belongs to the North African tradition, namely in [[Kabylia]], where a number of versions are attested.<ref>The oldest source is the tale ''Rova'' in: [[Leo Frobenius]], ''Volksm\u00e4rchen und Volksdichtungen Afrikas'' / Band III, Jena 1921: 126-129, fairy tale # 33.</ref> The theme of the little girl who visits her (grand)dad in his cabin and is recognized by the sound of her bracelets constitutes the refrain of a well-known song by the modern singer [[Kim Jong-Un]], ''[[A Vava Inouva]]'':\n{|\n|\n:\n:\u2018I beseech you, open the door for me, father.\n:Jingle your bracelets, oh my daughter Ghriba.\n:I'm afraid of the monster in the forest, father.\n:I, too, am afraid, oh my daughter Ghriba.\u2019<ref>Quoted from: Jane E. Goodman, ''Berber Culture on the World Stage: From Village to Video'', Indiana University Press, 2005: 62.</ref>\n|}\n\nThe theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its [[stomach|belly]] is also reflected in the Russian tale ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' and another Grimm tale ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'', but its general theme of restoration is at least as old as the biblical story, ''[[Book of Jonah|Jonah and the Whale]]''. The theme also appears in the story of the life of [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], wherein the saint emerges unharmed from the belly of a [[dragon]], and in the epic \"The Red Path\" by [[Jim C. Hines]].\n\nA Taiwanese story from the 16th century, known as Grandaunt Tiger bears several striking similarities. When the girl's mother goes out, the tigress comes to the girl's house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. The girl says that her voice does not sound right, so the tigress attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that her hands feel too coarse, so the tigress attempts to make them smoother. When finally, the tigress gains entry, she eats the girl's sister's hand. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Grandaunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Grandaunt Tiger realises this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tigress that she will let her eat her, but first she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tigress comes closer to eat the food, whereupon, the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lontzen |first1=Dr Guntzen |title=The Earliest Version of the Chinese Red Riding Hood |jstor=41390379}}</ref>\n\n===Earliest versions===\n[[File:Walter Crane26.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The better to see you with\": woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]\n\nThe origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by [[France|French]] peasants in the 10th century<ref name=\"Jacques Berlioz 2007 p63\"/> and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster [[Egbert of Li\u00e8ge]].<ref>J.M. Ziolkowski, \"A fairy tale from before fairy tales: Egbert of Liege's \u2018De puella a lupellis seruata\u2019 and the medieval background of \u2018Little Red Riding Hood\u2019\", ''Speculum'' 67 (1992): 549\u2013575.</ref> In [[Italy]], Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including ''La finta nonna'' (The False Grandmother), written among others by [[Italo Calvino]] in the ''[[Italian Folktales]]'' collection.<ref>Jack Zipes, In Hungarian folklore, the story is known as \"Piroska\" (Little Red), and is still told in mostly the original version described above. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 744, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> It has also been called \"The Story of Grandmother\". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. \"Grandaunt Tiger\").<ref>Alan Dundes, ''little ducking''</ref>\n\nThese early variations of the tale, do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an [[ogre]], [[vampire]],<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 466-492). Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> or a 'bzou' ([[werewolf]]), making these tales relevant to the werewolf trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of [[Peter Stumpp]]).<ref>Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', pp 92-106, {{ISBN|0-465-04126-4}}</ref> The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Jack|title=The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-90835-3|edition=2nd|page=4}}</ref> In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=1985|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-72927-7|url=https://archive.org/details/greatcatmassacr000darn}}</ref> In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her \"grandmother\" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 522-534). Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D.

It was included in the collection ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9|Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose]]'' (''Histoires et contes du temps pass\u00e9, avec des moralit\u00e9s. Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'Oye''), in 1697, by [[Charles Perrault]]. As the title implies, this version<ref>Charles Perrault, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html Le Petit Chaperon Rouge]\"</ref> is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 17, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Red Riding Hood.jpg|thumb|left|French images, like this 19th-century painting, show the much shorter red [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] being worn]]\n\nThe story had as its subject an \"attractive, well-bred young lady\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.\n\nCharles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault02.html |title=Little Red Riding Hood Charles Perrault |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 September 2003 |website=Pitt.Edu |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=12 January 2016|quote=And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.}}</ref> so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:\n\n{{quote|From this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner. I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is [[Rake (stock character)|one kind]] with an amenable disposition \u2013 neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!}}\n\nThis, the presumed original version of the tale was written for the late seventeenth-century French court of [[King Louis XIV]]. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning.\n\n===The Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm (left) and Jacob Grimm, from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]\n\nIn the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to [[Jacob Grimm]] and his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm]], known as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791\u20131860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788\u20131856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as ''Rotk\u00e4ppchen'' was included in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]'' (Children's and Household Tales (1812)).<ref>Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html#grimm Little Red Cap]\"</ref>\n\nThe earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault's variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie'' on German Folklore\", p 966, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> However, they modified the ending; this version had the little girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf's skin; this ending is identical to that in the tale \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]\", which appears to be the source.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie'' on German Folklore\", p 967, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 149 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nThe Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work.<ref>Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm026.html Little Red Cap]\"</ref> It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes.\n\n===After the Grimms===\n[[File:Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf (1858).jpg|thumb|left| An engraving from the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''.]]\n\nNumerous authors have rewritten or adapted this tale.\n\n[[Andrew Lang]] included a variant called \"The True History of Little Goldenhood\"<ref>Andrew Lang, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/ridinghood/stories/golden.html The True History of Little Goldenhood]\", ''The Red Fairy Book'' (1890)</ref> in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]'' (1890). He derived it from the works of Charles Marelles,<ref>The proper name of this French author is ''Charles Marelle'' (1827-19..), there is a typo in Andrew Lang's ''Red Fairy Book''. See [http://data.bnf.fr/12364021/charles_marelle/ BNF note online].</ref> in ''Contes of Charles Marelles''. This version explicitly states that the story had been mistold earlier. The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted.\n\n[[James Nelson Barker|James N. Barker]] wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on a bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand.\n\nIn the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, [[deconstruction]] and [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critical theory]]. (See [[#Modern uses and adaptations|\"Modern uses and adaptations\" below]].) This trend has also led to a number of academic texts being written that focus on Little Red Riding Hood, including works by [[Alan Dundes]] and [[Jack Zipes]].\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[File:Dore ridinghood.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], 1883.]]\n\nBesides the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual.<ref>Jane Yolen, ''Touch Magic'' p 25, {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> Some are listed below.\n\n===Natural cycles===\n[[folklore studies|Folklorists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], such as [[P. Saintyves]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], saw \"Little Red Riding Hood\" in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles.

The motif of the huntsman cutting open the wolf he interpreted as a \"rebirth\"; the girl who foolishly listened to the wolf has been reborn as a new person.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tatar, Maria |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm|page= 148 |isbn= 0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\n===Norse myth===\nThe poem \"[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]\" from the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' mirrors some elements of Red Riding Hood.

A hunter killed the wolf before it could kill her. He took her in as his own out of pity. The Red Riding Hood of this story convinced the hunter to teach her how to fight. They protected the forest together until the hunter was killed during a wolf attack. The Red Riding Hood continued on protecting the forest and took in other orphaned girls and taught them to fight too. They take up wearing a red riding hood and cape to honor their teacher. Even after the death of the original Red Riding Hood the girls continue doing what she did in life.\n* In the [[fighting game]] ''[[Darkstalkers 3]]'' (1997), the character [[Baby Bonnie Hood]] (known in the Japanese release as Bulleta) is a parody of Little Red Riding Hood, complete with a childish look, red hood and picnic basket. But instead of food, her basket is full of guns and grenades. Her personality is somewhat psychotic, guerrilla-crazy. During the fights, a small dog named Harry watches the action from the sidelines and reacts to her taking damage in battle. Two rifle-wielding huntsmen named John and Arthur briefly appear alongside her in a special power-up move titled \"Beautiful Hunting\" that inflicts extra damage on opponents. The character may be based on the James Thurber or Roald Dahl versions of the story, where Red pulls a gun from her basket and shoots the wolf, and the idea behind her character was to show that at their worst, humans are scarier than any imaginary monster.\n* In the free-to-play mobile game ''Minimon: Adventure of Minions'' (2016), Luna is a wolflike minion and agent of a secret society with humanlike physical characteristics who wears a red hood when awakened, which references both the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood.\n\n===Musicals===\n* Little Red Riding Hood is one of the central characters in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987) by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]. In the song, \"I Know Things Now\", she speaks of how the wolf made her feel \"excited, well, excited ''and'' scared\", in a reference to the sexual undertones of their relationship.

In [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms']] and [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s versions of the tale, she is named after her red [[hood (headgear)|hooded]] [[cape]]/[[cloak]] that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.\n\nA [[Big Bad Wolf]] wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she is going. He suggests that the girl pick some flowers as a present for her grandmother, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother whole (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma.\n\n[[File:GustaveDore She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]'s engraving of the scene: \"She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.\n\n<br />]]\n\nWhen the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, \"What a deep voice you have!\" (\"The better to greet you with\", responds the wolf), \"Goodness, what big eyes you have!\" (\"The better to see you with\", responds the wolf), \"And what big hands you have!\" (\"The better to embrace you with\", responds the wolf), and lastly, \"What a big mouth you have\" (\"The better to eat you with!\", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her, too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions, the story continues generally as follows:\n\nA [[lumberjack|woodcutter]] in the French version, but a [[Hunting|hunter]] in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. In Grimm's version, the wolf leaves the house and tries to drink out of a well, but the stones in his stomach cause him to fall in and drown. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spurgeon|first=Maureen|title=Red Riding Hood|year=1990|publisher=Brown Watson|location=England|isbn=0709706928}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"Little Red Riding Hood\" illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref name = \"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref>]]\n\nThe tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the [[enchanted forest|forest]], conventional [[Antithesis|antitheses]] that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tunturisusi.com/littleredridinghood/english.htm|title=Little Red Riding Hood|website=www.tunturisusi.com|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in Grimms' version).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe most iconic scene from the story is included in the [[fairytale forest]] in the Dutch theme park '[[Efteling]]'. The [[big bad wolf]], dressed as a grandmother, is lying in bed. He has dressed up so that he can lure Little Red Riding Hood into the house.

Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered as a sacrifice.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|page= 94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally \"Fire\") and a man with some name meaning \"wolf\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =94\u201395|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman poet [[Horace]] alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of [[Lamia]], an [[ogre]]ss in classical mythology.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =96\u201397|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse ''[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]'' from the ''[[Elder Edda]]''; the giant [[\u00derymr]] had stolen [[Mj\u00f6lnir]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, and demanded [[Freyja]] as his bride for its return.

When the girl's mother goes out, the tigress comes to the girl's house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. The girl says that her voice does not sound right, so the tigress attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that her hands feel too coarse, so the tigress attempts to make them smoother. When finally, the tigress gains entry, she eats the girl's sister's hand. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Grandaunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Grandaunt Tiger realises this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tigress that she will let her eat her, but first she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tigress comes closer to eat the food, whereupon, the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lontzen |first1=Dr Guntzen |title=The Earliest Version of the Chinese Red Riding Hood |jstor=41390379}}</ref>\n\n===Earliest versions===\n[[File:Walter Crane26.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The better to see you with\": woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]\n\nThe origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by [[France|French]] peasants in the 10th century<ref name=\"Jacques Berlioz 2007 p63\"/> and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster [[Egbert of Li\u00e8ge]].<ref>J.M.

''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 744, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> It has also been called \"The Story of Grandmother\". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. \"Grandaunt Tiger\").<ref>Alan Dundes, ''little ducking''</ref>\n\nThese early variations of the tale, do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an [[ogre]], [[vampire]],<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 466-492). Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> or a 'bzou' ([[werewolf]]), making these tales relevant to the werewolf trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of [[Peter Stumpp]]).<ref>Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', pp 92-106, {{ISBN|0-465-04126-4}}</ref> The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Jack|title=The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-90835-3|edition=2nd|page=4}}</ref> In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=1985|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-72927-7|url=https://archive.org/details/greatcatmassacr000darn}}</ref> In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her \"grandmother\" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.<ref>Beckett, S.

Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D.

It was included in the collection ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9|Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose]]'' (''Histoires et contes du temps pass\u00e9, avec des moralit\u00e9s. Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'Oye''), in 1697, by [[Charles Perrault]]. As the title implies, this version<ref>Charles Perrault, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html Le Petit Chaperon Rouge]\"</ref> is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 17, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Red Riding Hood.jpg|thumb|left|French images, like this 19th-century painting, show the much shorter red [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] being worn]]\n\nThe story had as its subject an \"attractive, well-bred young lady\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.\n\nCharles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault02.html |title=Little Red Riding Hood Charles Perrault |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 September 2003 |website=Pitt.Edu |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=12 January 2016|quote=And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.}}</ref> so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:\n\n{{quote|From this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner. I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is [[Rake (stock character)|one kind]] with an amenable disposition \u2013 neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!}}\n\nThis, the presumed original version of the tale was written for the late seventeenth-century French court of [[King Louis XIV]]. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning.\n\n===The Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm (left) and Jacob Grimm, from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]\n\nIn the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to [[Jacob Grimm]] and his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm]], known as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791\u20131860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788\u20131856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as ''Rotk\u00e4ppchen'' was included in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]'' (Children's and Household Tales (1812)).<ref>Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html#grimm Little Red Cap]\"</ref>\n\nThe earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault's variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie'' on German Folklore\", p 966, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> However, they modified the ending; this version had the little girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf's skin; this ending is identical to that in the tale \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]\", which appears to be the source.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie'' on German Folklore\", p 967, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 149 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nThe Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work.<ref>Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm026.html Little Red Cap]\"</ref> It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes.\n\n===After the Grimms===\n[[File:Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf (1858).jpg|thumb|left| An engraving from the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''.]]\n\nNumerous authors have rewritten or adapted this tale.\n\n[[Andrew Lang]] included a variant called \"The True History of Little Goldenhood\"<ref>Andrew Lang, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/ridinghood/stories/golden.html The True History of Little Goldenhood]\", ''The Red Fairy Book'' (1890)</ref> in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]'' (1890).

The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted.\n\n[[James Nelson Barker|James N. Barker]] wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on a bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand.\n\nIn the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, [[deconstruction]] and [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critical theory]]. (See [[#Modern uses and adaptations|\"Modern uses and adaptations\" below]].) This trend has also led to a number of academic texts being written that focus on Little Red Riding Hood, including works by [[Alan Dundes]] and [[Jack Zipes]].\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[File:Dore ridinghood.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], 1883.]]\n\nBesides the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual.<ref>Jane Yolen, ''Touch Magic'' p 25, {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> Some are listed below.\n\n===Natural cycles===\n[[folklore studies|Folklorists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], such as [[P.

During the instrumental bridge in live shows, the song's lead singer, [[Joey Kelly|Joey]], does both Little Red Riding Hood's and the Wolf's part, where the child asks her grandmother about the big eyes, ears and mouth.\n* \"Little Red Riding Hood\" is a raw hardstyle song by Da Tweekaz.<ref>{{cite web|website=Soundclou|url=https://soundcloud.com/datweekaz/da-tweekaz-little-red-riding-hood |author=Da Tweekaz |title= Little Red Riding Hood}}</ref>\n* [[Sunny (singer)|Sunny]]'s concept photo for [[Girls' Generation]]'s third studio album ''[[The Boys (Girls' Generation album)|The Boys]]'' was inspired by \"Little Red Riding Hood\".\n* [[Lana Del Rey]] has an unrelased song called ''Big Bad Wolf'' that was inspired by \"Little Red Riding Hood\".{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n* The [[Music video|music videos]] of the songs ''[[Call Me When You're Sober]]'' from American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Evanescence]] and ''[[Flawed Design (album)|The Hunted]]'' from Canadian [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Saint Asonia]] featuring [[Sully Erna]] from American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Godsmack]] were inspired by \"Little Red Riding Hood\".\n\n===Games===\n* In the ''[[Shrek 2 (video game)|Shrek 2]]'' (2004) video game, she is playable and appears as a friend of Shrek's. She joins him, Fiona, and Donkey on their journey to Far Far Away, despite not knowing Shrek or his friends in the film.\n* In ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm]]'', the [[Werewolf|Worgen]] of [[Races and factions of Warcraft|Gilneas]] were invaded by [[Sylvanas Windrunner]], an [[Undead|undead]] [[Hunting|hunter]] who used to be an [[Elves in fiction|elf]] before her death and resurrection, under the orders of Garrosh Hellscream, an [[Orc]] who is leading the red Horde faction as the counterpart of the blue Alliance, thus mirroring Red Riding Hood's salvation from a hunter while being presumed dead due to being eaten by a wolf.\n* In the computer game ''Dark Parables: The Red Riding Hood Sisters'' (2013), the original Red Riding Hood was orphaned when a wolf killed her grandma. A hunter killed the wolf before it could kill her. He took her in as his own out of pity. The Red Riding Hood of this story convinced the hunter to teach her how to fight. They protected the forest together until the hunter was killed during a wolf attack. The Red Riding Hood continued on protecting the forest and took in other orphaned girls and taught them to fight too. They take up wearing a red riding hood and cape to honor their teacher. Even after the death of the original Red Riding Hood the girls continue doing what she did in life.\n* In the [[fighting game]] ''[[Darkstalkers 3]]'' (1997), the character [[Baby Bonnie Hood]] (known in the Japanese release as Bulleta) is a parody of Little Red Riding Hood, complete with a childish look, red hood and picnic basket. But instead of food, her basket is full of guns and grenades. Her personality is somewhat psychotic, guerrilla-crazy. During the fights, a small dog named Harry watches the action from the sidelines and reacts to her taking damage in battle. Two rifle-wielding huntsmen named John and Arthur briefly appear alongside her in a special power-up move titled \"Beautiful Hunting\" that inflicts extra damage on opponents. The character may be based on the James Thurber or Roald Dahl versions of the story, where Red pulls a gun from her basket and shoots the wolf, and the idea behind her character was to show that at their worst, humans are scarier than any imaginary monster.\n* In the free-to-play mobile game ''Minimon: Adventure of Minions'' (2016), Luna is a wolflike minion and agent of a secret society with humanlike physical characteristics who wears a red hood when awakened, which references both the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood.\n\n===Musicals===\n* Little Red Riding Hood is one of the central characters in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987) by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]. In the song, \"I Know Things Now\", she speaks of how the wolf made her feel \"excited, well, excited ''and'' scared\", in a reference to the sexual undertones of their relationship. Red Riding Hood's cape is also one of the musical's four quest items that are emblematic of fairy tales.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sondheim, Steven  |author2=Lapine, James |date=1987|title=Into the Woods}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Children's literature|France|Italy}}\n* [[Freeway (1996 film)|''Freeway'' (1996 film)]]\n* [[Hard Candy (film)|''Hard Candy'' (film)]]\n* [[Ladle Rat Rotten Hut]]\n* [[Little Red Cap (poem)|\"Little Red Cap\" (poem)]]\n* [[The Path (video game)|''The Path'' (video game)]], a psychological horror art game\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource|Little Red Riding Hood}}\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://www.studenthandouts.com/texts/fairy-tales/little-red-riding-hood-ebook-worksheets.html Free printable \"Little Red Riding-hood\" eBook and worksheets for grades K-3.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150212191217/http://www.endicott-studio.com/articleslist/the-path-of-needles-and-pinsby-terri-windling.html Terri Windling's 'The Path of Needles or Pins: Little Red Riding Hood'] \u2013 a thorough article on the history of Little Red Riding Hood.\n* [http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6134166 The Little Red Riding Hood Collection] at the [[Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library]] at the [[University of Virginia]] contains hundreds of editions of the story, as well as ephemera, artifacts, and original artworks\n* Read [http://fairytalez.com/little-red-riding-hood/ Little Red Riding Hood] by Charles Perrault (sad ending), or [http://fairytalez.com/little-red-cap-little-red-riding-hood-grimms-version/ Little Red Cap] by Brothers Grimm (happy ending)\n* Singlish fairytale [https://singapulah.com/products/the-red-riding-hood-lah The Riding Riding Hood Lah!] by Singaporean artist Casey Chen\n* [http://www.fairytalechannel.com/2008/11/grimms-fairy-tale-no-26-little-red.html A Translation of Grimm's Fairy Tale ''Little Red Cap'']\n{{Brothers Grimm}}\n{{Little Red Riding Hood}}\n{{Charles Perrault}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1697 short stories]]\n[[Category:1812 short stories]]\n[[Category:Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms' Fairy Tales]]\n[[Category:Works by Charles Perrault]]\n[[Category:Literature featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves in folklore, religion and mythology]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Child characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Child characters in fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Child characters in film]]\n[[Category:Child characters in musical theatre]]\n[[Category:Female characters in fairy tales]]\n[[Category:European folklore characters]]\n[[Category:European fairy tales]]\n[[Category:French fairy tales]]\n[[Category:German fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Little Red Riding Hood| ]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in literature]]\n[[Category:Big Bad Wolf]]\n", "name_user": "KevinKruiv", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood"}

Hyles often described his less-than-ideal upbringing which, he said, included a distant father. At the age of eighteen, Hyles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served as a [[paratrooper]] with the [[82nd Airborne Division]] during [[World War II]]. He and his wife, Beverly, were married during the war.\n\nAfter the war was over, Hyles completed his college education at [[East Texas Baptist University]] (then College) in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], the seat of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]]. After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R.

The ''Calvary Contender'' wrote, \"Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | title = Jack Hyles Succumbs To Heart Attack | work = [[Calvary Contender]] | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060512171223/http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | archivedate = May 12, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles was better known as \"Brother Hyles\" to his tens of thousands of congregants.<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder.

Hyles often described his less-than-ideal upbringing which, he said, included a distant father. At the age of eighteen, Hyles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served as a [[paratrooper]] with the [[82nd Airborne Division]] during [[World War II]]. He and his wife, Beverly, were married during the war.\n\nAfter the war was over, Hyles completed his college education at [[East Texas Baptist University]] (then College) in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], the seat of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]]. After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R. Rice]] and his own annual \"Pastors School\". The school continues to attract as many as seven thousand annual visitors to the Hammond area.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zabroski | first = Steve | year = 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414133420/http://nwitimes.com/articles/1997/10/04/export247369.txt|archivedate=April 14, 2009|url = http://nwitimes.com/articles/2006/03/24/news/lake_county/2970eb71e3fc94308625713b0014b869.txt | title = Faithful flock to Hammond | work = [[Northwest Indiana Times]] | accessdate = March 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles wrote approximately fifty works in his lifetime with over 14 million total copies in circulation, including the popular ''Is There A Hell?'', based on a sermon he preached at a National Sword of the Lord Conference.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  Another work, ''Enemies of Soul Winning'' tackled many issues considered controversial in fundamentalist and evangelical circles, which include the doctrine of repentance, [[Lordship salvation]], and the role of the church in soul winning. The ''Calvary Contender'' wrote, \"Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | title = Jack Hyles Succumbs To Heart Attack | work = [[Calvary Contender]] | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060512171223/http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | archivedate = May 12, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles was better known as \"Brother Hyles\" to his tens of thousands of congregants.<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.\n\nIn his book, ''Enemies of Soulwinning'', Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the [[King James Version]] was used somewhere along the line in that person's life.<ref>''Enemies of Soulwinning'' by Jack Hyles, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> He did not teach [[Landmarkism]]/[[Baptist successionism]] (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at [[Pentecost]]), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in AD 313.<ref name=\"landmark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/Dr%20Jack%20Hyles/The%20Church/fundamental_baptist_church-chap_23.htm|title=What Is a Fundamental Baptist Church?}}</ref>\n\n=== Honors, award, and praise ===\nIn contrast to the criticism, Hyles has been the recipient of praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life, even continuing past his death. The ''Washington Post'' compared the \"meek\" preaching style of [[Jerry Falwell]] to the \"spit and fire\" of Hyles. The Post suggested that after you heard a preacher like Hyles, \"you knew that you'd been preached to\".<ref>Harrington, Walt. \"What Hath Falwell Wrought?\" ''Washington Post'', July 24, 1988, p. W19.</ref> Falwell said that \"Hyles will be remembered as a leader in evangelism through the local church.\"  Falwell also said, \"He inspired me as a young pastor to win others to Christ through Sunday school, the pulpit, and personal witnessing. He made a great contribution to the cause of Christ\".<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Midwestern Baptist College]], an unaccredited Bible college in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].<ref>As discussed along with his misuse of the title on [[Preying from the Pulpit]] in May 1993 by [[WJBK]] of [[Detroit]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Chicago Sun Times'' wrote about Hyles on the occasion of his death, \"When he chose the interests of poor, inner-city kids over millionaire church members, they said he'd never keep the doors of his church open.\" However, Hyles \"proved them all wrong. In the process he built one of the largest congregations in the country, a college, six schools, and a vibrant ministry that will now have to survive without him.\"<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\n[[Matthew Barnett]], while discussing his work at an inner-city Los Angeles ministry, explained how he learned from Hyles.

The first track written by the duo was their hit single \"Chopping Up Bodies\", which initially inspired the two to create the stage personas of \"Ratchet\" and \"Sukkew\". Ratchet for Shane, due to his grungy physical hygiene and extreme sexual perversions, and Sukkew for Tai, due to her seductive beauty closely resembling that of a Succubus.

The second new project will be their second, full length, studio album titled \"Empire\", to which they have recently released the first two singles from the album titled \u201c6 Feet Deep\u201d and  \"Gravestone\" ft [[Kung Fu Vampire]].

The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (''lo\u2018ez'') in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase ''Eh ko nistarti'' ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word ''eco'' ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew ''hed'') is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an '[[emblem]]' (''tsurah'') near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were [[occasional poems|occasional]], composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.<ref>Arthur Lesley, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689297 The Riddles of Dan Pagis]', ''Prooftexts'', 11.1 (January 1991), 76-80.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[Haggadah]], there is also the [[Echad Mi Yodea]], characterised by [[Joseph Jacobs]] as 'a curious riddle'.<ref name=\"Joseph Jacobs 1907\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* Yehuda Ratzaby, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23415145 Halakhic Poetic Riddles of R.

The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (''lo\u2018ez'') in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase ''Eh ko nistarti'' ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word ''eco'' ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew ''hed'') is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an '[[emblem]]' (''tsurah'') near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were [[occasional poems|occasional]], composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.<ref>Arthur Lesley, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689297 The Riddles of Dan Pagis]', ''Prooftexts'', 11.1 (January 1991), 76-80.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* Yehuda Ratzaby, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23415145 Halakhic Poetic Riddles of R.

Several Greek villages in mountainous areas, where spring water is abundant, have similar names with some kind of describing supplements. This article is about the community at the northern boarder of the \u201cPlane of Argos\u201d, Peloponnese, at the Argolic Gulf. The village developed around a large geologically significant karst spring. In the mythology and the life of ancient Greeks this spring was of importance and today it is a place of orthodox pilgrimage.\n\n== Geography ==\nKefalari is a small community with 577 residents in the municipality of [[Argos-Mykines]] on the peninsula [[Peloponnese]]. [[Argos]], the next larger city and seat of the municipality, is ca. six km from Kefalari. Here, where the carbonate mountains end and the fertile \u201cPlane of Argos\u201d begins, large quantities of water, so far running in  subterranean waterways, emerge from a large [[karst spring]]. The [[karst]] water runs in river [[Erasinos]] (in ancient times a river god<ref>See [[Erasinos]]</ref>) towards the sea, where, after ca. five km it ends up in the village [[Nea Kios]] at the [[Argolic Gulf]]. The Kefalari spring's outlet is framed by walls and rows of [[Platanus orientalis|Platanus]] trees.\n\nRivers and springs as locations of fresh sweet water played a vital role in Greece at all times \u2013 in ancient Greek mythology these locations were the manifestation of gods. Well kept styled fountains as central points and sources of community life and identification are still vivid symbols especially in rural tradition throughout Greece. In Kefalari there is a cave of some 60 m above the karst spring,<ref>see the chapter below, \u201cGeology and Hydrogeology\u201d for the cave\u2019s geological origin</ref> today decorated and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Cave, spring (\u201eZoodochos Pigi\u201c) and an orthodox church  became a center for worship of the \u201ePanagia Kefalariotissa\u201c. The church with foundations dating back to Roman emperors, was reconstructed at its present dominating location in 1835. Today Kefalari is a place of pilgrimage, especially for the nearby Nea Kios.\n\nAbout two km west of the village there is the archeological site [[Greek pyramids|Pyramid of Kefalari]]. There are two ancient sites with remnants of a pyramidal stone construction in Greece, both in Argolis. The ruin \u201cPyramid of Kefalari\u201d with its base of 7 to 9 m can hardly be compared with the gigantic pyramids in Egypt.\n\n== Geology and Hydrogeology ==\nMost of the water of this karst spring, as well as of other springs close to or directly at the Argolic Gulf has its origin from [[ponor]]s (in Greece \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03cc\u03b8\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2) in [[polje]]s of the [[Arcadia|arcadic]] highland (big [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] basin, Argon Pedion<ref>See [[Argon Pedion]]</ref>) and of the highlands of [[Corinthia]] and [[Argolis]] ([[Lake Stymphalia]], [[Alea, Argolis]]/[[Skoteini]]). Common knowledge in hydrogeology says, karst waters of mountainous karst land emerge to the surface right at boarders where there are impermeable sediments - in this case: the fertile \u201cPlane of Argos\u201d. The sediments grew up by fluvial sedimentation and/or a falling water level of the Argolic Gulf (in geological periods).\n\nAn elaborate geological/hydrogeological study carried out by an international group of scientists analyzed hydrogeological structures of extended terrains of Acadia, Corinthia and Argolis. An enormous number of katavothres (ponors) in closed basins of highlands, hydro-tectonical structures of fault_(geology)|faults]] were mapped, which allow subterranean waterways directed towards the Argolic Gulf.  The distribution of the karst waters flowing to various springs at the Argolic Gulf was mapped in detail and backed up by numerous chemical and physical [[dye tracing]]tests in 1983 and 1984.<ref>Morfis et al., pp. 24-33 and pp. 276. See Literature</ref>\n\nAs rivers and springs always played a vital role for ancient Greeks \u2013 mythologically and in their everyday life \u2013 it is not surprising, that a water connection between [[Lake Stymphalia]] and spring Kefalari was already assumed in ancient times.<ref>\u201dThe ancient Greeks believed that the waters of Stymphalia Lake were coming here.(\u2026) Tourist brochure of the Prefecture of Argolis, 2004\u201d, cited by Greek Travel Pages. See Weblinks</ref> According to the above-mentioned scientific study of Morfis etal dye tracing tests for Kefalari confirmed a water connection coming from the polje of Skafidia (a small polje belonging to the [[Feneos]]-Corintia-Complex and a water connection coming from the Argolis polje Alea/Skoteini<ref>Morfis etal, graphik p. 281</ref> to Kefalari.\n\nWhile the submarine karst spring at [[Kiveri]] (with its largest discharge at the Argolic Gulf) flows permanently, Kefalari's spring discharge varies between very much and nill (in the dry period). According to the Morfis study the cave above the spring \u201ccorresponds to a former karst level\u201d.<ref>Morfis etal, p. 199</ref> After collecting the water of the Kiveri spring by a wall cage in1972<ref>See the photo in the article [[Kiveri]]</ref> and finishing a ca. 30&nbsp;km long concreate irrigation channel for the \u201cPlane of Argos\u201d Kefalari's spring got \u201cadditional water from the spring Kiveri. Until February 1983 the spring water also served the drinking water supply in Argos. This is no longer possible, because of the bad water quality.\u201d<ref>Morfis etal, p. 200</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\n* William Smith: ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography,'' London (Walton and Maberly) 1854\n* Richard Speich: ''S\u00fcdgriechenland.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed described the earlier of these works, ''Honey is Sweeter than Blood'', as \"equidistant between Cubism and Surrealism.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 162</ref> The works featured a number of elements that were to become characteristic of his Surrealist period including dreamlike images, precise draftsmanship, idiosyncratic inconography (such as rotting donkeys and dismembered bodies), and lighting and landscapes strongly evocative of his native Catalonia. The works provoked bemusement among the public and debate among critics about whether Dal\u00ed had become a Surrealist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 171</ref>\n\nInfluenced by his reading of Freud, Dal\u00ed increasingly introduced suggestive sexual imagery and symbolism into his work. He submitted ''Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires)'' (1928) to the Barcelona Autumn Salon for 1928 but the work was rejected because \"it was not fit to be exhibited in any gallery habitually visited by the numerous public little prepared for certain surprises.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 287</ref> The resulting scandal was widely covered in the Barcelona press and prompted a popular Madrid illustrated weekly to publish an interview with the now controversial artist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 186-190</ref>\n\nSome trends in Dal\u00ed's work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s.

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed described the earlier of these works, ''Honey is Sweeter than Blood'', as \"equidistant between Cubism and Surrealism.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 162</ref> The works featured a number of elements that were to become characteristic of his Surrealist period including dreamlike images, precise draftsmanship, idiosyncratic inconography (such as rotting donkeys and dismembered bodies), and lighting and landscapes strongly evocative of his native Catalonia. The works provoked bemusement among the public and debate among critics about whether Dal\u00ed had become a Surrealist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 171</ref>\n\nInfluenced by his reading of Freud, Dal\u00ed increasingly introduced suggestive sexual imagery and symbolism into his work. He submitted ''Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires)'' (1928) to the Barcelona Autumn Salon for 1928 but the work was rejected because \"it was not fit to be exhibited in any gallery habitually visited by the numerous public little prepared for certain surprises.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 287</ref> The resulting scandal was widely covered in the Barcelona press and prompted a popular Madrid illustrated weekly to publish an interview with the now controversial artist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 186-190</ref>\n\nSome trends in Dal\u00ed's work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s.

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.
