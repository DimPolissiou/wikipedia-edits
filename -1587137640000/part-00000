It was released on April 5, 1999 via frontman Michael Gira's own record label [[Young God Records]], immediately after Michael Gira disbanded his previous band, [[Swans (band)|Swans]].

Understanding of these changes may shed light on the processes that contribute to age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. Barnes also developed the [[Barnes maze]], a spatial navigation memory task that is used to assess hippocampal-dependent memory.\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:Carleton_University_River.jpg|thumb|Carleton University River]]\n[[File:Riverside,_California_view_from_Box_Springs.jpg|thumb|Riverside, California view from Box Springs]]\n[[File:The_University_of_Oslo.jpg|thumb|The University of Oslo]]\n[[File:London_MMB_08_University_College.jpg|thumb|London MMB 08 University College]]\nCarol Barnes received a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology with honors at the [[University of California]], riverside, in 1971. She continued her education at [[Carleton University]] located in Ottawa Ontario, Canada, earning her Masters of Arts degree in Psychology in 1972.During her studies in pursuing a PhD in Psychology, Barnes took a temporary position as a postdoctoral researcher researching in [[neuropsychology]] and [[neurophysiology]] in the department of psychology at [[Dalhousie University]], at the institute of neurophysiology of [[University of Oslo]]as well as in Cerebral function at [[University College London|University College of London]]. In 1977 she graduated with Cum Laude in psychology at [[Carleton University]].\n\n== Career ==\nBarnes currently holds the positions of director for two organizations The Evelyn F McKnight Brain Institute and the Neural Systems-Memory and Aging. She holds the position of the Endowed Chair of the Evelyn F McKnight Brain Institute for Learning-Memory in Aging. Today she is a regents professor at the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson, Arizona. Barnes is apart\u00a0of the BIO5 Institute that is funded by the Technology and Research Fund (TRIF).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bio5.org/about/why|title=Why BIO5 {{!}} BIO5 Institute|website=bio5.org|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> At the BIO5 institute she works with students addressing [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other age-related brain diseases. Barnes also teaches cancer biology, neuroscience, psychology, and physiological sciences.\n\n== Research ==\nBarnes is involved with the [[neuroscience]] research community on a national and local level. Barnes research spans through 4 decades aiming to better understand the aging of the brain in relation to cognitive diseases. Her research is conducted by utilizing animal models such as primates and rats to explore and understand how memory is impacted through the normal aging process of the brain through means of neurobiological mechanisms that are involved. The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging impacting brain functioning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0 synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes created her own maze to test whether rodents, specifically mice, could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. The study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was also covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in spatial memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. Using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change while the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning to compare it to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that while during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the hippocampus. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition than younger monkeys. In addition, the older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated, which resembles the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding means that the studied rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans all use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual experience. However, since all three subjects have different sized hippocampi, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest hippocampus and thus use 40% of their hippocampus neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampi and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest hippocampi and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as set shifting. Attentional monitoring and updating are when the rules of a given situation change requiring a corresponding change in behavioral responses. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct initial choice. When the correct choice becomes the second option instead, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error which helps associate desired outcomes with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Meaning, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking around space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less differentiated activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated networks. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .

Understanding of these changes may shed light on the processes that contribute to age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. Barnes also developed the [[Barnes maze]], a spatial navigation memory task that is used to assess hippocampal-dependent memory.\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:Carleton_University_River.jpg|thumb|Carleton University River]]\n[[File:Riverside,_California_view_from_Box_Springs.jpg|thumb|Riverside, California view from Box Springs]]\n[[File:The_University_of_Oslo.jpg|thumb|The University of Oslo]]\n[[File:London_MMB_08_University_College.jpg|thumb|London MMB 08 University College]]\nCarol Barnes received a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology with honors at the [[University of California]], riverside, in 1971. She continued her education at [[Carleton University]] located in Ottawa Ontario, Canada, earning her Masters of Arts degree in Psychology in 1972.During her studies in pursuing a PhD in Psychology, Barnes took a temporary position as a postdoctoral researcher researching in [[neuropsychology]] and [[neurophysiology]] in the department of psychology at [[Dalhousie University]], at the institute of neurophysiology of [[University of Oslo]]as well as in Cerebral function at [[University College London|University College of London]]. In 1977 she graduated with Cum Laude in psychology at [[Carleton University]].\n\n== Career ==\nBarnes currently holds the positions of director for two organizations: the Evelyn F McKnight Brain Institute and the Neural Systems-Memory and Aging. She is also the Endowed Chair of the Evelyn F McKnight Brain Institute for Learning-Memory in Aging. Today, she is a regents professor at the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson, Arizona,\u00a0of the BIO5 Institute, funded by the Technology and Research Fund (TRIF).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bio5.org/about/why|title=Why BIO5 {{!}} BIO5 Institute|website=bio5.org|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> At the BIO5 institute she works with students addressing [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other age-related brain diseases. Barnes also teaches cancer biology, neuroscience, psychology, and physiological sciences.\n\n== Research ==\nBarnes is involved with the [[neuroscience]] research community on a national and local level. Barnes research spans through 4 decades aiming to better understand the aging of the brain in relation to cognitive diseases. Her research is conducted by utilizing animal models such as primates and rats to explore and understand how memory is impacted through the normal aging process of the brain through means of neurobiological mechanisms that are involved. The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging impacting brain functioning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0 synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes created her own maze to test whether rodents, specifically mice, could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. The study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was also covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in spatial memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. Using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change while the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning to compare it to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that while during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the hippocampus. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition than younger monkeys. In addition, the older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated, which resembles the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding means that the studied rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans all use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual experience. However, since all three subjects have different sized hippocampi, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest hippocampus and thus use 40% of their hippocampus neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampi and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest hippocampi and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as set shifting. Attentional monitoring and updating are when the rules of a given situation change requiring a corresponding change in behavioral responses. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct initial choice. When the correct choice becomes the second option instead, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error which helps associate desired outcomes with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Meaning, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking around space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less differentiated activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated networks. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .

He lives in H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland. He has studied Social Sciences (M.A. and L.Soc.Sc) and Literature (Ph.D) and has worked in journalism before becoming a full-time writer in 1981. His debut book was published in 1978 and since that he has published over 20 books (mostly novels and short story collections) and drama. Some of his novels have been translated into German, Swedish, Norwegian, Estonian and Latvian, and short stories in different languages.\n\nOlli Jalonen studied at the University of Tampere 1973-2006 and also at Trinity College Dublin 1979\u20131980. He took part in the International Writing Program IWP at the University of Iowa in 1982 and was the first Writer-in-Residence of Zurich, Switzerland, in 2010\u20132011. Olli Jalonen has received several literary awards since his debut book, including the [[Finlandia Fiction Prize]] in 1990 for his [[novel]] ''Is\u00e4ksi ja tytt\u00e4reksi'' and again in 2018 for his [[novel]] ''Taivaanpallo'', the J. H. Erkko Prize for the best debut book in 1978 and the Eino Leino Prize in 1990. He has had three nominations for the Nordic Council Literature Prize<ref>http://oga.otava.fi/authors/olli-jalonen/</ref><ref>The Dedalus Book of Finnish Fantasy, Dedalus 2005</ref><ref>http://www.uta.fi/lti/en/plural/theses/completed.html</ref><ref>http://www.writers-in-residence.ch/en/home/olli_jalonen</ref><ref>http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/nordic-council-prizes/nordisk-raads-litteraturpris</ref>\n\nIt has been said that Olli Jalonen's writing shows a delight in playing with the nature of reality. One of the trademarks of his work as a prosewriter is his desire to bring together his earlier works to form part of new, larger entities, thus making his texts comment upon one another.<ref>The Dedalus Book of Finnish Fantasy, Dedalus 2005</ref>\n\nFor decades he has been interested in the island of St. Helena and the astronomer and scientist Edmond Halley (1656-1742). For instance Jalonen's novel ''14 solmua Greenwichiin'' (14 Knots to Greenwich, Otava 2008) centres on the story of a fictional round-the-world race by land and sea that starts and ends in Greenwich.

He lives in H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland. He has studied Social Sciences (M.A. and L.Soc.Sc) and Literature (Ph.D) and has worked in journalism before becoming a full-time writer in 1981. His debut book was published in 1978 and since that he has published over 20 books (mostly novels and short story collections) and drama. Some of his novels have been translated into German, Swedish, Norwegian, Estonian and Latvian, and short stories in different languages.\n\nOlli Jalonen studied at the University of Tampere 1973-2006 and also at Trinity College Dublin 1979-1980. He took part in the International Writing Program IWP at the University of Iowa in 1982 and was the first Writer-in-Residence of Zurich, Switzerland, in 2010-2011. Olli Jalonen has received several literary awards since his debut book, including the [[Finlandia Fiction Prize]] in 1990 for his [[novel]] ''Is\u00e4ksi ja tytt\u00e4reksi'' and again in 2018 for his [[novel]] ''Taivaanpallo'', the J. H. Erkko Prize for the best debut book in 1978 and the Eino Leino Prize in 1990. He has had three nominations for the Nordic Council Literature Prize<ref>http://oga.otava.fi/authors/olli-jalonen/</ref><ref>The Dedalus Book of Finnish Fantasy, Dedalus 2005</ref><ref>http://www.uta.fi/lti/en/plural/theses/completed.html</ref><ref>http://www.writers-in-residence.ch/en/home/olli_jalonen</ref><ref> http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/nordic-council-prizes/nordisk-raads-litteraturpris</ref>\n\nIt has been said that Olli Jalonen\u2019s writing shows a delight in playing with the nature of reality. One of the trademarks of his work as a prosewriter is his desire to bring together his earlier works to form part of new, larger entities, thus making his texts comment upon one another.<ref>The Dedalus Book of Finnish Fantasy, Dedalus 2005</ref>\n\nFor decades he has been interested in the island of St. Helena and the astronomer and scientist Edmond Halley (1656-1742). For instance Jalonen\u2019s novel ''14 solmua Greenwichiin'' (14 Knots to Greenwich, Otava 2008) centres on the story of a fictional round-the-world race by land and sea that starts and ends in Greenwich. It moves between suspense fiction and autobiography in an unusual and often enigmatic way. The novel ''Taivaanpallo'' (The Celestial Sphere, Otava 2018) tells about the rays of the Enlightenment and life on St. Helena and London in the 1680s. The story of Edmond Halley and his trusted apprentice Angus continues in ''Merenpeitto'' (The Art of Living under Water, Otava 2019).<ref>http://www.booksfromfinland.fi/2008/12/olli-jalonen-14-solmua-greenwichiin-14-knots-to-greenwich/</ref><ref>http://nordicvoices.blogspot.fi/2009/03/14-knots-to-greenwich.html</ref><ref>https://rightsandbrands.com/products/the-celestial-sphere/</ref><ref> https://rightsandbrands.com/products/the-art-of-living-under-water/</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n===Novels and short story collections===\n* {{cite book | title=Unien tausta | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1978 | isbn = 951-1-04899-6}}\n* {{cite book | title=Sulkaturkki | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1979 | isbn = 951-1-05540-2}}\n* {{cite book | title=Ilo ja h\u00e4pe\u00e4 | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1981 | isbn = 951-1-06394-4}}\n* {{cite book | title=Hotelli el\u00e4ville | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava  | year=1983 | isbn = 951-1-07472-5}}\n* {{cite book | title=Tuhkasaari | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1987 | isbn = 951-1-09814-4}}\n* {{cite book | title=Johan ja Johan | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1989 | isbn = 951-1-10895-6}}\n* {{cite book | title=Is\u00e4ksi ja tytt\u00e4reksi | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1990 | isbn = 951-1-11475-1}}\n* {{cite book | title=El\u00e4m\u00e4, ja el\u00e4m\u00e4 | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1992 | isbn = 951-1-12178-2}}\n* {{cite book | title=Kenen kuvasta kerrot | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1996 | isbn = 951-1-14394-8}}\n* {{cite book | title=Yksityiset t\u00e4htitaivaat | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1999 | isbn = 951-1-15953-4}}\n* {{cite book | title=Yhdeks\u00e4n pyramidia  | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2000 | isbn = 951-1-16639-5}}\n* {{cite book | title=V\u00e4rj\u00e4tty\u00e4 rakkautta | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2003 | isbn = 951-1-18841-0}}\n* {{cite book | title=14 solmua Greenwichiin | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2008 | isbn = 978-951-1-23014-4}}\n* {{cite book | title=Poikakirja | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2010 | isbn = 978-951-1-24572-8}}\n* {{cite book | title=Karatolla | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2012 | isbn = 978-951-1-26469-9}}\n* {{cite book | title=Miehi\u00e4 ja ihmisi\u00e4 | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2014 | isbn = 978-951-1-28301-0}}\n* {{cite book | title=Taivaanpallo | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2018 | isbn = 978-951-1-31917-7}}\n* {{cite book | title=Merenpeitto | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=2019 | isbn = 978-951-1-34512-1}}\n\n=== Other books ===\n* {{cite book | title=Matkailijan Irlanti (Jalonen, Olli & Jalonen, Riitta) | location=Helsinki | publisher=Otava | year=1980 | isbn = 951-1-05785-5}}\n* {{cite book | title=Kansa kulttuurien virroissa.

Henry is best known for [[Wives of Henry VIII|his six marriages]], in particular his efforts to have his first marriage (to [[Catherine of Aragon]]) annulled. His disagreement with [[Pope Clement VII]] on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the [[English Reformation]], separating the [[Church of England]] from papal authority. He appointed himself the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] and [[dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved convents and monasteries]], for which he was [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church|excommunicated]]. Henry is also known as \"the father of the Royal Navy,\" as he invested heavily in the navy, increasing its size from a few to more than 50 ships, and established the [[Navy Board]].\n\nDomestically, Henry is known for his radical changes to the [[History of the Constitution of the United Kingdom|English Constitution]], ushering in the theory of the [[divine right of kings]]. He also greatly expanded royal power during his reign. He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial by means of [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]]. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Thomas More]], [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and [[Thomas Cranmer]] all figured prominently in his administration.\n\nHenry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the [[Reformation]] Parliament. He also converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, he was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance, as well as his numerous costly and largely unsuccessful wars, particularly with King [[Francis I of France]], [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], [[James V of Scotland]] and the Scottish regency under the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Earl of Arran]] and [[Mary of Guise]]. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], and he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]].\n\nHenry's contemporaries considered him an attractive, educated, and accomplished king. He has been described as \"one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne\".<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|2000|p=41}}.</ref> He was an author and composer.

The careful diplomacy of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]] had resulted in the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]] in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe in the wake of a new Ottoman threat, and it seemed that peace might be secured.<ref name=\"loades6869\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=68\u201369}}</ref> Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] near [[Calais]] for a fortnight of lavish entertainment.

The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable.<ref name=\"loades6869\" /> Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=69}}</ref> A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles [[Battle of Pavia|defeated and captured Francis at Pavia]] and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing.

These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy, which would take the intervention of the pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly, but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry's death; or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age. Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne, the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=88\u201389}}</ref> and it soon became the King's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigden|2000|p=114}}</ref> It was a decision that would lead Henry to reject papal authority and initiate the [[English Reformation]].\n\n[[File:1491 Henry VIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry, c. 1531]]\n\nHenry's precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> Henry himself, at least in the early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication ''[[Assertio Septem Sacramentorum]]'' (\"Defence of the Seven Sacraments\") earned him the title of ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith) from Pope [[Leo X]].<ref name=\"elton75\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms.<ref name=\"elton75\" /> It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to [[Leviticus]] 20:21,<ref group=\"nb\">Although Henry would have read the verse in its Latin (vulgate) form, the translation used in the 1604 King James Bible is instructive: \"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless\".</ref> an [[Affinity (canon law)|impediment]] Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=91\u201392}}</ref> Henry sent his secretary, [[William Knight (statesman)|William Knight]], to appeal directly to the [[Holy See]] by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull.

Though Clement agreed to the creation of such a court, he never had any intention of empowering his legate, [[Lorenzo Campeggio]], to decide in Henry's favour.<ref name=\"Elton109\" /> This bias was perhaps the result of pressure from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Catherine's nephew, though it is not clear how far this influenced either Campeggio or the Pope.

The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the submissive role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a [[false pregnancy]] or [[miscarriage]] in 1534, he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1971|p=138}}</ref> Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with [[Margaret and Mary Shelton|Margaret (\"Madge\") Shelton]] in 1535, although historian [[Antonia Fraser]] argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister [[Mary Shelton]].<ref name=\"Fraser1994\" />\n\nOpposition to Henry's religious policies was quickly suppressed in England.

The most prominent resisters included [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, both of whom refused to take the oath to the King.<ref name=\"elton192\" /> Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought to have the men executed; rather, they hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves. Fisher openly rejected Henry as the Supreme Head of the Church, but More was careful to avoid openly breaking the [[Treasons Act 1534|Treasons Act of 1534]], which (unlike later acts) did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason, however \u2013 More on the evidence of a single conversation with [[Richard Rich]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]].

In 1536, for example, Henry granted his assent to the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]], which legally annexed [[Wales]], uniting England and Wales into a single nation. This was followed by the [[Second Succession Act]] (the Act of Succession 1536), which declared Henry's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them from the throne.

With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|Italian War]] in favour of his new ally. An invasion of France was planned for 1543.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=75}}</ref> In preparation for it, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under the youthful [[James V of Scotland|James V]].

The Scottish Regent [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Lord Arran]] agreed to the marriage in the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] on 1 July 1543, but it was rejected by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] on 11 December. The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed \"the [[Rough Wooing]]\".

Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]]. The other, under Suffolk, [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u20131546)#First siege|laid siege to Boulogne]].

The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns (\u00a3750,000).

Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will designated 16 [[executor]]s to serve on a council of regency until Edward reached the age of 18. The executors chose [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]], Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be [[Lord Protector]] of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown was to go to Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret&nbsp;\u2013 the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 were thereby excluded from the succession.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=332\u2013333}}</ref> This final provision failed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became King of England in 1603.\n\n== Public image ==\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|left|Musical score of \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\", c. 1513, composed by Henry]]\nHenry cultivated the image of a [[Renaissance man]], and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].

Musicians included [[Benedict de Opitiis]], [[Richard Sampson]], [[Ambrose Lupo]], and Venetian organist [[Dionisio Memo]],<ref name=\"scarisbrick1516\" /> and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments.

He was also known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety.<ref name=\"Crofton2006a\" /> He was involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including [[Nonsuch Palace]], [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]], and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings which he improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], the [[Palace of Whitehall]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\nHenry was an intellectual, the first English king with a modern humanist education. He read and wrote English, French, and Latin, and owned a large library. He annotated many books and published one of his own, and he had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared to support the reformation of the church. Richard Sampson's ''Oratio'' (1534), for example, was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Chibi|1997|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref> At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices; the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Betteridge|2005|pp=91\u2013109}}</ref> Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.<ref name=\"hibbert\" />\n\nHenry was a large, well-built athlete, over {{convert|6|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} tall, strong, and broad in proportion, and he excelled at jousting and hunting. These were more than pastimes; they were political devices which served multiple goals, enhancing his athletic royal image, impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, and conveying his ability to suppress any rebellion. He arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 where he wore gilded armour and gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin, and cloth of gold with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that \"the wealth and civilisation of the world are here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hutchinson|2012|p=202}}</ref> Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started adding weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had made him so handsome, and his courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate and flatter him. His health rapidly declined near the end of his reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunn|1991|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2005|pp=41\u201359}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lipscomb|2009|p = }}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\nThe power of Tudor monarchs, including Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, [[Divine right of kings|by the grace of God]] alone.<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|1997|p=78}}</ref> The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the [[royal prerogative]].

This fortune was estimated to be \u00a31,250,000 (\u00a3375&nbsp;million by today's standards).<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=13}}</ref> By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=215\u2013216,&nbsp;355\u20136}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this wealth was spent by Henry on maintaining his court and household, including many of the building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|hung just 200]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|2005|pp=79\u201380}} citing {{harvnb|Thurley|1993|pp=222\u2013224}}</ref> Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 [[Handgun#Single-shot pistols|handguns]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2005|pp=11\u201329}}</ref> Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government out of their own income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like [[tonnage and poundage]], granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around \u00a3100,000),<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=64}}</ref> but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.\n\nWhereas Henry VII had not involved Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII had to turn to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, and as a result the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth \u00a3120,000 (\u00a336&nbsp;million) a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=393}}</ref> The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=312\u2013314}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformation ===\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\n[[File:King Henry VIII of England and Pope Clement VII.jpg|thumb|King Henry VIII sitting with his feet upon Pope Clement VI, 1641]]\n\nHenry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation \u2013 the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one \u2013 though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |accessdate=14 April 2013 |year=1997 |title=Competing Narratives: Recent Historiography of the English Reformation under Henry VIII |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615214144/http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |archivedate=15 June 2013  }}</ref> and the precise narrative not widely agreed.<ref name=\"elton103\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=103\u2013107}}</ref> Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy.<ref name=\"elton110\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=110\u2013112}}</ref> The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of [[papal supremacy]] (which he had previously defended), though as historian [[A. F. Pollard]] has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|1905|pp=230\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, between 1532 and 1537, Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent [[Church of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=missing}}</ref> These included the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] (passed 1533), which extended the charge of ''[[praemunire]]'' against all who introduced papal bulls into England, potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty.<ref name=\"bernard71\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=71}}</ref> Other acts included the [[Supplication against the Ordinaries]] and the [[Submission of the Clergy]], which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church. The [[Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534]] required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1534 declared that the King was \"the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England\" and the [[Treasons Act 1534]] made it high treason, punishable by death, to refuse the [[Oath of Supremacy]] acknowledging the King as such. Similarly, following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533, all adults in the Kingdom were required to acknowledge the Act's provisions (declaring Henry's marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate) by oath;<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=185}}</ref> those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life, and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty.<ref name=\"bernard2005\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Finally, the [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations|Peter's Pence Act]] was passed, and it reiterated that England had \"no superior under God, but only your [[His Grace|Grace]]\" and that Henry's \"imperial crown\" had been diminished by \"the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions\" of the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmberg|1970|p=missing}}</ref> The King had much support from the Church under Cranmer.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=195}}</ref>\n\nHenry, to Thomas Cromwell's annoyance, insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to the passing of the [[Act of Six Articles]], whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England.<ref name=\"elton289\" /> It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed [[liturgy]] and of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which would take until 1549 to complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=291}}</ref> The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel, however, and Cranmer remained in his position.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=297}}</ref> Overall, the rest of Henry's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy, helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome, especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new [[political theology]] of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade. It reflected [[Martin Luther]]'s new interpretation of the [[Ten commandments#Catholic and Lutheran Christianity|fourth commandment]] (\"Honour thy father and mother\"), brought to England by [[William Tyndale]]. The founding of royal authority on the [[Ten Commandments]] was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments' emphasis on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers' efforts lay behind the publication of the ''[[Great Bible]]'' in 1539 in English.<ref>{{harvnb|Rex|1996|pp=863\u2013894}}</ref> Protestant Reformers still faced persecution, particularly over objections to Henry's annulment. Many fled abroad, including the influential Tyndale,<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=3177}}</ref> who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry's behest.\n\nWhen taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the ''[[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref> In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=233}}</ref> In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=233\u2013234}}</ref> In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly to the beginning of the state-enforced [[dissolution of the monasteries]] with all religious houses worth less than \u00a3200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=234\u2013235}}</ref> After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some \u00a390,000 a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=235\u2013236}}</ref> The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=236\u2013237}}</ref> Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently.<ref>{{harvnb|St\u00f6ber|2007|p=190}}</ref> Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=238}}</ref>\n\nResponse to the reforms was mixed. The religious houses had been the only support of the impoverished,<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=254\u2013256}}</ref> and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536\u20131537, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=269\u2013272}}</ref> Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553\u20131558).\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Field Armor of King Henry VIII of England (reigned 1509\u201347) MET DT205963.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry's Italian-made suit of armour, c. 1544.

When [[Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond]] died, Henry recognised one successor for Ormond's English, Welsh and Scottish lands, whilst in Ireland another took control. Kildare's successor, the 9th Earl, was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] in 1520.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=183\u2013184}}</ref> Surrey's ambitious aims were costly, but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy, as favoured by Henry and Wolsey, and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Surrey was recalled in 1521, with [[Piers Butler]] \u2013 one of claimants to the Earldom of Ormond \u2013 appointed in his place. Butler proved unable to control opposition, including that of Kildare. Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524, resuming his dispute with Butler, which had before been in a lull. Meanwhile, the [[James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond|Earl of Desmond]], an Anglo-Irish peer, had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him, Kildare was once again removed from his post.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=185\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529, which was followed by a period of uncertainty. This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and the king's son, as lord lieutenant. Richmond had never before visited Ireland, his appointment a break with past policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes, but the effect was limited and the Irish parliament soon rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"loades187\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=187}}</ref> Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell, who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted. Kildare, on the other hand, was summoned to London; after some hesitation, he departed for London in 1534, where he would face charges of treason.<ref name=\"loades187\" /> His son, [[Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare|Thomas, Lord Offaly]] was more forthright, denouncing the king and leading a \"Catholic crusade\" against the king, who was by this time mired in marital problems. Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered, and besieged Dublin. Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes, although he failed to secure the support of [[Lord Darcy]], a sympathiser, or Charles V. What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2,000 English troops \u2013 a large army by Irish standards \u2013 and the execution of Offaly (his father was already dead) and his uncles.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=187\u2013189}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Offaly revolt was followed by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir [[Anthony St Leger (Lord Deputy of Ireland)|Antony St Leger]], as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], who would remain into the post past Henry's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=191}}</ref> Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere [[fiefdom]] to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] free from the Papal [[Lord|overlordship]]. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=191\u2013192}}</ref> The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe complexities and sheer scale of Henry's legacy ensured that, in the words of Betteridge and Freeman, \"throughout the centuries, Henry has been praised and reviled, but he has never been ignored\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" />  Historian J.D. Mackie sums up Henry's personality and its impact on his achievements and popularity:\n\n{{quote|The respect, nay even the popularity, which he had from his people was not unmerited....He kept the development of England in line with some of the most vigorous, though not the noblest forces of the day.  His high courage \u2013 highest when things went ill \u2013 his commanding intellect, his appreciation of fact, and his instinct for rule carried his country through a perilous time of change, and his very arrogance saved his people from the wars which afflicted other lands. Dimly remembering the wars of the Roses, vaguely informed as to the slaughters and sufferings in Europe, the people of England knew that in Henry they had a great king.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.D.

Pollard]], who in 1902 presented his own, largely positive, view of the king,  lauding him, \"as the king and statesman who, whatever his personal failings, led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Pollard's interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henry's life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953.\n\nElton's book on ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'', maintained Pollard's positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole, but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader. For Elton, it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government \u2013 Henry was shrewd, but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Henry was little more, in other words, than an \"ego-centric monstrosity\" whose reign \"owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from [the king]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=23,332}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the central tenets of Elton's thesis have since been questioned, it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work, including that of [[Jack Scarisbrick|J. J. Scarisbrick]], his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities, but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who \"wore regality with a splendid conviction\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1968|p=17}}</ref> The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Even among more recent biographers, including [[David Loades]], [[David Starkey]] and [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]], there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the correct assessment of those he did bring about.<ref name=\"bandf1\" />\n\nThis lack of clarity about Henry's control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> One traditional approach, favoured by Starkey and others, is to divide Henry's reign into two halves, the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities (politically inclusive, pious, athletic but also intellectual) who presided over a period of stability and calm, and the latter a \"hulking tyrant\" who presided over a period of dramatic, sometimes whimsical, change.<ref name=\"morris19\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> Other writers have tried to merge Henry's disparate personality into a single whole; [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]], for example, considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions, with a mechanical and conventional, but deeply held piety, and having at best a mediocre intellect.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1971|p=passim}}</ref>\n\n== Style and arms ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Coat of Arms of Henry VIII of England (1509-1547).svg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Coat of Arms of England (1509-1554).svg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Henry's armorial during his early reign (left) and later reign (right)\n}}\nMany changes were made to the royal style during his reign. Henry originally used the style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, [[List of monarchs of England|King of England]], [[English Kings of France|France]] and [[Lord of Ireland]]\". In 1521, pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his ''Defence of the Seven Sacraments'', the royal style became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and Lord of Ireland\". Following Henry's excommunication, [[Pope Paul III]] rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but an [[Act of Parliament]] ([[35 Hen 8]] c 3) declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day. Henry's motto was \"Coeur Loyal\" (\"true heart\"), and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word \"loyal\". His emblem was the [[Tudor rose]] and the [[Beaufort portcullis]]. As king, Henry's [[heraldry|arms]] were the same as those used by his predecessors since [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: ''Quarterly, Azure three [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lys]] Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England)''.\n\nIn 1535, Henry added the \"supremacy phrase\" to the royal style, which became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith, Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in Earth Supreme Head\". In 1536, the phrase \"of the Church of England\" changed to \"of the Church of England and also of [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]]\". In 1541, Henry had the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] change the title \"Lord of Ireland\" to \"King of Ireland\" with the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], after being advised that many Irish people regarded the Pope as the true head of their country, with the Lord acting as a mere representative. The reason the Irish regarded the Pope as their overlord was that Ireland had originally been given to King [[Henry II of England]] by [[Pope Adrian IV]] in the 12th century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship. The meeting of Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII as King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocrats. The style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head\" remained in use until the end of Henry's reign.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| ref=<ref>{{cite book |last=Weir |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Weir |title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy |publisher=Vintage Books |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-09-953973-5 |chapter=The Tudors}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| 1 = 1.

Henry is best known for [[Wives of Henry VIII|his six marriages]], in particular his efforts to have his first marriage (to [[Catherine of Aragon]]) annulled. His disagreement with [[Pope Clement VII]] on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the [[English Reformation]], separating the [[Church of England]] from papal authority. He appointed himself the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] and [[dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved convents and monasteries]], for which he was [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church|excommunicated]]. Henry is also known as \"the father of the Royal Navy,\" as he invested heavily in the navy, increasing its size from a few to more than 50 ships, and established the [[Navy Board]].\n\nDomestically, Henry is known for his radical changes to the [[History of the Constitution of the United Kingdom|English Constitution]], ushering in the theory of the [[divine right of kings]]. He also greatly expanded royal power during his reign. He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial by means of [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]]. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Thomas More]], [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and [[Thomas Cranmer]] all figured prominently in his administration.\n\nHenry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the [[Reformation]] Parliament. He also converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, he was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance, as well as his numerous costly and largely unsuccessful wars, particularly with King [[Francis I of France]], [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], [[James V of Scotland]] and the Scottish regency under the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Earl of Arran]] and [[Mary of Guise]]. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], and he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]].\n\nHenry's contemporaries considered him an attractive, educated, and accomplished king. He has been described as \"one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne\".<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|2000|p=41}}.</ref> He was an author and composer. As he aged, however, he became severely obese and his health suffered, contributing to his death in 1547. He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful, egotistical, harsh, and insecure king.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2006|pp=28\u201336}}</ref> He was succeeded by his son [[Edward VI]].\n\n== Early years ==\n[[File:Vaux Passional (f.9).

He was subsequently appointed [[Earl Marshal]] of England and [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] at age three, and was made a [[Knight of the Bath]] soon after. The day after the ceremony he was created [[Duke of York]] and a month or so later made [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the Scottish Marches]]. In May 1495, he was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]]. The reason for all the appointments to a small child was so his father could keep personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families.<ref name=\"scarisbrick3\" /> Henry was given a first-rate education from leading tutors, becoming fluent in Latin and French, and learning at least some Italian.<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1966|p=24}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> Not much is known about his early life \u2013 save for his appointments \u2013 because he was not expected to become king.<ref name=\"scarisbrick3\" /> In November 1501, Henry also played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], the youngest surviving child of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=4}}</ref> As Duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a ''label of three points ermine''. He was further honoured, on 9 February 1506, by [[Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]] who made him a [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Knight of the Golden Fleece]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume III|year=1912|editor-last=Gibbs|editor-first=Vicary|page=443|publisher=St Catherine's Press}}Under Duke of Cornwall, which was his title when he succeeded his brother as Prince of Wales.</ref>\n\nIn 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of [[sweating sickness]],<ref>{{harvnb|Maloney|2015|page=96}}</ref> just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine.<ref name=\"crofton126\">{{harvnb|Crofton|2006|p=126}}</ref> Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother, the 10-year-old Henry. After a little debate, Henry became the new [[Duke of Cornwall]] in October 1502, and the new [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] in February 1503.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Henry VII gave the boy few tasks. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne \"untrained in the exacting art of kingship\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=6}}</ref>\n\nHenry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his second son in marriage to Arthur's widow Catherine.<ref name=\"crofton126\" /> Both Isabella and Henry VII were keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death.<ref name=\"loades22\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=22}}</ref> On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later.<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=8}}</ref> A [[papal dispensation]] was only needed for the \"impediment of public honesty\" if the marriage had not been [[consummated]] as Catherine and her [[duenna]] claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for \"affinity\", which took account of the possibility of consummation.<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\" /> Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young.<ref name=\"loades22\" /> Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], complicated matters. Her father preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=22\u201323}}.</ref> Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. Ferdinand's solution was to make his daughter ambassador, allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout, she began to believe that it was God's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition.<ref name=\"Loades2009\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=23}}</ref>\n\n== Early reign ==\n[[File:HenryVIII 1509.jpg|thumb|upright|Eighteen-year-old Henry VIII after his [[coronation]] in 1509]]\nHenry VII died on 21 April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king. Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the [[dowry|marriage portion]].<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\" /><ref name=\"loades24\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=24}}</ref> The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine.<ref name=\"Loades2009\" /> Whether or not this was true, it was certainly convenient. [[Emperor Maximilian I]] had been attempting to marry his granddaughter (and Catherine's niece) [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to Henry; she had now been jilted.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=12}}</ref> Henry's wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friar's church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509.<ref name=\"loades24\" /> On 23 June 1509, Henry led the now 23-year-old Catherine from the [[Tower of London]] to [[Westminster Abbey]] for their coronation, which took place the following day.<ref name=\"scarisbrick1819\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> It was a grand affair: the king's passage was lined with tapestries and laid with fine cloth.<ref name=\"scarisbrick1819\" /> Following the ceremony, there was a grand banquet in [[Westminster Hall]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=19}}</ref> As Catherine wrote to her father, \"our time is spent in continuous festival\".<ref name=\"loades24\" />\n\nTwo days after his coronation, Henry arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir [[Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley]]. They were charged with [[treason|high treason]] and were executed in 1510. Politically-motivated executions would remain one of Henry's primary tactics for dealing with those who stood in his way.<ref name=\"Crofton2006\" /> Henry also returned to the public some of the money supposedly extorted by the two ministers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1904|p=17}}</ref> By contrast, Henry's view of the [[House of York]] \u2013 potential rival claimants for the throne \u2013 was more moderate than his father's had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father, including the [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset|Marquess of Dorset]], were pardoned.<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=304&nbdash;306}}</ref> Others (most notably [[Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk|Edmund de la Pole]]) went unreconciled; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513, an execution prompted by his brother [[Richard de la Pole|Richard]] siding against the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was [[stillbirth|stillborn]] on 31 January 1510. About four months later, Catherine again became pregnant.<ref name=\"loades26\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=26}}</ref> On New Year's Day 1511, the child \u2013 [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall|Henry]] \u2013 was born. After the grief of losing their first child, the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held,<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=18}}</ref> including a two-day [[jousting|joust]] known as the [[The 1511 Westminster Tournament Roll|Westminster Tournament]]. However, the child died seven weeks later.<ref name=\"loades26\" /> Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1513 and 1515, but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.<ref name=\"loades4849\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=48\u201349}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Henry's marriage to Catherine has since been described as \"unusually good\",<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=103}}</ref> it is known that Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], either Elizabeth or [[Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2009|p=27}}</ref> The most significant mistress for about three years, starting in 1516, was [[Elizabeth Blount]].<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, considered by some to be few for a virile young king.<ref name=\"Fraser1994\">{{harvnb|Fraser|1994|p=220}}</ref><ref name=\"loades4748\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=47\u201348}}</ref> Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: [[David Loades]] believes Henry had mistresses \"only to a very limited extent\",<ref name=\"loades4748\" /> whilst [[Alison Weir]] believes there were numerous other affairs.<ref name=\"Weir\">{{harvnb|Weir|1991|pp=122\u20133}}</ref> There is no evidence that Catherine protested, and in 1518 she fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn.<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry's illegitimate son, [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|Henry FitzRoy]].<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=98,&nbsp;104}}</ref> In 1533, FitzRoy married [[Mary FitzRoy, Duchess of Richmond and Somerset|Mary Howard]], but died childless three years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=255}}</ref> At the time of Richmond's death in June 1536, Parliament was enacting the [[Second Succession Act]], which could have allowed him to become king.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=255,&nbsp;271}}</ref>\n\n== France and the Habsburgs ==\n[[File:British - Field of the Cloth of Gold - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The meeting of Francis I and Henry VIII at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520]]\n\nIn 1510, [[Kingdom of France|France]], with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the [[League of Cambrai]], was winning a war against Venice. Henry renewed his father's friendship with [[Louis XII of France]], an issue that divided his council. Certainly war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult.<ref name=\"Loades27\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=27}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, however, Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand. After [[Pope Julius II]] created the anti-French [[League of Cambrai#Holy League|Holy League]] in October 1511,<ref name=\"Loades27\" /> Henry followed Ferdinand's lead and brought England into the new League.

Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles.

These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy, which would take the intervention of the pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly, but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry's death; or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age. Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne, the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=88\u201389}}</ref> and it soon became the King's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigden|2000|p=114}}</ref> It was a decision that would lead Henry to reject papal authority and initiate the [[English Reformation]].\n\n[[File:1491 Henry VIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry, c. 1531]]\n\nHenry's precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> Henry himself, at least in the early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication ''[[Assertio Septem Sacramentorum]]'' (\"Defence of the Seven Sacraments\") earned him the title of ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith) from Pope [[Leo X]].<ref name=\"elton75\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms.<ref name=\"elton75\" /> It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to [[Leviticus]] 20:21,<ref group=\"nb\">Although Henry would have read the verse in its Latin (vulgate) form, the translation used in the 1604 King James Bible is instructive: \"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless\".</ref> an [[Affinity (canon law)|impediment]] Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=91\u201392}}</ref> Henry sent his secretary, [[William Knight (statesman)|William Knight]], to appeal directly to the [[Holy See]] by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull.

He had such a reputation for integrity that his endorsement would have engendered huge support for the annulment among Parliament and the people, who loved Catherine. More's silence so angered Henry that he tried to force his hand by having him imprisoned and tried. The perfidy of the king's secretary, Thomas Cromwell, however, and the perjury of a petty bureaucrat, Richard Rich, brought about More's conviction and execution for treason in 1535.

The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the submissive role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a [[false pregnancy]] or [[miscarriage]] in 1534, he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal.

This was followed by the [[Second Succession Act]] (the Act of Succession 1536), which declared Henry's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them from the throne. The king was also granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will, should he have no further issue.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=350\u2013351}}</ref> However, when Charles and Francis made peace in January 1539, Henry became increasingly paranoid, perhaps as a result of receiving a constant list of threats to the kingdom (real or imaginary, minor or serious) supplied by Cromwell in his role as spymaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Enriched by the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry used some of his financial reserves to build a series of coastal defences and set some aside for use in the event of a Franco-German invasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=74\u201375}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage to Anne of Cleves ==\n[[File:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Anne of Cleves]]'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1539]]\nHaving considered the matter, Cromwell, now Earl of Essex, suggested [[Anne of Cleves|Anne]], the 25-year-old sister of the [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of Cleves]], who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England, for the duke fell between [[Lutheranism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=368\u2013369}}</ref> [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=369\u2013370}}</ref> Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light, it is more likely that the portrait was accurate; Holbein remained in favour at court.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=373\u2013374}}</ref> After seeing Holbein's portrait, and urged on by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers, the 49-year-old king agreed to wed Anne.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=373\u2013375}}</ref> However, it was not long before Henry wished to annul the marriage so he could marry another.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=370}}</ref><ref name=\"elton289\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=289}}</ref> Anne did not argue, and confirmed that the marriage had never been consummated.<ref name=\"scarisbrick373\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=373}}</ref> Anne's previous betrothal to the [[Duke of Lorraine]]'s son [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]] provided further grounds for the annulment.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=372\u20133}}</ref> The marriage was subsequently dissolved, and Anne received the title of \"The King's Sister\", two houses and a generous allowance.<ref name=\"scarisbrick373\" /> It was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17-year-old [[Catherine Howard]], the Duke of Norfolk's niece, the politics of which worried Cromwell, for Norfolk was a political opponent.<ref name=\"elton289291\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=289\u2013291}}</ref>\n\nShortly after, the religious reformers (and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Cromwell) [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]], [[William Jerome (martyr)|William Jerome]] and [[Thomas Garret]] were burned as heretics.<ref name=\"scarisbrick373\" /> Cromwell, meanwhile, fell out of favour although it is unclear exactly why, for there is little evidence of differences of domestic or foreign policy.

As a consequence, the king was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year.<ref name=\"Scarisbrick361\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=361}}</ref> In 1540, Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints. In 1542, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown.

Consequently, the [[Lords Spiritual]]\u2014as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known\u2014were for the first time outnumbered by the [[Lords Temporal]].\n\n== Second invasion of France and the \"Rough Wooing\" of Scotland ==\n{{Main|Rough Wooing}}\n[[File:Enrique VIII de Inglaterra, por Hans Holbein el Joven.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry in 1540, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured, eventually degenerating into renewed war. With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|Italian War]] in favour of his new ally. An invasion of France was planned for 1543.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=75}}</ref> In preparation for it, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under the youthful [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. The Scots were defeated at [[Battle of Solway Moss]] on 24 November 1542,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> and James died on 15 December. Henry now hoped to unite the crowns of England and Scotland by marrying his son Edward to James' successor, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]]. The Scottish Regent [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Lord Arran]] agreed to the marriage in the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] on 1 July 1543, but it was rejected by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] on 11 December. The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed \"the [[Rough Wooing]]\".

Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]]. The other, under Suffolk, [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u20131546)#First siege|laid siege to Boulogne]].

Francis attempted to invade England in the summer of 1545, but reached only the Isle of Wight before being repulsed in the [[Battle of the Solent]]. Out of money, France and England signed the [[Treaty of Ardres|Treaty of Camp]] on 7 June 1546. Henry secured Boulogne for eight years. The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns (\u00a3750,000). Henry needed the money; the 1544 campaign had cost \u00a3650,000, and England was once again bankrupt.<ref name=\"Loades79\" />\n\n== Marriage to Catherine Parr ==\nHenry married his last wife, the wealthy widow [[Catherine Parr]], in July 1543.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=456}}</ref> A reformer at heart, she argued with Henry over religion.

He was covered with painful, [[pus]]-filled [[boils]] and possibly suffered from [[gout]]. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced to the jousting accident in 1536 in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The [[chronic wound]] festered for the remainder of his life and became [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's [[mood swing]]s, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-jousting-accident-that-turned-henry-viii-into-a-tyrant-1670421.html |title=The jousting accident that turned Henry VIII into a tyrant |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"discovery\">{{cite news | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/henry-viii-blood-disorder-110311.html | title = King Henry VIII's Madness Explained | last = Sohn | first = Emily |date = 11 March 2011 | publisher=discovery.com | accessdate =25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe theory that Henry suffered from [[syphilis]] has been dismissed by most historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Hays|2010|p=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Gareth|title=Young and Damned and Fair|year=2016}} p. 130</ref> Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to [[scurvy]], which is caused by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-30/news/mn-1456_1_henry-viii |title=Names in the News: Henry VIII Termed Victim of Scurvy |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=30 August 1989}}</ref> Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been [[Kell antigen system|Kell positive]] and suffered from [[McLeod syndrome]].<ref name=\"discovery\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Whitley|Kramer|2010|p=passim}}</ref> According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result of [[traumatic brain injury]] after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a [[Neuroendocrine System|neuroendocrine]] cause of his obesity.

Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will designated 16 [[executor]]s to serve on a council of regency until Edward reached the age of 18. The executors chose [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]], Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be [[Lord Protector]] of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown was to go to Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret&nbsp;\u2013 the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 were thereby excluded from the succession.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=332\u2013333}}</ref> This final provision failed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became King of England in 1603.\n\n== Public image ==\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|left|Musical score of \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\", c. 1513, composed by Henry]]\nHenry cultivated the image of a [[Renaissance man]], and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]. He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included [[Benedict de Opitiis]], [[Richard Sampson]], [[Ambrose Lupo]], and Venetian organist [[Dionisio Memo]],<ref name=\"scarisbrick1516\" /> and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments.

He was also known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety.<ref name=\"Crofton2006a\" /> He was involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including [[Nonsuch Palace]], [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]], and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings which he improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], the [[Palace of Whitehall]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\nHenry was an intellectual, the first English king with a modern humanist education. He read and wrote English, French, and Latin, and owned a large library. He annotated many books and published one of his own, and he had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared to support the reformation of the church. Richard Sampson's ''Oratio'' (1534), for example, was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Chibi|1997|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref> At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices; the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Betteridge|2005|pp=91\u2013109}}</ref> Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.<ref name=\"hibbert\" />\n\nHenry was a large, well-built athlete, over {{convert|6|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} tall, strong, and broad in proportion, and he excelled at jousting and hunting. These were more than pastimes; they were political devices which served multiple goals, enhancing his athletic royal image, impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, and conveying his ability to suppress any rebellion. He arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 where he wore gilded armour and gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin, and cloth of gold with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that \"the wealth and civilisation of the world are here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hutchinson|2012|p=202}}</ref> Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started adding weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had made him so handsome, and his courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate and flatter him.

The reverse depicts the quartered arms of England and France.]]\n\nHenry inherited a vast fortune and a prosperous economy from his father Henry VII, who had been frugal and careful with money. This fortune was estimated to be \u00a31,250,000 (\u00a3375&nbsp;million by today's standards).<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=13}}</ref> By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=215\u2013216,&nbsp;355\u20136}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this wealth was spent by Henry on maintaining his court and household, including many of the building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|hung just 200]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|2005|pp=79\u201380}} citing {{harvnb|Thurley|1993|pp=222\u2013224}}</ref> Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 [[Handgun#Single-shot pistols|handguns]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2005|pp=11\u201329}}</ref> Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government out of their own income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like [[tonnage and poundage]], granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around \u00a3100,000),<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=64}}</ref> but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.\n\nWhereas Henry VII had not involved Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII had to turn to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, and as a result the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth \u00a3120,000 (\u00a336&nbsp;million) a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=393}}</ref> The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=312\u2013314}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformation ===\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\n[[File:King Henry VIII of England and Pope Clement VII.jpg|thumb|King Henry VIII sitting with his feet upon Pope Clement VI, 1641]]\n\nHenry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation \u2013 the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one \u2013 though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |accessdate=14 April 2013 |year=1997 |title=Competing Narratives: Recent Historiography of the English Reformation under Henry VIII |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615214144/http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |archivedate=15 June 2013  }}</ref> and the precise narrative not widely agreed.<ref name=\"elton103\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=103\u2013107}}</ref> Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy.<ref name=\"elton110\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=110\u2013112}}</ref> The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of [[papal supremacy]] (which he had previously defended), though as historian [[A. F. Pollard]] has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|1905|pp=230\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, between 1532 and 1537, Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent [[Church of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=missing}}</ref> These included the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] (passed 1533), which extended the charge of ''[[praemunire]]'' against all who introduced papal bulls into England, potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty.<ref name=\"bernard71\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=71}}</ref> Other acts included the [[Supplication against the Ordinaries]] and the [[Submission of the Clergy]], which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church. The [[Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534]] required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1534 declared that the King was \"the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England\" and the [[Treasons Act 1534]] made it high treason, punishable by death, to refuse the [[Oath of Supremacy]] acknowledging the King as such. Similarly, following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533, all adults in the Kingdom were required to acknowledge the Act's provisions (declaring Henry's marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate) by oath;<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=185}}</ref> those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life, and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty.<ref name=\"bernard2005\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Finally, the [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations|Peter's Pence Act]] was passed, and it reiterated that England had \"no superior under God, but only your [[His Grace|Grace]]\" and that Henry's \"imperial crown\" had been diminished by \"the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions\" of the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmberg|1970|p=missing}}</ref> The King had much support from the Church under Cranmer.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=195}}</ref>\n\nHenry, to Thomas Cromwell's annoyance, insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to the passing of the [[Act of Six Articles]], whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England.<ref name=\"elton289\" /> It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed [[liturgy]] and of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which would take until 1549 to complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=291}}</ref> The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel, however, and Cranmer remained in his position.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=297}}</ref> Overall, the rest of Henry's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy, helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome, especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new [[political theology]] of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade. It reflected [[Martin Luther]]'s new interpretation of the [[Ten commandments#Catholic and Lutheran Christianity|fourth commandment]] (\"Honour thy father and mother\"), brought to England by [[William Tyndale]]. The founding of royal authority on the [[Ten Commandments]] was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments' emphasis on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers' efforts lay behind the publication of the ''[[Great Bible]]'' in 1539 in English.<ref>{{harvnb|Rex|1996|pp=863\u2013894}}</ref> Protestant Reformers still faced persecution, particularly over objections to Henry's annulment. Many fled abroad, including the influential Tyndale,<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=3177}}</ref> who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry's behest.\n\nWhen taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the ''[[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref> In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=233}}</ref> In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=233\u2013234}}</ref> In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly to the beginning of the state-enforced [[dissolution of the monasteries]] with all religious houses worth less than \u00a3200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=234\u2013235}}</ref> After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some \u00a390,000 a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=235\u2013236}}</ref> The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=236\u2013237}}</ref> Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently.<ref>{{harvnb|St\u00f6ber|2007|p=190}}</ref> Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=238}}</ref>\n\nResponse to the reforms was mixed. The religious houses had been the only support of the impoverished,<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=254\u2013256}}</ref> and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536\u20131537, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=269\u2013272}}</ref> Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553\u20131558).\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Field Armor of King Henry VIII of England (reigned 1509\u201347) MET DT205963.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry's Italian-made suit of armour, c. 1544.

They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the [[war wagon]],<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|2001|p=82}}</ref> relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the case of the latter produced disastrous results at Montreuil.<ref name=\"Elton1977b\" />\n\nHenry's break with Rome incurred the threat of a large-scale French or Spanish invasion.<ref name=\"elton282\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=282}}</ref> To guard against this, in 1538, he began to build a chain of expensive, state-of-the-art defences, along Britain's southern and eastern coasts from [[Kent]] to [[Cornwall]], largely built of material gained from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|demolition of the monasteries]].<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pages=183, 281\u2013283}}</ref> These were known as Henry VIII's [[Device Forts]].

When [[Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond]] died, Henry recognised one successor for Ormond's English, Welsh and Scottish lands, whilst in Ireland another took control. Kildare's successor, the 9th Earl, was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] in 1520.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=183\u2013184}}</ref> Surrey's ambitious aims were costly, but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy, as favoured by Henry and Wolsey, and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Surrey was recalled in 1521, with [[Piers Butler]] \u2013 one of claimants to the Earldom of Ormond \u2013 appointed in his place. Butler proved unable to control opposition, including that of Kildare. Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524, resuming his dispute with Butler, which had before been in a lull. Meanwhile, the [[James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond|Earl of Desmond]], an Anglo-Irish peer, had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him, Kildare was once again removed from his post.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=185\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529, which was followed by a period of uncertainty. This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and the king's son, as lord lieutenant. Richmond had never before visited Ireland, his appointment a break with past policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes, but the effect was limited and the Irish parliament soon rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"loades187\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=187}}</ref> Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell, who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted. Kildare, on the other hand, was summoned to London; after some hesitation, he departed for London in 1534, where he would face charges of treason.<ref name=\"loades187\" /> His son, [[Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare|Thomas, Lord Offaly]] was more forthright, denouncing the king and leading a \"Catholic crusade\" against the king, who was by this time mired in marital problems. Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered, and besieged Dublin. Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes, although he failed to secure the support of [[Lord Darcy]], a sympathiser, or Charles V. What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2,000 English troops \u2013 a large army by Irish standards \u2013 and the execution of Offaly (his father was already dead) and his uncles.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=187\u2013189}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Offaly revolt was followed by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir [[Anthony St Leger (Lord Deputy of Ireland)|Antony St Leger]], as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], who would remain into the post past Henry's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=191}}</ref> Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere [[fiefdom]] to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] free from the Papal [[Lord|overlordship]]. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=191\u2013192}}</ref> The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe complexities and sheer scale of Henry's legacy ensured that, in the words of Betteridge and Freeman, \"throughout the centuries, Henry has been praised and reviled, but he has never been ignored\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" />  Historian J.D.

Pollard]], who in 1902 presented his own, largely positive, view of the king,  lauding him, \"as the king and statesman who, whatever his personal failings, led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Pollard's interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henry's life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953.\n\nElton's book on ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'', maintained Pollard's positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole, but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader. For Elton, it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government \u2013 Henry was shrewd, but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Henry was little more, in other words, than an \"ego-centric monstrosity\" whose reign \"owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from [the king]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=23,332}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the central tenets of Elton's thesis have since been questioned, it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work, including that of [[Jack Scarisbrick|J. J. Scarisbrick]], his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities, but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who \"wore regality with a splendid conviction\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1968|p=17}}</ref> The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Even among more recent biographers, including [[David Loades]], [[David Starkey]] and [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]], there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the correct assessment of those he did bring about.<ref name=\"bandf1\" />\n\nThis lack of clarity about Henry's control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> One traditional approach, favoured by Starkey and others, is to divide Henry's reign into two halves, the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities (politically inclusive, pious, athletic but also intellectual) who presided over a period of stability and calm, and the latter a \"hulking tyrant\" who presided over a period of dramatic, sometimes whimsical, change.<ref name=\"morris19\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> Other writers have tried to merge Henry's disparate personality into a single whole; [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]], for example, considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions, with a mechanical and conventional, but deeply held piety, and having at best a mediocre intellect.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1971|p=passim}}</ref>\n\n== Style and arms ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Coat of Arms of Henry VIII of England (1509-1547).svg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Coat of Arms of England (1509-1554).svg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Henry's armorial during his early reign (left) and later reign (right)\n}}\nMany changes were made to the royal style during his reign. Henry originally used the style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, [[List of monarchs of England|King of England]], [[English Kings of France|France]] and [[Lord of Ireland]]\". In 1521, pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his ''Defence of the Seven Sacraments'', the royal style became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and Lord of Ireland\". Following Henry's excommunication, [[Pope Paul III]] rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but an [[Act of Parliament]] ([[35 Hen 8]] c 3) declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day. Henry's motto was \"Coeur Loyal\" (\"true heart\"), and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word \"loyal\". His emblem was the [[Tudor rose]] and the [[Beaufort portcullis]]. As king, Henry's [[heraldry|arms]] were the same as those used by his predecessors since [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: ''Quarterly, Azure three [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lys]] Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England)''.\n\nIn 1535, Henry added the \"supremacy phrase\" to the royal style, which became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith, Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in Earth Supreme Head\". In 1536, the phrase \"of the Church of England\" changed to \"of the Church of England and also of [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]]\". In 1541, Henry had the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] change the title \"Lord of Ireland\" to \"King of Ireland\" with the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], after being advised that many Irish people regarded the Pope as the true head of their country, with the Lord acting as a mere representative. The reason the Irish regarded the Pope as their overlord was that Ireland had originally been given to King [[Henry II of England]] by [[Pope Adrian IV]] in the 12th century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship. The meeting of Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII as King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocrats. The style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head\" remained in use until the end of Henry's reign.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| ref=<ref>{{cite book |last=Weir |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Weir |title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy |publisher=Vintage Books |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-09-953973-5 |chapter=The Tudors}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| 1 = 1.

A letter from George Taylor to Lady Lisle dated the 27th April 1534 says that \u201cThe Queen hath a goodly belly, praying our Lord to send us a prince\u201d. In July, Anne\u2019s brother, Lord Rochford, was sent on a diplomatic mission to France to ask for the postponement of a meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I because of Anne\u2019s condition: \u201cbeing so far gone with child she could not cross the sea with the King\u201d. Chapuys backs this up in a letter dated the 27th July, where he refers to Anne\u2019s pregnancy. We do not know what happened with this pregnancy as there is no evidence of the outcome. Dewhurst writes of how the pregnancy could have resulted in a miscarriage or stillbirth, but there is no evidence to support this, he therefore wonders if it was a case of pseudocyesis, a false pregnancy, caused by the stress that Anne was under \u2013 the pressure to provide a son. Chapuys wrote on the 27th September 1534 \u201cSince the King began to doubt whether his lady was enceinte or not, he has renewed and increased the love he formerly had for a beautiful damsel of the court\u201d.

However, Dewhurst thinks that there is an error in the dating of this letter as the editor of the Lisle Letters states that this letter is actually from 1533 or 1534 because it also refers to Sir Christopher Garneys, a man who died in October 1534.</ref>\n|-\n|Unnamed son||colspan=2 style=\"text-align: center;\" |29 January 1536||miscarriage of a child, believed male, in the fourth month of pregnancy<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2003|p=553}}</ref><ref>Chapuys reported to Charles V on the 10th February 1536 that Anne Boleyn had miscarried on the day of Catherine of Aragon\u2019s funeral: \u201cOn the day of the interment [of Catherine of Aragon] the concubine [Anne] had an abortion which seemed to be a male child which she had not borne 3 1/2 months\u201d.</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|'''''By [[Jane Seymour]]''''' (married [[Palace of Whitehall]] 30 May 1536) died 24 October 1537\n|-\n|[[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]]||12 October 1537||6 July 1553|| unmarried; no issue\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |'''''By [[Anne of Cleves]]'''''  (married [[Palace of Placentia]] 6 January 1540; annulled 9 July 1540)\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |no issue\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|'''''By [[Catherine Howard]]''''' (married [[Oatlands Palace]] 28 July 1540; annulled 23 November 1541) beheaded on 13 February 1542\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |no issue\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|'''''By [[Catherine Parr]]''''' (married [[Hampton Court Palace]] 12 July 1543; Henry VIII died 28 January 1547)\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |no issue\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biography|Monarchy|England|Christianity}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Grene growith the holy.ogg|title=''Grene growith the holy'' (0:31)|description=A [[Christmas carol]] attributed to Henry VIII}}\n* [[Cestui que]]\n* [[Cultural depictions of Henry VIII of England]]\n* [[Family tree of English monarchs]]\n* [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom#Tudor foreign policy|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England]]\n* [[List of English monarchs]]\n* [[Tudor period]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Thomas |year= 2001 |title=The Renaissance at War |publisher=Cassell & Co. |location= London |isbn= 0-304-35270-5 |url= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Ashley |first=Mike |year=2002 |title=British Kings & Queens |publisher=Running Press |location= |isbn=0-7867-1104-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofbr0000ashl_f1a2 |ref=harv |url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Ashrafian |first=Hutan |title=Henry VIII's Obesity Following Traumatic Brain Injury |journal=Endocrine |volume=42 |year=2011 |pages=218\u20139 |doi=10.1007/s12020-011-9581-z |url=http://www.bioportfolio.com/resources/pmarticle/267683/Henry-Viii-s-Obesity-Following-Traumatic-Brain-Injury.html |ref=harv |pmid=22169966 |issue=1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120102054402/http://www.bioportfolio.com/resources/pmarticle/267683/Henry-Viii-s-Obesity-Following-Traumatic-Brain-Injury.html |archivedate=2 January 2012  }}\n* {{cite book |last=Bernard |first=G.

However Mavericks, inspired by [[Louisa Brownfield]] and [[Karen Atkinson (netball)|Karen Atkinson]], subsequently began to create more shooting opportunities.
