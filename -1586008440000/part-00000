Much of the border follows the [[Southern Railway (Turkey)|Southern Turkish]] stretch of the [[Baghdad Railway]], roughly along the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]] between the 37th and 42nd eastern meridians. In the west, it almost surrounds the Turkish [[Hatay Province]], partly following the course of the [[Orontes River]] and reaching the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coast at the foot of [[Jebel Aqra]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mount Dyunag and Karadouran beach, Kessab, Syria.jpg|thumb|Karadouran/al-Samara beach near [[Kessab]], Syria, along the Syrian-Turkish borderline, where Mount Dyunag touches the [[Mediterranean Sea]]]]\nDue to Turkey's annexation of Hatay Province, the post-1939 Syrian\u2013Turkish border touches the [[Mediterranean]] coast at [[Ras al-Bassit]], south of [[Mount Aqra]] ({{coord|35.9288|N|35.9178|E|}}). The Hatay province borders the Syrian [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] and [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] governorates. The westernmost (and southernmost) border crossing is at {{coord|35.905|N|36.010|E|}}, some 3&nbsp;km west of [[Yaylada\u011f\u0131]]. The border reaches its [[Extreme points of Turkey|southernmost point]] at {{coord|35.808|N|36.152|E|}}, 2&nbsp;km west of [[Bidama]], to include the now-abandoned village of Topraktutan (Beysun)  in Hatay.<ref>\nThe village's population was 583 in 1980 ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=LjtpAAAAMAAJ&q=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&dq=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbucql_63JAhUG_w4KHWWGBPkQ6AEINjAD T\u00fcrk D\u00fcnyas\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Vakf\u0131], 1986, p. 142); it was later evacuated due to landslides. There is now a police station and a monument marking the southernmost point of Turkey. Topraktutan forms a small salient into Syrian territory. It corresponds to the Turkish airspace claimed to have been violated prior to the [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown]].</ref>\n\nThe border now runs north and east, following the [[Orontes River]] for a part of its course, where in 2011 construction of a [[Syria\u2013Turkey Friendship Dam]] began (but has since been delayed due to the Syrian Civil War),<ref>{{cite news|title=Construction interrupted for friendship dam along Turkey-Syria border|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=248885|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=29 June 2011}}</ref> and east to the [[Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing]] on the [[\u0130skenderun]]\u2013[[Aleppo]] road, then further north to the border between Hatay and [[Gaziantep Province]], where it turns sharply east outside of [[Meidan Ekbis]] ([[Afrin District]]), at {{coord|36.830|N|36.665|E}}.\n\nWith the exception of Hatay province, the Turkish side of the border is entirely within the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]]. East of Meidan Ekbis, the border stretches eastward for some 400&nbsp;km, roughly following the [[37th parallel north]] and passing the [[37th meridian east|37th]] to [[42nd meridian east|42nd]] meridians. For a significant distance, from [[\u00c7obanbey]] to [[Nusaybin]] the border follows the tracks of the [[Konya-Baghdad Railway]]. It crosses the [[Euphrates River]] at [[Jarabulus]]/[[Karkam\u0131\u015f]] and passes north of the border town of [[Koban\u00ee|Koban\u00ee (Ayn al Arab)]] (built in 1912 as part of the Baghdad Railway construction project). The [[Raqqa Governorate]]'s [[Tell Abyad District]] borders the Turkish [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], including the divided border town of [[Tell Abyad]]/[[Ak\u00e7akale]]. The [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]], still bordering  [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], has a border crossing at [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah Governorate|Ras al-Ayn]], connecting to [[Ceylanp\u0131nar]]. Some 100&nbsp;km east of Ceylanp\u0131nar, the border passes the border town of [[Nusaybin]] in the Turkish [[Mardin Province]] (ancient ''Nisibis'', the birthplace of [[Ephraim the Syrian]]), next to Syrian [[Qamishli]]. The Syrian [[Aleppo Governorate]] has a {{convert|221|km}} long northern boundary with the Turkish [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], [[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]], and [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province|\u015eanl\u0131urfa]] provinces.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the Turkish side, the [[European route E90]] runs alongside the length of the border, crossing the Euphrates at [[Birecik]] and the Tigris at [[Cizre]]. For the final 30&nbsp;km the border follows the course of the Tigris, turning towards the south-east, until it reaches the Iraq-Syria-Turkey [[tripoint]] at {{coord|37.106|N|42.355|E}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|right|Turkey's borders as determined by the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres.]]\nAt the start of the 20th century the entire border region was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The Hatay province borders the Syrian [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] and [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] governorates. The westernmost (and southernmost) border crossing is at {{coord|35.905|N|36.010|E|}}, some 3&nbsp;km west of [[Yaylada\u011f\u0131]]. The border reaches its [[Extreme points of Turkey|southernmost point]] at {{coord|35.808|N|36.152|E|}}, 2&nbsp;km west of [[Bidama]], to include the now-abandoned village of Topraktutan (Beysun)  in Hatay.<ref>\nThe village's population was 583 in 1980 ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=LjtpAAAAMAAJ&q=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&dq=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbucql_63JAhUG_w4KHWWGBPkQ6AEINjAD T\u00fcrk D\u00fcnyas\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Vakf\u0131], 1986, p. 142); it was later evacuated due to landslides.

East of Meidan Ekbis, the border stretches eastward for some 400&nbsp;km, roughly following the [[37th parallel north]] and passing the [[37th meridian east|37th]] to [[42nd meridian east|42nd]] meridians. For a significant distance, from [[\u00c7obanbey]] to [[Nusaybin]] the border follows the tracks of the [[Konya-Baghdad Railway]]. It crosses the [[Euphrates River]] at [[Jarabulus]]/[[Karkam\u0131\u015f]] and passes north of the border town of [[Koban\u00ee|Koban\u00ee (Ayn al Arab)]] (built in 1912 as part of the Baghdad Railway construction project). The [[Raqqa Governorate]]'s [[Tell Abyad District]] borders the Turkish [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], including the divided border town of [[Tell Abyad]]/[[Ak\u00e7akale]]. The [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]], still bordering  [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], has a border crossing at [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah Governorate|Ras al-Ayn]], connecting to [[Ceylanp\u0131nar]]. Some 100&nbsp;km east of Ceylanp\u0131nar, the border passes the border town of [[Nusaybin]] in the Turkish [[Mardin Province]] (ancient ''Nisibis'', the birthplace of [[Ephraim the Syrian]]), next to Syrian [[Qamishli]]. The Syrian [[Aleppo Governorate]] has a {{convert|221|km}} long northern boundary with the Turkish [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], [[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]], and [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province|\u015eanl\u0131urfa]] provinces.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the Turkish side, the [[European route E90]] runs alongside the length of the border, crossing the Euphrates at [[Birecik]] and the Tigris at [[Cizre]]. For the final 30&nbsp;km the border follows the course of the Tigris, turning towards the south-east, until it reaches the Iraq-Syria-Turkey [[tripoint]] at {{coord|37.106|N|42.355|E}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|right|Turkey's borders as determined by the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres.]]\nAt the start of the 20th century the entire border region was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

{"title_page": "Disease surveillance in China", "text_new": "{{further|Disease surveillance}}\n{{Update|date=April 2010}}\n[[Disease surveillance|Surveillance]] for [[communicable diseases]] is the main [[public health surveillance]] activity in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. Currently, the [[disease surveillance]] system in China has three major components:<ref>David Ho. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/full/435421a.html;jsessionid=3805314D3192FBAF970D76F37ED1FA77 Is China prepared for microbial threats?] Nature 435, 421-422 (26 May 2005)</ref>\n\n*'''National Disease Reporting System''' (NDRS): The system covers the entire population (1.3 billion persons) living in all the provinces, prefectures, and counties that make up [[mainland China]]. Thirty-five communicable diseases are reportable under this system.\n* '''Nationwide Disease Surveillance Points''' (DSPs): This surveillance system, comprising 145 reporting sites selected by [[stratified sampling|stratified]] [[cluster sampling|cluster]] [[random sampling]], covers a 1% representative sample of China's population.\n*Surveillance system for specific [[infectious diseases]], [[occupational diseases]], [[food poisoning]], etc.\n\nThere are 35 notifiable infectious diseases, which are divided into Classes A, B, and C. The functions of the surveillance include explaining the natural history of infectious diseases, describing the distribution of case occurrence, triggering disease-control effort, monitoring epidemic of infectious diseases during [[Natural disasters in China|natural disasters]], predicting and controlling epidemics and providing the base of policy adjustment.\n\nData collected through the disease surveillance network serve as the basis for formulating health policies and devising strategies for preventing disease. A computerized reporting system for notifiable diseases has been established that links China's 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Mechanisms for providing timely feedback to units that report data and for systematically assessing the quality of those data are important attributes of this system.\n\n==National Disease Reporting System (NDRS)==\n\nIn 1959, a system for reporting infectious diseases was established. Data collected at the village level are reported to prevention units in township hospitals. From the prevention units, data are transmitted through county health and epidemic-prevention stations to provincial centers and then on to the [[Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine]]. Since 1977, the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Health]] has convened annual meetings to analyze these data on the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.\n\nIn 1987, a [[Nationwide Antiepidemic Computer Telecommunication Network]] (NATCN) was established as an official information system for the National Disease Reporting System (NDRS). The Ministry of Public Health and the provincial centers of health and epidemic prevention support this network, which monitors disease [[epidemic]]s at various levels within the public health system. As technical facilities of the network improve, use of the NACTN will expand into all aspects of public health surveillance.\n\n===Computer Network Development===\n\nAfter receiving approval from the Ministry of Public Health in 1986, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) began to establish a nationwide [[microcomputer]] [[communication network]]. The purpose was to link all the country's provincial centers of health and epidemic prevention in an effort to improve the system for preventing epidemics. After a year was spent establishing and modifying the system, a network that connected the capitals of 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities began operating in 1987. The primary function of the network was to collect data on the morbidity and mortality associated with reportable communicable diseases, to obtain information on [[outbreak]]s of other types of disease, and to provide monthly and annual reports to local and national health authorities.\n\n===Morbidity and Mortality Monthly Reports (MMMR)===\n\nEach month, all provinces transmit [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]]-level summaries of the numbers of cases and deaths associated with 35 notifiable communicable diseases to the Academy of Preventive Medicine. Reports are sent on the 13th to 15th day of each month via the NACTN. At the central node of NACTN, the Academy's Center of [[Computer Science]] and [[Health Statistics]] compiles and analyzes the data, provides feedback to the provinces, and creates national summaries within one week. Copies of the MMMR are distributed regularly to health authorities at various levels.\n\n===Morbidity and Mortality Annual Report (MMAR)===\n\nEach January, all provinces provide [[wikt:supplementary|supplementary]] reports to revise and update the monthly reports submitted during the previous year. [[Ageing|Age]]- and [[Employment|occupation]]-specific reports of mortality and morbidity are also submitted at this time. In April, after the surveillance data have been reviewed at the national meeting on epidemic diseases, the MMAR and other analytical reports are distributed.\n\n===Computer Telecommunication of Surveillance Data: Technical Issues===\n\nUntil the 1980s, no public [[digital communications]] system was available in China. In establishing the nationwide communication network, [[modem]]s with common [[Plain old telephone service|analog telephone]] lines had to be used. Making this large communication system run successfully posed major challenges. With some of the problems in mind, the system was designed to have strong fault-tolerant redundancy - with the capability for self-correction - to overcome the myriad of problems caused by poor-quality telephone lines and cumbersome [[telephone exchange]] systems.\n\nThe NACTN was enhanced by incorporating the following functions.\n\n* [[Breakpoint]] recording with resumption of operations: When telephone lines break during data transmission, the system is designed to record the break-point status for every case. This allows data transmission to resume automatically when line connections are reestablished.\n* Automatic node scanning and re-circling: This feature allows the system to scan the status of all network nodes to allocate telephone lines and thereby optimize the strategy for maintaining line connections. This important mechanism improves the efficiency of the system and makes data transmission more successful.\n* Automatic sorting/batching, rescheduling, and executing of transmissions: The system can execute all necessary network commands to carry out the communication task arranged by command files of the MMMR/MMAR system. The system adjusts the path as needed in order to complete transmissions that have been delayed because of problems in the system.\n* [[Data compression]] and [[data security|security]]: Before transmission, data are processed by a \"two-phase compressing\" procedure. Data file size can be compressed more than 90%, resulting in shorter [[online]] transmission times. Thus, receiving data from the 30 provincial reporting centers on the network requires only about an hour of online operation. Compression also makes data transmission more secure.\n\n====System Support for NACTN====\n\n* [[Personnel]]: In each province, the computer divisions have selected one or two persons who are dedicated to operating the province's nodes of the NACTN. In 1987, a working group convened to coordinate computer applications and activities. Several times each year, persons from provincial centers meet to discuss network problems and to devise solutions.\n* Hardware and software: Special software has been developed: YQS for collecting and processing information and producing reports and TXS for managing network communications.\n\n====Future Developments of the NACTN====\n\n* Accumulating information\n* Updating techniques\n* Establishing subnetworks within provinces\n\nIn collaboration with the NACTN, a few provinces have established subnetworks to facilitate local communication.\n\n====Existing Databases====\n\n* National report on infectious disease\n* National disease surveillance\n* National report on occupational disease\n* National report on outbreaks of food poisoning\n* National survey data bases: Drinking water quality; Human-parasite infections; Nutritional surveys; Nutrition for the elderly; Child-nutrition surveillance; Diarrheal disease of children; Smoking and health.\n\n==National Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs)==\n\nIn the period 1980\u20131989, the network of DSPs covered 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities that had a combined population of 10 million persons (<1% of China's population). When the network was proposed in 1978, it was not possible to obtain a population-based [[random sample]]. Because participation in the network was voluntary, the data collected were biased, even after attempts were made to adjust the sample to improve national representativeness. Persons covered by the DSPs tended to be from the upper-middle socioeconomic stratum.\n\nIn 1989, efforts were begun to select a new sample of surveillance points. We used stratified cluster random sampling to select 145 DSPs in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, which have a combined population structure similar to that shown in the national census. Data on individual births and deaths, as well as on infectious diseases and certain types of behaviors (e.g., [[tobacco smoking]]), are recorded. At the household level, information on socioeconomic indicators, health-care conditions, and environmental factors is collected.\n\nInformation obtained from the DSPs is compared with data obtained from the National Disease Reporting System to enable [[health policy|policymakers]] to estimate more accurately the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with infectious disease. More importantly, policy makers can evaluate information from the DSPs in relation to the economic development, cultural background, and health-care-service use by the population covered by this surveillance system.\n\nData collected at DSPs:\n\n* Household information: includes data on number of members, income, health-care situation, water supply, and toilet facilities.\n* Individual information: includes data on occupation, education, births, deaths, episodes of infectious diseases, pregnancy, [[lactation]], feeding, and [[vaccination]] status.\n\nEach month, data collected by the township hospitals and village prevention units are submitted to the country, which then conveys the information through the provincial centers to the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. The Academy distributes monthly reports to the Ministry of Public Health, to provincial health authorities, and to all DSPs. An annual report is also published and distributed.\n\n===Surveys and Investigations===\n\nSurveys and investigations are conducted by the DSPs to improve the quality and promote the use of data collected. These surveys and investigations are designed to generate information that can be used by policymakers. At present, the following activities are being undertaken:\n\n* Characterizing risk factors and patterns of death among adults;\n* Identifying factors that influence the quality of data collected by DSPs;\n* Developing methods to monitor [[Chronic diseases in China]];\n* Devising approaches to promote use of data from DSPs by policymakers.\n\n===Development of the Network of Disease Surveillance Points===\n\nSamples of persons already monitored under existing DSPs will be used for [[data collection]] to address important and emerging public health issues. Issues to be addressed include a prospective study of the health consequences of smoking, an assessment of drinking-water quality and disease occurrence, an evaluation of the national \"Expanded Program on [[Immunization]]\", and an epidemiologic study of [[hepatitis]]. By selecting samples in this fashion, investigators can correlate data from these special studies with data routinely collected under the system of DSPs.\n\n==Surveillance of Specific Infectious diseases==\n\nThe following are examples of surveillance for specific [[infectious diseases]].\n\n* For each 10-day period during the summer, cases of [[cholera]] - diagnosed by microbiologic or clinical criteria - from all the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities are reported to the national level; this information is compiled and conveyed back to the provincial reporting sources.\n* In eight provinces, surveillance among subgroups of the population with elevated risk for infection with [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) is conducted at the national [[diagnostic]] laboratories by using immediate reports and confirmatory testing.\n* A surveillance network for epidemic [[hemorrhagic fever]] has been established for immediate reporting of cases. During the peak season, surveillance for disease among [[rodent]]s is conducted to provide an early-warning system at the local level.\n\n==Quality control of data collection==\n\n[[Quality control]] (QC) in association with [[data collection]] (DC) has been an important component of disease-surveillance activities in China.\n\n* In November of each year, the NDRS actively surveys hospitals and households to identify the proportion of notifiable diseases that went unreported. During a recent year, for example, the proportion of class A and B infectious diseases that was unreported was 27%; this proportion was used to correct the total annual estimate of morbidity attributable to infectious diseases.\n* Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs) are surveyed annually to estimate underreporting of births, deaths, and morbidity due to infectious diseases. From 1990 to 1991, for example, reporting of morbidity from infectious diseases improved. The proportions of unreported births, age-specific deaths, and disease-specific deaths are also reported. In 1991, a team from the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine evaluated the quality of data reported from 18 DSPs located in nine provinces. In their study, the evaluation team identified factors that influenced data quality.\n\n==Use of surveillance data for control of disease==\n\nSurveillance data have been used to implement and evaluate public health programs.\n\n;Monitoring morbidity from infectious disease during heavy flooding in 1991\n\nWhen six provinces around the [[Yangtze River]] were heavily flooded in 1991, the central government expressed serious concern about disease-prevention activities in these provinces. In response, experts were dispatched to the flooded area, and prevention guidelines were developed and distributed to the affected provinces. Simultaneously, a system for collecting daily reports of disease activity was established. Every 3 days, DSP data on infectious disease morbidity were compared with data from previous years to identify potential outbreaks. For example, rates of hepatitis during the flood were compared with rates for the comparable time periods from the preceding 2 years. Data collected from June to October 1991 indicated that infectious diseases had been controlled effectively during the flood.\n\n;Forecasting the epidemiologic transition in China\n\nIn a study sponsored by the [[World Bank]], data collected in DSPs in the period 1986-1989 have been used to study the epidemiologic transition in China. Mortality from leading causes of death was projected for 2010 and 2030. After risk factors were assessed and the impact of preventive programs on these [[chronic diseases in China|chronic diseases]] was estimated, mortality rates were recalculated. These analyses were used to develop recommendations for program planning to the Ministry of Health.\n\n;Prediction and control of meningitis\n\nAfter surveillance data on morbidity from [[meningitis]] in China were reviewed by [[empirical analysis]] and [[Boyer's Theorem]], it was predicted that morbidity from this disease would peak in 1984 or 1985. Additional analyses suggested that the vaccination program that had been conducted for several years, which provided vaccination only for children <12 months of age, would not be adequate to control the predicted upsurge in disease. Therefore, a new vaccination program was adopted that expanded coverage to all children <5 years of age in areas in which surveillance data (including [[blood serum|serum]] epidemiologic data) identified a high risk of meningitis outbreaks. The results in [[Henan Province]] suggested that the intensified vaccination coverage was successful in decreasing rates of meningitis.\n\n;Strategy for vaccination for poliomyelitis\n\nAfter data from 1988 to 1989 on rates of [[poliomyelitis]] and vaccination coverage were reviewed, high-risk areas were identified. In these areas, persons received supplementary vaccination in 1989\u20131990. By 1991, rates of poliomyelitis had begun to fall.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n*David Ho.

Thirty-five communicable diseases are reportable under this system.\n* '''Nationwide Disease Surveillance Points''' (DSPs): This surveillance system, comprising 145 reporting sites selected by [[stratified sampling|stratified]] [[cluster sampling|cluster]] [[random sampling]], covers a 1% representative sample of China's population.\n*Surveillance system for specific [[infectious diseases]], [[occupational diseases]], [[food poisoning]], etc.\n\nThere are 35 notifiable infectious diseases, which are divided into Classes A, B, and C. The functions of the surveillance include explaining the natural history of infectious diseases, describing the distribution of case occurrence, triggering disease-control effort, monitoring epidemic of infectious diseases during [[Natural disasters in China|natural disasters]], predicting and controlling epidemics and providing the base of policy adjustment.\n\nData collected through the disease surveillance network serve as the basis for formulating health policies and devising strategies for preventing disease. A computerized reporting system for notifiable diseases has been established that links China's 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Mechanisms for providing timely feedback to units that report data and for systematically assessing the quality of those data are important attributes of this system.\n\n==National Disease Reporting System (NDRS)==\n\nIn 1959, a system for reporting infectious diseases was established. Data collected at the village level are reported to prevention units in township hospitals. From the prevention units, data are transmitted through county health and epidemic-prevention stations to provincial centers and then on to the [[Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine]]. Since 1977, the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Health]] has convened annual meetings to analyze these data on the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.\n\nIn 1987, a [[Nationwide Antiepidemic Computer Telecommunication Network]] (NATCN) was established as an official information system for the National Disease Reporting System (NDRS). The Ministry of Public Health and the provincial centers of health and epidemic prevention support this network, which monitors disease [[epidemic]]s at various levels within the public health system. As technical facilities of the network improve, use of the NACTN will expand into all aspects of public health surveillance.\n\n===Computer Network Development===\n\nAfter receiving approval from the Ministry of Public Health in 1986, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) began to establish a nationwide [[microcomputer]] [[communication network]]. The purpose was to link all the country's provincial centers of health and epidemic prevention in an effort to improve the system for preventing epidemics. After a year was spent establishing and modifying the system, a network that connected the capitals of 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities began operating in 1987. The primary function of the network was to collect data on the morbidity and mortality associated with reportable communicable diseases, to obtain information on [[outbreak]]s of other types of disease, and to provide monthly and annual reports to local and national health authorities.\n\n===Morbidity and Mortality Monthly Reports (MMMR)===\n\nEach month, all provinces transmit [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]]-level summaries of the numbers of cases and deaths associated with 35 notifiable communicable diseases to the Academy of Preventive Medicine. Reports are sent on the 13th to 15th day of each month via the NACTN. At the central node of NACTN, the Academy's Center of [[Computer Science]] and [[Health Statistics]] compiles and analyzes the data, provides feedback to the provinces, and creates national summaries within one week. Copies of the MMMR are distributed regularly to health authorities at various levels.\n\n===Morbidity and Mortality Annual Report (MMAR)===\n\nEach January, all provinces provide [[wikt:supplementary|supplementary]] reports to revise and update the monthly reports submitted during the previous year. [[Ageing|Age]]- and [[Employment|occupation]]-specific reports of mortality and morbidity are also submitted at this time. In April, after the surveillance data have been reviewed at the national meeting on epidemic diseases, the MMAR and other analytical reports are distributed.\n\n===Computer Telecommunication of Surveillance Data: Technical Issues===\n\nUntil the 1980s, no public [[digital communications]] system was available in China. In establishing the nationwide communication network, [[modem]]s with common [[Plain old telephone service|analog telephone]] lines had to be used. Making this large communication system run successfully posed major challenges. With some of the problems in mind, the system was designed to have strong fault-tolerant redundancy - with the capability for self-correction - to overcome the myriad of problems caused by poor-quality telephone lines and cumbersome [[telephone exchange]] systems.\n\nThe NACTN was enhanced by incorporating the following functions.\n\n* [[Breakpoint]] recording with resumption of operations: When telephone lines break during data transmission, the system is designed to record the break-point status for every case. This allows data transmission to resume automatically when line connections are reestablished.\n* Automatic node scanning and re-circling: This feature allows the system to scan the status of all network nodes to allocate telephone lines and thereby optimize the strategy for maintaining line connections. This important mechanism improves the efficiency of the system and makes data transmission more successful.\n* Automatic sorting/batching, rescheduling, and executing of transmissions: The system can execute all necessary network commands to carry out the communication task arranged by command files of the MMMR/MMAR system. The system adjusts the path as needed in order to complete transmissions that have been delayed because of problems in the system.\n* [[Data compression]] and [[data security|security]]: Before transmission, data are processed by a \"two-phase compressing\" procedure. Data file size can be compressed more than 90%, resulting in shorter [[online]] transmission times. Thus, receiving data from the 30 provincial reporting centers on the network requires only about an hour of online operation. Compression also makes data transmission more secure.\n\n====System Support for NACTN====\n\n* [[Personnel]]: In each province, the computer divisions have selected one or two persons who are dedicated to operating the province's nodes of the NACTN. In 1987, a working group convened to coordinate computer applications and activities. Several times each year, persons from provincial centers meet to discuss network problems and to devise solutions.\n* Hardware and software: Special software has been developed: YQS for collecting and processing information and producing reports and TXS for managing network communications.\n\n====Future Developments of the NACTN====\n\n* Accumulating information\n* Updating techniques\n* Establishing subnetworks within provinces\n\nIn collaboration with the NACTN, a few provinces have established subnetworks to facilitate local communication.\n\n====Existing Databases====\n\n* National report on infectious disease\n* National disease surveillance\n* National report on occupational disease\n* National report on outbreaks of food poisoning\n* National survey data bases: Drinking water quality; Human-parasite infections; Nutritional surveys; Nutrition for the elderly; Child-nutrition surveillance; Diarrheal disease of children; Smoking and health.\n\n==National Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs)==\n\nIn the period 1980\u20131989, the network of DSPs covered 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities that had a combined population of 10 million persons (<1% of China's population). When the network was proposed in 1978, it was not possible to obtain a population-based [[random sample]]. Because participation in the network was voluntary, the data collected were biased, even after attempts were made to adjust the sample to improve national representativeness. Persons covered by the DSPs tended to be from the upper-middle socioeconomic stratum.\n\nIn 1989, efforts were begun to select a new sample of surveillance points. We used stratified cluster random sampling to select 145 DSPs in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, which have a combined population structure similar to that shown in the national census. Data on individual births and deaths, as well as on infectious diseases and certain types of behaviors (e.g., [[tobacco smoking]]), are recorded. At the household level, information on socioeconomic indicators, health-care conditions, and environmental factors is collected.\n\nInformation obtained from the DSPs is compared with data obtained from the National Disease Reporting System to enable [[health policy|policymakers]] to estimate more accurately the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with infectious disease. More importantly, policy makers can evaluate information from the DSPs in relation to the economic development, cultural background, and health-care-service use by the population covered by this surveillance system.\n\nData collected at DSPs:\n\n* Household information: includes data on number of members, income, health-care situation, water supply, and toilet facilities.\n* Individual information: includes data on occupation, education, births, deaths, episodes of infectious diseases, pregnancy, [[lactation]], feeding, and [[vaccination]] status.\n\nEach month, data collected by the township hospitals and village prevention units are submitted to the country, which then conveys the information through the provincial centers to the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.

The agricultural surpluses and increased population enabled [[Shaka]] to raise a standing army of Zulus. By the end of the 18th century, the Zulus occupied much of their [[arable land]]. Declining rainfall and a ten-year drought in the early 19th century set off a competition for land and water resources among the peoples of the area. Another possible cause is the increased trade of ivory with the Portuguese in the [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. This led to deepening inequality within African societies which led people being even more vulnerable in an region that was already being hit by multiple droughts.<ref name=\":1\" />   \n\nIt is worth noting that there were three major ethnic groups which occupied the areas now known as [[Nquthu]], [[Babanango]], [[Empangeni]], [[Mtubatuba]], [[Hlabisa]], [[Nongoma]], [[Pongola, KwaZulu-Natal|Pongola]], [[Vryheid]], [[Melmoth, KwaZulu-Natal|Melmoth]] and [[Mahlabathini]] \u2013 those ethnic groups were the [[Swazi people|Ngwane]], the [[Ndwandwe]] and the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]]. They were respectively led by kings [[Sobhuza I|Sobhuza]] of [[Swaziland|Ngwane]], [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], and [[Dingiswayo]] and were the most powerful ethnic groups. The language now known as Zulu was spoken by the Ndwandwes. At that time the Zulus were a very weak ethnic group under the leadership of [[Senzangakhona]]. They spoke a [[thsefuya language]] in which \"l\" is pronounced as \"y\", so that 'suka lapha', meaning 'go from here', would be expressed as 'suya yapha'. These three ethnic groups are to this day found in the same areas. The Zulus were a weak minority occupying a small piece of land in the area now known as [[Makhosini]] near [[Babanango]]. The Ikhoshlo side of [[Buthelezi]] led by [[Mvulane]] became instrumental in the defeat of Phungashe by Shaka. Mvulane's son Ngqengelele became Shaka's induna and chief advisor. Ngqengele's son, [[Mbangambi]] led his section of [[Buthelezi]]s against Hhamu of Ngenetsheni.<ref group=note>Kamhlaza Hlathwayo who was married to Josiah of Gibisizungu, of Mbangambi of Ngengelele</ref>\n\nOral history says that after the death of [[Mvulane]], the younger brother of Phungashe, Mvulane's sons [[Khoboyela]] and [[Ngqengelele]] escaped being killed by Phungashe over their father Mvulane's estate and went to live with Senzangakhona and Ngqengelele. Most of the members of the Buthelezi ethnic group had left with Khoboyela and Ngqengelele. When Shaka attacked the Ngwane, Sobhuza's men were outnumbered by the combination of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwas]], the Buthelezis under Ngqengelele and the Zulus.  In summary, the causes of mfecane are; the need for land, population growth in Natal, Shaka's military and expansionist strategy. In addition, the profitable slave trade through Delagoa Bay (modern day Maputo Bay) is another cause.\n\n==Rise of the Zulu==\nIn about 1817, Chief [[Dingiswayo]] of the [[Mtetwa Empire|Mthethwa]] group in the south near the [[Tugela River]], entered into an alliance with the [[Vatsonga people|Tsongas]], who controlled the trade routes to [[Delagoa Bay]] (now [[Maputo]]). This alliance encroached on the routes used by the [[Ndwandwe]] alliance, who occupied the region in the north, near the [[Pongola River]]. Battles between the allied forces of Chief Dingiswayo and of Chief [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], and the Ndwandwe probably mark the start of what became the Mfecane.\n\nZwide defeated the Mthethwa and executed Chief Dingiswayo. Dingiswayo was a mentor to King Shaka. He took him in together with his mother Queen Nandi and gave them refuge.  Many of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] leaders formed a confederation with the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] clan, under the leadership of [[Shaka]]. The Zulus conquered and assimilated smaller clans in the area. Zwide attacked King [[Shaka]] and was defeated at the [[Battle of Gqokli Hill]] which marked the start of Shaka's conquest of the [[Ndwandwe]]. The Zulu practice was to absorb only the women and young men of a clan or village. They killed the elderly and men of fighting age; the lucky ones escaped. Having learned Zulu tactics, the escapees in turn descended upon more distant clans unfamiliar with the new order.\n\n==Consequences for the Nguni==\n[[File:Shaka's Empire map.svg|thumb|400px|This map illustrates the rise of the Zulu Empire under Shaka (1816\u20131828) in present-day [[South Africa]]. The rise of the Zulu Empire {{color box|#aa4400}} under Shaka forced other chiefdoms and clans to flee across a wide area of southern Africa.  Clans fleeing the Zulu war zone {{color box|#ffb380}} included the [[Soshangane]], [[Zwangendaba]], [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], [[Hlubi people|Hlubi]], [[Swazi people|Ngwane]], and the [[Mfengu]].  A number of clans were caught between the Zulu Empire and advancing [[Voortrekkers]] and [[British Empire]] {{color box|#F08080}} such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] {{color box|#008000}}.]]\nAround 1821, the Zulu general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] defied Zulu king Shaka, and set up his own kingdom. He quickly made many enemies, not only with the Zulu king, but also with the [[Boer]]s, [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]]. Defeats in several clashes convinced Mzilikazi to move north towards Swaziland. Going north and then inland westward along the watershed between the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers, Mzilikazi and his followers, the AmaNdebele, (called Matebele in English) established an [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] state northwest of the city of [[Pretoria]].\n\nDuring this period, the Matebele left a trail of destruction in their wake.<ref name=\"Becker1979\">{{cite book|author=Becker, Peter |year=1979 |title=Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matebele ethnic group of Southern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h6KPwAACAAJ |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-004978-7}}</ref> From 1837 to 1838, the arrival of Boer settlers and the subsequent battles of Vegtkop and Mosega, drove the Matebele north of the Limpopo.  They settled in the area now known as [[Matabeleland]], in present-day southern [[Zimbabwe]]. Mzilikazi set up his new capital in [[Bulawayo]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\">''Cambridge History of Africa,'' Vol. 5</ref> The AmaNdebele drove the AmaShona of the region northward and forced them to pay tribute. This caused resentment that continued to the current day in modern Zimbabwe.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Mhlatuze River]] in 1818, the Ndwandwe were defeated by the Zulu led by Shaka. [[Soshangane]], one of Zwide's generals, fled to [[Mozambique]] with the remainder of the Ndwandwe. There they established the [[Gaza Empire|Gaza kingdom]]. They oppressed the [[Shangaan|Tsonga]] people living there, some of whom fled over the [[Lebombo Mountains]] into the Northern Transvaal. In 1833, Soshangane invaded various Portuguese settlements, and was initially successful. But a combination of internal disputes and war against the [[Swazi people|Swazi]] caused the downfall of the Gaza kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe [[Swazi people|Ngwane]] people lived in present-day [[Swaziland]], where they had settled in the southwest. They warred periodically with the Ndwandwe.\n\n[[Zwangendaba]], a commander of the Ndwandwe army, fled north with Soshangane after his defeat in 1819. Zwangendaba's followers were henceforth called [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]]. Continuing north of the [[Zambezi River]], they formed a state in the region between lakes [[Lake Malawi|Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]]. [[Maseko]], who led another part of the Ngoni people, founded another state to the east of Zwangendaba's kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nTo the east, refugees from the Mfecane were assimilated into the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]-speaking groups in present-day [[Eastern Cape Province]], becoming the [[Mfengu]]. Subjected to successive waves of attack by other ethnic groups, they were also pressed from the West by the British colonists.\n\n==Consequences for the Sotho-Tswana peoples==\n[[Moshoeshoe I]] gathered the mountain clans together in an alliance against the Zulus. Fortifying the easily defended hills and expanding his reach with cavalry raids, he fought against his enemies with some success, despite not adopting the Zulu tactics, as many other clans had done. The territory of Moshoeshoe I became the kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe Tswana were pillaged by two large invasionary forces set on the move by the Mfecane. [[Sebitwane]] gathered the [[Makololo|Kololo]] ethnic groups near modern Lesotho and wandered north across what is now [[Botswana]], plundering and killing many of the Tswana people in the way. They also took large numbers of captives north with them,<ref name=\"Segolodi\">{{Cite journal|author=Segolodi, Moanaphuti  |year=1940 |title=Ditso Tsa Batawana  |url=https://www.academia.edu/12170767 }}</ref> finally settling north of the Zambezi River in [[Barotseland]], where they conquered the [[Lozi people]].<ref name=\"Tlou1985\">{{cite book|author=Tlou, Thomas |year=1985 |title=A History of Ngamiland, 1750 to 1906: The Formation of an African State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-d3pXwAACAAJ |publisher=Macmillan Botswana|isbn=9780333396353 }}</ref> The next force was the [[Mzilikazi]] and the Matebele who moved across Tswana territory in 1837.

According to Cobbing, apartheid historians had mischaracterised the Mfecane as a period of internally induced black-on-black destruction. Instead, Cobbing argued that the roots of the conflicts could be found exclusively in the labour needs of the Portuguese slave traders operating out of [[Delagoa Bay]], in modern-day [[Mozambique]], and of the British colonists in the Cape. The resulting pressures led to massive displacement, famine, and war in the interior, allowing later [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] settlers to seize control of most land.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cobbing|first=Julian|title=The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1988|volume=29|issue=3|pages=487\u2013519|doi=10.1017/s0021853700030590}}</ref> Among those involved were European adventurers such as [[Nathaniel Isaacs]] (who was later accused of [[slave traders|slave trading]]).<ref name=Natalia>{{cite journal\n|url = http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/4/Natalia%20v04%20article%20p19-21%20C.pdf\n|title = Nathaniel Isaacs\n|author = Herrman, Louis \n|journal = Natalia\n|publisher = The Natal Society Foundation\n|location = Pietermartizburg\n|pages = 19\u201322\n|issue = 4\n|date=December 1974\n|accessdate = 2010-08-10}}</ref>\n\nCobbing's hypothesis caused an immense amount of polemics among historians and the discussion about it was called the \"Cobbing Controversy\".

Moreover, Eldredge argues that [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and other groups allied with British Colonists, rather Missionaries, were primarily responsible for the slave raids coming from the Cape. Eldredge also asserts that Cobbing downplays the importance of the [[ivory trade]] in Delagoa Bay, and the extent to which African groups and leaders sought to establish more centralised and complex state formations to control ivory routes and the wealth associated with the trade. She suggests these pressures created internal movements, as well as reactions against European activity, that drove the state formations and concomitant violence and displacement.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|author=Eldredge, Elizabeth |year= 1995|chapter=Sources of Conflict in Southern Africa c. 1800\u20131830: the 'Mfecane' Reconsidered |pages=122\u2013161 |editor=Hamilton, Carolyn |title=The Mfecane Aftermath: Reconstructive Debates in Southern African History |location= Pietermaritzburg |publisher=University of Natal Press |isbn=978-1-86814-252-1}}</ref> She still agreed with Cobbing's overall sentiment in that the Zulu-centric explanation for the Mfecane is not reliable.<ref name=\":2\" /> By the early 2000s, a new consensus had emerged.<ref name=\":0\" />  Most historians recognize that the Mfecane wasn't just a series of events caused by the founding of the Zulu kingdom but rather a multitude of factors caused before and after [[Shaka|Shaka Zulu]] came into power.<ref name=\"Etherington2004\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Creation of the Zulu Kingdom, 1815\u20131828|last=Eldredge|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n{{refbegin}}\n*J.D.

Battles between the allied forces of Chief Dingiswayo and of Chief [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], and the Ndwandwe probably mark the start of what became the Mfecane.\n\nZwide defeated the Mthethwa and executed Chief Dingiswayo. Dingiswayo was a mentor to King Shaka. He took him in together with his mother Queen Nandi and gave them refuge.  Many of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] leaders formed a confederation with the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] clan, under the leadership of [[Shaka]]. The Zulus conquered and assimilated smaller clans in the area. Zwide attacked King [[Shaka]] and was defeated at the [[Battle of Gqokli Hill]] which marked the start of Shaka's conquest of the [[Ndwandwe]]. The Zulu practice was to absorb only the women and young men of a clan or village. They killed the elderly and men of fighting age; the lucky ones escaped. Having learned Zulu tactics, the escapees in turn descended upon more distant clans unfamiliar with the new order.\n\n==Consequences for the Nguni==\n[[File:Shaka's Empire map.svg|thumb|400px|This map illustrates the rise of the Zulu Empire under Shaka (1816\u20131828) in present-day [[South Africa]]. The rise of the Zulu Empire {{color box|#aa4400}} under Shaka forced other chiefdoms and clans to flee across a wide area of southern Africa.  Clans fleeing the Zulu war zone {{color box|#ffb380}} included the [[Soshangane]], [[Zwangendaba]], [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], [[Hlubi people|Hlubi]], [[Swazi people|Ngwane]], and the [[Mfengu]].  A number of clans were caught between the Zulu Empire and advancing [[Voortrekkers]] and [[British Empire]] {{color box|#F08080}} such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] {{color box|#008000}}.]]\nAround 1821, the Zulu general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] defied Zulu king Shaka, and set up his own kingdom. He quickly made many enemies, not only with the Zulu king, but also with the [[Boer]]s, [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]]. Defeats in several clashes convinced Mzilikazi to move north towards Swaziland. Going north and then inland westward along the watershed between the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers, Mzilikazi and his followers, the AmaNdebele, (called Matebele in English) established an [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] state northwest of the city of [[Pretoria]].\n\nDuring this period, the Matebele left a trail of destruction in their wake.<ref name=\"Becker1979\">{{cite book|author=Becker, Peter |year=1979 |title=Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matebele ethnic group of Southern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h6KPwAACAAJ |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-004978-7}}</ref> From 1837 to 1838, the arrival of Boer settlers and the subsequent battles of Vegtkop and Mosega, drove the Matebele north of the Limpopo.  They settled in the area now known as [[Matabeleland]], in present-day southern [[Zimbabwe]]. Mzilikazi set up his new capital in [[Bulawayo]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\">''Cambridge History of Africa,'' Vol. 5</ref> The AmaNdebele drove the AmaShona of the region northward and forced them to pay tribute. This caused resentment that continued to the current day in modern Zimbabwe.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Mhlatuze River]] in 1818, the Ndwandwe were defeated by the Zulu led by Shaka. [[Soshangane]], one of Zwide's generals, fled to [[Mozambique]] with the remainder of the Ndwandwe. There they established the [[Gaza Empire|Gaza kingdom]]. They oppressed the [[Shangaan|Tsonga]] people living there, some of whom fled over the [[Lebombo Mountains]] into the Northern Transvaal. In 1833, Soshangane invaded various Portuguese settlements, and was initially successful. But a combination of internal disputes and war against the [[Swazi people|Swazi]] caused the downfall of the Gaza kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe [[Swazi people|Ngwane]] people lived in present-day [[Swaziland]], where they had settled in the southwest. They warred periodically with the Ndwandwe.\n\n[[Zwangendaba]], a commander of the Ndwandwe army, fled north with Soshangane after his defeat in 1819. Zwangendaba's followers were henceforth called [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]]. Continuing north of the [[Zambezi River]], they formed a state in the region between lakes [[Lake Malawi|Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]]. [[Maseko]], who led another part of the Ngoni people, founded another state to the east of Zwangendaba's kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nTo the east, refugees from the Mfecane were assimilated into the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]-speaking groups in present-day [[Eastern Cape Province]], becoming the [[Mfengu]]. Subjected to successive waves of attack by other ethnic groups, they were also pressed from the West by the British colonists.\n\n==Consequences for the Sotho-Tswana peoples==\n[[Moshoeshoe I]] gathered the mountain clans together in an alliance against the Zulus. Fortifying the easily defended hills and expanding his reach with cavalry raids, he fought against his enemies with some success, despite not adopting the Zulu tactics, as many other clans had done. The territory of Moshoeshoe I became the kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe Tswana were pillaged by two large invasionary forces set on the move by the Mfecane. [[Sebitwane]] gathered the [[Makololo|Kololo]] ethnic groups near modern Lesotho and wandered north across what is now [[Botswana]], plundering and killing many of the Tswana people in the way. They also took large numbers of captives north with them,<ref name=\"Segolodi\">{{Cite journal|author=Segolodi, Moanaphuti  |year=1940 |title=Ditso Tsa Batawana  |url=https://www.academia.edu/12170767 }}</ref> finally settling north of the Zambezi River in [[Barotseland]], where they conquered the [[Lozi people]].<ref name=\"Tlou1985\">{{cite book|author=Tlou, Thomas |year=1985 |title=A History of Ngamiland, 1750 to 1906: The Formation of an African State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-d3pXwAACAAJ |publisher=Macmillan Botswana|isbn=9780333396353 }}</ref> The next force was the [[Mzilikazi]] and the Matebele who moved across Tswana territory in 1837.

According to Cobbing, apartheid historians had mischaracterised the Mfecane as a period of internally induced black-on-black destruction. Instead, Cobbing argued that the roots of the conflicts could be found exclusively in the labour needs of the Portuguese slave traders operating out of [[Delagoa Bay]], in modern-day [[Mozambique]], and of the British colonists in the Cape. The resulting pressures led to massive displacement, famine, and war in the interior, allowing later [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] settlers to seize control of most land.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cobbing|first=Julian|title=The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1988|volume=29|issue=3|pages=487\u2013519|doi=10.1017/s0021853700030590}}</ref> Among those involved were European adventurers such as [[Nathaniel Isaacs]] (who was later accused of [[slave traders|slave trading]]).<ref name=Natalia>{{cite journal\n|url = http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/4/Natalia%20v04%20article%20p19-21%20C.pdf\n|title = Nathaniel Isaacs\n|author = Herrman, Louis \n|journal = Natalia\n|publisher = The Natal Society Foundation\n|location = Pietermartizburg\n|pages = 19\u201322\n|issue = 4\n|date=December 1974\n|accessdate = 2010-08-10}}</ref>\n\nCobbing's hypothesis caused an immense amount of polemics among historians and the discussion about it was called the \"Cobbing Controversy\".

Moreover, Eldredge argues that [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and other groups allied with British Colonists, rather Missionaries, were primarily responsible for the slave raids coming from the Cape. Eldredge also asserts that Cobbing downplays the importance of the [[ivory trade]] in Delagoa Bay, and the extent to which African groups and leaders sought to establish more centralised and complex state formations to control ivory routes and the wealth associated with the trade. She suggests these pressures created internal movements, as well as reactions against European activity, that drove the state formations and concomitant violence and displacement.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|author=Eldredge, Elizabeth |year= 1995|chapter=Sources of Conflict in Southern Africa c. 1800\u20131830: the 'Mfecane' Reconsidered |pages=122\u2013161 |editor=Hamilton, Carolyn |title=The Mfecane Aftermath: Reconstructive Debates in Southern African History |location= Pietermaritzburg |publisher=University of Natal Press |isbn=978-1-86814-252-1}}</ref> She still agreed with Cobbing's overall sentiment in that the Zulu-centric explanation for the Mfecane is not reliable.<ref name=\":2\" /> By the early 2000s, a new consensus had emerged.<ref name=\":0\" />  Most historians recognize that the Mfecane wasn't just a series of events caused by the founding of the Zulu kingdom but rather a multitude of factors caused before and after [[Shaka|Shaka Zulu]] came into power.<ref name=\"Etherington2004\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Creation of the Zulu Kingdom, 1815\u20131828|last=Eldredge|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n{{refbegin}}\n*J.D.

The history of psychology as a scholarly study of the mind and behavior dates back to the [[Ancient Greeks]]. There is also evidence of psychological thought in ancient Egypt. Very high level of work on mind-sciences one can find in Vedic scriptures of Sanatana Dharm (Hinduism) from the dated back of unknow history there was application of certain principle as a part in yogic practices of India.\n\n[[Psychology]] was a branch of the domain of [[philosophy]] until the 1870s, when it developed as an independent scientific discipline in Germany. Psychology as a self-conscious field of experimental study began in 1879, in Leipzig Germany, when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Germany. Wundt was also the first person to refer to himself as ''a psychologist'' (a notable precursor of Wundt was [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) who designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' in 1783 and gave lectures on scientific psychology at the Old University of M\u00fcnster, Germany<ref>Schwarz, K. A., & Pfister, R.: ''Scientific psychology in the 18th century: a historical rediscovery.'' In: ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', Nr. 11, p. 399-407.</ref>). Other important early contributors to the field include [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (a pioneer in the study of [[memory]]), [[William James]] (the American father of [[pragmatism]]), and [[Ivan Pavlov]] (who developed the procedures associated with [[classical conditioning]]).\n\nSoon after the development of [[experimental psychology]], various kinds of applied psychology appeared. [[G. Stanley Hall]] brought scientific pedagogy to the United States from Germany in the early 1880s. [[John Dewey]]'s educational theory of the 1890s was another example. Also in the 1890s, [[Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg]] began writing about the application of psychology to industry, law, and other fields. [[Lightner Witmer]] established the first psychological clinic in the 1890s. [[James McKeen Cattell]] adapted [[Francis Galton]]'s anthropometric methods to generate the first program of mental testing in the 1890s.  In Vienna, meanwhile, [[Sigmund Freud]] developed an independent approach to the study of the mind called [[psychoanalysis]], which has been widely influential.\n\nThe 20th century saw a reaction to [[Edward Titchener]]'s critique of Wundt's empiricism. This contributed to the formulation of [[behaviorism]] by [[John B. Watson]], which was popularized by [[B. F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism proposed emphasizing the study of overt behavior, because that could be quantified and easily measured. Early behaviorists considered study of the \"[[mind]]\" too vague for productive scientific study.  However, Skinner and his colleagues did study thinking as a form of covert behavior to which they could apply the same principles as overt (publicly observable) behavior.\n\nThe final decades of the 20th century saw the rise of [[cognitive science]], an interdisciplinary approach to studying the human mind. Cognitive science again considers the \"mind\" as a subject for investigation, using the tools of [[evolutionary psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], [[behaviorism]], and [[neurobiology]]. This form of investigation has proposed that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as [[artificial intelligence]].\n\nThere are conceptual divisions of psychology in so-called \"forces\" or \"waves,\" based on its schools and historical trends. This terminology is popularized among the psychologists to differentiate a growing humanism in therapeutic practice from the 1930s onwards, called the \"third force,\" in response to the [[Psychological determinism|deterministic]] tendencies of Watson's behaviourism and Freud's psychoanalysis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Angyal|first=Andras|last2=Maslow|first2=Abraham|last3=Murray|first3=Henry A.|last4=Bugental|first4=J.

Though other medical documents of ancient times were full of incantations and applications meant to turn away disease-causing demons and other superstition, the Edwin Smith Papyrus gives remedies to almost 50 conditions and only two contain incantations to ward off evil.\n\nAncient Greek philosophers, from [[Thales]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 550 BC) through even to the Roman period, developed an elaborate theory of what they termed the ''psuch\u1ebd'' ([[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]) (from which the first half of \"psychology\" is derived), as well as other \"psychological\" terms&nbsp;\u2013 ''nous'', ''thumos'', ''logistikon'', etc.<ref>see e.g., Everson, 1991; Green & Groff, 2003</ref> The most influential of these are the accounts of [[Plato]] (especially in the ''[[Republic]]''),<ref>see, e.g., Robinson, 1995</ref> [[Pythagoras]] and of [[Aristotle]] (esp.

However, it is not clear how these sources first came to be used during the [[Renaissance]], and their influence on what would later emerge as the discipline of psychology is a topic of scholarly debate.<ref>[http://ahp.yorku.ca/?p=299 Advances in the History of Psychology \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Presentism in the Service of Diversity?<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n\n===Etymology and early usage of word===\nThe first use of the term \"psychology\" is often attributed to the [[German people|German]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]] Rudolf G\u00f6ckel (1547\u20131628), often known under the Latin form [[Rudolph Goclenius|Rodolphus Goclenius]]), who published the ''Psychologia hoc est: de hominis perfectione, animo et imprimis ortu hujus...'' in [[Marburg]] in 1590. However, the term seems to have been used more than six decades earlier by the Croatian humanist [[Marko Maruli\u0107]] (1450\u20131524) in the title of his Latin treatise, ''Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae.'' Although the treatise itself has not been preserved, its title appears in a list of Marulic's works compiled by his younger contemporary, [[Franjo Bozicevic-Natalis]] in his \"Vita Marci Maruli Spalatensis\" (Krsti\u0107, 1964).\n\nThe term did not come into popular usage until the German Rationalist philosopher, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679\u20131754) used it in his works ''Psychologia empirica'' (1732) and ''Psychologia rationalis'' (1734). This distinction between empirical and rational psychology was picked up in [[Denis Diderot]]'s (1713\u20131780) and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s (1717\u20131783) ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (1751\u20131784) and was popularized in France by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Pierre-Gonthier Maine de Biran|Maine de Biran]] (1766\u20131824). In England, the term \"psychology\" overtook \"mental philosophy\" in the middle of the 19th century, especially in the work of [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] (1788\u20131856).<ref>See Danziger, 1997, chap. 3.</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment psychological thought===\nEarly psychology was regarded as the study of the soul (in the Christian sense of the term).<ref>{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=461 |isbn=978-0-9515922-5-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The modern philosophical form of psychology was heavily influenced by the works of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650), and the debates that he generated, of which the most relevant were the objections to his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641), published with the text. Also important to the later development of psychology were his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649) and ''[[Treatise on Man]]'' (completed in 1632 but, along with the rest of ''[[The World]]'', withheld from publication after Descartes heard of the [[Catholic Church]]'s condemnation of [[Galileo]]; it was eventually published posthumously, in 1664).\n\nAlthough not educated as a physician, [[Descartes]] did extensive anatomical studies of bulls' hearts and was considered important enough that [[William Harvey]] responded to him. Descartes was one of the first to endorse Harvey's model of the circulation of the blood, but disagreed with his metaphysical framework to explain it. Descartes dissected animals and human cadavers and as a result was familiar with the research on the flow of blood leading to the conclusion that the body is a complex device that is capable of moving without the soul, thus contradicting the \"Doctrine of the Soul\". The emergence of psychology as a medical discipline was given a major boost by [[Thomas Willis]], not only in his reference to psychology (the \"Doctrine of the Soul\") in terms of brain function, but through his detailed 1672 anatomical work, and his treatise ''De anima brutorum quae hominis vitalis ac sentitiva est: exercitationes duae'' (\"Two Discourses on the Souls of Brutes\"\u2014meaning \"beasts\"). However, Willis acknowledged the influence of Descartes's rival, Pierre Gassendi, as an inspiration for his work.\n\nThe philosophers of the British [[Empiricist]] and [[Associationist]] schools had a profound impact on the later course of experimental psychology. [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689), [[George Berkeley]]'s ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710), and [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739\u20131740) were particularly influential, as were [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]]'s ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749) and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[A System of Logic]]''. (1843). Also notable was the work of some Continental [[Rationalist]] philosophers, especially [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s (1632\u20131677) ''[[On the Improvement of the Understanding]]'' (1662) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s (1646\u20131716) ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'' (completed 1705, published 1765). Also was an important contribution [[Friedrich August Rauch]]'s (1806\u20131841) book ''[[Psychology: Or, A View of the Human Soul; Including Anthropology]]'' (1840),<ref>Reissued in 2002 by Thoemmes, Bristol, as Vol. 1 of ''The Early American Reception of German Idealism''</ref><ref>See Joseph Henry Dubbs, ''The Reformed Church in Pennsylvania'', Lancaster, PA: Pennsylvania German Society, 1902; pp. 295-312.</ref> the first English exposition of [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] for an American audience.<ref>See E.

The former was developed in the 1770s by Austrian physician [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734\u20131815) who claimed to use the power of gravity, and later of \"animal magnetism\", to cure various physical and mental ills. As Mesmer and his treatment became increasingly fashionable in both Vienna and Paris, it also began to come under the scrutiny of suspicious officials. In 1784, an investigation was commissioned in Paris by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] which included American ambassador [[Benjamin Franklin]], chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and physician [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]] (later the popularizer of the guillotine). They concluded that Mesmer's method was useless. [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]], an Indo-Portuguese priest, revived public attention in animal magnetism. Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that the effect was 'generated from within the mind\u2019 by the power of expectancy and cooperation of the patient.\nAlthough disputed, the \"magnetic\" tradition continued among Mesmer's students and others, resurfacing in England in the 19th century in the work of the physician [[John Elliotson]] (1791\u20131868), and the surgeons [[James Esdaile]] (1808\u20131859), and [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] (1795\u20131860) (who reconceptualized it as property of the subject's mind rather than a \"power\" of the Mesmerist's, and relabeled it \"hypnotism\"). Mesmerism also continued to have a strong social (if not medical) following in England through the 19th century (see Winter, 1998). Faria's approach was significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]] and [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] of the [[Nancy School]]. Faria's theoretical position, and the subsequent experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of [[\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9]].<ref>See [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:47777/bin55efd6f6-374a-478d-8f8d-cf96f616d62f?view=true&xy=01 Yeates, Lindsay B.

Gall argued that the brain is divided into a large number of functional \"organs\", each responsible for particular human mental abilities and dispositions&nbsp;\u2013 hope, love, spirituality, greed, language, the abilities to detect the size, form, and color of objects, etc. He argued that the larger each of these organs are, the greater the power of the corresponding mental trait. Further, he argued that one could detect the sizes of the organs in a given individual by feeling the surface of that person's skull. Gall's ultra-localizationist position with respect to the brain was soon attacked, most notably by French anatomist [[Pierre Flourens]] (1794\u20131867), who conducted ablation studies (on chickens) which purported to demonstrate little or no cerebral localization of function. Although Gall had been a serious (if misguided) researcher, his theory was taken by his assistant, [[Johann Spurzheim|Johann Gaspar Spurzheim]]  (1776\u20131832), and developed into the profitable, popular enterprise of [[phrenology]], which soon spawned, especially in Britain, a thriving industry of independent practitioners. In the hands of Scottish religious leader [[George Combe]] (1788\u20131858) (whose book ''[[The Constitution of Man]]'' was one of the best-sellers of the century), phrenology became strongly associated with political reform movements and egalitarian principles (see, e.g., Shapin, 1975; but also see van Wyhe, 2004). Phrenology soon spread to America as well, where itinerant practical phrenologists assessed the mental well-being of willing customers (see Sokal, 2001).\n\nThe development of modern psychology was closely linked to [[psychiatry]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (see [[History of psychiatry]]), when the treatment of the mentally ill in hospices was revolutionized after Europeans first considered their pathological conditions. In fact, there was no distinction between the two areas in psychotherapeutic practice, in an era when there was still no drug treatment (of the so-called [[Psychopharmacology revolution|psychopharmacologicy revolution]] from 1950) for mental disorders, and its early theorists and pioneering clinical psychologists generally had medical background. The first to implement in the Western a humanitarian and scientific treatment of [[mental health]], based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, were the French [[alienist]]s, who developed the empirical observation of [[psychopathology]], describing the clinical conditions, their physiological relationships and classifying them. It was called the rationalist-empirical school, which most known exponents were [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]], [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol|Esquirol]], [[Jean-Pierre Falret|Falret]], [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel|Morel]] and [[Valentin Magnan|Magnan]]. In the late nineteenth century, the French current was gradually overcome by the German field of study. At first, the German school was influenced by [[German Romanticism|romantic ideals]] and gave rise to a line of mental process speculators, based more on [[empathy]] than reason. They became known as ''Psychiker'', mentalists or psychologists, with different currents being highlighted by [[Johann Christian Reil|Reil]] (creator of the word \"psychiatry\"), [[Johann Christian August Heinroth|Heinroth]] (first to use the term \"[[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]]\") [[Karl Wilhelm Ideler|Ideler]] and [[Carl Gustav Carus|Carus]]. In the middle of the century, a \"somatic reaction\" (''somatiker'') formed against the speculative doctrines of mentalism, and it was based on [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neuropathology]]. In it, those who made important contributions to the psychopathological classification were [[Wilhelm Griesinger|Griesinger]], [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Westphal]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebbing]] and [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|Kahlbaum]], which, in their turn, would influence [[Carl Wernicke|Wernicke]] and [[Theodor Meynert|Meynert]]. [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] revolutionized as the first to define the diagnostic aspects of mental disorders in [[syndrome]]s, and the work of psychological classification was followed to the contemporary field by contributions from [[Kurt Schneider|Schneider]], [[Ernst Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], [[Karl Leonhard|Leonhard]], and [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]]. In [[Great Britain]], there stand out in the nineteenth century [[Alexander Bain]] (founder of the first journal of psychology, [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']], and writer of reference books on the subject at the time, such as ''Mental Science: The Compendium of Psychology, and the History of Philosophy'' (1868), and [[Henry Maudsley]]. In [[Switzerland]], [[Eugen Bleuler|Bleuler]] coined the terms \"[[depth psychology]]\", \"[[schizophrenia]]\", \"[[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]]\" and \"[[autism]]\". In the [[United States]], the Swiss psychiatrist [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] maintained that the patient should be regarded as an integrated \"psychobiological\" whole, emphasizing [[Biopsychosocial model|psychosocial factors]], concepts that propitiated the so-called psychosomatic medicine.<ref name=\"Berrios, G.

Whether it could become an independent scientific discipline was questioned already earlier on: [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804) declared in his ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]]'' (1786) that psychology might perhaps never become a \"proper\" natural science because its phenomena cannot be quantified, among other reasons.<ref>Thomas Sturm, Is there a problem with mathematical psychology in the eighteenth century? A fresh look at Kant\u2019s old argument. ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', 42 (2006), 353-377.</ref> Kant proposed an alternative conception of an empirical investigation of human thought, feeling, desire, and action, and lectured on these topics for over twenty years (1772/73-1795/96). His ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798), which resulted from these lectures, looks like an empirical psychology in many respects.<ref>Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis Verlag, 2009).</ref>\n\n[[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (1776\u20131841) took issue with what he viewed as Kant's conclusion and attempted to develop a mathematical basis for a scientific psychology. Although he was unable to empirically realize the terms of his psychological theory, his efforts did lead scientists such as [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] (1795\u201318\n78) and [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] (1801\u20131887) to attempt to measure the mathematical relationships between the physical magnitudes of external stimuli and the psychological intensities of the resulting sensations. Fechner (1860) is the originator of the term [[psychophysics]].\n\nMeanwhile, individual differences in reaction time had become a critical issue in the field of astronomy, under the name of the \"[[personal equation]]\". Early researches by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] (1784\u20131846) in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and [[Adolf Hirsch]] led to the development of a highly precise [[Marine chronometer|chronoscope]] by [[Matth\u00e4us Hipp]] that, in turn, was based on a design by [[Charles Wheatstone]] for a device that measured the speed of artillery shells (Edgell & Symes, 1906). Other timing instruments were borrowed from physiology (e.g., [[Carl Ludwig]]'s [[kymograph]]) and adapted for use by the Utrecht ophthalmologist [[Franciscus Donders]] (1818\u20131899) and his student [[Johan Jacob de Jaager]] in measuring the duration of simple mental decisions.\n\nThe 19th century was also the period in which physiology, including neurophysiology, professionalized and saw some of its most significant discoveries. Among its leaders were [[Charles Bell]] (1774\u20131843) and [[Fran\u00e7ois Magendie]] (1783\u20131855) who independently discovered the distinction between sensory and motor nerves in the spinal column, [[Johannes Peter M\u00fcller|Johannes M\u00fcller]] (1801\u20131855) who proposed the [[Law of specific nerve energies|doctrine of specific nerve energies]], [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] (1818\u20131896) who studied the electrical basis of muscle contraction, [[Pierre Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880) and [[Carl Wernicke]] (1848\u20131905) who identified areas of the brain responsible for different aspects of language, as well as [[Gustav Fritsch]] (1837\u20131927), [[Eduard Hitzig]] (1839\u20131907), and [[David Ferrier]] (1843\u20131924) who localized sensory and motor areas of the brain. One of the principal founders of experimental physiology, [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Hermann Helmholtz]] (1821\u20131894), conducted studies of a wide range of topics that would later be of interest to psychologists&nbsp;\u2013 the speed of neural transmission, the natures of sound and color, and of our perceptions of them, etc. In the 1860s, while he held a position in [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], Helmholtz engaged as an assistant a young M.D. named [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. Wundt employed the equipment of the physiology laboratory&nbsp;\u2013 [[Marine chronometer|chronoscope]], [[kymograph]], and various peripheral devices&nbsp;\u2013 to address more complicated psychological questions than had, until then, been investigated experimentally. In particular he was interested in the nature of [[apperception]]&nbsp;\u2013 the point at which a perception occupies the central focus of conscious awareness.\n\nIn 1864 Wundt took up a professorship in [[Z\u00fcrich]], where he published his landmark textbook, ''[[Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie]]'' (''Principles of Physiological Psychology'', 1874). Moving to a more prestigious professorship in [[Leipzig]] in 1875, Wundt founded a laboratory specifically dedicated to original research in experimental psychology in 1879, the first laboratory of its kind in the world. In 1883, he launched a journal in which to publish the results of his, and his students', research, ''[[Philosophische Studien]]'' (''Philosophical Studies'')  (For more on Wundt, see, e.g., Bringmann & Tweney, 1980; Rieber & Robinson, 2001). Wundt attracted a large number of students not only from Germany, but also from abroad. Among his most influential American students were [[G. Stanley Hall]] (who had already obtained a PhD from Harvard under the supervision of [[William James]]), [[James McKeen Cattell]] (who was Wundt's first assistant), and [[Frank Angell]] (who founded laboratories at both [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]). The most influential British student was [[Edward Bradford Titchener]] (who later became professor at [[Cornell University|Cornell]]).\n\nExperimental psychology laboratories were soon also established at Berlin by [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848\u20131936) and at G\u00f6ttingen by [[Georg Elias M\u00fcller]] (1850\u20131934). Another major German experimental psychologist of the era, though he did not direct his own research institute, was [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20131909).\n\n==Psychoanalysis==\n{{see also|Psychoanalysis#History}}\nExperimentation was not the only approach to psychology in the German-speaking world at this time. Starting in the 1890s, employing the case study technique, the Viennese physician [[Sigmund Freud]] developed and applied the methods of hypnosis, free association, and dream interpretation to reveal putatively [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] beliefs and desires that he argued were the underlying causes of his patients' \"[[hysteria]].\" He dubbed this approach [[psychoanalysis]]. Freudian psychoanalysis is particularly notable for the emphasis it places on the course of an individual's sexual development in [[pathogenesis]]. Psychoanalytic concepts have had a strong and lasting influence on Western culture, particularly on the arts. Although its scientific contribution is still a matter of debate, both Freudian and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology revealed the existence of compartmentalized thinking, in which some behavior and thoughts are hidden from consciousness&nbsp;\u2013 yet operative as part of the complete personality. Hidden agendas, a bad conscience, or a sense of guilt, are examples of the existence of mental processes in which the individual is not conscious, through choice or lack of understanding, of some aspects of their personality and subsequent behavior.\n\nPsychoanalysis examines mental processes which affect the ego. An understanding of these theoretically allows the individual greater choice and consciousness with a healing effect in neurosis and occasionally in psychosis, both of which [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] defined as \"diseases of the personality\".\n\nFreud founded the [[International Psychoanalytical Association|International Psychoanalytic Association]] in 1910, inspired also by [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi|Ferenczi]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the IPA|url=https://www.ipa.world/IPA/en/IPA1/ipa_history/history_of_the_ipa.aspx|work=www.ipa.world|accessdate=2019-09-07}}</ref> Main theoretical successors were [[Anna Freud]] (his daughter) and [[Melanie Klein|Melane Klein]], particularly in [[child psychoanalysis]], both inaugurating competing concepts; in addition to those who became dissidents and developed interpretations different from Freud's psychoanalytic one, thus called by some [[Neo-Freudianism|neo-freudians]], or more correctly post-freudians:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Freud and the post-Freudians|last=Brown, J.

Working with concepts of the unconscious first noted during the 1800s (by [[John Stuart Mill]], Krafft-Ebing, [[Pierre Janet]], [[Th\u00e9odore Flournoy]] and others),  Jung defined four mental functions which relate to and define the ''ego'', the conscious self:\n\n# Sensation, which tell consciousness that something is there.\n# Feelings, which consist of value judgments, and motivate our reaction to what we have sensed.\n# Intellect, an analytic function that compares the sensed event to all known others and gives it a class and category, allowing us to understand a situation within a historical process, personal or public.\n# And intuition, a mental function with access to deep behavioral patterns, being able to suggest unexpected solutions or predict unforeseen consequences, \"as if seeing around corners\" as Jung put it.\n\nJung insisted on an empirical psychology on which theories must be based on facts and not on the psychologist's projections or expectations.\n\n==Early American==\nAround 1875 the [[Harvard]] physiology instructor (as he then was), [[William James]], opened a small experimental psychology demonstration [[laboratory]] for use with his courses. The [[laboratory]] was never used, at that time, for original research, and so controversy remains as to whether it is to be regarded as the \"first\" experimental psychology laboratory or not. In 1878, James gave a series of lectures at [[Johns Hopkins University]] entitled \"The Senses and the Brain and their Relation to Thought\" in which he argued, ''contra'' [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], that consciousness is not [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenal]], but must have an evolutionary function, or it would not have been naturally selected in humans. The same year James was contracted by [[Henry Holt (publisher)|Henry Holt]] to write a textbook on the \"new\" experimental psychology. If he had written it quickly, it would have been the first English-language textbook on the topic. It was twelve years, however, before his two-volume ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' would be published. In the meantime textbooks were published by [[George Trumbull Ladd]] of [[Yale]] (1887) and [[James Mark Baldwin]] then of [[Lake Forest College]] (1889).\n\nWilliam James was one of the founders of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] in 1885, which studied [[Psychic|psychic phenomena]] ([[parapsychology]]), before the creation of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1892. James was also president of the British society that inspired the United States' one, the [[Society for Psychical Research]], founded in 1882, which investigated psychology and the [[paranormal]] on topics such as [[mediumship]], [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[telepathy]] and [[hypnosis]], and it innovated research in psychology, by which, according to science historian Andreas Sommer, were \"devised methodological innovations such as randomized study designs\" and conducted \"the first experiments investigating the psychology of eyewitness testimony (Hodgson and Davey, 1887), [and] empirical and conceptual studies illuminating mechanisms of dissociation and hypnotism\"; Its members also initiated and organised the International Congresses of Physiological/Experimental psychology.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23355763 | doi=10.1177/0952695112439376 | pmc=3552602 | volume=25 | title=Psychical research and the origins of American psychology: Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg, William James and Eusapia Palladino | year=2012 | journal=Hist Human Sci | pages=23\u201344  | last1 = Sommer | first1 = A}}</ref>\n\nIn 1879 [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] was hired as a philosophy instructor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Although better known for his astronomical and philosophical work, Peirce also conducted what are perhaps the first American psychology experiments, on the subject of color vision, published in 1877 in the ''American Journal of Science'' (see Cadwallader, 1974). Peirce and his student [[Joseph Jastrow]] published \"On Small Differences in Sensation\" in the ''Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences'', in 1884. In 1882, Peirce was joined at Johns Hopkins by [[G. Stanley Hall]], who opened the first American research laboratory devoted to experimental psychology in 1883. Peirce was forced out of his position by scandal and Hall was awarded the only professorship in philosophy at Johns Hopkins. In 1887 Hall founded the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'', which published work primarily emanating from his own laboratory. In 1888 Hall left his Johns Hopkins professorship for the presidency of the newly founded [[Clark University]], where he remained for the rest of his career.\n\nSoon, experimental psychology laboratories were opened at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 1887, by [[James McKeen Cattell]]), [[Indiana University]] (1888, [[William Lowe Bryan]]), the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|University of Wisconsin]] (1888, [[Joseph Jastrow]]), [[Clark University]] (1889, [[Edmund Sanford]]), the [[McLean Hospital|McLean Asylum]] (1889, William Noyes), and the [[University of Nebraska]] (1889, [[Harry Kirke Wolfe]]).\nHowever, it was [[Princeton University]]'s Eno Hall, built in 1924, that became the first university building in the United States to be devoted entirely to experimental psychology when it became the home of the university's [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]].<ref>Glucksberg, S.

It laid many of the foundations for the sorts of questions that American psychologists would focus on for years to come. The book's chapters on consciousness, emotion, and habit were particularly agenda-setting.\n\nOne of those who felt the impact of James' ''[[The Principles of Psychology|Principles]]'' was [[John Dewey]], then professor of philosophy at the [[University of Michigan]]. With his junior colleagues, [[James Hayden Tufts]] (who founded the psychology laboratory at Michigan) and  [[George Herbert Mead]], and his student [[James Rowland Angell]], this group began to reformulate psychology, focusing more strongly on the social environment and on the ''activity'' of mind and behavior than the psychophysics-inspired physiological psychology of Wundt and his followers had heretofore. Tufts left Michigan for another junior position at the newly founded [[University of Chicago]] in 1892. A year later, the senior philosopher at Chicago, [[Charles Augustus Strong|Charles Strong]], resigned, and Tufts recommended to Chicago president [[William Rainey Harper]] that Dewey be offered the position. After initial reluctance, Dewey was hired in 1894. Dewey soon filled out the department with his Michigan companions Mead and Angell. These four formed the core of the [[Chicago School of psychology]].\n\nIn 1892, [[G. Stanley Hall]] invited 30-some psychologists and philosophers to a meeting at [[Clark University|Clark]] with the purpose of founding a new [[American Psychological Association]] (APA). (On the history of the APA, see Evans, Staudt Sexton, & Cadwallader, 1992.) The first annual meeting of the APA was held later that year, hosted by [[George Stuart Fullerton]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Almost immediately tension arose between the experimentally and philosophically inclined members of the APA. [[Edward Bradford Titchener]] and [[Lightner Witmer]] launched an attempt to either establish a separate \"Section\" for philosophical presentations, or to eject the philosophers altogether. After nearly a decade of debate, a [[Western Philosophical Association]] was founded and held its first meeting in 1901 at the [[University of Nebraska]]. The following year (1902), an [[American Philosophical Association]] held its first meeting at [[Columbia University]]. These ultimately became the Central and Eastern Divisions of the modern [[American Philosophical Association]].\n\nIn 1894, a number of psychologists, unhappy with the parochial editorial policies of the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' approached Hall about appointing an editorial board and opening the journal out to more psychologists not within Hall's immediate circle. Hall refused, so [[James McKeen Cattell]] (then of [[Columbia University|Columbia]]) and [[James Mark Baldwin]] (then of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) co-founded a new journal, ''[[Psychological Review]]'', which rapidly grew to become a major outlet for American psychological researchers.<ref name=\"DigitalHistory1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = C.

In 1896, [[James Rowland Angell]] and [[Addison W. Moore]] (Chicago) published a series of experiments in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' appearing to show that Baldwin was the more correct of the two. However, they interpreted their findings in light of [[John Dewey]]'s new approach to psychology, which rejected the traditional stimulus-response understanding of the reflex arc in favor of a \"circular\" account in which what serves as \"stimulus\" and what as \"response\" depends on how one views the situation. The full position was laid out in Dewey's landmark article \"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology\" which also appeared in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1896.\n\n[[Edward Bradford Titchener|Titchener]] responded in ''[[Philosophical Review]]'' (1898, 1899) by distinguishing his austere \"structural\" approach to psychology from what he termed the Chicago group's more applied \"functional\" approach, and thus began the first major theoretical rift in American psychology between [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] and [[Functional psychology|Functionalism]]. The group at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], led by [[James McKeen Cattell]], [[Edward L. Thorndike]], and [[Robert S. Woodworth]], was often regarded as a second (after Chicago) \"school\" of American Functionalism (see, e.g., Heidbredder, 1933), although they never used that term themselves, because their research focused on the applied areas of mental testing, learning, and education. Dewey was elected president of the APA in 1899, while Titchener dropped his membership in the association. (In 1904, Titchener formed his own group, eventually known as the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]].) [[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]] promoted the functionalist approach in his APA presidential address of 1900, and Angell adopted Titchener's label explicitly in his influential textbook of 1904 and his APA presidential address of 1906. In reality, Structuralism was, more or less, confined to Titchener and his students.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} (It was Titchener's former student [[E. G. Boring]], writing [[Edwin Boring#A History of Experimental Psychology, 1929|''A History of Experimental Psychology'']] [1929\u20131950, the most influential textbook of the 20th century about the discipline], who launched the common idea that the structuralism/functionalism debate was the primary fault line in American psychology at the turn of the 20th century.) Functionalism, broadly speaking, with its more practical emphasis on action and application, better suited the American cultural \"style\" and, perhaps more important, was more appealing to pragmatic university trustees and private funding agencies.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Early French==\n[[Jules Baillarger]] founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9dico-Psychologique in 1847, one of the first associations of its kind and which published the ''Annales Medico-Psychologiques''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medicopsy.com/a-propos|title=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9dico-Psychologique {{!}} A propos|website=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9dico-Psychologique|language=fr|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref> France already had a pioneering tradition in psychological study, and it was relevant the publication of ''Pr\u00e9cis d'un cours de psychologie'' (\"Summary of a Psychology Course\") in 1831 by [[Adolphe Granier de Cassagnac|Adolphe Garnier]], who also published the''Trait\u00e9 des facult\u00e9s de l'\u00e2me, comprenant l'histoire des principales th\u00e9ories psychologiques'' (\"Treatise of the Faculties of the Soul, comprising the history of major psychological theories\") in 1852.<ref>Gustave Vapereau, ''Dictionnaire universel des contemporains'', Hachette, 1858, <abbr>p.</abbr> 720</ref> Garnier was called \"the best monument of psychological science of our time\" by [[Revue des deux Mondes|Revue des Deux Mondes]] in 1864.<ref>''La Revue des deux Mondes'', t.

These were traditional metaphysical schools, opposed to regarding psychology as a natural science. With the ouster of Napol\u00e9on III after the d\u00e9bacle of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], new paths, both political and intellectual, became possible. From the 1870 forward, a steadily increasing interest in [[positivism|positivist]], [[materialism|materialist]], [[evolution]]ary, and [[determinism|deterministic]] approaches to psychology developed, influenced by, among others, the work of [[Hyppolyte Taine]] (1828\u20131893) (e.g., ''De L'Intelligence'', 1870) and [[Th\u00e9odule-Armand Ribot|Th\u00e9odule Ribot]] (1839\u20131916) (e.g., ''La Psychologie Anglaise Contemporaine'', 1870).\n\nIn 1876, Ribot founded ''[[Revue philosophique de la France et de l'\u00e9tranger|Revue Philosophique]]'' (the same year as ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' was founded in Britain), which for the next generation would be virtually the only French outlet for the \"new\" psychology (Plas, 1997). Although not a working experimentalist himself, Ribot's many books were to have profound influence on the next generation of psychologists. These included especially his ''L'H\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 Psychologique'' (1873) and ''La Psychologie Allemande Contemporaine'' (1879). In the 1880s, Ribot's interests turned to psychopathology, writing books on disorders of memory (1881), will (1883), and personality (1885), and where he attempted to bring to these topics the insights of general psychology. Although in 1881 he lost a [[Sorbonne]] professorship in the History of Psychological Doctrines to traditionalist [[Jules Soury]] (1842\u20131915), from 1885 to 1889 he taught experimental psychology at the [[Sorbonne]]. In 1889 he was awarded a chair at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] in Experimental and Comparative Psychology, which he held until 1896 (Nicolas, 2002).\n\nFrance's primary psychological strength lay in the field of psychopathology. The chief neurologist at the [[Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]] Hospital in Paris, [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825\u20131893), had been using the recently revivied and renamed (see above) practice of hypnosis to \"experimentally\" produce hysterical symptoms in some of his patients. Two of his students, [[Alfred Binet]] (1857\u20131911) and [[Pierre Janet]] (1859\u20131947), adopted and expanded this practice in their own work.\n\nIn 1889, Binet and his colleague [[Henri Beaunis]] (1830\u20131921) co-founded, at the [[Sorbonne]], the first experimental psychology laboratory in France. Just five years later, in 1894, Beaunis, Binet, and a third colleague, [[Victor Henri]] (1872\u20131940), co-founded the first French journal dedicated to experimental psychology, [[:fr:L'ann\u00e9e psychologique|''L'Ann\u00e9e Psychologique'']]. In the first years of the 20th century, Binet was requested by the French government to develop a method for the newly founded universal public education system to identify students who would require extra assistance to master the standardized curriculum. In response, with his collaborator [[Th\u00e9odore Simon]] (1873\u20131961), he developed the [[:fr:Test Binet-Simon|Binet-Simon Intelligence Test]], first published in 1905 (revised in 1908 and 1911).\nAlthough the test was used to effect in France, it would find its greatest success (and controversy) in the United States, where it was translated into English by [[Henry H. Goddard]] (1866\u20131957), the director of the Training School for the Feebleminded in Vineland, New Jersey, and his assistant, [[Elizabeth Kite]] (a translation of the 1905 edition appeared in the Vineland ''Bulletin'' in 1908, but much better known was Kite's 1916 translation of the 1908 edition, which appeared in book form). The translated test was used by Goddard to advance his [[eugenics]] agenda with respect to those he deemed congenitally feeble-minded, especially immigrants from non-Western European countries. Binet's test was revised by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] (1877\u20131956) into the [[Stanford-Binet]] IQ test in 1916.\nWith Binet's death in 1911, the [[Sorbonne]] laboratory and [[:fr:L'ann\u00e9e psychologique|''L'Ann\u00e9e Psychologique'']] fell to [[Henri Pi\u00e9ron]] (1881\u20131964). Pi\u00e9ron's orientation was more physiological that Binet's had been.\n\n[[Pierre Janet]] became the leading psychiatrist in France, being appointed to the [[Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]] (1890\u20131894), [[the Sorbonne]] (1895\u20131920), and the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] (1902\u20131936). In 1904, he co-founded the ''[[Journale de Psychologie Normale et Pathologique]]'' with fellow [[Sorbonne]] professor [[Georges Dumas]] (1866\u20131946), a student and faithful follower of Ribot. Whereas Janet's teacher, Charcot, had focused on the neurologial bases of hysteria, Janet was concerned to develop a scientific approach to psychopathology as a ''mental'' disorder. His theory that mental pathology results from conflict between unconscious and conscious parts of the mind, and that unconscious mental contents may emerge as symptoms with symbolic meanings led to a public priority dispute with [[Sigmund Freud]].\n\n==Early British==\n\nAlthough the British had the first scholarly journal dedicated to the topic of psychology&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', founded in 1876 by [[Alexander Bain]] and edited by [[George Croom Robertson]]&nbsp;\u2013 it was quite a long while before experimental psychology developed there to challenge the strong tradition of \"mental philosophy.\" The experimental reports that appeared in ''Mind'' in the first two decades of its existence were almost entirely authored by Americans, especially [[G. Stanley Hall]] and his students (notably [[Henry Herbert Donaldson]]) and [[James McKeen Cattell]].\n\n[[Francis Galton]]'s (1822\u20131911) [[anthropometry|anthropometric]] laboratory opened in 1884. There people were tested on a wide variety of physical (e.g., strength of blow) and perceptual (e.g., visual acuity) attributes. In 1886 Galton was visited by [[James McKeen Cattell]] who would later adapt Galton's techniques in developing his own [[mental testing]] research program in the United States. Galton was not primarily a psychologist, however. The data he accumulated in the anthropometric laboratory primarily went toward supporting his case for [[eugenics]]. To help interpret the mounds of data he accumulated, Galton developed a number of important statistical techniques, including the precursors to the scatterplot and the [[product-moment correlation coefficient]] (later perfected by [[Karl Pearson]], 1857\u20131936).\n\nSoon after, [[Charles Spearman]] (1863\u20131945) developed the correlation-based statistical procedure of [[factor analysis]] in the process of building a case for his two-factor theory of intelligence, published in 1901. Spearman believed that people have an inborn level of [[G factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] or ''g'' which can be crystallized into a specific skill in any of a number of narrow content area (''s'', or specific intelligence).\n\nLaboratory psychology of the kind practiced in Germany and the United States was slow in coming to Britain. Although the philosopher [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] (1843\u20131925) urged [[Cambridge University]] to establish a psychophysics laboratory from the mid-1870s forward, it was not until the 1891 that they put so much as \u00a350 toward some basic apparatus (Bartlett, 1937). A laboratory was established through the assistance of the physiology department in 1897 and a lectureship in psychology was established which first went to [[William Halse Rivers Rivers|W. H. R. Rivers]] (1864\u20131922). Soon Rivers was joined by [[Charles Samuel Myers|C. S. Myers]] (1873\u20131946) and [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (1871\u20131938). This group showed as much interest in anthropology as psychology, going with [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] (1855\u20131940) on the famed [[Torres Straits]] expedition of 1898.\n\nIn 1901 the Psychological Society was established (which renamed itself the [[British Psychological Society]] in 1906), and in 1904 Ward and Rivers co-founded the ''[[British Journal of Psychology]]''.\n\n==Early Russian==\n\nInsofar as psychology was regarded as the science of the soul and institutionally part of philosophy courses in theology schools, psychology was present in Russia from the second half of the 18th century. By contrast, if by psychology we mean a separate discipline, with\nuniversity chairs and people employed as psychologists, then it appeared only after the October Revolution. All the same, by the end of the 19th century, many different kinds of activities called psychology had spread in philosophy, natural science, literature, medicine, education, legal practice, and even military science. Psychology was as much a cultural\nresource as it was a defined area of scholarship <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/36976031 | title=Russian Federation | accessdate=4 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe question, \"Who Is to Develop Psychology and How?\", was of such importance that [[Ivan Sechenov]], a physiologist and doctor by training and a teacher in institutions of higher education, chose it as the title for an essay in 1873. His question was rhetorical, for he was already convinced that physiology was the scientific basis on which to build psychology. The response to Sechenov's popular essay included one, in 1872\u20131873, from a liberal professor of law, [[Konstantin Kavelin]]. He supported a psychology drawing on ethnographic materials about national character, a program that had existed since 1847, when the ethnographic division of the recently founded [[Russian Geographical Society]] circulated a request for information on the people's way of life, including \u201cintellectual and moral abilities.\u201d This was part of a larger debate about national character, national resources, and national development, in the context of which a prominent linguist, [[Alexander Potebnja]], began, in 1862, to publish studies of the relation between mentality and language.\n\nAlthough it was the history and philology departments that traditionally taught courses in psychology, it was the medical schools that first introduced psychological laboratories and courses on experimental psychology. As early as the 1860s and 1870s, I. M. Balinskii (1827\u20131902) at the Military-Surgical Academy (which changed its name in the 1880s to the Military Medical Academy) in St. Petersburg and [[Sergey Korsakov]], a psychiatrist at Moscow university, began to purchase psychometric apparatus. [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] created the first laboratory\u2014a special space for psychological experiments\u2014in Kazan\u2019 in 1885. At a meeting of the Moscow Psychological Society in 1887, the psychiatrists [[Grigory Rossolimo]] and Ardalion Tokarskii (1859\u20131901) demonstrated both Wundt's experiments and hypnosis. In 1895, Tokarskii set up a psychological laboratory in the psychiatric clinic of Moscow university with the support of its head, Korsakov, to teach future psychiatrists about what he promoted as new and necessary techniques.\n\nin January 1884, the philosophers Matvei Troitskii and Iakov Grot founded the Moscow Psychological Society. They wished to discuss philosophical issues, but because anything called \u201cphilosophical\u201d could attract official disapproval, they used \u201cpsychological\u201d as a euphemism. In 1907, Georgy Chelpanov announced a 3-year course in psychology based on laboratory work and a well-structured teaching seminar. In the following years, Chelpanov traveled in Europe and the United States to see existing institutes; the result was a luxurious four-story building for the [[Psychological Institute of Moscow]] with well-equipped laboratories, opening formally on March 23, 1914.\n\n==Second generation German==\n\n===W\u00fcrzburg School<!--'W\u00fcrzburg School' redirects here-->===\n\nIn 1896, one of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s former Leipzig laboratory assistants, [[Oswald K\u00fclpe]] (1862\u20131915), founded a new laboratory in [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]]. K\u00fclpe soon surrounded himself with a number of younger psychologists, the so-called '''W\u00fcrzburg School'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, most notably [[Narziss Ach|Narzi\u00df Ach]] (1871\u20131946), [[Karl B\u00fchler]] (1879\u20131963), [[Ernst D\u00fcrr]] (1878\u20131913), [[Karl Marbe]] (1869\u20131953), and [[Henry Jackson Watt]] (1879\u20131925). Collectively, they developed a new approach to psychological experimentation that flew in the face of many of Wundt's restrictions. Wundt had drawn a distinction between the old philosophical style of self-observation (''Selbstbeobachtung'') in which one introspected for extended durations on higher thought processes, and inner perception (''innere Wahrnehmung'') in which one could be immediately aware of a momentary sensation, feeling, or image (''Vorstellung''). The former was declared to be impossible by Wundt, who argued that higher thought could not be studied experimentally through extended introspection, but only humanistically through ''[[V\u00f6lkerpsychologie]]'' (folk psychology). Only the latter was a proper subject for experimentation.\n\nThe W\u00fcrzburgers, by contrast, designed experiments in which the experimental subject was presented with a complex stimulus (for example a Nietzschean aphorism or a logical problem) and after processing it for a time (for example interpreting the aphorism or solving the problem), retrospectively reported to the experimenter all that had passed through his consciousness during the interval. In the process, the W\u00fcrzburgers claimed to have discovered a number of new elements of consciousness (over and above Wundt's sensations, feelings, and images) including ''Bewu\u00dftseinslagen'' (conscious sets), ''Bewu\u00dftheiten'' (awarenesses), and ''Gedanken'' (thoughts). In the English-language literature, these are often collectively termed \"imageless thoughts\", and the debate between Wundt and the W\u00fcrzburgers, the \"imageless thought controversy\".\n\nWundt referred to the W\u00fcrzburgers' studies as \"sham\" experiments and criticized them vigorously. Wundt's most significant English student, [[Edward Bradford Titchener]], then working at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], intervened in the dispute, claiming to have conducted extended introspective studies in which he was able to resolve the W\u00fcrzburgers' imageless thoughts into sensations, feelings, and images. He thus, paradoxically, used a method of which Wundt did not approve in order to affirm Wundt's view of the situation.<ref>See Kusch, 1995; Kroker, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe imageless thought debate is often said to have been instrumental in undermining the legitimacy of all introspective methods in experimental psychology and, ultimately, in bringing about the behaviorist revolution in American psychology. It was not without its own delayed legacy, however. [[Herbert A. Simon]] (1981) cites the work of one W\u00fcrzburg psychologist in particular, [[Otto Selz]] (1881\u20131943), for having inspired him to develop his famous problem-solving computer algorithms (such as [[Logic Theorist]] and [[General Problem Solver]]) and his \"thinking out loud\" method for [[protocol analysis]]. In addition, [[Karl Popper]] studied psychology under B\u00fchler and Selz, and appears to have brought some of their influence, unattributed, to his philosophy of science.<ref>Ter Hark, 2004</ref>\n\n===Gestalt psychology===\nWhereas the W\u00fcrzburgers debated with Wundt mainly on matters of method, another German movement, centered in Berlin, took issue with the widespread assumption that the aim of psychology should be to break consciousness down into putative basic elements. Instead, they argued that the psychological \"whole\" has priority and that the \"parts\" are defined by the structure of the whole, rather than vice versa. Thus, the school was named ''[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]]'', a German term meaning approximately \"form\" or \"configuration.\" It was led by [[Max Wertheimer]] (1880\u20131943), [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] (1887\u20131967), and [[Kurt Koffka]] (1886\u20131941). Wertheimer had been a student of Austrian philosopher, [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (1859\u20131932), who claimed that in addition to the sensory elements of a perceived object, there is an extra element which, though in some sense derived from the organization of the standard sensory elements, is also to be regarded as being an element in its own right. He called this extra element ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' or \"form-quality.\" For instance, when one hears a melody, one hears the notes plus something in addition to them which binds them together into a tune&nbsp;\u2013 the ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t''. It is the presence of this ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' which, according to Von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, but still retain its identity. Wertheimer took the more radical line that \"what is given me by the melody does not arise ... as a secondary process from the sum of the pieces as such. Instead, what takes place in each single part already depends upon what the whole is\", (1925/1938). In other words, one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly in vision, one sees the form of the circle first&nbsp;\u2013 it is given \"im-mediately\" (i.e. its apprehension is not mediated by a process of part-summation). Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.\n\n''Gestalt-Theorie'' ([[Gestalt psychology]]) was officially initiated in 1912 in an article by Wertheimer on the phi-phenomenon; a perceptual illusion in which two stationary but alternately flashing lights appear to be a single light moving from one location to another. Contrary to popular opinion, his primary target was not behaviorism, as it was not yet a force in psychology. The aim of his criticism was, rather, the atomistic psychologies of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920), and other European psychologists of the time.\n\nThe two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiment were K\u00f6hler and Koffka. K\u00f6hler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist [[Max Planck]] (1858\u20131947), but had taken his degree in psychology under [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848\u20131936). Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917 K\u00f6hler (1917/1925) published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. K\u00f6hler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by \"sudden insight\" into the \"structure\" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that [[Ivan Pavlov]] (1849\u20131936) and [[Edward Lee Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949) had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.\n\nThe terms \"structure\" and \"organization\" were focal for the Gestalt psychologists. Stimuli were said to have a certain structure, to be organized in a certain way, and that it is to this structural organization, rather than to individual sensory elements, that the organism responds. When an animal is conditioned, it does not simply respond to the absolute properties of a stimulus, but to its properties relative to its surroundings. To use a favorite example of K\u00f6hler's, if conditioned to respond in a certain way to the lighter of two gray cards, the animal generalizes the relation between the two stimuli rather than the absolute properties of the conditioned stimulus: it will respond to the lighter of two cards in subsequent trials even if the darker card in the test trial is of the same intensity as the lighter one in the original training trials.\n\nIn 1921 Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, ''Growth of the Mind''. With the help of American psychologist [[Robert Morris Ogden|Robert Ogden]], Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''. It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at [[Smith College]] in 1927. In 1935 Koffka published his ''Principles of Gestalt Psychology''. This textbook laid out the ''Gestalt'' vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the ''Gestalt''ists was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to swallow not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other \"scientific categories\": questions of order and questions of ''Sinn'', a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.\n\nHaving survived the onslaught of the Nazis up to the mid-1930s,<ref>see Henle, 1978</ref> all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935.<ref>Henle, 1984</ref> K\u00f6hler published another book, ''Dynamics in Psychology'', in 1940 but thereafter the ''Gestalt'' movement suffered a series of setbacks. Koffka died in 1941 and Wertheimer in 1943. Wertheimer's long-awaited book on mathematical problem-solving, ''Productive Thinking,'' was published posthumously in 1945 but K\u00f6hler was now left to guide the movement without his two long-time colleagues.<ref>For more on the history of ''Gestalt'' psychology, see Ash, 1995</ref>\n\n==Emergence of behaviorism in America==\n{{Main|Behaviorism}}\n\nAs a result of the conjunction of a number of events in the early 20th century, behaviorism gradually emerged as the dominant school in American psychology. First among these was the increasing skepticism with which many viewed the concept of consciousness: although still considered to be the essential element separating psychology from physiology, its subjective nature and the unreliable introspective method it seemed to require, troubled many. [[William James]]' 1904 ''Journal of Philosophy....'' article \"Does Consciousness Exist?\", laid out the worries explicitly.\n\nSecond was the gradual rise of a rigorous animal psychology. In addition to [[Edward Lee Thorndike]]'s work with cats in puzzle boxes in 1898, the start of research in which rats learn to navigate mazes was begun by [[Willard Small]] (1900, 1901 in ''American Journal of Psychology''). [[Robert M. Yerkes]]'s 1905 ''Journal of Philosophy...'' article \"Animal Psychology and the Criteria of the Psychic\" raised the general question of when one is entitled to attribute consciousness to an organism. The following few years saw the emergence of [[John Broadus Watson]] (1878\u20131959) as a major player, publishing his dissertation on the relation between neurological development and learning in the white rat (1907, ''Psychological Review Monograph Supplement''; Carr & Watson, 1908, ''J. Comparative Neurology & Psychology''). Another important rat study was published by [[Henry H. Donaldson]] (1908, ''J. Comparative Neurology & Psychology''). The year 1909 saw the first English-language account of [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s studies of conditioning in dogs (Yerkes & Morgulis, 1909, ''Psychological Bulletin'').\n\nA third factor was the rise of Watson to a position of significant power within the psychological community. In 1908, Watson was offered a junior position at Johns Hopkins by [[James Mark Baldwin]]. In addition to heading the Johns Hopkins department, Baldwin was the editor of the influential journals, ''[[Psychological Review]]'' and ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''. Only months after Watson's arrival, Baldwin was forced to resign his professorship due to scandal. Watson was suddenly made head of the department and editor of Baldwin's journals. He resolved to use these powerful tools to revolutionize psychology in the image of his own research. In 1913 he published in ''Psychological Review'' the article that is often called the \"manifesto\" of the behaviorist movement, \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It.\" There he argued that psychology \"is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science\", \"introspection forms no essential part of its methods...\" and \"The behaviorist... recognizes no dividing line between man and brute\". The following year, 1914, his first textbook, ''Behavior'' went to press. Although behaviorism took some time to be accepted as a comprehensive approach (see Samelson, 1981), (in no small part because of the intervention of World War I), by the 1920s Watson's revolution was well underway. The central tenet of early behaviorism was that psychology should be a science of behavior, not of the mind, and rejected internal mental states such as beliefs, desires, or goals. Watson himself, however, was forced out of Johns Hopkins by scandal in 1920. Although he continued to publish during the 1920s, he eventually moved on to a career in advertising (see Coon, 1994).\n\nAmong the behaviorists who continued on, there were a number of disagreements about the best way to proceed. Neo-behaviorists such as  [[Edward C. Tolman]], [[Edwin Guthrie]], [[Clark L. Hull]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] debated issues such as (1) whether to reformulate the traditional psychological vocabulary in behavioral terms or discard it in favor of a wholly new scheme, (2) whether learning takes place all at once or gradually, (3) whether biological drives should be included in the new science in order to provide a \"motivation\" for behavior, and (4) to what degree ''any'' theoretical framework is required over and above the measured effects of reinforcement and punishment on learning. By the late 1950s, Skinner's formulation had become dominant, and it remains a part of the modern discipline under the rubric of Behavior Analysis. Its application (Applied Behavior Analysis) has become one of the most useful fields of psychology.\n\nBehaviorism was the ascendant experimental model for research in psychology for much of the 20th century, largely due to the creation and successful application (not least of which in advertising) of conditioning theories as scientific models of human behaviour.\n\n==Second generation francophone==\n\n===Genevan School<!--'Genevan School' redirects here-->===\nIn 1918, [[Jean Piaget]] (1896\u20131980) turned away from his early training in [[natural history]] and began post-doctoral work in [[psychoanalysis]] in Zurich. In 1919, he moved to Paris to work at the Binet-Simon Lab. However, Binet had died in 1911 and Simon lived and worked in Rouen. His supervision therefore came (indirectly) from [[Pierre Janet]], Binet's old rival and a professor at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]].\n\nThe job in Paris was relatively simple: to use the statistical techniques he had learned as a natural historian, studying molluscs, to standardize [[Cyril Burt]]'s intelligence test for use with French children.  Yet without direct supervision, he soon found a remedy to this boring work: exploring why children made the mistakes they did.  Applying his early training in psychoanalytic interviewing, Piaget began to intervene directly with the children: \"Why did you do that?\" (etc.)  It was from this that the ideas formalized in his later [[stage theory]] first emerged.\n\nIn 1921, Piaget moved to Geneva to work with [[\u00c9douard Clapar\u00e8de]] at the [[Rousseau Institute]]. They formed what is now known as the '''Genevan School'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.\n\nIn 1936, Piaget received his first honorary doctorate from Harvard.\n\nIn 1955, the International Center for Genetic Epistemology was founded: an interdisciplinary collaboration of theoreticians and scientists, devoted to the study of topics related to Piaget's theory.\n\nIn 1969, Piaget received the \"distinguished scientific contributions\" award from the [[American Psychological Association]].\n\n== Soviet Marxist Psychology ==\n\nIn the early twentieth century, [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s behavioral and conditioning experiments became the most internationally recognized Russian achievements. With the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922, [[Marxism]] was introduced as an overall philosophical and methodological framework in scientific research. In 1920s, state ideology promoted a tendency to the psychology of [[Vladimir Bekhterev|Bekhterev]]'s [[Reflexology|reflexologist]] reductionism in its Marxist interpretation and to [[historical materialism]], while [[Idealism|idealistic]] philosophers and psychologists were harshly criticized. Another variation of Marxist version of psychology that got popularity mostly in Moscow and centered in the local Institute of Psychology was Konstantin Kornilov's (the Director of this Institute) reactology that became the main view, besides a small group of the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle|Vygotsky-Luria Circle]] that, besides its namesakes [[Lev Vygotsky]], and [[Alexander Luria]], included [[Bluma Zeigarnik]], [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Alexei Leontiev]] and others, and in 1920s embraced a deterministic \"instrumental psychology\" version of [[Cultural-historical psychology]]. Due to Soviet censorship and primarily Vygotsky's failed attempt at building consistent psychological theory of consciousness many works by Vygotsky were not published chronologically.\n\nA few attempts were made in 1920s at formulating the core of theoretical framework of the \"genuinely Marxist\" psychology, but all these failed and were characterized in early 1930s as either right- or left-wing deviations of reductionist \"mechanicism\" or \"menshevising idealism\". It was [[Sergei Rubinstein]] in mid 1930s, who formulated the key principles, on which the entire Soviet variation of Marxist psychology would be based, and, thus become the genuine pioneer and the founder of this psychological discipline in the Marxist disguise in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn late 1940s-early 1950s, [[Lysenkoism]] somewhat affected Russian psychology, yet gave it a considerable impulse for a reaction and unification that resulted in institutional and disciplinary integration of psychological community in the postwar Soviet Union.\n\n==Cognitivism==\n{{Main|Cognitive Psychology|Cognitive Science|Cognitive revolution}}\n\n[[Noam Chomsky]]'s (1957) review of Skinner's book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' (that aimed to explain [[language acquisition]] in a behaviorist framework) is considered one of the major theoretical challenges to the type of radical (as in 'root') behaviorism that Skinner taught. Chomsky claimed that language could not be learned solely from the sort of operant conditioning that Skinner postulated. Chomsky's argument was that people could produce an infinite variety of sentences unique in structure and meaning and that these could not possibly be generated solely through experience of natural language. As an alternative, he concluded that there must be internal mental structures&nbsp;\u2013 states of mind of the sort that behaviorism rejected as illusory. The issue is not whether mental activities exist; it is whether they can be shown to be the causes of behavior.  Similarly, work by [[Albert Bandura]] showed that children could [[social learning theory|learn by social observation]], without any change in overt behaviour, and so must (according to him) be accounted for by internal representations.\n\nThe rise of computer technology also promoted the metaphor of mental function as [[information processing]]. This, combined with a scientific approach to studying the mind, as well as a belief in internal mental states, led to the rise of [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] as the dominant model of the mind.\n\nLinks between [[brain]] and [[nervous system]] function were also becoming common, partly due to the experimental work of people like [[Charles Sherrington]] and [[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]], and partly due to studies of people with [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]] (see [[cognitive neuropsychology]]). With the development of technologies for accurately measuring brain function, [[neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] have become some of the most active areas in contemporary psychology.\n\nWith the increasing involvement of other disciplines (such as [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], and [[neuroscience]]) in the quest to understand the mind, the umbrella discipline of [[cognitive science]] has been created as a means of focusing such efforts in a constructive way.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Behavioral neuroscience#History|History of behavioral neuroscience]]\n*[[Clinical psychology#History|History of clinical psychology]]\n*[[Cognitive neuroscience#Historical origins|History of cognitive neuroscience]]\n*[[Cognitive science#History|History of cognitive science]]\n*[[History of evolutionary psychology]]\n*[[Experimental psychology#History|History of experimental psychology]]\n*[[History of hypnosis]]\n*[[History of mental disorders]]\n*[[History of neurology]]\n*[[Neuropsychology#History|History of neuropsychology]]\n*[[Neurophysiology#History|History of neurophysiology]]\n*[[History of psychiatry]]\n*[[History of psychotherapy]]\n*[[History of sociology]]\n*[[History of science]]\n*[[Applied psychology]]\n*[[Basic science (psychology)]]\n*[[Psychophysics]]\n*[[Psychology of art]]\n*[[Psychology of religion]]\n*[[Kurt Danziger]]\n*[[Timeline of psychology]]\n*[[Archives of the History of American Psychology]]\n*[[List of important publications in psychology]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*Annas, J.

The history of psychology as a scholarly study of the mind and behavior dates back to the [[Ancient Greeks]]. There is also evidence of psychological thought in ancient Egypt. Very high level of work on mind-sciences one can find in Vedic scriptures of Sanatana Dharm (Hinduism) from the dated back of unknow history there was application of certain principle as a part in yogic practices of India. \n\n[[Psychology]] was a branch of the domain of [[philosophy]] until the 1870s, when it developed as an independent scientific discipline in Germany. Psychology as a self-conscious field of experimental study began in 1879, in Leipzig Germany, when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Germany. Wundt was also the first person to refer to himself as ''a psychologist'' (a notable precursor of Wundt was [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) who designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' in 1783 and gave lectures on scientific psychology at the Old University of M\u00fcnster, Germany<ref>Schwarz, K. A., & Pfister, R.: ''Scientific psychology in the 18th century: a historical rediscovery.'' In: ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', Nr. 11, p. 399-407.</ref>). Other important early contributors to the field include [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (a pioneer in the study of [[memory]]), [[William James]] (the American father of [[pragmatism]]), and [[Ivan Pavlov]] (who developed the procedures associated with [[classical conditioning]]).\n\nSoon after the development of [[experimental psychology]], various kinds of applied psychology appeared. [[G. Stanley Hall]] brought scientific pedagogy to the United States from Germany in the early 1880s. [[John Dewey]]'s educational theory of the 1890s was another example. Also in the 1890s, [[Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg]] began writing about the application of psychology to industry, law, and other fields. [[Lightner Witmer]] established the first psychological clinic in the 1890s. [[James McKeen Cattell]] adapted [[Francis Galton]]'s anthropometric methods to generate the first program of mental testing in the 1890s.  In Vienna, meanwhile, [[Sigmund Freud]] developed an independent approach to the study of the mind called [[psychoanalysis]], which has been widely influential.\n\nThe 20th century saw a reaction to [[Edward Titchener]]'s critique of Wundt's empiricism. This contributed to the formulation of [[behaviorism]] by [[John B. Watson]], which was popularized by [[B. F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism proposed emphasizing the study of overt behavior, because that could be quantified and easily measured. Early behaviorists considered study of the \"[[mind]]\" too vague for productive scientific study.  However, Skinner and his colleagues did study thinking as a form of covert behavior to which they could apply the same principles as overt (publicly observable) behavior.\n\nThe final decades of the 20th century saw the rise of [[cognitive science]], an interdisciplinary approach to studying the human mind. Cognitive science again considers the \"mind\" as a subject for investigation, using the tools of [[evolutionary psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], [[behaviorism]], and [[neurobiology]]. This form of investigation has proposed that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as [[artificial intelligence]].\n\nThere are conceptual divisions of psychology in so-called \"forces\" or \"waves,\" based on its schools and historical trends. This terminology is popularized among the psychologists to differentiate a growing humanism in therapeutic practice from the 1930s onwards, called the \"third force,\" in response to the [[Psychological determinism|deterministic]] tendencies of Watson's behaviourism and Freud's psychoanalysis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Angyal|first=Andras|last2=Maslow|first2=Abraham|last3=Murray|first3=Henry A.|last4=Bugental|first4=J.

Though other medical documents of ancient times were full of incantations and applications meant to turn away disease-causing demons and other superstition, the Edwin Smith Papyrus gives remedies to almost 50 conditions and only two contain incantations to ward off evil.\n\nAncient Greek philosophers, from [[Thales]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 550 BC) through even to the Roman period, developed an elaborate theory of what they termed the ''psuch\u1ebd'' ([[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]) (from which the first half of \"psychology\" is derived), as well as other \"psychological\" terms&nbsp;\u2013 ''nous'', ''thumos'', ''logistikon'', etc.<ref>see e.g., Everson, 1991; Green & Groff, 2003</ref> The most influential of these are the accounts of [[Plato]] (especially in the ''[[Republic]]''),<ref>see, e.g., Robinson, 1995</ref> [[Pythagoras]] and of [[Aristotle]] (esp.

The Greek tradition influenced some Christian and Islamic thought on the topic.\n\nIn the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, the [[Manual of Discipline]] (from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], ca. 21 BC\u201361 AD) notes the division of human nature into two temperaments or opposing spirits of either veracity or perversity <ref>[http://www.essene.com/History&Essenes/md.htm  See sub-heading: Of the two Spirits of Man]</ref>\n\nWalter M Freeman proposes that [[Thomism]] is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with neurodynamics, in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' entitled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas.\"<ref>http://philpapers.org/rec/FRENBD</ref>\n\nIn Asia, China had a long history of administering tests of ability as part of its education system. In the 6th century AD, [[Lin Xie]] carried out an early experiment, in which he asked people to draw a square with one hand and at the same time draw a circle with the other (ostensibly to test people's vulnerability to distraction).

However, it is not clear how these sources first came to be used during the [[Renaissance]], and their influence on what would later emerge as the discipline of psychology is a topic of scholarly debate.<ref>[http://ahp.yorku.ca/?p=299 Advances in the History of Psychology \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Presentism in the Service of Diversity?<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n\n===Etymology and early usage of word===\nThe first use of the term \"psychology\" is often attributed to the [[German people|German]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]] Rudolf G\u00f6ckel (1547\u20131628), often known under the Latin form [[Rudolph Goclenius|Rodolphus Goclenius]]), who published the ''Psychologia hoc est: de hominis perfectione, animo et imprimis ortu hujus...'' in [[Marburg]] in 1590. However, the term seems to have been used more than six decades earlier by the Croatian humanist [[Marko Maruli\u0107]] (1450\u20131524) in the title of his Latin treatise, ''Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae.'' Although the treatise itself has not been preserved, its title appears in a list of Marulic's works compiled by his younger contemporary, [[Franjo Bozicevic-Natalis]] in his \"Vita Marci Maruli Spalatensis\" (Krsti\u0107, 1964).\n\nThe term did not come into popular usage until the German Rationalist philosopher, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679\u20131754) used it in his works ''Psychologia empirica'' (1732) and ''Psychologia rationalis'' (1734). This distinction between empirical and rational psychology was picked up in [[Denis Diderot]]'s (1713\u20131780) and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s (1717\u20131783) ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (1751\u20131784) and was popularized in France by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Pierre-Gonthier Maine de Biran|Maine de Biran]] (1766\u20131824). In England, the term \"psychology\" overtook \"mental philosophy\" in the middle of the 19th century, especially in the work of [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] (1788\u20131856).<ref>See Danziger, 1997, chap. 3.</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment psychological thought===\nEarly psychology was regarded as the study of the soul (in the Christian sense of the term).<ref>{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=461 |isbn=978-0-9515922-5-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The modern philosophical form of psychology was heavily influenced by the works of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650), and the debates that he generated, of which the most relevant were the objections to his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641), published with the text. Also important to the later development of psychology were his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649) and ''[[Treatise on Man]]'' (completed in 1632 but, along with the rest of ''[[The World]]'', withheld from publication after Descartes heard of the [[Catholic Church]]'s condemnation of [[Galileo]]; it was eventually published posthumously, in 1664).\n\nAlthough not educated as a physician, [[Descartes]] did extensive anatomical studies of bulls' hearts and was considered important enough that [[William Harvey]] responded to him. Descartes was one of the first to endorse Harvey's model of the circulation of the blood, but disagreed with his metaphysical framework to explain it. Descartes dissected animals and human cadavers and as a result was familiar with the research on the flow of blood leading to the conclusion that the body is a complex device that is capable of moving without the soul, thus contradicting the \"Doctrine of the Soul\". The emergence of psychology as a medical discipline was given a major boost by [[Thomas Willis]], not only in his reference to psychology (the \"Doctrine of the Soul\") in terms of brain function, but through his detailed 1672 anatomical work, and his treatise ''De anima brutorum quae hominis vitalis ac sentitiva est: exercitationes duae'' (\"Two Discourses on the Souls of Brutes\"\u2014meaning \"beasts\"). However, Willis acknowledged the influence of Descartes's rival, Pierre Gassendi, as an inspiration for his work.\n\nThe philosophers of the British [[Empiricist]] and [[Associationist]] schools had a profound impact on the later course of experimental psychology. [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689), [[George Berkeley]]'s ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710), and [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739\u20131740) were particularly influential, as were [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]]'s ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749) and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[A System of Logic]]''. (1843). Also notable was the work of some Continental [[Rationalist]] philosophers, especially [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s (1632\u20131677) ''[[On the Improvement of the Understanding]]'' (1662) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s (1646\u20131716) ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'' (completed 1705, published 1765). Also was an important contribution [[Friedrich August Rauch]]'s (1806\u20131841) book ''[[Psychology: Or, A View of the Human Soul; Including Anthropology]]'' (1840),<ref>Reissued in 2002 by Thoemmes, Bristol, as Vol. 1 of ''The Early American Reception of German Idealism''</ref><ref>See Joseph Henry Dubbs, ''The Reformed Church in Pennsylvania'', Lancaster, PA: Pennsylvania German Society, 1902; pp. 295-312.</ref> the first English exposition of [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] for an American audience.<ref>See E.

The former was developed in the 1770s by Austrian physician [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734\u20131815) who claimed to use the power of gravity, and later of \"animal magnetism\", to cure various physical and mental ills. As Mesmer and his treatment became increasingly fashionable in both Vienna and Paris, it also began to come under the scrutiny of suspicious officials. In 1784, an investigation was commissioned in Paris by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] which included American ambassador [[Benjamin Franklin]], chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and physician [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]] (later the popularizer of the guillotine). They concluded that Mesmer's method was useless. [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]], an Indo-Portuguese priest, revived public attention in animal magnetism. Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that the effect was 'generated from within the mind\u2019 by the power of expectancy and cooperation of the patient.\nAlthough disputed, the \"magnetic\" tradition continued among Mesmer's students and others, resurfacing in England in the 19th century in the work of the physician [[John Elliotson]] (1791\u20131868), and the surgeons [[James Esdaile]] (1808\u20131859), and [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] (1795\u20131860) (who reconceptualized it as property of the subject's mind rather than a \"power\" of the Mesmerist's, and relabeled it \"hypnotism\"). Mesmerism also continued to have a strong social (if not medical) following in England through the 19th century (see Winter, 1998). Faria's approach was significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]] and [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] of the [[Nancy School]]. Faria's theoretical position, and the subsequent experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of [[\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9]].<ref>See [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:47777/bin55efd6f6-374a-478d-8f8d-cf96f616d62f?view=true&xy=01 Yeates, Lindsay B.

Gall argued that the brain is divided into a large number of functional \"organs\", each responsible for particular human mental abilities and dispositions&nbsp;\u2013 hope, love, spirituality, greed, language, the abilities to detect the size, form, and color of objects, etc. He argued that the larger each of these organs are, the greater the power of the corresponding mental trait. Further, he argued that one could detect the sizes of the organs in a given individual by feeling the surface of that person's skull. Gall's ultra-localizationist position with respect to the brain was soon attacked, most notably by French anatomist [[Pierre Flourens]] (1794\u20131867), who conducted ablation studies (on chickens) which purported to demonstrate little or no cerebral localization of function. Although Gall had been a serious (if misguided) researcher, his theory was taken by his assistant, [[Johann Spurzheim|Johann Gaspar Spurzheim]]  (1776\u20131832), and developed into the profitable, popular enterprise of [[phrenology]], which soon spawned, especially in Britain, a thriving industry of independent practitioners. In the hands of Scottish religious leader [[George Combe]] (1788\u20131858) (whose book ''[[The Constitution of Man]]'' was one of the best-sellers of the century), phrenology became strongly associated with political reform movements and egalitarian principles (see, e.g., Shapin, 1975; but also see van Wyhe, 2004). Phrenology soon spread to America as well, where itinerant practical phrenologists assessed the mental well-being of willing customers (see Sokal, 2001).\n\nThe development of modern psychology was closely linked to [[psychiatry]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (see [[History of psychiatry]]), when the treatment of the mentally ill in hospices was revolutionized after Europeans first considered their pathological conditions. In fact, there was no distinction between the two areas in psychotherapeutic practice, in an era when there was still no drug treatment (of the so-called [[Psychopharmacology revolution|psychopharmacologicy revolution]] from 1950) for mental disorders, and its early theorists and pioneering clinical psychologists generally had medical background. The first to implement in the Western a humanitarian and scientific treatment of [[mental health]], based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, were the French [[Alienist|alienists]], who developed the empirical observation of [[psychopathology]], describing the clinical conditions, their physiological relationships and classifying them. It was called the rationalist-empirical school, which most known exponents were [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]], [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol|Esquirol]], [[Jean-Pierre Falret|Falret]], [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel|Morel]] and [[Valentin Magnan|Magnan]]. In the late nineteenth century, the French current was gradually overcome by the German field of study. At first, the German school was influenced by [[German Romanticism|romantic ideals]] and gave rise to a line of mental process speculators, based more on [[empathy]] than reason. They became known as ''Psychiker'', mentalists or psychologists, with different currents being highlighted by [[Johann Christian Reil|Reil]] (creator of the word \"psychiatry\"), [[Johann Christian August Heinroth|Heinroth]] (first to use the term \"[[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]]\") [[Karl Wilhelm Ideler|Ideler]] and [[Carl Gustav Carus|Carus]]. In the middle of the century, a \"somatic reaction\" (''somatiker'') formed against the speculative doctrines of mentalism, and it was based on [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neuropathology]]. In it, those who made important contributions to the psychopathological classification were [[Wilhelm Griesinger|Griesinger]], [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Westphal]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebbing]] and [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|Kahlbaum]], which, in their turn, would influence [[Carl Wernicke|Wernicke]] and [[Theodor Meynert|Meynert]]. [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] revolutionized as the first to define the diagnostic aspects of mental disorders in [[Syndrome|syndromes]], and the work of psychological classification was followed to the contemporary field by contributions from [[Kurt Schneider|Schneider]], [[Ernst Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], [[Karl Leonhard|Leonhard]], and [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]]. In [[Great Britain]], there stand out in the nineteenth century [[Alexander Bain]] (founder of the first journal of psychology, [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']], and writer of reference books on the subject at the time, such as ''Mental Science: The Compendium of Psychology, and the History of Philosophy'' (1868), and [[Henry Maudsley]]. In [[Switzerland]], [[Eugen Bleuler|Bleuler]] coined the terms \"[[depth psychology]]\", \"[[schizophrenia]]\", \"[[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]]\" and \"[[autism]]\". In the [[United States]], the Swiss psychiatrist [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] maintained that the patient should be regarded as an integrated \"psychobiological\" whole, emphasizing [[Biopsychosocial model|psychosocial factors]], concepts that propitiated the so-called psychosomatic medicine.<ref>Berrios, G. E. (1996). ''The history of mental symptoms: descriptive psychopathology since the nineteenth century''. Cambridge: Cambridge University.</ref><ref>Berrios, G. E.; Porter, R. (1999).

Whether it could become an independent scientific discipline was questioned already earlier on: [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804) declared in his ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]]'' (1786) that psychology might perhaps never become a \"proper\" natural science because its phenomena cannot be quantified, among other reasons.<ref>Thomas Sturm, Is there a problem with mathematical psychology in the eighteenth century? A fresh look at Kant\u2019s old argument. ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', 42 (2006), 353-377.</ref> Kant proposed an alternative conception of an empirical investigation of human thought, feeling, desire, and action, and lectured on these topics for over twenty years (1772/73-1795/96). His ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798), which resulted from these lectures, looks like an empirical psychology in many respects.<ref>Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis Verlag, 2009).</ref>\n\n[[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (1776\u20131841) took issue with what he viewed as Kant's conclusion and attempted to develop a mathematical basis for a scientific psychology. Although he was unable to empirically realize the terms of his psychological theory, his efforts did lead scientists such as [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] (1795\u201318\n78) and [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] (1801\u20131887) to attempt to measure the mathematical relationships between the physical magnitudes of external stimuli and the psychological intensities of the resulting sensations. Fechner (1860) is the originator of the term [[psychophysics]].\n\nMeanwhile, individual differences in reaction time had become a critical issue in the field of astronomy, under the name of the \"[[personal equation]]\". Early researches by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] (1784\u20131846) in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and [[Adolf Hirsch]] led to the development of a highly precise [[Marine chronometer|chronoscope]] by [[Matth\u00e4us Hipp]] that, in turn, was based on a design by [[Charles Wheatstone]] for a device that measured the speed of artillery shells (Edgell & Symes, 1906). Other timing instruments were borrowed from physiology (e.g., [[Carl Ludwig]]'s [[kymograph]]) and adapted for use by the Utrecht ophthalmologist [[Franciscus Donders]] (1818\u20131899) and his student [[Johan Jacob de Jaager]] in measuring the duration of simple mental decisions.\n\nThe 19th century was also the period in which physiology, including neurophysiology, professionalized and saw some of its most significant discoveries. Among its leaders were [[Charles Bell]] (1774\u20131843) and [[Fran\u00e7ois Magendie]] (1783\u20131855) who independently discovered the distinction between sensory and motor nerves in the spinal column, [[Johannes Peter M\u00fcller|Johannes M\u00fcller]] (1801\u20131855) who proposed the [[Law of specific nerve energies|doctrine of specific nerve energies]], [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] (1818\u20131896) who studied the electrical basis of muscle contraction, [[Pierre Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880) and [[Carl Wernicke]] (1848\u20131905) who identified areas of the brain responsible for different aspects of language, as well as [[Gustav Fritsch]] (1837\u20131927), [[Eduard Hitzig]] (1839\u20131907), and [[David Ferrier]] (1843\u20131924) who localized sensory and motor areas of the brain. One of the principal founders of experimental physiology, [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Hermann Helmholtz]] (1821\u20131894), conducted studies of a wide range of topics that would later be of interest to psychologists&nbsp;\u2013 the speed of neural transmission, the natures of sound and color, and of our perceptions of them, etc. In the 1860s, while he held a position in [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], Helmholtz engaged as an assistant a young M.D. named [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. Wundt employed the equipment of the physiology laboratory&nbsp;\u2013 [[Marine chronometer|chronoscope]], [[kymograph]], and various peripheral devices&nbsp;\u2013 to address more complicated psychological questions than had, until then, been investigated experimentally. In particular he was interested in the nature of [[apperception]]&nbsp;\u2013 the point at which a perception occupies the central focus of conscious awareness.\n\nIn 1864 Wundt took up a professorship in [[Z\u00fcrich]], where he published his landmark textbook, ''[[Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie]]'' (''Principles of Physiological Psychology'', 1874). Moving to a more prestigious professorship in [[Leipzig]] in 1875, Wundt founded a laboratory specifically dedicated to original research in experimental psychology in 1879, the first laboratory of its kind in the world. In 1883, he launched a journal in which to publish the results of his, and his students', research, ''[[Philosophische Studien]]'' (''Philosophical Studies'')  (For more on Wundt, see, e.g., Bringmann & Tweney, 1980; Rieber & Robinson, 2001). Wundt attracted a large number of students not only from Germany, but also from abroad. Among his most influential American students were [[G. Stanley Hall]] (who had already obtained a PhD from Harvard under the supervision of [[William James]]), [[James McKeen Cattell]] (who was Wundt's first assistant), and [[Frank Angell]] (who founded laboratories at both [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]). The most influential British student was [[Edward Bradford Titchener]] (who later became professor at [[Cornell University|Cornell]]).\n\nExperimental psychology laboratories were soon also established at Berlin by [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848\u20131936) and at G\u00f6ttingen by [[Georg Elias M\u00fcller]] (1850\u20131934). Another major German experimental psychologist of the era, though he did not direct his own research institute, was [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20131909).\n\n==Psychoanalysis==\n{{see also|Psychoanalysis#History}}\nExperimentation was not the only approach to psychology in the German-speaking world at this time. Starting in the 1890s, employing the case study technique, the Viennese physician [[Sigmund Freud]] developed and applied the methods of hypnosis, free association, and dream interpretation to reveal putatively [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] beliefs and desires that he argued were the underlying causes of his patients' \"[[hysteria]].\" He dubbed this approach [[psychoanalysis]]. Freudian psychoanalysis is particularly notable for the emphasis it places on the course of an individual's sexual development in [[pathogenesis]]. Psychoanalytic concepts have had a strong and lasting influence on Western culture, particularly on the arts. Although its scientific contribution is still a matter of debate, both Freudian and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology revealed the existence of compartmentalized thinking, in which some behavior and thoughts are hidden from consciousness&nbsp;\u2013 yet operative as part of the complete personality. Hidden agendas, a bad conscience, or a sense of guilt, are examples of the existence of mental processes in which the individual is not conscious, through choice or lack of understanding, of some aspects of their personality and subsequent behavior.\n\nPsychoanalysis examines mental processes which affect the ego. An understanding of these theoretically allows the individual greater choice and consciousness with a healing effect in neurosis and occasionally in psychosis, both of which [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] defined as \"diseases of the personality\".\n\nFreud founded the [[International Psychoanalytical Association|International Psychoanalytic Association]] in 1910, inspired also by [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi|Ferenczi]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the IPA|url=https://www.ipa.world/IPA/en/IPA1/ipa_history/history_of_the_ipa.aspx|work=www.ipa.world|accessdate=2019-09-07}}</ref> Main theoretical successors were [[Anna Freud]] (his daughter) and [[Melanie Klein|Melane Klein]], particularly in [[child psychoanalysis]], both inaugurating competing concepts; in addition to those who became dissidents and developed interpretations different from Freud's psychoanalytic one, thus called by some [[Neo-Freudianism|neo-freudians]], or more correctly post-freudians:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Freud and the post-Freudians|last=Brown, J.

Working with concepts of the unconscious first noted during the 1800s (by [[John Stuart Mill]], Krafft-Ebing, [[Pierre Janet]], [[Th\u00e9odore Flournoy]] and others),  Jung defined four mental functions which relate to and define the ''ego'', the conscious self:\n\n# Sensation, which tell consciousness that something is there.\n# Feelings, which consist of value judgments, and motivate our reaction to what we have sensed.\n# Intellect, an analytic function that compares the sensed event to all known others and gives it a class and category, allowing us to understand a situation within a historical process, personal or public.\n# And intuition, a mental function with access to deep behavioral patterns, being able to suggest unexpected solutions or predict unforeseen consequences, \"as if seeing around corners\" as Jung put it.\n\nJung insisted on an empirical psychology on which theories must be based on facts and not on the psychologist's projections or expectations.\n\n==Early American==\nAround 1875 the [[Harvard]] physiology instructor (as he then was), [[William James]], opened a small experimental psychology demonstration [[laboratory]] for use with his courses. The [[laboratory]] was never used, at that time, for original research, and so controversy remains as to whether it is to be regarded as the \"first\" experimental psychology laboratory or not. In 1878, James gave a series of lectures at [[Johns Hopkins University]] entitled \"The Senses and the Brain and their Relation to Thought\" in which he argued, ''contra'' [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], that consciousness is not [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenal]], but must have an evolutionary function, or it would not have been naturally selected in humans. The same year James was contracted by [[Henry Holt (publisher)|Henry Holt]] to write a textbook on the \"new\" experimental psychology. If he had written it quickly, it would have been the first English-language textbook on the topic. It was twelve years, however, before his two-volume ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' would be published. In the meantime textbooks were published by [[George Trumbull Ladd]] of [[Yale]] (1887) and [[James Mark Baldwin]] then of [[Lake Forest College]] (1889).\n\nWilliam James was one of the founders of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] in 1885, which studied [[Psychic|psychic phenomena]] ([[parapsychology]]), before the creation of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1892. James was also president of the British society that inspired the United States' one, the [[Society for Psychical Research]], founded in 1882, which investigated psychology and the [[paranormal]] on topics such as [[mediumship]], [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[telepathy]] and [[hypnosis]], and it innovated research in psychology, by which, according to science historian Andreas Sommer, were \"devised methodological innovations such as randomized study designs\" and conducted \"the first experiments investigating the psychology of eyewitness testimony (Hodgson and Davey, 1887), [and] empirical and conceptual studies illuminating mechanisms of dissociation and hypnotism\"; Its members also initiated and organised the International Congresses of Physiological/Experimental psychology.<ref>Sommer, Andreas (2012). \"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552602 Psychical research and the origins of American psychology: Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg, William James and Eusapia Palladino]\".

Although better known for his astronomical and philosophical work, Peirce also conducted what are perhaps the first American psychology experiments, on the subject of color vision, published in 1877 in the ''American Journal of Science'' (see Cadwallader, 1974). Peirce and his student [[Joseph Jastrow]] published \"On Small Differences in Sensation\" in the ''Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences'', in 1884. In 1882, Peirce was joined at Johns Hopkins by [[G. Stanley Hall]], who opened the first American research laboratory devoted to experimental psychology in 1883. Peirce was forced out of his position by scandal and Hall was awarded the only professorship in philosophy at Johns Hopkins. In 1887 Hall founded the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'', which published work primarily emanating from his own laboratory. In 1888 Hall left his Johns Hopkins professorship for the presidency of the newly founded [[Clark University]], where he remained for the rest of his career.\n\nSoon, experimental psychology laboratories were opened at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 1887, by [[James McKeen Cattell]]), [[Indiana University]] (1888, [[William Lowe Bryan]]), the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|University of Wisconsin]] (1888, [[Joseph Jastrow]]), [[Clark University]] (1889, [[Edmund Sanford]]), the [[McLean Hospital|McLean Asylum]] (1889, William Noyes), and the [[University of Nebraska]] (1889, [[Harry Kirke Wolfe]]).\nHowever, it was [[Princeton University]]'s Eno Hall, built in 1924, that became the first university building in the United States to be devoted entirely to experimental psychology when it became the home of the university's [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]].<ref>Glucksberg, S.

It laid many of the foundations for the sorts of questions that American psychologists would focus on for years to come. The book's chapters on consciousness, emotion, and habit were particularly agenda-setting.\n\nOne of those who felt the impact of James' ''[[The Principles of Psychology|Principles]]'' was [[John Dewey]], then professor of philosophy at the [[University of Michigan]]. With his junior colleagues, [[James Hayden Tufts]] (who founded the psychology laboratory at Michigan) and  [[George Herbert Mead]], and his student [[James Rowland Angell]], this group began to reformulate psychology, focusing more strongly on the social environment and on the ''activity'' of mind and behavior than the psychophysics-inspired physiological psychology of Wundt and his followers had heretofore. Tufts left Michigan for another junior position at the newly founded [[University of Chicago]] in 1892. A year later, the senior philosopher at Chicago, [[Charles Augustus Strong|Charles Strong]], resigned, and Tufts recommended to Chicago president [[William Rainey Harper]] that Dewey be offered the position. After initial reluctance, Dewey was hired in 1894. Dewey soon filled out the department with his Michigan companions Mead and Angell. These four formed the core of the [[Chicago School of psychology]].\n\nIn 1892, [[G. Stanley Hall]] invited 30-some psychologists and philosophers to a meeting at [[Clark University|Clark]] with the purpose of founding a new [[American Psychological Association]] (APA). (On the history of the APA, see Evans, Staudt Sexton, & Cadwallader, 1992.) The first annual meeting of the APA was held later that year, hosted by [[George Stuart Fullerton]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Almost immediately tension arose between the experimentally and philosophically inclined members of the APA. [[Edward Bradford Titchener]] and [[Lightner Witmer]] launched an attempt to either establish a separate \"Section\" for philosophical presentations, or to eject the philosophers altogether. After nearly a decade of debate, a [[Western Philosophical Association]] was founded and held its first meeting in 1901 at the [[University of Nebraska]]. The following year (1902), an [[American Philosophical Association]] held its first meeting at [[Columbia University]]. These ultimately became the Central and Eastern Divisions of the modern [[American Philosophical Association]].\n\nIn 1894, a number of psychologists, unhappy with the parochial editorial policies of the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' approached Hall about appointing an editorial board and opening the journal out to more psychologists not within Hall's immediate circle. Hall refused, so [[James McKeen Cattell]] (then of [[Columbia University|Columbia]]) and [[James Mark Baldwin]] (then of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) co-founded a new journal, ''[[Psychological Review]]'', which rapidly grew to become a major outlet for American psychological researchers.<ref name=\"DigitalHistory1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = C.

In 1896, [[James Rowland Angell]] and [[Addison W. Moore]] (Chicago) published a series of experiments in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' appearing to show that Baldwin was the more correct of the two. However, they interpreted their findings in light of [[John Dewey]]'s new approach to psychology, which rejected the traditional stimulus-response understanding of the reflex arc in favor of a \"circular\" account in which what serves as \"stimulus\" and what as \"response\" depends on how one views the situation. The full position was laid out in Dewey's landmark article \"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology\" which also appeared in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1896.\n\n[[Edward Bradford Titchener|Titchener]] responded in ''[[Philosophical Review]]'' (1898, 1899) by distinguishing his austere \"structural\" approach to psychology from what he termed the Chicago group's more applied \"functional\" approach, and thus began the first major theoretical rift in American psychology between [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] and [[Functional psychology|Functionalism]]. The group at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], led by [[James McKeen Cattell]], [[Edward L. Thorndike]], and [[Robert S. Woodworth]], was often regarded as a second (after Chicago) \"school\" of American Functionalism (see, e.g., Heidbredder, 1933), although they never used that term themselves, because their research focused on the applied areas of mental testing, learning, and education. Dewey was elected president of the APA in 1899, while Titchener dropped his membership in the association. (In 1904, Titchener formed his own group, eventually known as the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]].) [[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]] promoted the functionalist approach in his APA presidential address of 1900, and Angell adopted Titchener's label explicitly in his influential textbook of 1904 and his APA presidential address of 1906. In reality, Structuralism was, more or less, confined to Titchener and his students.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} (It was Titchener's former student [[E. G. Boring]], writing [[Edwin Boring#A History of Experimental Psychology, 1929|''A History of Experimental Psychology'']] [1929\u20131950, the most influential textbook of the 20th century about the discipline], who launched the common idea that the structuralism/functionalism debate was the primary fault line in American psychology at the turn of the 20th century.) Functionalism, broadly speaking, with its more practical emphasis on action and application, better suited the American cultural \"style\" and, perhaps more important, was more appealing to pragmatic university trustees and private funding agencies.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Early French==\n[[Jules Baillarger]] founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9dico-Psychologique in 1847, one of the first associations of its kind and which published the ''Annales Medico-Psychologiques''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medicopsy.com/a-propos|title=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9dico-Psychologique {{!}} A propos|website=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9dico-Psychologique|language=fr|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref> France already had a pioneering tradition in psychological study, and it was relevant the publication of ''Pr\u00e9cis d'un cours de psychologie'' (\"Summary of a Psychology Course\") in 1831 by [[Adolphe Granier de Cassagnac|Adolphe Garnier]], who also published the''Trait\u00e9 des facult\u00e9s de l'\u00e2me, comprenant l'histoire des principales th\u00e9ories psychologiques'' (\"Treatise of the Faculties of the Soul, comprising the history of major psychological theories\") in 1852.<ref>Gustave Vapereau, ''Dictionnaire universel des contemporains'', Hachette, 1858, <abbr>p.</abbr> 720</ref> Garnier was called \"the best monument of psychological science of our time\" by [[Revue des deux Mondes|Revue des Deux Mondes]] in 1864.<ref>''La Revue des deux Mondes'', t.

These were traditional metaphysical schools, opposed to regarding psychology as a natural science. With the ouster of Napol\u00e9on III after the d\u00e9bacle of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], new paths, both political and intellectual, became possible. From the 1870 forward, a steadily increasing interest in [[positivism|positivist]], [[materialism|materialist]], [[evolution]]ary, and [[determinism|deterministic]] approaches to psychology developed, influenced by, among others, the work of [[Hyppolyte Taine]] (1828\u20131893) (e.g., ''De L'Intelligence'', 1870) and [[Th\u00e9odule-Armand Ribot|Th\u00e9odule Ribot]] (1839\u20131916) (e.g., ''La Psychologie Anglaise Contemporaine'', 1870).\n\nIn 1876, Ribot founded ''[[Revue philosophique de la France et de l'\u00e9tranger|Revue Philosophique]]'' (the same year as ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' was founded in Britain), which for the next generation would be virtually the only French outlet for the \"new\" psychology (Plas, 1997). Although not a working experimentalist himself, Ribot's many books were to have profound influence on the next generation of psychologists. These included especially his ''L'H\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 Psychologique'' (1873) and ''La Psychologie Allemande Contemporaine'' (1879). In the 1880s, Ribot's interests turned to psychopathology, writing books on disorders of memory (1881), will (1883), and personality (1885), and where he attempted to bring to these topics the insights of general psychology. Although in 1881 he lost a [[Sorbonne]] professorship in the History of Psychological Doctrines to traditionalist [[Jules Soury]] (1842\u20131915), from 1885 to 1889 he taught experimental psychology at the [[Sorbonne]]. In 1889 he was awarded a chair at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] in Experimental and Comparative Psychology, which he held until 1896 (Nicolas, 2002).\n\nFrance's primary psychological strength lay in the field of psychopathology. The chief neurologist at the [[Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]] Hospital in Paris, [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825\u20131893), had been using the recently revivied and renamed (see above) practice of hypnosis to \"experimentally\" produce hysterical symptoms in some of his patients. Two of his students, [[Alfred Binet]] (1857\u20131911) and [[Pierre Janet]] (1859\u20131947), adopted and expanded this practice in their own work.\n\nIn 1889, Binet and his colleague [[Henri Beaunis]] (1830\u20131921) co-founded, at the [[Sorbonne]], the first experimental psychology laboratory in France. Just five years later, in 1894, Beaunis, Binet, and a third colleague, [[Victor Henri]] (1872\u20131940), co-founded the first French journal dedicated to experimental psychology, [[:fr:L'ann\u00e9e psychologique|''L'Ann\u00e9e Psychologique'']]. In the first years of the 20th century, Binet was requested by the French government to develop a method for the newly founded universal public education system to identify students who would require extra assistance to master the standardized curriculum. In response, with his collaborator [[Th\u00e9odore Simon]] (1873\u20131961), he developed the [[:fr:Test Binet-Simon|Binet-Simon Intelligence Test]], first published in 1905 (revised in 1908 and 1911).\nAlthough the test was used to effect in France, it would find its greatest success (and controversy) in the United States, where it was translated into English by [[Henry H. Goddard]] (1866\u20131957), the director of the Training School for the Feebleminded in Vineland, New Jersey, and his assistant, [[Elizabeth Kite]] (a translation of the 1905 edition appeared in the Vineland ''Bulletin'' in 1908, but much better known was Kite's 1916 translation of the 1908 edition, which appeared in book form). The translated test was used by Goddard to advance his [[eugenics]] agenda with respect to those he deemed congenitally feeble-minded, especially immigrants from non-Western European countries. Binet's test was revised by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] (1877\u20131956) into the [[Stanford-Binet]] IQ test in 1916.\nWith Binet's death in 1911, the [[Sorbonne]] laboratory and [[:fr:L'ann\u00e9e psychologique|''L'Ann\u00e9e Psychologique'']] fell to [[Henri Pi\u00e9ron]] (1881\u20131964). Pi\u00e9ron's orientation was more physiological that Binet's had been.\n\n[[Pierre Janet]] became the leading psychiatrist in France, being appointed to the [[Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]] (1890\u20131894), [[the Sorbonne]] (1895\u20131920), and the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] (1902\u20131936). In 1904, he co-founded the ''[[Journale de Psychologie Normale et Pathologique]]'' with fellow [[Sorbonne]] professor [[Georges Dumas]] (1866\u20131946), a student and faithful follower of Ribot. Whereas Janet's teacher, Charcot, had focused on the neurologial bases of hysteria, Janet was concerned to develop a scientific approach to psychopathology as a ''mental'' disorder. His theory that mental pathology results from conflict between unconscious and conscious parts of the mind, and that unconscious mental contents may emerge as symptoms with symbolic meanings led to a public priority dispute with [[Sigmund Freud]].\n\n==Early British==\n\nAlthough the British had the first scholarly journal dedicated to the topic of psychology&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', founded in 1876 by [[Alexander Bain]] and edited by [[George Croom Robertson]]&nbsp;\u2013 it was quite a long while before experimental psychology developed there to challenge the strong tradition of \"mental philosophy.\" The experimental reports that appeared in ''Mind'' in the first two decades of its existence were almost entirely authored by Americans, especially [[G. Stanley Hall]] and his students (notably [[Henry Herbert Donaldson]]) and [[James McKeen Cattell]].\n\n[[Francis Galton]]'s (1822\u20131911) [[anthropometry|anthropometric]] laboratory opened in 1884. There people were tested on a wide variety of physical (e.g., strength of blow) and perceptual (e.g., visual acuity) attributes. In 1886 Galton was visited by [[James McKeen Cattell]] who would later adapt Galton's techniques in developing his own [[mental testing]] research program in the United States. Galton was not primarily a psychologist, however. The data he accumulated in the anthropometric laboratory primarily went toward supporting his case for [[eugenics]]. To help interpret the mounds of data he accumulated, Galton developed a number of important statistical techniques, including the precursors to the scatterplot and the [[product-moment correlation coefficient]] (later perfected by [[Karl Pearson]], 1857\u20131936).\n\nSoon after, [[Charles Spearman]] (1863\u20131945) developed the correlation-based statistical procedure of [[factor analysis]] in the process of building a case for his two-factor theory of intelligence, published in 1901. Spearman believed that people have an inborn level of [[G factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] or ''g'' which can be crystallized into a specific skill in any of a number of narrow content area (''s'', or specific intelligence).\n\nLaboratory psychology of the kind practiced in Germany and the United States was slow in coming to Britain. Although the philosopher [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] (1843\u20131925) urged [[Cambridge University]] to establish a psychophysics laboratory from the mid-1870s forward, it was not until the 1891 that they put so much as \u00a350 toward some basic apparatus (Bartlett, 1937). A laboratory was established through the assistance of the physiology department in 1897 and a lectureship in psychology was established which first went to [[William Halse Rivers Rivers|W. H. R. Rivers]] (1864\u20131922). Soon Rivers was joined by [[Charles Samuel Myers|C. S. Myers]] (1873\u20131946) and [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (1871\u20131938). This group showed as much interest in anthropology as psychology, going with [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] (1855\u20131940) on the famed [[Torres Straits]] expedition of 1898.\n\nIn 1901 the Psychological Society was established (which renamed itself the [[British Psychological Society]] in 1906), and in 1904 Ward and Rivers co-founded the ''[[British Journal of Psychology]]''.\n\n==Early Russian==\n\nInsofar as psychology was regarded as the science of the soul and institutionally part of philosophy courses in theology schools, psychology was present in Russia from the second half of the 18th century. By contrast, if by psychology we mean a separate discipline, with\nuniversity chairs and people employed as psychologists, then it appeared only after the October Revolution. All the same, by the end of the 19th century, many different kinds of activities called psychology had spread in philosophy, natural science, literature, medicine, education, legal practice, and even military science. Psychology was as much a cultural\nresource as it was a defined area of scholarship <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/36976031 | title=Russian Federation | accessdate=4 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe question, \"Who Is to Develop Psychology and How?\", was of such importance that [[Ivan Sechenov]], a physiologist and doctor by training and a teacher in institutions of higher education, chose it as the title for an essay in 1873. His question was rhetorical, for he was already convinced that physiology was the scientific basis on which to build psychology. The response to Sechenov's popular essay included one, in 1872\u20131873, from a liberal professor of law, [[Konstantin Kavelin]]. He supported a psychology drawing on ethnographic materials about national character, a program that had existed since 1847, when the ethnographic division of the recently founded [[Russian Geographical Society]] circulated a request for information on the people's way of life, including \u201cintellectual and moral abilities.\u201d This was part of a larger debate about national character, national resources, and national development, in the context of which a prominent linguist, [[Alexander Potebnja]], began, in 1862, to publish studies of the relation between mentality and language.\n\nAlthough it was the history and philology departments that traditionally taught courses in psychology, it was the medical schools that first introduced psychological laboratories and courses on experimental psychology. As early as the 1860s and 1870s, I. M. Balinskii (1827\u20131902) at the Military-Surgical Academy (which changed its name in the 1880s to the Military Medical Academy) in St. Petersburg and [[Sergey Korsakov]], a psychiatrist at Moscow university, began to purchase psychometric apparatus. [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] created the first laboratory\u2014a special space for psychological experiments\u2014in Kazan\u2019 in 1885. At a meeting of the Moscow Psychological Society in 1887, the psychiatrists [[Grigory Rossolimo]] and Ardalion Tokarskii (1859\u20131901) demonstrated both Wundt's experiments and hypnosis. In 1895, Tokarskii set up a psychological laboratory in the psychiatric clinic of Moscow university with the support of its head, Korsakov, to teach future psychiatrists about what he promoted as new and necessary techniques.\n\nin January 1884, the philosophers Matvei Troitskii and Iakov Grot founded the Moscow Psychological Society. They wished to discuss philosophical issues, but because anything called \u201cphilosophical\u201d could attract official disapproval, they used \u201cpsychological\u201d as a euphemism. In 1907, Georgy Chelpanov announced a 3-year course in psychology based on laboratory work and a well-structured teaching seminar. In the following years, Chelpanov traveled in Europe and the United States to see existing institutes; the result was a luxurious four-story building for the [[Psychological Institute of Moscow]] with well-equipped laboratories, opening formally on March 23, 1914.\n\n==Second generation German==\n\n===W\u00fcrzburg School<!--'W\u00fcrzburg School' redirects here-->===\n\nIn 1896, one of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s former Leipzig laboratory assistants, [[Oswald K\u00fclpe]] (1862\u20131915), founded a new laboratory in [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]]. K\u00fclpe soon surrounded himself with a number of younger psychologists, the so-called '''W\u00fcrzburg School'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, most notably [[Narziss Ach|Narzi\u00df Ach]] (1871\u20131946), [[Karl B\u00fchler]] (1879\u20131963), [[Ernst D\u00fcrr]] (1878\u20131913), [[Karl Marbe]] (1869\u20131953), and [[Henry Jackson Watt]] (1879\u20131925). Collectively, they developed a new approach to psychological experimentation that flew in the face of many of Wundt's restrictions. Wundt had drawn a distinction between the old philosophical style of self-observation (''Selbstbeobachtung'') in which one introspected for extended durations on higher thought processes, and inner perception (''innere Wahrnehmung'') in which one could be immediately aware of a momentary sensation, feeling, or image (''Vorstellung''). The former was declared to be impossible by Wundt, who argued that higher thought could not be studied experimentally through extended introspection, but only humanistically through ''[[V\u00f6lkerpsychologie]]'' (folk psychology). Only the latter was a proper subject for experimentation.\n\nThe W\u00fcrzburgers, by contrast, designed experiments in which the experimental subject was presented with a complex stimulus (for example a Nietzschean aphorism or a logical problem) and after processing it for a time (for example interpreting the aphorism or solving the problem), retrospectively reported to the experimenter all that had passed through his consciousness during the interval. In the process, the W\u00fcrzburgers claimed to have discovered a number of new elements of consciousness (over and above Wundt's sensations, feelings, and images) including ''Bewu\u00dftseinslagen'' (conscious sets), ''Bewu\u00dftheiten'' (awarenesses), and ''Gedanken'' (thoughts). In the English-language literature, these are often collectively termed \"imageless thoughts\", and the debate between Wundt and the W\u00fcrzburgers, the \"imageless thought controversy\".\n\nWundt referred to the W\u00fcrzburgers' studies as \"sham\" experiments and criticized them vigorously. Wundt's most significant English student, [[Edward Bradford Titchener]], then working at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], intervened in the dispute, claiming to have conducted extended introspective studies in which he was able to resolve the W\u00fcrzburgers' imageless thoughts into sensations, feelings, and images. He thus, paradoxically, used a method of which Wundt did not approve in order to affirm Wundt's view of the situation.<ref>See Kusch, 1995; Kroker, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe imageless thought debate is often said to have been instrumental in undermining the legitimacy of all introspective methods in experimental psychology and, ultimately, in bringing about the behaviorist revolution in American psychology. It was not without its own delayed legacy, however. [[Herbert A. Simon]] (1981) cites the work of one W\u00fcrzburg psychologist in particular, [[Otto Selz]] (1881\u20131943), for having inspired him to develop his famous problem-solving computer algorithms (such as [[Logic Theorist]] and [[General Problem Solver]]) and his \"thinking out loud\" method for [[protocol analysis]]. In addition, [[Karl Popper]] studied psychology under B\u00fchler and Selz, and appears to have brought some of their influence, unattributed, to his philosophy of science.<ref>Ter Hark, 2004</ref>\n\n===Gestalt psychology===\nWhereas the W\u00fcrzburgers debated with Wundt mainly on matters of method, another German movement, centered in Berlin, took issue with the widespread assumption that the aim of psychology should be to break consciousness down into putative basic elements. Instead, they argued that the psychological \"whole\" has priority and that the \"parts\" are defined by the structure of the whole, rather than vice versa. Thus, the school was named ''[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]]'', a German term meaning approximately \"form\" or \"configuration.\" It was led by [[Max Wertheimer]] (1880\u20131943), [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] (1887\u20131967), and [[Kurt Koffka]] (1886\u20131941). Wertheimer had been a student of Austrian philosopher, [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (1859\u20131932), who claimed that in addition to the sensory elements of a perceived object, there is an extra element which, though in some sense derived from the organization of the standard sensory elements, is also to be regarded as being an element in its own right. He called this extra element ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' or \"form-quality.\" For instance, when one hears a melody, one hears the notes plus something in addition to them which binds them together into a tune&nbsp;\u2013 the ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t''. It is the presence of this ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' which, according to Von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, but still retain its identity. Wertheimer took the more radical line that \"what is given me by the melody does not arise ... as a secondary process from the sum of the pieces as such. Instead, what takes place in each single part already depends upon what the whole is\", (1925/1938). In other words, one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly in vision, one sees the form of the circle first&nbsp;\u2013 it is given \"im-mediately\" (i.e. its apprehension is not mediated by a process of part-summation). Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.\n\n''Gestalt-Theorie'' ([[Gestalt psychology]]) was officially initiated in 1912 in an article by Wertheimer on the phi-phenomenon; a perceptual illusion in which two stationary but alternately flashing lights appear to be a single light moving from one location to another. Contrary to popular opinion, his primary target was not behaviorism, as it was not yet a force in psychology. The aim of his criticism was, rather, the atomistic psychologies of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920), and other European psychologists of the time.\n\nThe two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiment were K\u00f6hler and Koffka. K\u00f6hler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist [[Max Planck]] (1858\u20131947), but had taken his degree in psychology under [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848\u20131936). Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917 K\u00f6hler (1917/1925) published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. K\u00f6hler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by \"sudden insight\" into the \"structure\" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that [[Ivan Pavlov]] (1849\u20131936) and [[Edward Lee Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949) had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.\n\nThe terms \"structure\" and \"organization\" were focal for the Gestalt psychologists. Stimuli were said to have a certain structure, to be organized in a certain way, and that it is to this structural organization, rather than to individual sensory elements, that the organism responds. When an animal is conditioned, it does not simply respond to the absolute properties of a stimulus, but to its properties relative to its surroundings. To use a favorite example of K\u00f6hler's, if conditioned to respond in a certain way to the lighter of two gray cards, the animal generalizes the relation between the two stimuli rather than the absolute properties of the conditioned stimulus: it will respond to the lighter of two cards in subsequent trials even if the darker card in the test trial is of the same intensity as the lighter one in the original training trials.\n\nIn 1921 Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, ''Growth of the Mind''. With the help of American psychologist [[Robert Morris Ogden|Robert Ogden]], Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''. It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at [[Smith College]] in 1927. In 1935 Koffka published his ''Principles of Gestalt Psychology''. This textbook laid out the ''Gestalt'' vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the ''Gestalt''ists was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to swallow not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other \"scientific categories\": questions of order and questions of ''Sinn'', a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.\n\nHaving survived the onslaught of the Nazis up to the mid-1930s,<ref>see Henle, 1978</ref> all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935.<ref>Henle, 1984</ref> K\u00f6hler published another book, ''Dynamics in Psychology'', in 1940 but thereafter the ''Gestalt'' movement suffered a series of setbacks. Koffka died in 1941 and Wertheimer in 1943. Wertheimer's long-awaited book on mathematical problem-solving, ''Productive Thinking,'' was published posthumously in 1945 but K\u00f6hler was now left to guide the movement without his two long-time colleagues.<ref>For more on the history of ''Gestalt'' psychology, see Ash, 1995</ref>\n\n==Emergence of behaviorism in America==\n{{Main|Behaviorism}}\n\nAs a result of the conjunction of a number of events in the early 20th century, behaviorism gradually emerged as the dominant school in American psychology. First among these was the increasing skepticism with which many viewed the concept of consciousness: although still considered to be the essential element separating psychology from physiology, its subjective nature and the unreliable introspective method it seemed to require, troubled many. [[William James]]' 1904 ''Journal of Philosophy....'' article \"Does Consciousness Exist?\", laid out the worries explicitly.\n\nSecond was the gradual rise of a rigorous animal psychology. In addition to [[Edward Lee Thorndike]]'s work with cats in puzzle boxes in 1898, the start of research in which rats learn to navigate mazes was begun by [[Willard Small]] (1900, 1901 in ''American Journal of Psychology''). [[Robert M. Yerkes]]'s 1905 ''Journal of Philosophy...'' article \"Animal Psychology and the Criteria of the Psychic\" raised the general question of when one is entitled to attribute consciousness to an organism. The following few years saw the emergence of [[John Broadus Watson]] (1878\u20131959) as a major player, publishing his dissertation on the relation between neurological development and learning in the white rat (1907, ''Psychological Review Monograph Supplement''; Carr & Watson, 1908, ''J. Comparative Neurology & Psychology''). Another important rat study was published by [[Henry H. Donaldson]] (1908, ''J. Comparative Neurology & Psychology''). The year 1909 saw the first English-language account of [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s studies of conditioning in dogs (Yerkes & Morgulis, 1909, ''Psychological Bulletin'').\n\nA third factor was the rise of Watson to a position of significant power within the psychological community. In 1908, Watson was offered a junior position at Johns Hopkins by [[James Mark Baldwin]]. In addition to heading the Johns Hopkins department, Baldwin was the editor of the influential journals, ''[[Psychological Review]]'' and ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''. Only months after Watson's arrival, Baldwin was forced to resign his professorship due to scandal. Watson was suddenly made head of the department and editor of Baldwin's journals. He resolved to use these powerful tools to revolutionize psychology in the image of his own research. In 1913 he published in ''Psychological Review'' the article that is often called the \"manifesto\" of the behaviorist movement, \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It.\" There he argued that psychology \"is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science\", \"introspection forms no essential part of its methods...\" and \"The behaviorist... recognizes no dividing line between man and brute\". The following year, 1914, his first textbook, ''Behavior'' went to press. Although behaviorism took some time to be accepted as a comprehensive approach (see Samelson, 1981), (in no small part because of the intervention of World War I), by the 1920s Watson's revolution was well underway. The central tenet of early behaviorism was that psychology should be a science of behavior, not of the mind, and rejected internal mental states such as beliefs, desires, or goals. Watson himself, however, was forced out of Johns Hopkins by scandal in 1920. Although he continued to publish during the 1920s, he eventually moved on to a career in advertising (see Coon, 1994).\n\nAmong the behaviorists who continued on, there were a number of disagreements about the best way to proceed. Neo-behaviorists such as  [[Edward C. Tolman]], [[Edwin Guthrie]], [[Clark L. Hull]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] debated issues such as (1) whether to reformulate the traditional psychological vocabulary in behavioral terms or discard it in favor of a wholly new scheme, (2) whether learning takes place all at once or gradually, (3) whether biological drives should be included in the new science in order to provide a \"motivation\" for behavior, and (4) to what degree ''any'' theoretical framework is required over and above the measured effects of reinforcement and punishment on learning. By the late 1950s, Skinner's formulation had become dominant, and it remains a part of the modern discipline under the rubric of Behavior Analysis. Its application (Applied Behavior Analysis) has become one of the most useful fields of psychology.\n\nBehaviorism was the ascendant experimental model for research in psychology for much of the 20th century, largely due to the creation and successful application (not least of which in advertising) of conditioning theories as scientific models of human behaviour.\n\n==Second generation francophone==\n\n===Genevan School<!--'Genevan School' redirects here-->===\nIn 1918, [[Jean Piaget]] (1896\u20131980) turned away from his early training in [[natural history]] and began post-doctoral work in [[psychoanalysis]] in Zurich. In 1919, he moved to Paris to work at the Binet-Simon Lab. However, Binet had died in 1911 and Simon lived and worked in Rouen. His supervision therefore came (indirectly) from [[Pierre Janet]], Binet's old rival and a professor at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]].\n\nThe job in Paris was relatively simple: to use the statistical techniques he had learned as a natural historian, studying molluscs, to standardize [[Cyril Burt]]'s intelligence test for use with French children.  Yet without direct supervision, he soon found a remedy to this boring work: exploring why children made the mistakes they did.  Applying his early training in psychoanalytic interviewing, Piaget began to intervene directly with the children: \"Why did you do that?\" (etc.)  It was from this that the ideas formalized in his later [[stage theory]] first emerged.\n\nIn 1921, Piaget moved to Geneva to work with [[\u00c9douard Clapar\u00e8de]] at the [[Rousseau Institute]]. They formed what is now known as the '''Genevan School'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.\n\nIn 1936, Piaget received his first honorary doctorate from Harvard.\n\nIn 1955, the International Center for Genetic Epistemology was founded: an interdisciplinary collaboration of theoreticians and scientists, devoted to the study of topics related to Piaget's theory.\n\nIn 1969, Piaget received the \"distinguished scientific contributions\" award from the [[American Psychological Association]].\n\n== Soviet Marxist Psychology ==\n\nIn the early twentieth century, [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s behavioral and conditioning experiments became the most internationally recognized Russian achievements. With the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922, [[Marxism]] was introduced as an overall philosophical and methodological framework in scientific research. In 1920s, state ideology promoted a tendency to the psychology of [[Vladimir Bekhterev|Bekhterev]]'s [[Reflexology|reflexologist]] reductionism in its Marxist interpretation and to [[historical materialism]], while [[Idealism|idealistic]] philosophers and psychologists were harshly criticized. Another variation of Marxist version of psychology that got popularity mostly in Moscow and centered in the local Institute of Psychology was Konstantin Kornilov's (the Director of this Institute) reactology that became the main view, besides a small group of the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle|Vygotsky-Luria Circle]] that, besides its namesakes [[Lev Vygotsky]], and [[Alexander Luria]], included [[Bluma Zeigarnik]], [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Alexei Leontiev]] and others, and in 1920s embraced a deterministic \"instrumental psychology\" version of [[Cultural-historical psychology]]. Due to Soviet censorship and primarily Vygotsky's failed attempt at building consistent psychological theory of consciousness many works by Vygotsky were not published chronologically. \n\nA few attempts were made in 1920s at formulating the core of theoretical framework of the \"genuinely Marxist\" psychology, but all these failed and were characterized in early 1930s as either right- or left-wing deviations of reductionist \"mechanicism\" or \"menshevising idealism\". It was [[Sergei Rubinstein]] in mid 1930s, who formulated the key principles, on which the entire Soviet variation of Marxist psychology would be based, and, thus become the genuine pioneer and the founder of this psychological discipline in the Marxist disguise in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn late 1940s-early 1950s, [[Lysenkoism]] somewhat affected Russian psychology, yet gave it a considerable impulse for a reaction and unification that resulted in institutional and disciplinary integration of psychological community in the postwar Soviet Union.\n\n==Cognitivism==\n{{Main|Cognitive Psychology|Cognitive Science|Cognitive revolution}}\n\n[[Noam Chomsky]]'s (1957) review of Skinner's book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' (that aimed to explain [[language acquisition]] in a behaviorist framework) is considered one of the major theoretical challenges to the type of radical (as in 'root') behaviorism that Skinner taught. Chomsky claimed that language could not be learned solely from the sort of operant conditioning that Skinner postulated. Chomsky's argument was that people could produce an infinite variety of sentences unique in structure and meaning and that these could not possibly be generated solely through experience of natural language. As an alternative, he concluded that there must be internal mental structures&nbsp;\u2013 states of mind of the sort that behaviorism rejected as illusory. The issue is not whether mental activities exist; it is whether they can be shown to be the causes of behavior.  Similarly, work by [[Albert Bandura]] showed that children could [[social learning theory|learn by social observation]], without any change in overt behaviour, and so must (according to him) be accounted for by internal representations.\n\nThe rise of computer technology also promoted the metaphor of mental function as [[information processing]]. This, combined with a scientific approach to studying the mind, as well as a belief in internal mental states, led to the rise of [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] as the dominant model of the mind.\n\nLinks between [[brain]] and [[nervous system]] function were also becoming common, partly due to the experimental work of people like [[Charles Sherrington]] and [[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]], and partly due to studies of people with [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]] (see [[cognitive neuropsychology]]). With the development of technologies for accurately measuring brain function, [[neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] have become some of the most active areas in contemporary psychology.\n\nWith the increasing involvement of other disciplines (such as [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], and [[neuroscience]]) in the quest to understand the mind, the umbrella discipline of [[cognitive science]] has been created as a means of focusing such efforts in a constructive way.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Behavioral neuroscience#History|History of behavioral neuroscience]]\n*[[Clinical psychology#History|History of clinical psychology]]\n*[[Cognitive neuroscience#Historical origins|History of cognitive neuroscience]]\n*[[Cognitive science#History|History of cognitive science]]\n*[[History of evolutionary psychology]]\n*[[Experimental psychology#History|History of experimental psychology]]\n*[[History of hypnosis]]\n*[[History of mental disorders]]\n*[[History of neurology]]\n*[[Neuropsychology#History|History of neuropsychology]]\n*[[Neurophysiology#History|History of neurophysiology]]\n*[[History of psychiatry]]\n*[[History of psychotherapy]]\n*[[History of sociology]]\n*[[History of science]]\n*[[Applied psychology]]\n*[[Basic science (psychology)]]\n*[[Psychophysics]]\n*[[Psychology of art]]\n*[[Psychology of religion]]\n*[[Kurt Danziger]]\n*[[Timeline of psychology]]\n*[[Archives of the History of American Psychology]]\n*[[List of important publications in psychology]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*Annas, J.

Whiteout's principal recordings were the albums ''[[Bite It]]'' (1995) and ''[[Big Wow (album)|Big Wow]]'' (1998).

The singles \"Detroit\" and \"Jackie's Racing\" followed and the group began to achieve a growing reputation in [[Japan]].\n\nOn 11 October 1994 Whiteout performed at [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Peel Sessions#Peel sessions|Peel Sessions]]''. They played four songs: \"Everyday\", \"Time and Again\", \"Get Me Through\", and \"Higher\".\n\nAndrew Caldwell left the group in 1996, after ''Bite It'' (replaced briefly by Warren McIntyre) and by the time the (now three piece of Carroll, Lindsay & McDermott) band reemerged with their second album \"Big Wow\" in 1998 (The last track of which included the refrain \"We'll all go down in history\") it was to a largely dismissive reception from the music media. Original drummer Mark Fairhurst ('Fudge') had replaced McDermott on drums in 1997, appearing on two of \"Big Wow\"'s tracks, but Whiteout split soon after, around 1999, shortly after becoming a 4-piece again with Eric Russell on keys.\n\nThe only recorded material since has come from Eric Lindsay's outfit 'Eli', and the album 'Dreams Are The Foundations of Reality' (2009), though there have been brief outings by combinations of Lindsay, Carroll and Russell since the split in various acoustic and electric incarnations.

Staying connected with family and friends is also a must in the families philosophy, as it develops mental and spiritual strength among practitioners. Jiu Jitsu to the Gracie's is a way of life, that had been established by founders of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ)]], Grand Masters Carlos and H\u00e9lio Gracie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://graciebarracarlsbad.com/history/|title=History|website=Carlsbad Jiu Jitsu - Gracie Barra|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n== Ultimate Fighting Championship  ==\nAfter gaining popularity in Brazil, [[Rorion Gracie]] moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s in the hopes of expanding [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ)]] to America. The Gracie family promoted their style of fighting through popular contests in Brazil known as [[Vale tudo|\"Vale Tudo\"]], ever since the early 1920s. Rorion Gracie, the eldest son of H\u00e9lio Gracie was one of the creators of a similar event as Vale Tudo in America, in which different martial arts styles are tested against each other. This event is called the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). The UFC was seen as an event for fighters to promote their fighting style ands show the world what martial art is truly dominant. The first UFC event was in the year 1993, and Rorion's younger brother [[Royce Gracie]] took part. Royce had been much smaller than all the other competitors, but despite his frame he was able to dominate all four fights that night. Royce's victorious performance then attracted many martial artists, especially in America, and eventually the whole world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jiujitsubrotherhood.com/starting-brazilian-jiu-jitsu/a-brief-history-of-jiu-jitsu/|title=A Brief History of Jiu-Jitsu|last=Gregoriades|first=Nic|website=Jiu-Jitsu Brotherhood - Grappling & Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Videos and Techniques|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n\n== The Gracie Triangle ==\nThe Gracie triangle is considered to be the symbol of Jiu-Jitsu, and can be traced back to the very first [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ)]] academies which were operated by [[Carlos Gracie|Carlos]] and [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] Gracie. The triangle symbol came into existence when the two brothers Carlos and H\u00e9lio were photographed demonstrating a specific technique. The way their bodies were shaped during the demonstration formed a perfect triangle. This same photograph was later used as the cover of the very first book written by Carlos Gracie, and featured detailed information about fundamental attacks and defenses in BJJ. The triangle then became much more than just a symbol of the Gracie family. Each side of the triangle symbolized an element of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Those elements are mind, body, and spirit, the components that a BJJ athlete should adopt. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-triangle-as-a-symbol-of-jiu-jitsu/|title=The Origin Of The Triangle As A Symbol Of Jiu-Jitsu|last=BJJEE|date=2015-12-03|website=Bjj Eastern Europe|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Family members==\n\n===Family tree===\n{{Expand-section|1=further entries and formatting for the tree|date=February 2016}}\n<!--\nhttp://www.gracieacademy.com/familytree.asp\ncan be used for reference.

({{IPA-pt|\u02c8\u0261\u027eejsi|lang}}) is a prominent [[martial arts]] family from [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Brazil]], known for their development & modification of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] (BJJ). They have been successful in combat sport competitions for over 80 years representing their style (Gracie Jiu-Jitsu) including [[mixed martial arts]], [[vale tudo]] and [[submission wrestling]] events and are the co creators of the         [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) along with promotor [[Art Davie]].\n\nAs a family, they created and uphold the [[Gracie challenge]], a martial arts challenge which promotes their style of modern Brazilian jiu-jitsu up against other martial art styles.

Staying connected with family and friends is also a must in the families philosophy, as it develops mental and spiritual strength among practitioners. Jiu Jitsu to the Gracie's is a way of life, that had been established by founders of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ)]], Grand Masters Carlos and H\u00e9lio Gracie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://graciebarracarlsbad.com/history/|title=History|website=Carlsbad Jiu Jitsu - Gracie Barra|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n== Ultimate Fighting Championship  ==\nAfter gaining popularity in Brazil, [[Rorion Gracie]] moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990's in the hopes of expanding [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ)]] to America. The Gracie family promoted their style of fighting through popular contests in Brazil known as [[Vale tudo|\"Vale Tudo\"]], ever since the early 1920's. Rorion Gracie, the eldest son of H\u00e9lio Gracie was one of the creators of a similar event as Vale Tudo in America, in which different martial arts styles are tested against each other. This event is called the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). The UFC was seen as an event for fighters to promote their fighting style ands show the world what martial art is truly dominant. The first UFC event was in the year 1993, and Rorion's younger brother [[Royce Gracie]] took part. Royce had been much smaller than all the other competitors, but despite his frame he was able to dominate all four fights that night. Royce's victorious performance then attracted many martial artists, especially in America, and eventually the whole world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jiujitsubrotherhood.com/starting-brazilian-jiu-jitsu/a-brief-history-of-jiu-jitsu/|title=A Brief History of Jiu-Jitsu|last=Gregoriades|first=Nic|website=Jiu-Jitsu Brotherhood - Grappling & Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Videos and Techniques|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n\n== The Gracie Triangle ==\nThe Gracie triangle is considered to be the symbol of Jiu-Jitsu, and can be traced back to the very first [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ)]] academies which were operated by [[Carlos Gracie|Carlos]] and [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] Gracie. The triangle symbol came into existence when the two brothers Carlos and H\u00e9lio were photographed demonstrating a specific technique. The way their bodies were shaped during the demonstration formed a perfect triangle. This same photograph was later used as the cover of the very first book written by Carlos Gracie, and featured detailed information about fundamental attacks and defenses in BJJ. The triangle then became much more than just a symbol of the Gracie family. Each side of the triangle symbolized an element of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Those elements are mind, body, and spirit, the components that a BJJ athlete should adopt. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-triangle-as-a-symbol-of-jiu-jitsu/|title=The Origin Of The Triangle As A Symbol Of Jiu-Jitsu|last=BJJEE|date=2015-12-03|website=Bjj Eastern Europe|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Family members==\n\n===Family tree===\n{{Expand-section|1=further entries and formatting for the tree|date=February 2016}}\n<!--\nhttp://www.gracieacademy.com/familytree.asp\ncan be used for reference.

{"title_page": "10-in-1 food parcel", "text_new": "The '''10-in-1 food parcel''', commonly known as the '''10-in-1 ration''', was a field ration prepared for soldiers of the [[United States Army]], intended to provide one meal for 10 men. \n\n==Development==\nAlthough the possibility of packing the [[B ration]] in units of ten was suggested early in the [[Second World War]], progress on such an arrangement did not begin until 1943 when the [[Mountain ration]], [[Jungle ration]], and [[5-in-1 ration|5-in-1 rations]] were discontinued. The success of the British \"Composite 14-in-1 ration\" during the North African campaign in 1942 and the movement to classify field rations into four categories added incentive for development of the 10-in-1 ration.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Koehler, Franz A., ''Special Rations for the Armed Forces: Army Operational Rations - A Historical Background'', QMC Historical Studies, Historical Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington, D.C. (1958)</ref>  A guide to its rapid development was furnished in the following 1943 definition:\n<blockquote>\n\"A small-group field ration [shall be] composed of components of the standard field ration type B (modified to reduce bulk and weight) packed in basic packages of five complete rations each. . . . The inner and outer packages are to be proof against water, vapor, moisture, and chemical agents. They are to be of such shape and dimensions as to be suitable for either animal-pack or man-carry, and sufficiently sturdy as to material and construction to withstand normal handling and transportation in motor vehicles, on pack animals or by individual portage.\"<ref name=\"multiref1\"/></blockquote>\n\nSpecification requirements were quickly published, and the ration was standardized as the replacement for other group rations such as the [[5-in-1 ration]]. Although superseding the 5-in-1, the 10-in-1 was essentially two 5-in-1s packed in one unit. Within such a combination, a greater variety of contents was possible; the number of \"menus\" was increased to five, compared to the three-menu arrangement of the 5-in-1. In ensuing war years, several revisions were made to the original specification, but their intended purpose of providing one day's food for ten men, remained unaltered. Within the daily plan, complete group meals were specified for breakfast and supper while a partial dinner unit was provided for the luncheon meal.<ref name=\"multiref1\"/> \n\nA typical menu included such canned items as butter-substitute spread, soluble coffee, pudding, meat units, jam, evaporated milk, and vegetables as well as biscuits, cereal, beverages, candy, salt, and sugar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Feiler |first1=Bruce |title=The Care-Package Wars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/fashion/the-care-package-wars.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 January 2019 |date=19 July 2013}}</ref> Accessory items were can opener, toilet paper, soap, towels, and water-purification ([[Halazone]]) tablets. The partial dinner unit was enclosed in a cellophane bag-in-carton for easy distribution to the individual soldier for his noontime meal. Within the unit were biscuits, a confection, beverage powder, sugar, gum, and a can opener. These items were provided on the theory that an individual \"snack\" was sufficient for midday meals, when there would be neither time nor opportunity to prepare the ration for group feeding.<ref name=\"multiref1\"/>\n\n==Revision==\nThe similarity of the partial unit to the [[K ration]] was a chief reason for the proposed revision of the 10-in-1 in 1945.  The revised 10-in-1 was intended for use during and after the [[Operation Downfall|1945 planned attack on Japan]] during [[World War II]].  It was planned to eliminate the unit ration concept, and to assemble the entire ration on the basis of three group meals rather than two group meals and one individual luncheon package. Although it was recognized that the overall weight of the ration would be increased thereby, it was felt that the added weight would be offset by the increased acceptability and nutritional value which a greater variety of components would provide. The end of the war prevented realization of such a plan in the 10-in-1, leaving a surplus of food.

The success of the British \"Composite 14-in-1 ration\" during the North African campaign in 1942 and the movement to classify field rations into four categories added incentive for development of the 10-in-1 ration.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Koehler, Franz A., ''Special Rations for the Armed Forces: Army Operational Rations - A Historical Background'', QMC Historical Studies, Historical Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington, D.C. (1958)</ref>  A guide to its rapid development was furnished in the following 1943 definition:\n<blockquote>\n\"A small-group field ration [shall be] composed of components of the standard field ration type B (modified to reduce bulk and weight) packed in basic packages of five complete rations each. . . . The inner and outer packages are to be proof against water, vapor, moisture, and chemical agents. They are to be of such shape and dimensions as to be suitable for either animal-pack or man-carry, and sufficiently sturdy as to material and construction to withstand normal handling and transportation in motor vehicles, on pack animals or by individual portage.\"<ref name=\"multiref1\"/></blockquote>\n\nSpecification requirements were quickly published, and the ration was standardized as the replacement for other group rations such as the [[5-in-1 ration]]. Although superseding the 5-in-1, the 10-in-1 was essentially two 5-in-1s packed in one unit. Within such a combination, a greater variety of contents was possible; the number of \"menus\" was increased to five, compared to the three-menu arrangement of the 5-in-1. In ensuing war years, several revisions were made to the original specification, but their intended purpose of providing one day's food for ten men, remained unaltered. Within the daily plan, complete group meals were specified for breakfast and supper while a partial dinner unit was provided for the luncheon meal.<ref name=\"multiref1\"/> \n\nA typical menu included such canned items as butter-substitute spread, soluble coffee, pudding, meat units, jam, evaporated milk, and vegetables as well as biscuits, cereal, beverages, candy, salt, and sugar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Feiler |first1=Bruce |title=The Care-Package Wars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/fashion/the-care-package-wars.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 January 2019 |date=19 July 2013}}</ref> Accessory items were can opener, toilet paper, soap, towels, and water-purification ([[Halazone]]) tablets. The partial dinner unit was enclosed in a cellophane bag-in-carton for easy distribution to the individual soldier for his noontime meal. Within the unit were biscuits, a confection, beverage powder, sugar, gum, and a can opener. These items were provided on the theory that an individual \"snack\" was sufficient for midday meals, when there would be neither time nor opportunity to prepare the ration for group feeding.<ref name=\"multiref1\"/>\n\n==Revision==\nThe similarity of the partial unit to the [[K ration]] was a chief reason for the proposed revision of the 10-in-1 in 1945.  The revised 10-in-1 was intended for use during and after the [[Operation Downfall|1945 planned attack on Japan]] during [[World War II]].  It was planned to eliminate the unit ration concept, and to assemble the entire ration on the basis of three group meals rather than two group meals and one individual luncheon package. Although it was recognized that the overall weight of the ration would be increased thereby, it was felt that the added weight would be offset by the increased acceptability and nutritional value which a greater variety of components would provide. The end of the war prevented realization of such a plan in the 10-in-1, leaving a surplus of food.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli).
