It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 5, 2003.\n\nIn the episode, the senior citizens of South Park ran over more than a few farmers' markets, and the residents feel that they are no longer safe in the streets. With their well being at stake, the boys decide to take action against the older generation. Unwilling to surrender their driver's licenses, the elderly fight back. Soon, the [[AARP]] is involved.\n\nThe episode, and its name, parody the 1984 film ''[[Red Dawn]]''.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the South Park Farmers' Market, [[List of South Park characters#Other characters|Priest Maxi]] holds a memorial service for nine people who died the previous day when they were run over by senior citizens. The proceedings are marred by another unfortunate senior related driving incident. The news covers the recent rash of senior related driving tragedies, mentioning the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] was planning to suspend driver's licences from senior citizens over 70. Grandpa Marsh and the other seniors have a meeting at the community center to decide what to do, struggling to remember what they were there for in the first\n\n==Cultural references==\nDuring the opening scene Eric responds to Kyle, \"Yeah, but like eight of them were hippies; mostly hippies go to Farmers' markets. Mostly.\" This is a reference to Carrie Henn's character 'Newt' and her line in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986): \"We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly.\"\n\nThe episode, according to the creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, was partially inspired by the [[Santa Monica Farmers Market crash|case of George Russell Weller]], an elderly man who in 2003 accidentally killed 10 people at a Santa Monica farmers market by driving through the crowd. They stated that while it was a terrible incident, they didn't agree with elderly drivers losing their licenses and suggested they go through retesting.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2006 |title=South Park: The Complete Seventh Season: \"Grey Dawn\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD Disc|url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/evzbo3/creator-commentary-grey-dawn|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nOlder drivers in the episode are depicted similar to zombies from the film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]].''<ref>[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/73-year-old-man-driving-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-road-reminds-us-of-south-park-video-88981.html 73-Year old Man Driving on the Wrong Side of the Road Reminds Us of South Park]</ref>\n\nThe restaurant that all the old people go to was originally going to be a [[Furr's|Furr's Cafeteria]], but the creators liked how Country Kitchen Buffet sounded.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nWhen Randy and the kids are running up the stairs during hiding, a man's corpse swings from a doorway, this is a reference to the slasher flick ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''.\n\n==Home release==\n\"Grey Dawn\", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''The Complete Seventh Season,'' were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 21, 2006.

Soon, the [[AARP]] is involved.\n\nThe episode, and its name, parody the 1984 film ''[[Red Dawn]]''.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the South Park Farmers' Market, [[List of South Park characters#Other characters|Priest Maxi]] holds a memorial service for nine people who died the previous day when they were run over by senior citizens. The proceedings are marred by another unfortunate senior related driving incident. The news covers the recent rash of senior related driving tragedies, mentioning the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] was planning to suspend driver's licences from senior citizens over 70. Grandpa Marsh and the other seniors have a meeting at the community center to decide what to do, struggling to remember what they were there for in the first place. When the meeting is over, all the seniors are driving on the road at the same time. Randy manages to save the boys, who were playing street hockey, and they flee from the many cars recklessly wandering the streets. They hide in an old house.\n\nBecause of the incidents, the state of [[Colorado]] demands all seniors turn in their driver's licenses, much to the seniors' anger. Grandpa Marsh drives anyways to pick up his new Hover Round and makes the boys accompany him, with the boys theorizing they will be safer if they are ''in'' the car. After Marsh causes other cars to swerve off the road and crash, [[List of South Park characters#Other characters|Officer Barbrady]] pulls the car over and takes Grandpa Marsh to jail. There, Grandpa Marsh calls the [[AARP]] to send their aid. During a class session later on, [[Mr. Garrison]] notices a large number of old people dropping out of the sky. The AARP has [[airdrop]]ped reinforcements and they begin taking hostages, liberating their colleagues from the retirement home and begin to take over the town.\n\nThe military arrives and the seniors list their demands: their driver's licenses, more [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and keeping kids from skateboarding on the sidewalk. The AARP leader realizes they could even take over the whole country, and demonstrates that they are willing to kill hostages and soldiers to get their demands, but Marvin feels this goes too far beyond their original demands. The children find their parents under lockup. Randy tells the boys that the seniors were able to organize so effectively because they get up earlier than everyone else, representing an advantage over their children, who prefer to sleep late. Randy then realizes that the children get up almost as early as the seniors, and are the only hope for getting the town back. Randy tells the boys to hide in the woods and find a way to fight, shouting through the fence  \"Avenge me!\"\n\nAfter fleeing, the boys resolve to board up the Country Kitchen Buffet restaurant in order to cut the seniors off from their food supply. The AARP plans are thwarted when they start collapsing from hunger outside of the locked Country Kitchen Buffet. The military takes the town back and arrests the AARP. Marvin is turned back over to his family, but when Randy admonishes him for his actions, Stan rebukes Randy, telling him that the condescending manner in which he treated Grandpa like a child is one of the main causes that led to the crisis in the first place. Stan also tells his grandfather that he should be proud to be a senior, but he should realize that he is a killing machine when he is driving, an assessment that Grandpa accepts. As the reconciled family goes home, Stan mutters, \"Dude, I hate my family.\"\n\n==Cultural references==\nDuring the opening scene Eric responds to Kyle, \"Yeah, but like eight of them were hippies; mostly hippies go to Farmers' markets. Mostly.\" This is a reference to Carrie Henn's character 'Newt' and her line in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986): \"We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly.\"\n\nThe episode, according to the creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, was partially inspired by the [[Santa Monica Farmers Market crash|case of George Russell Weller]], an elderly man who in 2003 accidentally killed 10 people at a Santa Monica farmers market by driving through the crowd. They stated that while it was a terrible incident, they didn't agree with elderly drivers losing their licenses and suggested they go through retesting.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2006 |title=South Park: The Complete Seventh Season: \"Grey Dawn\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD Disc|url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/evzbo3/creator-commentary-grey-dawn|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nOlder drivers in the episode are depicted similar to zombies from the film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]].''<ref>[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/73-year-old-man-driving-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-road-reminds-us-of-south-park-video-88981.html 73-Year old Man Driving on the Wrong Side of the Road Reminds Us of South Park]</ref>\n\nThe restaurant that all the old people go to was originally going to be a [[Furr's|Furr's Cafeteria]], but the creators liked how Country Kitchen Buffet sounded.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nWhen Randy and the kids are running up the stairs during hiding, a man's corpse swings from a doorway, this is a reference to the slasher flick ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''.\n\n==Home release==\n\"Grey Dawn\", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''The Complete Seventh Season,'' were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 21, 2006.

She first appeared in the [[Pilot (Gilmore Girls)|pilot episode]] of the series on October 5, 2000 and appeared in every episode until the [[Bon Voyage (Gilmore Girls)|series finale]] on May 15, 2007. Bledel's performance throughout the series' run earned her a [[Young Artist Awards|Young Artist Award]], a Family Television Award and two [[Teen Choice Awards]]. She also received nominations for an [[ALMA Award]], a [[Satellite Award]], and a [[Saturn Award]].\n\n==Background==\nRory is the only daughter of [[Lorelai Gilmore]], and the first-born daughter of [[Christopher Hayden]]. She was born October 8, 1984 in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], at 4:03am. Every year at that exact time, Lorelai wakes Rory up to tell her the story of her birth. Because Lorelai became pregnant with Rory when she was only sixteen, the two are more like friends than mother and daughter. Rory shares her mother's taste in junk food, coffee, movies, music, and much more. She spent her first months living with her mother at her grandparent's mansion until her mother ran away. The rest of her childhood she spent in the Independence Inn in [[Stars Hollow]] where her mother worked originally as a maid. The two lived in the [[garden shed|potting shed]] behind the inn where Jackson's cousin Rune lived in later seasons. Eventually, Lorelai was able to buy a nice house where Rory spent her adolescent years. Rory did not have much contact with her grandparents until she started to attend Chilton, which Lorelai preferred. My name is Ciara\n\n==Storylines==\nRory dreams of studying at [[Harvard University]] and gets accepted into the prestigious and fictional Chilton Academy, where she stays for her sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. To pay tuition, Lorelai asks for the money from her estranged wealthy parents, [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]]. They agree to pay for Rory's education on the condition that the two come to their house every Friday night for dinner. Before leaving Stars Hollow High School, Rory meets [[Dean Forester]] ([[Jared Padalecki]]). Rory almost convinced herself not to go to Chilton because of not wanting to leave Dean, but after learning of the huge sacrifices her mother made, she decides to go to Chilton. Rory and Dean date for two seasons, only breaking up once when Dean told Rory he loved her on their 3-month anniversary, and she replied that she would have to think about it, but they eventually reconcile. Dean escorts Rory when she is [[Debutante|presented to society]] at a [[debutante ball]] hosted by her grandmother's chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. During her time at Chilton, Rory becomes engaged in a feud with close academic rival, [[Paris Geller]]. Though [[Rory Gilmore and Paris Geller|the two later become friends]], the rivalry continues into their university studies. Rory reluctantly runs for student government with Paris and wins, and writes for the Chilton paper, ''The Franklin''.\n\nWhen she meets Jess Mariano ([[Milo Ventimiglia]]), Rory feels an immediate attraction. They become friends first, but start to date after Dean breaks up with Rory because he sees that Rory likes Jess. However, various problems make their relationship difficult. After Jess skips school to go to work at [[Walmart]], causing him to be unable to graduate or to take Rory to Prom, Jess decides to leave to go to [[California]] to see his estranged father, effectively breaking up with Rory. Jess does not tell Rory he is leaving, but later calls and does not say anything on the phone, until Rory caught on that it was him and revealed that she might have loved him but would just have to get over it. Later that year, still upset, Jess returns and tells Rory that he loves her and then leaves again.\n\nAfter graduating Chilton as [[valedictorian]] and with a 4.2 [[GPA]], Rory goes on to attend [[Yale University]], her grandfather's alma mater, in season four, although her entire life she had wanted to go to Harvard, having decided that the benefits of Yale outweighed her dream of studying at Harvard. During her freshman year, Rory resides at [[Durfee Hall]] and shares a dorm room with Tana, Janet, and fellow Chilton alumna [[Paris Geller]]. She moves to [[Branford College]], the same [[Residential colleges of Yale University|residential college]] that her grandfather, Richard Gilmore, lived in,<ref name=\"writteninthestars\">\"[[Gilmore Girls Season 5|Written in the Stars]]\"</ref> at the beginning of her sophomore year. There she shares a dorm room with Paris. At Yale, Rory majors in English and pursues her interest in journalism; she wants to be a foreign correspondent and her role-model is [[Christiane Amanpour]]. She writes for the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' and is its editor towards the end of her studies.\n\nWhile at Yale, Rory reconnects with Dean, who married Lindsay (a fellow school mate), straight after high school, but it is soon clear that he impulsively did it as a [[Rebound (dating)|rebound]] from Rory. During the same period, Jess shows up at Yale to see Rory unexpectedly, and asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. Dean gets jealous but he and Rory grow closer and have an affair, during which Rory loses her [[virginity]]. Lorelai is angry and disappointed in Rory, who decides to leave for Europe with her grandmother for the summer to avoid conflicts. Shortly after, Dean separates from Lindsay and the two continue seeing each other.\n\nMeanwhile, Rory makes the acquaintance of the heir to the Huntzberger Publishing Company, [[Logan Huntzberger]] ([[Matt Czuchry]]). She soon becomes interested in him and after Dean breaks up with her (she was detained at a party arranged by her grandparents to introduce her to the wealthy and eligible sons of their Yale alumni friends, including Logan), she makes the first move at her grandparents' [[Wedding Bell Blues (Gilmore Girls)|vow-renewal]]. Their relationship begins casually as a \"no strings attached\" affair, because Logan makes it clear that he does not want to commit to a relationship. However, as time passes, Rory grows dissatisfied with their open relationship, and after a day of drunken introspection, she suggests they should end their sexual relationship and be friends because she is \"a girlfriend kind of girl.\" Logan interprets this as an ultimatum and unexpectedly agrees to date her exclusively. At her first time to dinner at Logan\u2019s family home, the Huntzbergers reject Rory as a fit girlfriend for their son because of her aspirations to work and her background. However, Logan affirms his commitment to their relationship, although the pressure exerted by the Huntzbergers continues to dog the couple.\n\nTo make amends, Logan's father, Mitchum Huntzberger gives Rory an [[internship]] at one of his newspapers, the ''Stamford Eagle Gazette''. At the end of her internship, Mitchum tells Rory that she does not have what it takes to be a journalist, although she would make a good assistant. Upset and angry, Rory cajoles Logan into leaving his sister\u2019s engagement party, held at a marina, to steal a yacht and vent her frustration. When apprehended, Rory is sentenced to 300 hours of [[community service]] and rethinks her lifelong ambitions and current path at Yale. Her decision to take time off to consider her options precipitates the most sustained rift with Lorelai to date, beginning in the season five finale. She moves into her grandparents' pool house, joins Emily\u2019s branch of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and begins working for the organization. Rory and Lorelai barely speak for months and are only reconciled mid-season six, in \u2018The Prodigal Daughter Returns\u2019.\n\nExperiencing some problems with the restricted liberty living with her grandparents, chiefly centering on her sexual relationship with Logan, Rory reassesses her life after another unexpected visit from Jess. He has achieved something with his own life by writing a novel and he encourages her to see that her current choices do not suit who she really is. However, Jess\u2019s visit and Rory\u2019s subsequent realization that she is doing nothing with her life precipitate an argument with Logan and the couple are estranged for some time. Rory doggedly pursues her former editor for a job at the ''Stamford Eagle Gazette'', takes on extra courses at Yale to make up for her time away and is unexpectedly elected editor of the ''Yale Daily News'', taking over from Paris.\n\nRory and Logan reunite and cement their relationship despite his post-graduation spell working in [[London]], England, and a failed business. She cultivates new friendships with girls involved in the arts and drama, Olivia and Lucy, although these relationships become fraught when Marty, a friend who had a crush on Rory in an earlier season, is revealed to be Lucy\u2019s boyfriend. Having been unexpectedly elected editor of the ''Yale Daily News'', Rory\u2019s tenure later comes to an end and leaves her feeling deflated. She continues to work towards her goal, applying for the Reston Fellowship, to become an intern at the ''[[New York Times]]'', as well as applying and interviewing for other jobs. She turns down one firm job offer, counting on getting the Reston Fellowship. When she is rejected, Rory is in turmoil, unable to concentrate on a final exam about [[John Milton]]\u2019s epic poem, ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and generally experiencing great uncertainty about her future.\n\nAt Rory\u2019s own graduation party, where it is revealed she graduated with honors and membership in [[Phi Beta Kappa]],<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9g5K9Mvpzs&t=43</ref> Logan unexpectedly proposes marriage and asks her to move to [[Palo Alto]], California, with him. She considers his offer but ultimately declines, suggesting they try to maintain a long-distance relationship. She says that she relishes the openness of her life and the opportunities before her: marriage now would limit that. Logan, however, finds the prospect of \"going backwards\" in their relationship unappealing and issues the ultimatum that it is \"all or nothing\". Rory wordlessly returns his engagement ring and Logan walks away. As of the final episode, Rory had prepared numerous r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to mail  before going on vacation with her mother. She is offered a job as a reporter to cover [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign and his bid for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for an online magazine, when another reporter drops out at the last moment. Luke throws a surprise graduation party for Rory, which closes out the series.\n\nNine years later, Rory is in a rut.  She became a successful freelance journalist, but she got fired from a job to ghostwrite a book, and gave up her apartment to stay in different places like New York, London and Stars Hollow. She has been dating a man named Paul for two years, but does not seem to be invested in their relationship. After breaking up with Paul, she also engages in casual sex, including with a nameless man in a Wookie costume.\n\nWhile jetting back and forth between America and London, Rory sees Logan on the side. He, in turn, cheats on his fianc\u00e9e with Rory, but he will not leave her for Rory. Rory interviews for more many jobs, but she does not receive any promising offers. Rory ends back in Stars Hollow and becomes the editor of The Stars Hollow Gazette. While at work one day, Jess visits her and gives her the idea of writing a book about her life and relationship with her mother, Lorelai.\n\nRory and her mother have a falling out when Rory tells Lorelai about the book, as Lorelai does not want her life written about. Rory continues to wander, although very determined to write her novel. She breaks things off with Logan for good, believing their relationship is not what is best for her. She ends up reconciling with her mother and is present when Lorelai marries Luke. Rory later reveals to Lorelai that she is pregnant. While the father's identity is not explicitly stated, the timing implies that it is Logan's child.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:AlexisBledelSept11TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Rory Gilmore was played by Alexis Bledel]]\n\n===Casting and creation===\nAlexis Bledel had no previous acting experience: \"It was just one of those young, beautiful faces.

That was a lovely element in the show that I really enjoyed.\"<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\nMargaret Lyons of [[Vulture.com]] wrote \"Rory's worst attribute, other than her slouchy posture, is her lack of impulse control. Rory's strongest motivator is want \u2014 if she wants to do it, she does. Her wants always win. Conveniently for her, her wants often align with social norms for [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] success, but on the occasions that they don't, she still follows them. \"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lyons|first1=Margaret|title=Gilmore Girls Is Great, But Lorelai and Rory Might Be Terrible|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/whos-worse-lorelai-or-rory.html|website=[[Vulture.com]]|accessdate=August 15, 2015|date=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexis Bledel]] said of her character's evolution up to the fifth season finale: \"Rory has been on a very specific path for most of her young life, so last season [season 4] was the year that sort of opened her eyes to the fact that there are so many other things. She realized how competitive the field she was trying to get into is, and how slim her chances actually were, and how hard she'd have to work ... when she already was working hard. We saw more about her than her academic goals, and it was fun to see where it would go. Viewers had never really seen [Rory] mess up too much. She was almost annoyingly perfect.

She first appeared in the [[Pilot (Gilmore Girls)|pilot episode]] of the series on October 5, 2000 and appeared in every episode until the [[Bon Voyage (Gilmore Girls)|series finale]] on May 15, 2007. Bledel's performance throughout the series' run earned her a [[Young Artist Awards|Young Artist Award]], a Family Television Award and two [[Teen Choice Awards]]. She also received nominations for an [[ALMA Award]], a [[Satellite Award]], and a [[Saturn Award]].\n\n==Background==\nRory is the only daughter of [[Lorelai Gilmore]], and the first-born daughter of [[Christopher Hayden]]. She was born October 8, 1984 in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], at 4:03am. Every year at that exact time, Lorelai wakes Rory up to tell her the story of her birth. Because Lorelai became pregnant with Rory when she was only sixteen, the two are more like friends than mother and daughter. Rory shares her mother's taste in junk food, coffee, movies, music, and much more. She spent her first months living with her mother at her grandparent's mansion until her mother ran away. The rest of her childhood she spent in the Independence Inn in [[Stars Hollow]] where her mother worked originally as a maid. The two lived in the [[garden shed|potting shed]] behind the inn where Jackson's cousin Rune lived in later seasons. Eventually, Lorelai was able to buy a nice house where Rory spent her adolescent years. Rory did not have much contact with her grandparents until she started to attend Chilton, which Lorelai preferred.\n\n==Storylines==\nRory dreams of studying at [[Harvard University]] and gets accepted into the prestigious and fictional Chilton Academy, where she stays for her sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. To pay tuition, Lorelai asks for the money from her estranged wealthy parents, [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]]. They agree to pay for Rory's education on the condition that the two come to their house every Friday night for dinner. Before leaving Stars Hollow High School, Rory meets [[Dean Forester]] ([[Jared Padalecki]]). Rory almost convinced herself not to go to Chilton because of not wanting to leave Dean, but after learning of the huge sacrifices her mother made, she decides to go to Chilton. Rory and Dean date for two seasons, only breaking up once when Dean told Rory he loved her on their 3-month anniversary, and she replied that she would have to think about it, but they eventually reconcile. Dean escorts Rory when she is [[Debutante|presented to society]] at a [[debutante ball]] hosted by her grandmother's chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. During her time at Chilton, Rory becomes engaged in a feud with close academic rival, [[Paris Geller]]. Though [[Rory Gilmore and Paris Geller|the two later become friends]], the rivalry continues into their university studies. Rory reluctantly runs for student government with Paris and wins, and writes for the Chilton paper, ''The Franklin''.\n\nWhen she meets Jess Mariano ([[Milo Ventimiglia]]), Rory feels an immediate attraction. They become friends first, but start to date after Dean breaks up with Rory because he sees that Rory likes Jess. However, various problems make their relationship difficult. After Jess skips school to go to work at [[Walmart]], causing him to be unable to graduate or to take Rory to Prom, Jess decides to leave to go to [[California]] to see his estranged father, effectively breaking up with Rory. Jess does not tell Rory he is leaving, but later calls and does not say anything on the phone, until Rory caught on that it was him and revealed that she might have loved him but would just have to get over it. Later that year, still upset, Jess returns and tells Rory that he loves her and then leaves again.\n\nAfter graduating Chilton as [[valedictorian]] and with a 4.2 [[GPA]], Rory goes on to attend [[Yale University]], her grandfather's alma mater, in season four, although her entire life she had wanted to go to Harvard, having decided that the benefits of Yale outweighed her dream of studying at Harvard. During her freshman year, Rory resides at [[Durfee Hall]] and shares a dorm room with Tana, Janet, and fellow Chilton alumna [[Paris Geller]]. She moves to [[Branford College]], the same [[Residential colleges of Yale University|residential college]] that her grandfather, Richard Gilmore, lived in,<ref name=\"writteninthestars\">\"[[Gilmore Girls Season 5|Written in the Stars]]\"</ref> at the beginning of her sophomore year. There she shares a dorm room with Paris. At Yale, Rory majors in English and pursues her interest in journalism; she wants to be a foreign correspondent and her role-model is [[Christiane Amanpour]]. She writes for the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' and is its editor towards the end of her studies.\n\nWhile at Yale, Rory reconnects with Dean, who married Lindsay (a fellow school mate), straight after high school, but it is soon clear that he impulsively did it as a [[Rebound (dating)|rebound]] from Rory. During the same period, Jess shows up at Yale to see Rory unexpectedly, and asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. Dean gets jealous but he and Rory grow closer and have an affair, during which Rory loses her [[virginity]]. Lorelai is angry and disappointed in Rory, who decides to leave for Europe with her grandmother for the summer to avoid conflicts. Shortly after, Dean separates from Lindsay and the two continue seeing each other.\n\nMeanwhile, Rory makes the acquaintance of the heir to the Huntzberger Publishing Company, [[Logan Huntzberger]] ([[Matt Czuchry]]). She soon becomes interested in him and after Dean breaks up with her (she was detained at a party arranged by her grandparents to introduce her to the wealthy and eligible sons of their Yale alumni friends, including Logan), she makes the first move at her grandparents' [[Wedding Bell Blues (Gilmore Girls)|vow-renewal]]. Their relationship begins casually as a \"no strings attached\" affair, because Logan makes it clear that he does not want to commit to a relationship. However, as time passes, Rory grows dissatisfied with their open relationship, and after a day of drunken introspection, she suggests they should end their sexual relationship and be friends because she is \"a girlfriend kind of girl.\" Logan interprets this as an ultimatum and unexpectedly agrees to date her exclusively. At her first time to dinner at Logan\u2019s family home, the Huntzbergers reject Rory as a fit girlfriend for their son because of her aspirations to work and her background. However, Logan affirms his commitment to their relationship, although the pressure exerted by the Huntzbergers continues to dog the couple.\n\nTo make amends, Logan's father, Mitchum Huntzberger gives Rory an [[internship]] at one of his newspapers, the ''Stamford Eagle Gazette''. At the end of her internship, Mitchum tells Rory that she does not have what it takes to be a journalist, although she would make a good assistant. Upset and angry, Rory cajoles Logan into leaving his sister\u2019s engagement party, held at a marina, to steal a yacht and vent her frustration. When apprehended, Rory is sentenced to 300 hours of [[community service]] and rethinks her lifelong ambitions and current path at Yale. Her decision to take time off to consider her options precipitates the most sustained rift with Lorelai to date, beginning in the season five finale. She moves into her grandparents' pool house, joins Emily\u2019s branch of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and begins working for the organization. Rory and Lorelai barely speak for months and are only reconciled mid-season six, in \u2018The Prodigal Daughter Returns\u2019.\n\nExperiencing some problems with the restricted liberty living with her grandparents, chiefly centering on her sexual relationship with Logan, Rory reassesses her life after another unexpected visit from Jess. He has achieved something with his own life by writing a novel and he encourages her to see that her current choices do not suit who she really is. However, Jess\u2019s visit and Rory\u2019s subsequent realization that she is doing nothing with her life precipitate an argument with Logan and the couple are estranged for some time. Rory doggedly pursues her former editor for a job at the ''Stamford Eagle Gazette'', takes on extra courses at Yale to make up for her time away and is unexpectedly elected editor of the ''Yale Daily News'', taking over from Paris.\n\nRory and Logan reunite and cement their relationship despite his post-graduation spell working in [[London]], England, and a failed business. She cultivates new friendships with girls involved in the arts and drama, Olivia and Lucy, although these relationships become fraught when Marty, a friend who had a crush on Rory in an earlier season, is revealed to be Lucy\u2019s boyfriend. Having been unexpectedly elected editor of the ''Yale Daily News'', Rory\u2019s tenure later comes to an end and leaves her feeling deflated. She continues to work towards her goal, applying for the Reston Fellowship, to become an intern at the ''[[New York Times]]'', as well as applying and interviewing for other jobs. She turns down one firm job offer, counting on getting the Reston Fellowship. When she is rejected, Rory is in turmoil, unable to concentrate on a final exam about [[John Milton]]\u2019s epic poem, ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and generally experiencing great uncertainty about her future.\n\nAt Rory\u2019s own graduation party, where it is revealed she graduated with honors and membership in [[Phi Beta Kappa]],<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9g5K9Mvpzs&t=43</ref> Logan unexpectedly proposes marriage and asks her to move to [[Palo Alto]], California, with him. She considers his offer but ultimately declines, suggesting they try to maintain a long-distance relationship. She says that she relishes the openness of her life and the opportunities before her: marriage now would limit that. Logan, however, finds the prospect of \"going backwards\" in their relationship unappealing and issues the ultimatum that it is \"all or nothing\". Rory wordlessly returns his engagement ring and Logan walks away. As of the final episode, Rory had prepared numerous r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to mail  before going on vacation with her mother. She is offered a job as a reporter to cover [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign and his bid for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for an online magazine, when another reporter drops out at the last moment. Luke throws a surprise graduation party for Rory, which closes out the series.\n\nNine years later, Rory is in a rut.  She became a successful freelance journalist, but she got fired from a job to ghostwrite a book, and gave up her apartment to stay in different places like New York, London and Stars Hollow. She has been dating a man named Paul for two years, but does not seem to be invested in their relationship. After breaking up with Paul, she also engages in casual sex, including with a nameless man in a Wookie costume.\n\nWhile jetting back and forth between America and London, Rory sees Logan on the side. He, in turn, cheats on his fianc\u00e9e with Rory, but he will not leave her for Rory. Rory interviews for more many jobs, but she does not receive any promising offers. Rory ends back in Stars Hollow and becomes the editor of The Stars Hollow Gazette. While at work one day, Jess visits her and gives her the idea of writing a book about her life and relationship with her mother, Lorelai.\n\nRory and her mother have a falling out when Rory tells Lorelai about the book, as Lorelai does not want her life written about. Rory continues to wander, although very determined to write her novel. She breaks things off with Logan for good, believing their relationship is not what is best for her. She ends up reconciling with her mother and is present when Lorelai marries Luke. Rory later reveals to Lorelai that she is pregnant. While the father's identity is not explicitly stated, the timing implies that it is Logan's child.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:AlexisBledelSept11TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Rory Gilmore was played by Alexis Bledel]]\n\n===Casting and creation===\nAlexis Bledel had no previous acting experience: \"It was just one of those young, beautiful faces.

That was a lovely element in the show that I really enjoyed.\"<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\nMargaret Lyons of [[Vulture.com]] wrote \"Rory's worst attribute, other than her slouchy posture, is her lack of impulse control. Rory's strongest motivator is want \u2014 if she wants to do it, she does. Her wants always win. Conveniently for her, her wants often align with social norms for [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] success, but on the occasions that they don't, she still follows them. \"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lyons|first1=Margaret|title=Gilmore Girls Is Great, But Lorelai and Rory Might Be Terrible|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/whos-worse-lorelai-or-rory.html|website=[[Vulture.com]]|accessdate=August 15, 2015|date=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexis Bledel]] said of her character's evolution up to the fifth season finale: \"Rory has been on a very specific path for most of her young life, so last season [season 4] was the year that sort of opened her eyes to the fact that there are so many other things. She realized how competitive the field she was trying to get into is, and how slim her chances actually were, and how hard she'd have to work ... when she already was working hard. We saw more about her than her academic goals, and it was fun to see where it would go. Viewers had never really seen [Rory] mess up too much. She was almost annoyingly perfect.

Each player has nine pieces, or \"men\", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'\u2014three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically\u2014allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.\n\nThe game proceeds in three phases:\n# Placing men on vacant points\n# Moving men to adjacent points\n# (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men\n\n===Phase 1: Placing pieces===\n[[Image:Nine Men's Morris board with coordinates, modified.png|thumb|upright=1.0|Nine men's morris starts on an empty board.]]\nThe game begins with an empty board. The players determine who plays first, then take turns placing their men one per play on empty points. If a player is able to place three of their pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, they have formed a ''mill'' and may remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board and the game, with the caveat that a piece in an opponent's mill can only be removed if no other pieces are available.j After all men have been placed, phase two begins.\n\n===Phase 2: Moving pieces===\nPlayers continue to alternate moves, this time moving a man to an adjacent point. A piece may not \"jump\" another piece. Players continue to try to form mills and remove their opponent's pieces as in phase one. A player can \"break\" a mill by moving one of his pieces out of an existing mill, then moving it back to form the same mill a second time (or any number of times), each time removing one of his opponent's men. The act of removing an opponent's man is sometimes called \"pounding\" the opponent. When one player has been reduced to three men, phase three begins.\n\n===Phase 3: \"Flying\"===\nWhen a player is reduced to three pieces, there is no longer a limitation on that player of moving to only adjacent points: The player's men may \"fly\" (or \"hop\",<ref name=\"Mohr\"/><ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Clement |author2=Gloria Goddard |title=The Complete Book of Games |year=1940 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Garden City Books]] |location=[[Garden City, New York]] |pages=342\u201343}}</ref> or \"jump\"<ref name=\"Foster\">{{cite book |last=Foster |first=R.

The game is for two players; each player has three men. The players put one man on the board in each of their first three plays, winning if a mill is formed (as in tic-tac-toe).

This means the board can be filled in the placement stage; if this happens the game is a draw. This variation on the game is popular amongst rural youth in South Africa where it is known as ''[[morabaraba]]'' and is now recognized as a sport in that country. H. J. R. Murray also calls the game \"the larger merels\".\n\nThis board is also used for eleven men's morris.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Lasker morris===\nThis variant (also called '''ten men's morris''') was invented by [[Emanuel Lasker]], chess world champion from 1894 to 1921. It is based on the\nrules of nine men\u2019s morris, but there are two differences: each player gets ten pieces; and pieces can be moved in the first phase already. This means each player can choose to either place a new piece or to move one of his pieces already on the board. This variant is more complex than nine men's morris, and draws are less likely.<ref>http://www.althofer.de/stahlhacke-lasker-morris-2003.pdf</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:NineMensMorrisTileMycenae.jpg|thumb|right|Clay tile fragment from the archeological museum at [[Mycenae]] showing what appears to be a Nine Men's Morris board]]\nAccording to [[R. C. Bell]], the earliest known board for the game includes diagonal lines and was \"cut into the roofing slabs of the temple at [[Kurna]] in Egypt\"; he estimated a date for them of {{circa|1400}}&nbsp;[[Common era|BCE]].<ref name=\"Bell vol. 1\"/> However, Friedrich Berger wrote that some of the diagrams at Kurna include [[Coptic cross]]es, making it \"doubtful\" that the diagrams date to 1400&nbsp;BCE. Berger concluded, \"certainly they cannot be dated.\"<ref name=\"Berger\"/>\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of the game may be in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]''.<ref name=\"Berger\"/><ref name=\"Bell vol. 1\"/> In book III (c.&nbsp;8&nbsp;CE), after discussing {{lang|la|[[Ludus latrunculorum|latrones]]}}, a popular board game, Ovid wrote:\n<blockquote>There is another game divided into as many parts as there are months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner must get all the pieces in a straight line. It is a bad thing for a woman not to know how to play, for love often comes into being during play.</blockquote>\n\nBerger believes the game was \"probably well known by the Romans\", as there are many boards on Roman buildings, even though dating them is impossible because the buildings \"have been easily accessible\" since they were built. It is possible that the Romans were introduced to the game via trade routes, but this cannot be proven.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>\n\n[[Image:Nine Men's Morris with dice in Libro de los juegos.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th century illustration in ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'' of the game being played with dice]]\n[[Image:Muzej Me\u0111imurja, \u010cakovec (Croatia) - stol za mlin i \u0161ah.jpg|thumb|right|An old combined Nine Men's Morris and chess table]]\nThe game might have been played by the sculptors while they were building the huge temples.

It has been shown that with perfect play from both players, the game results in a draw.<ref name=\"Gasser\">{{cite journal|last=Gasser|first=Ralph|year=1996|title=Solving Nine Men's Morris|journal=Games of No Chance|volume=29|pages=101\u2013113|url=http://library.msri.org/books/Book29/files/gasser.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-06-01}}</ref> Its name derives from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|merellus}}, 'gamepiece'.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>\n\nThree main alternative variations of the game are [[three men's morris|three]], six, and [[twelve men's morris]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or ''points''. Each player has nine pieces, or \"men\", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'\u2014three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically\u2014allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.\n\nThe game proceeds in three phases:\n# Placing men on vacant points\n# Moving men to adjacent points\n# (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men\n\n===Phase 1: Placing pieces===\n[[Image:Nine Men's Morris board with coordinates, modified.png|thumb|upright=1.0|Nine men's morris starts on an empty board.]]\nThe game begins with an empty board. The players determine who plays first, then take turns placing their men one per play on empty points. If a player is able to place three of their pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, they have formed a ''mill'' and may remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board and the game, with the caveat that a piece in an opponent's mill can only be removed if no other pieces are available. After all men have been placed, phase two begins.\n\n===Phase 2: Moving pieces===\nPlayers continue to alternate moves, this time moving a man to an adjacent point. A piece may not \"jump\" another piece. Players continue to try to form mills and remove their opponent's pieces as in phase one. A player can \"break\" a mill by moving one of his pieces out of an existing mill, then moving it back to form the same mill a second time (or any number of times), each time removing one of his opponent's men. The act of removing an opponent's man is sometimes called \"pounding\" the opponent. When one player has been reduced to three men, phase three begins.\n\n===Phase 3: \"Flying\"===\nWhen a player is reduced to three pieces, there is no longer a limitation on that player of moving to only adjacent points: The player's men may \"fly\" (or \"hop\",<ref name=\"Mohr\"/><ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Clement |author2=Gloria Goddard |title=The Complete Book of Games |year=1940 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Garden City Books]] |location=[[Garden City, New York]] |pages=342\u201343}}</ref> or \"jump\"<ref name=\"Foster\">{{cite book |last=Foster |first=R.

The game is for two players; each player has three men. The players put one man on the board in each of their first three plays, winning if a mill is formed (as in tic-tac-toe). After that, each player moves one of his men, according to one of the following rules versions:\n{{ordered list|style=list-style-position:inside\n| To any empty position\n| To any adjacent empty position \n}}\nA player wins by forming a mill.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=H.

This means the board can be filled in the placement stage; if this happens the game is a draw. This variation on the game is popular amongst rural youth in South Africa where it is known as ''[[morabaraba]]'' and is now recognized as a sport in that country. H. J. R. Murray also calls the game \"the larger merels\".\n\nThis board is also used for eleven men's morris.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Lasker morris===\nThis variant (also called '''ten men's morris''') was invented by [[Emanuel Lasker]], chess world champion from 1894 to 1921. It is based on the\nrules of nine men\u2019s morris, but there are two differences: each player gets ten pieces; and pieces can be moved in the first phase already. This means each player can choose to either place a new piece or to move one of his pieces already on the board. This variant is more complex than nine men's morris, and draws are less likely.<ref>http://www.althofer.de/stahlhacke-lasker-morris-2003.pdf</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:NineMensMorrisTileMycenae.jpg|thumb|right|Clay tile fragment from the archeological museum at [[Mycenae]] showing what appears to be a Nine Men's Morris board]]\nAccording to [[R. C. Bell]], the earliest known board for the game includes diagonal lines and was \"cut into the roofing slabs of the temple at [[Kurna]] in Egypt\"; he estimated a date for them of {{circa|1400}}&nbsp;[[Common era|BCE]].<ref name=\"Bell vol. 1\"/> However, Friedrich Berger wrote that some of the diagrams at Kurna include [[Coptic cross]]es, making it \"doubtful\" that the diagrams date to 1400&nbsp;BCE. Berger concluded, \"certainly they cannot be dated.\"<ref name=\"Berger\"/>\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of the game may be in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]''.<ref name=\"Berger\"/><ref name=\"Bell vol. 1\"/> In book III (c.&nbsp;8&nbsp;CE), after discussing {{lang|la|[[Ludus latrunculorum|latrones]]}}, a popular board game, Ovid wrote:\n<blockquote>There is another game divided into as many parts as there are months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner must get all the pieces in a straight line. It is a bad thing for a woman not to know how to play, for love often comes into being during play.</blockquote>\n\nBerger believes the game was \"probably well known by the Romans\", as there are many boards on Roman buildings, even though dating them is impossible because the buildings \"have been easily accessible\" since they were built. It is possible that the Romans were introduced to the game via trade routes, but this cannot be proven.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>\n\n[[Image:Nine Men's Morris with dice in Libro de los juegos.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th century illustration in ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'' of the game being played with dice]]\n[[Image:Muzej Me\u0111imurja, \u010cakovec (Croatia) - stol za mlin i \u0161ah.jpg|thumb|right|An old combined Nine Men's Morris and chess table]]\nThe game might have been played by the sculptors while they were building the huge temples.

(He served as the Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture from 2004 to 2012, and was the Republican nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky]] in 2011, and would later serve two years in federal prison after pleading guilty to multiple corruption charges during his tenure as Agriculture Commissioner.)\n* [[Deron Feldhaus]], a 6'7\"/2.01 m forward from [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]], a small [[Ohio River]] town in the [[Bluegrass region]], about an hour's drive upriver from [[Cincinnati]].\n* [[John Pelphrey]], a 6'8\"/2.03 m forward from another eastern coal town, [[Paintsville, Kentucky|Paintsville]] (currently the head coach at [[Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles men's basketball|Tennessee Tech]], and former assistant at [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida]] and former head coach at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]).\n* [[Sean Woods]], the only non-Kentuckian, a 6'2\"/1.88 m [[point guard]] from [[Indianapolis]] (formerly the head coach at [[Morehead State Eagles men's basketball|Morehead State]]).\n\nAlthough the seniors were the heart and soul of the team, its biggest star was sophomore [[Jamal Mashburn]], who would go on to become a consensus first-team All-American the following season and have a successful 12-year [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] career; he is now an NBA analyst for [[ESPN]].\n\nThe legacy of \"The Unforgettables\" at UK was great enough that the UK program decided to retire their jerseys (but not their numbers) almost immediately after that game.
