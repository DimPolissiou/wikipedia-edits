It rises in the [[Krkono\u0161e Mountains]] of the northern [[Czech Republic]] before traversing much of [[Bohemia]] (western half of the Czech Republic), then [[Germany]] and flowing into the [[North Sea]] at [[Cuxhaven]], {{convert|110|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Hamburg]].

The basin spans four countries, however it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the state's territory). Marginally, the basin stretches also to [[Austria]] (0.6%) and [[Poland]] (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people, the biggest cities within are [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Prague]], [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]].<ref name=erb />\n\n==Course==\n===In the Czech Republic===\nThe Elbe rises at an elevation of about {{convert|1400|m|ft|0}} in the [[Karkonosze|Krkono\u0161e]] (also known as ''Giant Mountains'' or in German as ''Riesengebirge'') on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic near Labsk\u00e1 bouda. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river, the most important is the [[B\u00edl\u00e9 Labe]], or White Elbe. After plunging down the {{convert|60|m|ft|0}} of the [[Labsk\u00fd vodop\u00e1d]], or Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential [[Mal\u00e9 Labe]], and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at [[Jarom\u011b\u0159]], where it receives [[\u00dapa]] and [[Metuje]].\n\nHere the Elbe enters the vast vale named [[Polab\u00ed]] (meaning \"land along the Elbe\"), and continues on southwards through [[Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] (where [[Orlice]] flows in) and then to [[Pardubice]], where it turns sharply to the west. At [[Kol\u00edn]] some {{convert|43|km|mi|0}} further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of [[K\u00e1ran\u00fd]], a little above [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem]], it picks up the [[Jizera (river)|Jizera]].\n\nAt [[M\u011bln\u00edk]] its stream is more than doubled in volume by the [[Vltava]], or [[Vltava|Moldau]], a major river which winds northwards through [[Bohemia]]. Upstream from the [[confluence]] the Vltava is in fact much longer ({{convert|434|km}} against {{convert|294|km}} of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger [[drainage basin]]. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.\n\nSome distance lower down, at [[Litom\u011b\u0159ice]], the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish [[Oh\u0159e]] (Eger). Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the [[\u010cesk\u00e9 St\u0159edoho\u0159\u00ed]], churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.\n\n===In Germany===\nShortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]], the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.\n\nThe river rolls through [[Dresden]] and finally, beyond [[Mei\u00dfen]], enters on its long journey across the [[North German Plain]] passing along the former western border of [[East Germany]], touching [[Torgau]], [[Wittenberg]], [[Dessau]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Wittenberge]], and [[Hamburg]] on the way, and taking on the waters of the [[Mulde]] and [[Saale]] from the west, and those of the [[Schwarze Elster]], [[Havel]] and [[Elde]] from the east. In its northern section both banks of the Elbe are characterised by flat, very fertile [[marshland]]s ([[Elbe Marshes]]), former flood plains of the Elbe now diked.\n\nAt Magdeburg  there is a  viaduct, the [[Magdeburg Water Bridge]], that carries a canal and its shipping traffic over the Elbe and its banks, allowing shipping traffic to pass under it unhindered.\n\n{{wide image|ElbeInAutumn.jpg|800px|The Middle Elbe in the [[North German Plain]] near the village of [[Gorleben]]. In this section, the river had been part of the [[Iron Curtain]] between West and East Germany during the [[Cold War]]. For that reason, the river banks even today look relatively natural and undeveloped.|left}}\n\nFrom the [[sluice]] of [[Geesthacht]] (at kilometre 586) on downstream the Elbe is subject to the [[tide]]s, the tidal Elbe section is called the [[Unterelbe|Low Elbe]] (Unterelbe). Soon the Elbe reaches Hamburg. Within the city-state the Unterelbe has a number of branch streams, such as [[Dove Elbe]], [[Gose Elbe]], [[K\u00f6hlbrand]], [[Norderelbe|Northern Elbe]] (Norderelbe), [[Reiherstieg]], [[S\u00fcderelbe|Southern Elbe]] (S\u00fcderelbe). Some of which have been disconnected for vessels from the main stream by dikes. In 1390 the Gose Elbe (literally in {{lang-en|shallow Elbe}}) was separated from the main stream by a dike connecting the two then-islands of [[Kirchwerder]] and [[Neuengamme]]. The Dove Elbe (literally in {{lang-en|deaf Elbe}}) was diked off in 1437/38 at Gammer Ort. These [[hydraulic engineering]] works were carried out to protect marshlands from inundation, and to improve the water supply of the [[Port of Hamburg]]. After the heavy inundation by the [[North Sea flood of 1962]] the western section of the Southern Elbe was separated, becoming the Old Southern Elbe, while the waters of the eastern Southern Elbe now merge into the K\u00f6hlbrand, which is bridged by the [[K\u00f6hlbrandbr\u00fccke]], the last bridge over the Elbe before the North Sea.\n\nThe Northern Elbe passes the [[Elbe Philharmonic Hall]] and is then crossed under by the [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|old Elbe Tunnel (Alter Elbtunnel)]], both in Hamburg's city centre. A bit more downstream the Low Elbe's two main [[anabranch]]es Northern Elbe and the K\u00f6hlbrand reunite south of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]-Altstadt, a locality of Hamburg. Right after both anabranches reunited the Low Elbe is passed under by the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|New Elbe Tunnel (Neuer Elbtunnel)]], the last structural road link crossing the river before the North Sea. At the bay [[M\u00fchlenberger Loch]] in Hamburg at kilometre 634, the Northern Elbe and the Southern Elbe (here now the cut-off meander Old Southern Elbe) used to reunite, which is why the bay is seen as the starting point of the [[Niederelbe|Lower Elbe]] (Niederelbe). Leaving the city-state the Lower Elbe then passes between [[Holstein]] and the [[Elbe-Weser Triangle]] with [[Stade]] until it flows into the North Sea at [[Cuxhaven]]. Near its mouth it passes the entrance to the [[Kiel Canal]] at [[Brunsb\u00fcttel]] before it debouches into the North Sea.\n\n{{wide image|River Elbe bend panorama.jpg|800px|View of the Elbe in [[Saxon Switzerland]], an area in Germany|left}}\n\n==Towns and cities==\n[[File:Dresden-Altstadt von der Marienbruecke-II.jpg|thumb|The Elbe passing [[Dresden]]]]\n[[File:Elbe in Wittenberg.jpg|thumb|Elbe near [[Wittenberg]]]]\n[[File:CTB-CTW Port of Hamburg-Waltershof.jpg|thumb|The [[Port of Hamburg]] on the Elbe]]\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:0; font-size:100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Key\n|- \n!

The river is linked by [[canal]]s ([[Elbe Lateral Canal]], [[Elbe-Havel Canal]], [[Mittellandkanal]]) to the industrial areas of Germany and to [[Berlin]]. The [[Elbe-L\u00fcbeck Canal]] links the Elbe to the [[Baltic Sea]], as does the [[Kiel Canal]], whose western entrance is near the mouth of the Elbe. The [[Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel]] connects the Elbe with the [[Weser]].\n\nBy the [[Treaty of Versailles#International organizations|Treaty of Versailles]] the navigation on the Elbe became subject to the International Commission of the Elbe, seated in Dresden.<ref>The commission was staffed with two representatives of Czechoslovakia and one representative of [[Free State of Anhalt|Anhalt]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], Hamburg, [[Italy]], [[Free State of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]], and the United Kingdom each, with Czecholosvakia and the German states being those, whose territory was crossed by the Elbe and thus competent for maintaining navigation installations.

The contract of lease with Germany, and supervised by the [[United Kingdom]], was signed on February 14, 1929 ending in 2028. Since 1993 the Czech Republic holds the former Czechoslovak legal position.\n\nBefore Germany was reunited, waterway transport in Western Germany was hindered by the fact that [[inland navigation]] to Hamburg had to pass through the German Democratic Republic. The Elbe-Seitenkanal (Elbe Lateral Canal) was built between the West German section of the Mittellandkanal and the Lower Elbe to restore this connection. When the two nations were reunited, works were begun to improve and restore the original links: the [[Magdeburg Water Bridge]] now allows large barges to cross the Elbe without having to enter the river. The often low water levels of the Elbe no longer hinder navigation to Berlin.<ref>[http://www.noorderSoft.com/indexen.html NoorderSoft Waterways Database]</ref>\n\n==Islands==\n[[File:13-09-29-nordfriesisches-wattenmeer-RalfR-10.jpg|thumb|Cuxhaven]]\n[[File:Germany (1), Elbe, Trischen.jpg|thumb|upright|The mouth of the Elbe with the island of [[Trischen]] in the [[North Sea]]]]\n\n===Headwaters===\n* [[Ho\u0159ej\u0161\u00ed]] \u2013 in [[Kol\u00edn]]  \n* [[Kmoch\u016fv]] \u2013 in Kol\u00edn\n\n===Upper reaches===\n* [[Pillnitzer Elbinsel]] \u2013 in [[Dresden]]'s southern quarter of [[Pillnitz]] in the [[Dresden Basin]]\n* [[Gauernitzer Elbinsel]] \u2013 east of [[Gauernitz]] in the Dresden Basin between Dresden and [[Mei\u00dfen]]\n\n===Middle Elbe===\n* [[Rotehorninsel]] \u2013 in [[Magdeburg]]\n* [[Steinkopfinsel]] \u2013 in Magdeburg\n\n=== Between Northern and Southern Elbe (Norderelbe/S\u00fcderelbe)===\n* [[Wilhelmsburg, Hamburg|Wilhelmsburg]], including the islands [[Veddel]], [[Georgswerder]], [[Kleiner Grasbrook]], [[Steinwerder]], [[Peute]] and several more \u2013 in [[Hamburg]]'s [[Hamburg-Mitte|borough of Mitte (centre)]]\n* [[Kaltehofe]] (also \"Kalte Hofe\") \u2013 in Hamburg's borough of Mitte\n* [[Finkenwerder]] \u2013 in Hamburg's borough of Mitte\n\n===[[Niederelbe|Lower Elbe]]===\n* [[Schweinesand]] \u2013 south of [[Blankenese|Blankenese (Hamburg)]]\n* [[Ne\u00dfsand]] \u2013 south of [[Tinsdal]]\n* [[Hahn\u00f6fersand]] \u2013 north of [[Jork]]\n* [[Hanskalbsand]] \u2013 south of [[Schulau]]\n* [[L\u00fchesand]] \u2013 east of [[Stade]]\n* [[Bishorst|Bisterhorster Sand]] \u2013 west of [[Wedel]]\n* [[Pagensand]] \u2013 west of [[Seesterm\u00fche]]\n* [[Schwarztonnensand]] \u2013 east of [[Drochtersen]]\n* [[Rhinplate]] \u2013 west of [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]]\n\n===Outer Elbe (estuary)===\n* [[Neuwerk]] \u2013 an [[exclave]] \u2013 in Hamburg's borough of Mitte\n* [[Scharh\u00f6rn]] \u2013 an exclave Hamburg's borough of Mitte\n* [[Nigeh\u00f6rn]] \u2013 an exclave Hamburg's borough of Mitte\n\n===Former islands===\n* [[Medemsand]]\n\n==Ferries==\n[[File:P\u0159\u00edvoz Doln\u00ed \u017dleb.JPG|thumb|right|The Doln\u00ed \u017dleb Ferry]]\n[[File:Gierseilf\u00e4hre Coswig.JPG|thumb|right|The W\u00f6rlitz Coswig Ferry]]\n[[File:Faehre Zollenspieker.jpg|thumb|right|The Zollenspieker Ferry]]\nThe Elbe is crossed by many ferries, both passenger and car carrying.

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] knew the river as the ''{{lang|la|Albis}}''; however, they made only one serious [[Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|attempt to move the border of their empire]] forward from the [[Rhine]] to the Elbe, and this attempt failed with the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9&nbsp;AD, after which they never seriously tried again. In the [[Middle Ages]] the Elbe formed the eastern limit of the [[Carolingian Empire|Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]] (King of the Franks from 769 to 814). The river's navigable sections were essential to the success of the [[Hanseatic League]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]], and much trade was carried on its waters.\n\nFrom the early 6th century [[Slavic tribes]] (known as the [[Polabian Slavs]]) settled in the areas east of the rivers Elbe and Saale (which had been depopulated since the 4th century). In the 10th century the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] (dominant from 919 to 1024) began conquering these lands; a slow process of [[Germanization]] ensued, including the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147.\n\nThe Elbe delineated the western parts of Germany from the eastern so-called [[East Elbia]], where [[soccage]] and [[serfdom]] were more strict and prevailed longer than westwards of the river, and where feudal lords held bigger estates than in the west. Thus incumbents of huge land-holdings became characterised{{when|date=November 2019}} as East Elbian [[Junker]]s. The [[Northern Germany|Northern German]] area north of the Lower Elbe used to be called [[Nordalbingia|North Albingia]] in the Middle Ages. When the four [[Lutheran]] [[Landeskirche|church bodies]] there united in 1977 they chose the name [[North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. Other, administrative units were named after the river Elbe, such as the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalian]] ''Elbe [[d\u00e9partement]]'' (1807\u20131813) and ''Lower Elbe d\u00e9partement'' (1810), and the French d\u00e9partement [[Bouches-de-l'Elbe]] (1811\u20131814).\n\nIn 1945, as [[World War II]] drew to a close, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] territory came under attack from the armies of the [[western Allies]] advancing from the west and those of the [[Soviet Union]] advancing from the east. On 25 April 1945 these two forces linked up near [[Torgau]], on the Elbe. The victorious countries marked the event unofficially as [[Elbe Day]]. From 1949 to 1990 the Elbe formed part of the [[Inner German border]] between [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the Soviet Union stated that [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ashes had been scattered in the Elbe following disinterment from their original burial-site.<ref>Hans Meissner, ''Magda Goebbels, First Lady of the Third Reich'', 260\u2013277</ref><ref>\n{{cite news |title= Official: KGB chief ordered Hitler's remains destroyed | author= Maxim Tkachenko |newspaper= CNN |date= 11 December 2009 |url= http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/12/11/russia.hitler.remains/index.html |accessdate= 11 December 2009 }}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[2002 European floods]]\n* [[2006 European floods]]\n* [[2013 European floods]]\n* [[Saxon Elbeland]], the region of the Upper Elbe in Germany\n* [[List of waterbodies in Saxony-Anhalt]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last= Rada|first= Uwe|date= 2013|title= Die Elbe.

The basin spans four countries, however it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the state's territory). Marginally, the basin stretches also to [[Austria]] (0.6%) and [[Poland]] (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people, the biggest cities within are [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Prague]], [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]].<ref name=erb />\n\n==Course==\n===In the Czech Republic===\nThe Elbe rises at an elevation of about {{convert|1400|m|ft|0}} in the [[Karkonosze|Krkono\u0161e]] (also known as ''Giant Mountains'' or in German as ''Riesengebirge'') on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic near Labsk\u00e1 bouda. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river, the most important is the [[B\u00edl\u00e9 Labe]], or White Elbe. After plunging down the {{convert|60|m|ft|0}} of the [[Labsk\u00fd vodop\u00e1d]], or Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential [[Mal\u00e9 Labe]], and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at [[Jarom\u011b\u0159]], where it receives [[\u00dapa]] and [[Metuje]].\n\nHere the Elbe enters the vast vale named [[Polab\u00ed]] (meaning \"land along the Elbe\"), and continues on southwards through [[Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] (where [[Orlice]] flows in) and then to [[Pardubice]], where it turns sharply to the west. At [[Kol\u00edn]] some {{convert|43|km|mi|0}} further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of [[K\u00e1ran\u00fd]], a little above [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem]], it picks up the [[Jizera (river)|Jizera]].\n\nAt [[M\u011bln\u00edk]] its stream is more than doubled in volume by the [[Vltava]], or [[Vltava|Moldau]], a major river which winds northwards through [[Bohemia]]. Upstream from the [[confluence]] the Vltava is in fact much longer ({{convert|434|km}} against {{convert|294|km}} of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger [[drainage basin]]. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.\n\nSome distance lower down, at [[Litom\u011b\u0159ice]], the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish [[Oh\u0159e]] (Eger). Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the [[\u010cesk\u00e9 St\u0159edoho\u0159\u00ed]], churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.\n\n===In Germany===\nShortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]], the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.\n\nThe river rolls through [[Dresden]] and finally, beyond [[Mei\u00dfen]], enters on its long journey across the [[North German Plain]] passing along the former western border of [[East Germany]], touching [[Torgau]], [[Wittenberg]], [[Dessau]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Wittenberge]], and [[Hamburg]] on the way, and taking on the waters of the [[Mulde]] and [[Saale]] from the west, and those of the [[Schwarze Elster]], [[Havel]] and [[Elde]] from the east. In its northern section both banks of the Elbe are characterised by flat, very fertile [[marshland]]s ([[Elbe Marshes]]), former flood plains of the Elbe now diked.\n\nAt Magdeburg  there is a  viaduct, the [[Magdeburg Water Bridge]], that carries a canal and its shipping traffic over the Elbe and its banks, allowing shipping traffic to pass under it unhindered.\n\n{{wide image|ElbeInAutumn.jpg|800px|The Middle Elbe in the [[North German Plain]] near the village of [[Gorleben]]. In this section, the river had been part of the [[Iron Curtain]] between West and East Germany during the [[Cold War]]. For that reason, the river banks even today look relatively natural and undeveloped.|left}}\n\nFrom the [[sluice]] of [[Geesthacht]] (at kilometre 586) on downstream the Elbe is subject to the [[tide]]s, the tidal Elbe section is called the [[Unterelbe|Low Elbe]] (Unterelbe). Soon the Elbe reaches Hamburg. Within the city-state the Unterelbe has a number of branch streams, such as [[Dove Elbe]], [[Gose Elbe]], [[K\u00f6hlbrand]], [[Norderelbe|Northern Elbe]] (Norderelbe), [[Reiherstieg]], [[S\u00fcderelbe|Southern Elbe]] (S\u00fcderelbe). Some of which have been disconnected for vessels from the main stream by dikes. In 1390 the Gose Elbe (literally in {{lang-en|shallow Elbe}}) was separated from the main stream by a dike connecting the two then-islands of [[Kirchwerder]] and [[Neuengamme]]. The Dove Elbe (literally in {{lang-en|deaf Elbe}}) was diked off in 1437/38 at Gammer Ort. These [[hydraulic engineering]] works were carried out to protect marshlands from inundation, and to improve the water supply of the [[Port of Hamburg]]. After the heavy inundation by the [[North Sea flood of 1962]] the western section of the Southern Elbe was separated, becoming the Old Southern Elbe, while the waters of the eastern Southern Elbe now merge into the K\u00f6hlbrand, which is bridged by the [[K\u00f6hlbrandbr\u00fccke]], the last bridge over the Elbe before the North Sea.\n\nThe Northern Elbe passes the [[Elbe Philharmonic Hall]] and is then crossed under by the [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|old Elbe Tunnel (Alter Elbtunnel)]], both in Hamburg's city centre. A bit more downstream the Low Elbe's two main [[anabranch]]es Northern Elbe and the K\u00f6hlbrand reunite south of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]-Altstadt, a locality of Hamburg. Right after both anabranches reunited the Low Elbe is passed under by the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|New Elbe Tunnel (Neuer Elbtunnel)]], the last structural road link crossing the river before the North Sea. At the bay [[M\u00fchlenberger Loch]] in Hamburg at kilometre 634, the Northern Elbe and the Southern Elbe (here now the cut-off meander Old Southern Elbe) used to reunite, which is why the bay is seen as the starting point of the [[Niederelbe|Lower Elbe]] (Niederelbe). Leaving the city-state the Lower Elbe then passes between [[Holstein]] and the [[Elbe-Weser Triangle]] with [[Stade]] until it flows into the North Sea at [[Cuxhaven]]. Near its mouth it passes the entrance to the [[Kiel Canal]] at [[Brunsb\u00fcttel]] before it debouches into the North Sea.\n\n{{wide image|River Elbe bend panorama.jpg|800px|View of the Elbe in [[Saxon Switzerland]], an area in Germany.|left}}\n\n==Towns and cities==\n[[File:Dresden-Altstadt von der Marienbruecke-II.jpg|thumb|The Elbe passing [[Dresden]].]]\n[[File:Elbe in Wittenberg.jpg|thumb|Elbe near [[Wittenberg]]]]\n[[File:CTB-CTW Port of Hamburg-Waltershof.jpg|thumb|The [[Port of Hamburg]] on the Elbe]]\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:0; font-size:100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Key\n|- \n!

The river is linked by [[canal]]s ([[Elbe Lateral Canal]], [[Elbe-Havel Canal]], [[Mittellandkanal]]) to the industrial areas of Germany and to [[Berlin]]. The [[Elbe-L\u00fcbeck Canal]] links the Elbe to the [[Baltic Sea]], as does the [[Kiel Canal]], whose western entrance is near the mouth of the Elbe. The [[Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel]] connects the Elbe with the [[Weser]].\n\nBy the [[Treaty of Versailles#International organizations|Treaty of Versailles]] the navigation on the Elbe became subject to the International Commission of the Elbe, seated in Dresden.<ref>The commission was staffed with two representatives of Czechoslovakia and one representative of [[Free State of Anhalt|Anhalt]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], Hamburg, [[Italy]], [[Free State of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]], and the United Kingdom each, with Czecholosvakia and the German states being those, whose territory was crossed by the Elbe and thus competent for maintaining navigation installations.

The contract of lease with Germany, and supervised by the [[United Kingdom]], was signed on February 14, 1929 ending in 2028. Since 1993 the Czech Republic holds the former Czechoslovak legal position.\n\nBefore Germany was reunited, waterway transport in Western Germany was hindered by the fact that [[inland navigation]] to Hamburg had to pass through the German Democratic Republic. The Elbe-Seitenkanal (Elbe Lateral Canal) was built between the West German section of the Mittellandkanal and the Lower Elbe to restore this connection. When the two nations were reunited, works were begun to improve and restore the original links: the [[Magdeburg Water Bridge]] now allows large barges to cross the Elbe without having to enter the river.

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] knew the river as the ''{{lang|la|Albis}}''; however, they made only one serious [[Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|attempt to move the border of their empire]] forward from the [[Rhine]] to the Elbe, and this attempt failed with the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9&nbsp;AD, after which they never seriously tried again. In the [[Middle Ages]] the Elbe formed the eastern limit of the [[Carolingian Empire|Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]] (King of the Franks from 769 to 814). The river's navigable sections were essential to the success of the [[Hanseatic League]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]], and much trade was carried on its waters.\n\nFrom the early 6th century [[Slavic tribes]] (known as the [[Polabian Slavs]]) settled in the areas east of the rivers Elbe and Saale (which had been depopulated since the 4th century). In the 10th century the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] (dominant from 919 to 1024) began conquering these lands; a slow process of [[Germanization]] ensued, including the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147.\n\nThe Elbe delineated the western parts of Germany from the eastern so-called [[East Elbia]], where [[soccage]] and [[serfdom]] were more strict and prevailed longer than westwards of the river, and where feudal lords held bigger estates than in the west. Thus incumbents of huge land-holdings became characterised{{when|date=November 2019}} as East Elbian [[Junker]]s. The [[Northern Germany|Northern German]] area north of the Lower Elbe used to be called [[Nordalbingia|North Albingia]] in the Middle Ages. When the four [[Lutheran]] [[Landeskirche|church bodies]] there united in 1977 they chose the name [[North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. Other, administrative units were named after the river Elbe, such as the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalian]] ''Elbe [[d\u00e9partement]]'' (1807\u20131813) and ''Lower Elbe d\u00e9partement'' (1810), and the French d\u00e9partement [[Bouches-de-l'Elbe]] (1811\u20131814).\n\nIn 1945, as [[World War II]] drew to a close, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] territory came under attack from the armies of the [[western Allies]] advancing from the west and those of the [[Soviet Union]] advancing from the east. On 25 April 1945 these two forces linked up near [[Torgau]], on the Elbe. The victorious countries marked the event unofficially as [[Elbe Day]]. From 1949 to 1990 the Elbe formed part of the [[Inner German border]] between [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the Soviet Union stated that [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ashes had been scattered in the Elbe following disinterment from their original burial-site.<ref>Hans Meissner, ''Magda Goebbels, First Lady of the Third Reich'', 260\u2013277</ref><ref>\n{{cite news |title= Official: KGB chief ordered Hitler's remains destroyed | author= Maxim Tkachenko |newspaper= CNN |date= 11 December 2009 |url= http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/12/11/russia.hitler.remains/index.html |accessdate= 11 December 2009 }}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[2002 European floods]]\n* [[2006 European floods]]\n* [[2013 European floods]]\n* [[Saxon Elbeland]], the region of the Upper Elbe in Germany\n* [[List of waterbodies in Saxony-Anhalt]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last= Rada|first= Uwe|date= 2013|title= Die Elbe.

They include [[mnemonic]]s, which aid the retention of lists of information; effective reading; concentration techniques;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0993496424|edition=Second}}</ref> and efficient note taking.<ref>http://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/site/colleges/seh/freshinfo/vs/StudySkills2008b.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319212840/http://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/site/colleges/seh/freshinfo/vs/StudySkills2008b.pdf |date=March 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWhile often left up to the student and their support network, study skills are increasingly taught in [[high school]] and at the [[university]] level. \n\nMore broadly, any skill which boosts a person's ability to study, retain and recall information which assists in and passing exams can be termed a study skill, and this could include [[time management]] and motivational techniques.\n\nStudy skills are discrete techniques that can be learned, usually in a short time, and applied to all or most fields of study.  They must, therefore, be distinguished from strategies that are specific to a particular field of study (e.g. music or technology), and from abilities inherent in the student, such as aspects of intelligence or [[learning styles]].\n\n== Historical context ==\nThe term ''study skills'' is used for general approaches to learning, skills for specific courses of study.  There are many theoretical works on the subject, including a vast number of popular books and websites.  Manuals for students have been published since the 1940s {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, college instructors in the fields of psychology and the study of education used to research, theory, and experience with their own students in writing manuals.<ref>, Preston, Rah (1959).

The act of memorization is often a deliberate mental process undertaken in order to store in memory for later recall items such as experiences, names, appointments, addresses, telephone numbers, lists, stories, poems, pictures, maps, diagrams, facts, music or other visual, auditory, or tactical information. Memorization may also refer to the process of storing particular data into the memory of a device. \nOne of the most basic approaches to learning any information is simply to repeat it by rote.  Typically this will include reading over notes or a textbook and re-writing notes.\n\n=== Reading and listening ===\n<!-- [[PQRST (study skill)]] links here! -->\n\nThe weakness of rote learning is that it implies a passive reading and listening style. Educators such as [[John Dewey]] have argued that students need to learn [[critical thinking]] \u2013 questioning and weighing up evidence as they learn. This can be done during lectures or when reading books.\n\nA method that is useful during the first interaction with the subject of study is '''REAP method'''. This method helps students to improve their understanding of the text and bridge the idea with that of the author's. REAP is an acronym for '''R'''ead, '''E'''ncode, '''A'''nnotate and '''P'''onder.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sheryn Spencer-Waterman|title=Handbook on Differentiated Instruction for Middle & High Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSIEAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA61|date=9 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-93008-2|page=61}}</ref>\n\n#'''Read''': Reading a section to discern the idea.\n#'''Encode''': Paraphrasing the idea from the author's perspective to the student's own words.\n#'''Annotate''': Annotating the section with critical understanding and other relevant notes.\n#'''Ponder''': To ponder about what they read through thinking, discussing with others and reading related materials. Thus it allows the possibility of elaboration and fulfillment of [[zone of proximal development]].\n\nAnnotating and Encoding helps the student reprocess the content into concise and coherent knowledge which adds a meaningful symbolic fund of knowledge. Precise annotation, Organizing question annotation, Intentional annotation, and Probe annotation are some of the annotation methods used.\n\n[[File:Studying.jpg|thumb|right|A student of the [[University of British Columbia]] studies for his final exams using the PQRST method.]]\n\nA method used to focus on key information when studying from books uncritically is the '''PQRST method'''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chennai/Students_tackle_stress_as_board_exams_draw/articleshow/3949131.cms | work=The Times Of India | first1=Karthika | last1=Gopalakrishnan | title=Students tackle stress as board exams draw | date=2009-01-08}}</ref>  This method prioritizes the information in a way that relates directly to how they will be asked to use that information in an exam.  PQRST is an acronym for '''P'''review, '''Q'''uestion, '''R'''ead, '''S'''ummary, '''T'''est.<ref name=\"stangl1\">{{cite web|url=http://arbeitsblaetter.stangl-taller.at/LERNTECHNIK/PQRST.shtml|title=The PQRST Method of Studying|last=Stangl|first=Werner|publisher=stangl-taller.at}} {{cite book|author1=Robinson, Francis Pleasant|year=1970|title= Effective study|location=New York|publisher= Harper & Row}}</ref>\n\n#'''Preview:''' The student looks at the topic to be learned by glancing over the major headings or the points in the syllabus.\n#'''Question:''' The student formulates questions to be answered following a thorough examination of the topic(s).\n#'''Read:''' The student reads through the related material, focusing on the information that best relates to the questions formulated earlier.\n#'''Summary:''' The student summarizes the topic, bringing his or her own understanding of the process.  This may include written notes, spider diagrams, flow diagrams, labeled diagrams, [[mnemonics]], or even voice recordings.\n#'''Test:''' The student answers the questions drafted earlier, avoiding adding any questions that might distract or change the subject.\n\nThere are a variety of studies from different colleges nationwide that show peer-communication can help increase better study habits tremendously. One study shows that an average of 73% score increase was recorded by those who were enrolled in the classes surveyed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nSpeed reading, while trainable, results in lower accuracy, comprehension, and understanding.<ref>https://espressoscience.com/2017/02/15/the-fiction-and-facts-of-speed-reading/</ref>\n\n=== Flashcard training ===\n\n'''Flashcards''' are visual cues on cards.  These have numerous uses in teaching and learning but can be used for revision.  Students often make their own [[flashcard]]s, or more detailed '''index cards''' \u2013 cards designed for filing, often A5 size, on which short summaries are written.  Being discrete and separate, they have the advantage of allowing students to re-order them, pick a selection to read over, or choose randomly for self-testing.  Software equivalents can be used.\n\n=== Summary methods ===\n\nSummary methods vary depending on the topic, but most involve condensing the large amount of information from a course or book into shorter notes.  Often, these notes are then condensed further into key facts.\n\n'''Organized summaries:''' Such as [[outline (list)|outlines]] showing [[Index term|keywords]] and definitions and relations, usually in a [[tree structure]].\n\n'''Spider diagrams:''' Using [[spider diagram]]s or [[mind map]]s can be an effective way of linking concepts together. They can be useful for planning essays and essay responses in exams.  These tools can give a visual summary of a topic that preserves its logical structure, with lines used to show how different parts link together.\n\n===Visual imagery ===\n\nSome learners are thought to have a visual [[learning style]], and will benefit greatly from taking information from their studies which are often heavily verbal, and using [[Mental image|visual techniques]] to help encode and retain it in memory.\n\nSome memory techniques make use of visual memory, for example the [[method of loci]], a system of visualising key information in real physical locations e.g. around a room.\n\n'''Diagrams''' are often underrated tools.{{cn|date=May 2018}} They can be used to bring all the information together and provide practice reorganizing what has been learned in order to produce something practical and useful. They can also aid the recall of information learned very quickly, particularly if the student made the diagram while studying the information.  Pictures can then be transferred to flashcards that are very effective last-minute revision tools rather than rereading any written material.\n\n=== Acronyms and mnemonics ===\n\nA '''mnemonic''' is a method of organizing and memorizing information.  Some use a simple phrase or fact as a trigger for a longer list of information.  For example, the cardinal points of the [[compass]] can be recalled in the correct order with the phrase \"'''N'''ever '''E'''at '''S'''hredded '''W'''heat\".  Starting with '''North''', the first letter of each word relates to a compass point in clockwise order round a compass. \n\n===Exam strategies ===\n\nThe '''Black-Red-Green method''' (developed through the Royal Literary Fund) helps the student to ensure that every aspect of the question posed has been considered, both in [[exam]]s and essays.<ref>Royal Literary Fund: ''Mission Possible: the Study Skills Pack'' http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/mission_possible.cfm</ref>  The student underlines relevant parts of the question using three separate colors (or some equivalent).  '''BLA'''ck denotes ''''BLA'''tant instructions', i.e. something that clearly must be done; a directive or obvious instruction. '''RE'''d is a '''RE'''ference Point or '''RE'''quired input of some kind, usually to do with definitions, terms, cited authors, theory, etc. (either explicitly referred to or strongly implied).  '''GRE'''en denotes '''GRE'''mlins, which are subtle signals one might easily miss, or a \u2018'''GRE'''EN Light\u2019 that gives a hint on how to proceed, or where to place the emphasis in answers [https://web.archive.org/web/20061004191812/http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/documents/answerquestionb.pdf]. Another popular method whilst studying is to P.E.E; Point, evidence and explain, reason being, this helps the student break down exam questions allowing them to maximize their marks/grade during the exam. Many Schools will encourage practicing the P.E. BEing method prior to an exam.\n\n=== Spacing ===\n'''Spacing''', also called '''distributed learning''' by some; helps individuals remember at least as much if not more information for a longer period of time than using only one study skill. Using spacing in addition to other study methods can improve retention and performance on tests.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Spacing is especially useful for retaining and recalling new material.<ref name=\":0\" /> The theory of spacing is that instead of cramming all studying into one long study session an individual would split that single session to a few shorter sessions that are hours, if not days apart. Studying will not last longer than it would have originally and one is not working harder but this tool gives the user the ability to remember and recall things for a longer time period. The science behind this; according to Jost\u2019s Law from 1897 \u201cIf two associations are of equal strength but of different age, a new repetition has a greater value for the older one\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=68}}</ref> This means that if a person were to study two things once, at different times, the one studied most recently will be easier to recall.\n\n=== Time management, organization and lifestyle changes<ref>College Success: Study Strategies and Skills, Jean A. Reynolds, \u00a91996 by Allyn & Bacon, Boston</ref> ===\n\nOften, improvements to the effectiveness of study may be achieved through changes to things unrelated to the study material itself, such as [[Time management|time-management]], boosting [[motivation]] and avoiding [[procrastination]], and in improvements to [[sleep]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].\n\nTime management in study sessions aims to ensure that activities that achieve the greatest benefit are given the greatest focus.  A '''traffic lights''' system is a simple way of identifying the importance of information, highlighting or underlining information in colours:\n* Green: topics to be studied first; important and also simple\n* Amber: topics to be studied next; important but time-consuming\n* Red: lowest priority; complex and not vital.\n\nThis reminds students to start with the things which will provide the quickest benefit, while 'red' topics are only dealt with if time allows.  The concept is similar to the [[ABC analysis]], commonly used by workers to help prioritize. Also, some websites (such as [[FlashNotes]]) can be used for additional study materials and may help improve time management and increase motivation.\n\nIn addition to time management, sleep is important; getting adequate rest improves memorisation.<ref>[https://www.teenlife.com/blogs/articles/how-study-more-efficiently Study Efficiently] TeenLife Media, January, 2015</ref> Students are generally more productive in the morning than the afternoon. <ref>http://home.uchicago.edu/~npope/morning_afternoon.pdf</ref>\n\nIn addition to time management and sleep, emotional state of mind can matter when a student is studying. If an individual is calm or nervous in class; replicating that emotion can assist in studying. With replicating the emotion an individual is more likely to recall more information if they are in the same state of mind when in class. This also goes the other direction; if one is upset but normally calm in class it\u2019s much better to wait until they are feeling calmer to study. At the time of the test or class they will remember more. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=47}}</ref> \n\n=== Study environment ===\nStudying can also be more effective if one changes their environment while studying. For example: the first time studying the material, one can study in a bedroom, the second time one can study outside, and the final time one can study in a coffee shop.

They must, therefore, be distinguished from strategies that are specific to a particular field of study (e.g. music or technology), and from abilities inherent in the student, such as aspects of intelligence or [[learning styles]].\n\n== Historical context ==\nThe term ''study skills'' is used for general approaches to learning, skills for specific courses of study.  There are many theoretical works on the subject, including a vast number of popular books and websites.  Manuals for students have been published since the 1940s {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, college instructors in the fields of psychology and the study of education used to research, theory, and experience with their own students in writing manuals.<ref>, Preston, Rah (1959). ''Teaching Study Habits and Skills'', Rinehart. Original from the University of Maryland digitized August 7, 2006.</ref><ref>Kranyik, Robert and Shankman, Florence V. (1963).

A work in two volumes, one for upper elementary grades and the other for middle school, the ''Guide'' has methods for taking tests and completing schoolwork.<ref>Gruber, Gary (1986).

The act of memorization is often a deliberate mental process undertaken in order to store in memory for later recall items such as experiences, names, appointments, addresses, telephone numbers, lists, stories, poems, pictures, maps, diagrams, facts, music or other visual, auditory, or tactical information. Memorization may also refer to the process of storing particular data into the memory of a device. \nOne of the most basic approaches to learning any information is simply to repeat it by rote.  Typically this will include reading over notes or a textbook and re-writing notes.\n\n=== Reading and listening ===\n<!-- [[PQRST (study skill)]] links here! -->\n\nThe weakness of rote learning is that it implies a passive reading and listening style. Educators such as [[John Dewey]] have argued that students need to learn [[critical thinking]] \u2013 questioning and weighing up evidence as they learn. This can be done during lectures or when reading books.\n\nA method that is useful during the first interaction with the subject of study is '''REAP method'''. This method helps students to improve their understanding of the text and bridge the idea with that of the author's. REAP is an acronym for '''R'''ead, '''E'''ncode, '''A'''nnotate and '''P'''onder.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sheryn Spencer-Waterman|title=Handbook on Differentiated Instruction for Middle & High Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSIEAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA61|date=9 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-93008-2|page=61}}</ref>\n\n#'''Read''': Reading a section to discern the idea.\n#'''Encode''': Paraphrasing the idea from the author's perspective to the student's own words.\n#'''Annotate''': Annotating the section with critical understanding and other relevant notes.\n#'''Ponder''': To ponder about what they read through thinking, discussing with others and reading related materials. Thus it allows the possibility of elaboration and fulfillment of [[zone of proximal development]].\n\nAnnotating and Encoding helps the student reprocess the content into concise and coherent knowledge which adds a meaningful symbolic fund of knowledge. Precise annotation, Organizing question annotation, Intentional annotation, and Probe annotation are some of the annotation methods used.\n\n[[File:Studying.jpg|thumb|right|A student of the [[University of British Columbia]] studies for his final exams using the PQRST method.]]\n\nA method used to focus on key information when studying from books uncritically is the '''PQRST method'''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chennai/Students_tackle_stress_as_board_exams_draw/articleshow/3949131.cms | work=The Times Of India | first1=Karthika | last1=Gopalakrishnan | title=Students tackle stress as board exams draw | date=2009-01-08}}</ref>  This method prioritizes the information in a way that relates directly to how they will be asked to use that information in an exam.  PQRST is an acronym for '''P'''review, '''Q'''uestion, '''R'''ead, '''S'''ummary, '''T'''est.<ref name=\"stangl1\">{{cite web|url=http://arbeitsblaetter.stangl-taller.at/LERNTECHNIK/PQRST.shtml|title=The PQRST Method of Studying|last=Stangl|first=Werner|publisher=stangl-taller.at}} {{cite book|author1=Robinson, Francis Pleasant|year=1970|title= Effective study|location=New York|publisher= Harper & Row}}</ref>\n\n#'''Preview:''' The student looks at the topic to be learned by glancing over the major headings or the points in the syllabus.\n#'''Question:''' The student formulates questions to be answered following a thorough examination of the topic(s).\n#'''Read:''' The student reads through the related material, focusing on the information that best relates to the questions formulated earlier.\n#'''Summary:''' The student summarizes the topic, bringing his or her own understanding of the process.  This may include written notes, spider diagrams, flow diagrams, labeled diagrams, [[mnemonics]], or even voice recordings.\n#'''Test:''' The student answers the questions drafted earlier, avoiding adding any questions that might distract or change the subject.\n\nThere are a variety of studies from different colleges nationwide that show peer-communication can help increase better study habits tremendously. One study shows that an average of 73% score increase was recorded by those who were enrolled in the classes surveyed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nSpeed reading, while trainable, results in lower accuracy, comprehension, and understanding.<ref>https://espressoscience.com/2017/02/15/the-fiction-and-facts-of-speed-reading/</ref>\n\n=== Flashcard training ===\n\n'''Flashcards''' are visual cues on cards.  These have numerous uses in teaching and learning but can be used for revision.  Students often make their own [[flashcard]]s, or more detailed '''index cards''' \u2013 cards designed for filing, often A5 size, on which short summaries are written.  Being discrete and separate, they have the advantage of allowing students to re-order them, pick a selection to read over, or choose randomly for self-testing.  Software equivalents can be used.\n\n=== Summary methods ===\n\nSummary methods vary depending on the topic, but most involve condensing the large amount of information from a course or book into shorter notes.  Often, these notes are then condensed further into key facts.\n\n'''Organized summaries:''' Such as [[outline (list)|outlines]] showing [[Index term|keywords]] and definitions and relations, usually in a [[tree structure]].\n\n'''Spider diagrams:''' Using [[spider diagram]]s or [[mind map]]s can be an effective way of linking concepts together. They can be useful for planning essays and essay responses in exams.  These tools can give a visual summary of a topic that preserves its logical structure, with lines used to show how different parts link together.\n\n===Visual imagery ===\n\nSome learners are thought to have a visual [[learning style]], and will benefit greatly from taking information from their studies which are often heavily verbal, and using [[Mental image|visual techniques]] to help encode and retain it in memory.\n\nSome memory techniques make use of visual memory, for example the [[method of loci]], a system of visualising key information in real physical locations e.g. around a room.\n\n'''Diagrams''' are often underrated tools.{{cn|date=May 2018}} They can be used to bring all the information together and provide practice reorganizing what has been learned in order to produce something practical and useful. They can also aid the recall of information learned very quickly, particularly if the student made the diagram while studying the information.  Pictures can then be transferred to flashcards that are very effective last-minute revision tools rather than rereading any written material.\n\n=== Acronyms and mnemonics ===\n\nA '''mnemonic''' is a method of organizing and memorizing information.  Some use a simple phrase or fact as a trigger for a longer list of information.  For example, the cardinal points of the [[compass]] can be recalled in the correct order with the phrase \"'''N'''ever '''E'''at '''S'''hredded '''W'''heat\".  Starting with '''North''', the first letter of each word relates to a compass point in clockwise order round a compass. \n\n===Exam strategies ===\n\nThe '''Black-Red-Green method''' (developed through the Royal Literary Fund) helps the student to ensure that every aspect of the question posed has been considered, both in [[exam]]s and essays.<ref>Royal Literary Fund: ''Mission Possible: the Study Skills Pack'' http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/mission_possible.cfm</ref>  The student underlines relevant parts of the question using three separate colors (or some equivalent).  '''BLA'''ck denotes ''''BLA'''tant instructions', i.e. something that clearly must be done; a directive or obvious instruction. '''RE'''d is a '''RE'''ference Point or '''RE'''quired input of some kind, usually to do with definitions, terms, cited authors, theory, etc. (either explicitly referred to or strongly implied).  '''GRE'''en denotes '''GRE'''mlins, which are subtle signals one might easily miss, or a \u2018'''GRE'''EN Light\u2019 that gives a hint on how to proceed, or where to place the emphasis in answers [https://web.archive.org/web/20061004191812/http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/documents/answerquestionb.pdf]. Another popular method whilst studying is to P.E.E; Point, evidence and explain, reason being, this helps the student break down exam questions allowing them to maximize their marks/grade during the exam. Many Schools will encourage practicing the P.E. BEing method prior to an exam.\n\n=== Spacing ===\n'''Spacing''', also called '''distributed learning''' by some; helps individuals remember at least as much if not more information for a longer period of time than using only one study skill. Using spacing in addition to other study methods can improve retention and performance on tests.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Spacing is especially useful for retaining and recalling new material.<ref name=\":0\" /> The theory of spacing is that instead of cramming all studying into one long study session an individual would split that single session to a few shorter sessions that are hours, if not days apart. Studying will not last longer than it would have originally and one is not working harder but this tool gives the user the ability to remember and recall things for a longer time period. The science behind this; according to Jost\u2019s Law from 1897 \u201cIf two associations are of equal strength but of different age, a new repetition has a greater value for the older one\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=68}}</ref> This means that if a person were to study two things once, at different times, the one studied most recently will be easier to recall.\n\n=== Time management, organization and lifestyle changes<ref>College Success: Study Strategies and Skills, Jean A. Reynolds, \u00a91996 by Allyn & Bacon, Boston</ref> ===\n\nOften, improvements to the effectiveness of study may be achieved through changes to things unrelated to the study material itself, such as [[Time management|time-management]], boosting [[motivation]] and avoiding [[procrastination]], and in improvements to [[sleep]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].\n\nTime management in study sessions aims to ensure that activities that achieve the greatest benefit are given the greatest focus.  A '''traffic lights''' system is a simple way of identifying the importance of information, highlighting or underlining information in colours:\n* Green: topics to be studied first; important and also simple\n* Amber: topics to be studied next; important but time-consuming\n* Red: lowest priority; complex and not vital.\n\nThis reminds students to start with the things which will provide the quickest benefit, while 'red' topics are only dealt with if time allows.  The concept is similar to the [[ABC analysis]], commonly used by workers to help prioritize. Also, some websites (such as [[FlashNotes]]) can be used for additional study materials and may help improve time management and increase motivation.\n\nIn addition to time management, sleep is important; getting adequate rest improves memorisation.<ref>[https://www.teenlife.com/blogs/articles/how-study-more-efficiently Study Efficiently] TeenLife Media, January, 2015</ref> Students are generally more productive in the morning than the afternoon. <ref>http://home.uchicago.edu/~npope/morning_afternoon.pdf</ref>\n\nIn addition to time management and sleep, emotional state of mind can matter when a student is studying. If an individual is calm or nervous in class; replicating that emotion can assist in studying. With replicating the emotion an individual is more likely to recall more information if they are in the same state of mind when in class. This also goes the other direction; if one is upset but normally calm in class it\u2019s much better to wait until they are feeling calmer to study. At the time of the test or class they will remember more. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=47}}</ref> \n\n=== Study environment ===\nStudying can also be more effective if one changes their environment while studying. For example: the first time studying the material, one can study in a bedroom, the second time one can study outside, and the final time one can study in a coffee shop. The thinking behind this is that as when an individual changes their environment the brain associates different aspects of the learning and gives a stronger hold and additional brain pathways with which to access the information. In this context environment can mean many things; from location, to sounds, to smells, to other stimuli including foods.

(October 9, 1982) [[New York Times]] ''[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50912F63D5F0C7A8CDDA90994DA484D81 U.S. plans a new drive on narcotics.]'' Section: 1; Page 18.

The Director advises the President regarding changes in the organization, management, budgeting, and personnel of federal agencies that affect U.S. anti-drug efforts; and regarding federal agency compliance with their obligations under the National Drug Control Strategy, an annual report required by law. The most recent director is [[James W. Carroll|James. W. Carroll]], who took over from former director [[Michael Botticelli]]. The Fiscal Year 2011 National Drug Control Budget proposed by the Obama Administration would devote significant new resources to the prevention and treatment of drug abuse. These resources are complemented by an aggressive effort to enhance domestic law enforcement, interdiction, and supply control programs. New resources, $340 million, are added to the prevention and treatment of drug use.<ref>[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/policy/11budget/fy11factsheet.pdf FY 2011 Drug Control Program Highlights]</ref><ref>[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press10/020110.html Administration's FY 2011 Budget Proposal Demonstrates Balanced Approach to Drug Control February 1, 2010]</ref>\n\n== Programs ==\n[[File:ONDCP Pothead.gif|thumb|A [[National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign]] poster circa 2000 concerning [[cannabis in the United States]].]]\nThe programs directed by the ONDCP include:\n* the [[High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area]]s (HIDTA) program\n* the [[National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign]], a current domestic government [[propaganda]] campaign in the US\n* the Drug Free Communities Program\n* Anti-Doping Activities\n* [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) dues\n\n== Congressional issues ==\n=== Bi-partisan support for Drug Czar ===\nThe [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988]], which created the Office of National Drug Control Policy, was the product of bi-partisan support. It was co-sponsored in the House of Representatives by parties' leaders, [[Tom Foley]] and [[Robert Michel]],<ref name=\"congress\">[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d100:HR05210:|TOM:/bss/d100query.html Bill History for H.R. 5210, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988].</ref> and it passed by margins of 346\u201311 and 87\u20133 in the House and Senate, respectively.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d100:HR05210:@@@R Major Congressional Actions for H.R. 5210, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988].</ref> Upon signing the law, [[Ronald Reagan]] said, \"This bill is the product of a bipartisan effort.\"<ref name=\"signing statement\">[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1988/111888c.htm President Reagan's signing statement]</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\nIn September 2002, the [[Senate Appropriations Committee]] recommended that salaries and expenses at ONDCP be reduced from $26.6 million in fiscal 2006 to $11.5 million in fiscal 2007, to \"more closely reflect actual performance.\" Committee members said they would request funding for a study of ONDCP by the [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)|National Academy of Public Administration]]. They also ordered a [[Government Accountability Office]] study on the distribution of grants. Plus, they directed the Director to provide quarterly updates on travel expenditures, staffing levels and plans for future hirings.<ref name=\"WP-9-12-06\">Kevin Freking, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/12/AR2006091201394.html \"Panel Advises Cutting Salaries at Agency\"], ''Washington Post'', September 12, 2006</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the ONDCP requested funding for 98 full-time employees, 64 (65.31%) of whom would be paid at either [[GS levels#Salary Calculation|GS-15, GS-14]], or [[Senior Executive Service#Pay rates|SES]] pay grades, or more than $105,211.00 yearly, being adjusted for Washington, D.C. cost of living expenses.<ref>[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/policy/FY12_congress_budget_submission.pdf Office of National Drug Control Policy Fiscal Year 2012 Appropriations Request (PDF file)]</ref>\n\n=== High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Program ===\nIn 2005, the Bush Administration proposed transferring the $225 million High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Program from ONDCP to the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. The program gives additional money to communities with chronic illicit drug sales. According to the ''Washington Post'', \"Many lawmakers oppose the transfer for fear the program would become less of a priority.\"<ref name=\"WP-9-12-06\"/>\n\n=== Anti-legalization Policy ===\nBy law, the drug czar must oppose any attempt to legalize the use (in any form) of illicit drugs.<ref>[http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/drug-czar-required/ The Drug Czar is required by law to lie]</ref> According to the \"Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998\"<ref>[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/about/98reauthorization.html Title VII Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998]</ref> the director of the ONDCP\n<blockquote>(12) shall ensure that no Federal funds appropriated to the Office of National Drug Control Policy shall be expended for any study or contract relating to the legalization (for a medical use or any other use) of a substance listed in schedule I of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and take such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use of a substance (in any form) that \u2013\n\n1. is listed in schedule I of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812); and\n2. has not been approved for use for medical purposes by the Food and Drug Administration;</blockquote>\n\nThe Government Accountability Office has found that this law authorizes the ONDCP to disseminate information in order to oppose legalization:<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/products/A09471 Application of Anti-Lobbying Laws to the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Open Letter to State Level Prosecutors, B-301022, March 10, 2004]</ref>\n<blockquote>Finally, apart from considerations of whether any particular law has been violated, you have asked whether the Deputy Director's letter disseminated misleading information in connection with statements relating to the debate over legalization of marijuana. Clearly, the Deputy Director's statements reflect one perspective regarding marijuana \u2013 a perspective that is disputed by others with different viewpoints. However, ONDCP is specifically charged with the responsibility for \"taking such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use\" of certain controlled substances such as marijuana \u2013 a responsibility which logically could include the making of advocacy statements in opposition to legalization efforts.

Walters blamed poor ads that weren't resonating with teenagers. Walters promised in Senate testimony in 2002 that he would show results within a year or admit failure, and Congress agreed to extend the campaign through 2003 while cutting funding for the ads from $170 million in 2002 to $150 million in 2003.

They developed an accounting system to decide which network shows would be valued and for how much. Receiving advance copies of scripts, they assigned financial value to each show's anti-drug message. Then they would suggest ways that the networks could increase the payments they would get. The [[The WB Television Network|WB]] network's senior vice president for broadcast standards Rick Mater admitted, \"The White House did view scripts.

Specifically, MPP argued that Nevada [[campaign finance]] laws required the Drug Czar to reveal how much taxpayer money he had spent to defeat the initiative. In April 2003, the [[Nevada Attorney General]] concluded that the Drug Czar was not required to comply with Nevada's campaign finance laws. MPP filed a [[writ of mandamus]] as an appeal of the decision. The [[Nevada Supreme Court]] issued an order declaring that MPP had \"set forth issues of arguable merit\" in its writ; however, on August 18, 2004, the Court declared that it was \"not satisfied that [the] court's intervention by way of extraordinary relief is warranted\".<ref name=\"MPP\">[http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ \"MPP's first victory in 'War on Drug Czar' campaign is short-lived; Nevada Supreme Court order allows Drug Czar to ignore state campaign finance laws\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305222609/http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ |date=2005-03-05 }}, Marijuana Policy Project</ref>\n\nA February 24, 2005 MPP press release announced that the group had filed similar complaints in [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[Alaska]], accusing the Drug Czar of failing to make legally required campaign expense disclosures:<ref>[http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ War On Drug Czar<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305222609/http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ |date=2005-03-05 }}</ref>\n:''On October 5, 2004, the drug czar traveled to Oregon for the purpose of opposing Measure 33, a ballot measure designed to expand the state's medical marijuana program.

Clearly, the Deputy Director's statements reflect one perspective regarding marijuana - a perspective that is disputed by others with different viewpoints. However, ONDCP is specifically charged with the responsibility for \"taking such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use\" of certain controlled substances such as marijuana - a responsibility which logically could include the making of advocacy statements in opposition to legalization efforts. The Deputy Director's statements about marijuana are thus within the statutory role assigned to ONDCP. Given this role, we do not see a need to examine the accuracy of the Deputy Director's individual statements in detail.</blockquote>\n\n==Effectiveness of ONDCP==\n=== Extent of drug use in the U.S. ===\nIn September 2006, the office reported that the 2005 survey of 67,500 people found that 8.1 percent reported using an illicit drug in the 30 days prior to being asked about their drug use, which equates to 19.7 million people nationwide (age 12 and older). The percentage was up slightly compared to 2004. Youth drug use declined for the third year in a row.<ref>Kevin Freking, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090700552.html \"Drug Use Up for Boomers, Down for Teens\"], ''Washington Post'', September 7, 2006</ref> While the ONDCP measures their efficacy against prior use statistics within the U.S., they do not publicize how these statistics compare against other countries at the time in their communications to the press. In 2008, ONDCP reported that actual youth drug use, as measured as the percent reporting past month use, has declined from 19.4% to 14.8% among middle and high school students between 2001 and 2007.<ref>[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/successes_challenges/successes_challenges.pdf Office of National Drug Control Policy Executive Office of the President: CURRENT STATE OF DRUG POLICY: SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES, March 2008]</ref>\n\n===Anti-marijuana advertising===\nIn August 2001, the office told a Congressional committee that its [[National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign]] \"has been the most visible symbol of the federal government's commitment to drug prevention,\" and that the office was \"investing $7 million a year in performance measurement to determine the effectiveness\" of the campaign. The statement by said \"We believe there is a strong body of evidence that indicates the campaign is working, as planned, to change drug attitudes, intentions and use.\"<ref>[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/NEWS/testimony01/080101/content.html \"National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign: How to Ensure the Program Operates Efficiently and Effectively\"], Testimony to Congress, August 1, 2001</ref>\n\nIn 2002, according to a multiyear study by the research firm hired by the office, teenagers exposed to federal anti-drug ads were no less likely to use drugs for having viewed them, and some young girls said they were even more likely to give drugs a try. Walters blamed poor ads that weren't resonating with teenagers. Walters promised in Senate testimony in 2002 that he would show results within a year or admit failure, and Congress agreed to extend the campaign through 2003 while cutting funding for the ads from $170 million in 2002 to $150 million in 2003. An entirely new advertising campaign was created.<ref>Shawn Zeller, [http://www.govexec.com/features/0903/0903s3.htm \"Ads, Drugs & Money\"], ''Government Executive'' magazine, September 19, 2003</ref>\n\nIn February 2005, a research company hired by the office and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] reported that the government's ad campaign aimed at dissuading teens from using marijuana, a campaign that cost $1.4 billion between 1998 and 2006, did not work: \"greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana.\" The research company was paid $42.7 million for the five-year study. After the February 2005 report was received, the office continued the ad campaign, spending $220 million on the anti-marijuana ads in fiscal years 2005 and 2006.<ref>[[Ryan Grim]], ''[http://www.slate.com/id/2148999/ A White House Drug Deal Gone Bad: Sitting on the Negative Results of a Study of Anti-Marijuana Ads]'', ''Slate'' magazine, September 7, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Other ===\nAccording to the [[University of Michigan]]'s annual Monitoring the Future report, the number of young people using drugs in the U.S. declined by 7 percent between 2001 and 2006,<ref>[http://monitoringthefuture.org/data/06data.html \"Monitoring the Future\" (MTF) survey, December 2006]</ref> though there is no evidence to suggest that government anti-drug programs that were started at the turn of the millennium helped cause this drop.\n\nWhile cocaine production in [[Colombia]] initially decreased with the onset of Plan Colombia, the [[United Nations]] declared that in 2005, despite record levels of eradication by the U.S., coca production increased to about {{convert|330|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}.<ref>\"Coca production up despite record eradication\" (''[[MSNBC]]''), June 2006</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n{{see also|Propaganda in the United States}}\n\n=== Paying for anti-drug messages in television shows ===\nIn the spring of 1998, the ONDCP began offering additional advertising dollars to networks that embedded anti-drug messages in their programming. They developed an accounting system to decide which network shows would be valued and for how much. Receiving advance copies of scripts, they assigned financial value to each show's anti-drug message. Then they would suggest ways that the networks could increase the payments they would get. The [[The WB Television Network|WB]] network's senior vice president for broadcast standards Rick Mater admitted, \"The White House did view scripts. They did sign off on them -- they read scripts, yes.\"<ref name=\"salonprop\">[http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/01/13/drugs/print.html '''Prime-time propaganda'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115151200/http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/01/13/drugs/print.html |date=2007-01-15 }}, January 13, 2000, [http://www.salon.com Salon.com]</ref>\n\nRunning the campaign for the ONDCP was Alan Levitt, who estimated that between 1998 and 2000 the networks received nearly $25 million in benefits.<ref name=\"salonprop\"/>\n\nOne example was with [[Warner Brothers]]' show, ''[[Smart Guy]]''. The original script portrayed two young people using drugs at a party. Originally depicted as cool and popular, after input from the drug office, \"We showed that they were losers and put them [hidden away to indulge in shamed secrecy] in a utility room.

Specifically, MPP argued that Nevada [[campaign finance]] laws required the Drug Czar to reveal how much taxpayer money he had spent to defeat the initiative. In April 2003, the [[Nevada Attorney General]] concluded that the Drug Czar was not required to comply with Nevada's campaign finance laws. MPP filed a [[writ of mandamus]] as an appeal of the decision. The [[Nevada Supreme Court]] issued an order declaring that MPP had \"set forth issues of arguable merit\" in its writ; however, on August 18, 2004, the Court declared that it was \"not satisfied that [the] court's intervention by way of extraordinary relief is warranted\".<ref name=\"MPP\">[http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ \"MPP's first victory in 'War on Drug Czar' campaign is short-lived; Nevada Supreme Court order allows Drug Czar to ignore state campaign finance laws\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305222609/http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ |date=2005-03-05 }}, Marijuana Policy Project</ref>\n\nA February 24, 2005 MPP press release announced that the group had filed similar complaints in [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[Alaska]], accusing the Drug Czar of failing to make legally required campaign expense disclosures:<ref>[http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ War On Drug Czar<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305222609/http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/ |date=2005-03-05 }}</ref>\n:''On October 5, 2004, the drug czar traveled to Oregon for the purpose of opposing Measure 33, a ballot measure designed to expand the state's medical marijuana program. On October 6, ONDCP Deputy Director Scott Burns traveled to Montana to campaign against Initiative 148, the medical marijuana measure passed by voters in November. And on October 13 and 14, Burns traveled to Alaska to oppose Measure 2, a measure to allow the state to tax and regulate the sale of marijuana. All of these trips were widely reported in the local press as being campaign stops in opposition to the reform initiatives.''\n\n=== Use of video news releases ===\nIn 2005, the [[Government Accountability Office]] found that the ONDCP had violated domestic [[propaganda]] and publicity prohibitions by preparing prepackaged [[video news releases|news stories]] that did not disclose to television viewers that the government had produced them, had illegally spent appropriations to develop, produce and distribute the covert propaganda but use of the term \"Drug Czar\" in the \"Video News Releases\" had not constituted unlawful self-aggrandizement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/303495.htm |title=Office of National Drug Control Policy--Video News Release |accessdate=2008-09-06 |date=2005-01-04 |publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office }}</ref>\n\nONDCP supporters such as Representatives [[Thomas M.

The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals.

Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Tournament results==\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
