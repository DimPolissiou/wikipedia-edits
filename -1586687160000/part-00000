{"title_page": "1939 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe '''Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, 1939''', was a [[by-election|parliamentary by-election]] held on 1 August 1939 for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], in [[South Wales]].\n\n==Vacancy==\nThe by-election was caused by the sitting member, [[Ivor Guest, 2nd Viscount Wimborne|Ivor Guest]], succeeding to a title that gave him a seat in the [[House of Lords]]. He had been MP for the constituency since winning the seat in 1935.\n\n==Election History==\nIvor Guest was elected as a 'National Government' candidate, supported by both local Conservative and Liberal Associations. Guest came from a political family that had in the past had a foot in both party camps, so his selection had been a natural choice. The local Liberal Association had not put forward a candidate for election since the 1929 general election and last won the seat in 1923. The Conservatives had won the seat in 1931, and the Labour party won the seat in 1929. When all three parties had fielded candidates, the election had been a close three-way contest.\nThe result at the last General election was:\n\n{{Election box begin|title=[[1935 United Kingdom general election|General election 1935]]: Brecon and Radnor<ref name=\"Craig, F.

The Conservatives wanted Hanning Philipps, and put him forward as candidate without consulting the Liberals. As a result, the local Liberal Association, which was affiliated to Sir John Simon's Liberal National organisation, formally decided to take no part in the by-election campaign. Philipps was the 35-year-old second son of [[Laurence Philipps, 1st Baron Milford|Baron Milford]], who had been educated at Eton.\nThe local Labour party needed to find a new candidate, as their last, [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Leslie Haden Guest]], had been elected in a [[1937 Islington North by-election|1937 by-election]] in the London constituency of [[Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington North]]. They chose as their new candidate, [[William Jackson, 1st Baron Jackson|William Jackson]], who was a farmer from the neighbouring Hereford constituency. Jackson had been a Liberal up until 1931, and was thus a more attractive option to Liberal voters than the Conservative Philipps.\n\n==Main Issues and Campaign==\nThe nature of the constituency meant that issues relating to Agriculture would be foremost in the campaign.  This placed the Labour campaign at an advantage as their candidate was a farmer and the Conservative candidate had no understanding of these issues; Hanning Philipps admitted at his adoption meeting that he knew nothing about farming. Jackson concentrated his campaign on the policy of guaranteed prices for farmers. \nThe absence of a Liberal candidate also allowed the Jackson campaign to appeal to those who favoured a [[Popular Front (UK)|Popular Front]] opposition to the Government that had been advocated by the likes of Sir Stafford Cripps.\n\n==Result==\nThe Labour party gained the seat from the National Government.\n{{Election box begin|title=[[1939 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election]]<ref name=\"Craig, F.

The local Conservatives, more mindful of the concerns of the local Liberals, chose as their candidate, another member of the Guest family, who had previously sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal.

He had been MP for the constituency since winning the seat in 1935.\n\n==Election History==\nIvor Guest was elected as a 'National Government' candidate, supported by both local Conservative and Liberal Associations. Guest came from a political family that had in the past had a foot in both party camps, so his selection had been a natural choice. The local Liberal Association had not put forward a candidate for election since the 1929 general election and last won the seat in 1923. The Conservatives had won the seat in 1931, and the Labour party won the seat in 1929. When all three parties had fielded candidates, the election had been a close three-way contest.\nThe result at the last General election was:\n\n{{Election box begin|title=[[1935 United Kingdom general election|General election 1935]]: Brecon and Radnor<ref name=\"Craig, F.

The Conservatives wanted Hanning Philipps, and put him forward as candidate without consulting the Liberals. As a result, the local Liberal Association, which was affiliated to Sir John Simon's Liberal National organisation, formally decided to take no part in the by-election campaign. Philipps was the 35-year-old second son of [[Laurence Philipps, 1st Baron Milford|Baron Milford]], who had been educated at Eton.\nThe local Labour party needed to find a new candidate, as their last, [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Leslie Haden Guest]], had been elected in a [[1937 Islington North by-election|1937 by-election]] in the London constituency of [[Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington North]]. They chose as their new candidate, [[William Jackson, 1st Baron Jackson|William Jackson]], who was a farmer from the neighbouring Hereford constituency. Jackson had been a Liberal up until 1931, and was thus a more attractive option to Liberal voters than the Conservative Philipps.\n\n==Main Issues and Campaign==\nThe nature of the constituency meant that issues relating to Agriculture would be foremost in the campaign.  This placed the Labour campaign at an advantage as their candidate was a farmer and the Conservative candidate had no understanding of these issues; Hanning Philipps admitted at his adoption meeting that he knew nothing about farming. Jackson concentrated his campaign on the policy of guaranteed prices for farmers. \nThe absence of a Liberal candidate also allowed the Jackson campaign to appeal to those who favoured a [[Popular Front (UK)|Popular Front]] opposition to the Government that had been advocated by the likes of Sir Stafford Cripps.\n\n==Result==\nThe Labour party gained the seat from the National Government.\n{{Election box begin|title=[[1939 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election]]<ref name=\"Craig, F.

The local Conservatives, more mindful of the concerns of the local Liberals, chose as their candidate, another member of the Guest family, who had previously sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal. However, by now, the local Liberal Association had ceased being supporters of the National Government and put up their own candidate.\n\n{{Election box begin|title=[[1945 United Kingdom general election|General election 1945]]: Brecon and Radnor<ref name=\"Craig, F.

The school is approximately {{convert|5|mi}} away from the intersection of two major highways, [[State Road 9 (Indiana)|State Road 9]] and [[U.S. Route 52]]; it draws students from as far as the vicinity of [[Fountaintown, Indiana|Fountaintown]].\n\n==District==\nAll Morristown and [[Waldron, Indiana|Waldron]] schools are part of [[Shelby Eastern Schools]]. The administration building is located very near [[Rays Crossing, Indiana|Rays Crossing]], and is almost equidistant from both Morristown and Waldron schools. Shelby Eastern School Corporation is one of four [[School districts|school corporations]] within Shelby County.\n\n==Education==\nMorristown Jr.-Sr. High School offers four types of degrees: the regular diploma, the Core 40 diploma, the Academic Honors Diploma, and the Technical Honors Diploma. Each of these has a separate set of criteria as defined by the [[Indiana Department of Education|Indiana State Board of Education]]. While most high schools offer a fair amount of [[AP courses]] for their students to take, Morristown High School is still struggling for these classes as well as for staff qualified to teach them.{{Citation needed}} As of 2007, the following AP classes are offered: [[AP United States History|US History]] (added 2005-06 school year), [[AP Calculus|Calculus AB]], [[AP Statistics|Statistics]], [[AP Literature|Literature]], [[AP English Language and Composition|Composition]]. [[Dual enrollment|Dual Credit]] courses have been hosted by [[Ivy Tech]], but students must pass the [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] with a certain score or pass the [[COMPASS]] exam in order to take the course.

Students are connected to another school by television and learn from a teacher in a completely different location. This takes effect for AP US History (teacher from Morristown), Physics (teacher from Waldron), and Personal Finance (teacher from Blue River).\n\n==Athletics==\nMorristown offers several sports activities for both boys and girls to participate in. Boys may participate in the following sports: soccer, tennis, cross country, basketball, baseball, track, and golf. Girls may participate in: cross country, volleyball, basketball, gymnastics, softball, tennis, track, and golf.\n\nAt one point, Morristown Jr.-Sr. High School had a football team (1979-1984). However, rising costs, lack of funds, and dwindling student interest (the team had only 22 players its final year, according to former assistant coach and current teacher Pat Kohne) led to the sport being discontinued. The old football scoreboard and lights have been taken down and replaced by a soccer scoreboard. Soccer is now on Morristown's map having won three sectional titles. Despite student interest in re-establishing a football team in recent years, present school funds do not allow for such an endeavor.{{Citation needed}}\n\nIn 2004, Morristown won a state championship in girl's volleyball, defeating [[Marquette Catholic High School (Michigan City, Indiana)|Michigan City Marquette]] in the first three sets<ref>https://www.ihsaa.org/dnn/Sports/Girls/Volleyball/State-Champions</ref>.\n\nIn 2018, Morristown won a state championship in boy's basketball, defeating [[Southwood Junior-Senior High School|Southwood High School]] 89 to 60<ref>https://www.ihsaa.org/dnn/Sports/Boys/Basketball/State-Champions</ref>.\n\n==Activities==\nAlongside athletics, there are a variety of activities offered to students.

He was brought up at ''Long White Cloud'' house on the south bank of the [[River Thames]]. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the [[1924 Indianapolis 500]]. Aileen Moss had also been involved in motorsport, entering prewar hillclimbs at the wheel of a Singer Nine. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, [[Pat Moss]], who became a successful [[rallying|rally driver]] and married [[Erik Carlsson]].\n\nMoss was educated at several independent schools: [[Shrewsbury House School]] in [[Surbiton]], Clewer Manor Junior School, and the linked senior school, [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]], located at [[Hertford Heath]], near [[Hertford]].\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Vanwall VW5 Aintree 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Moss shared this [[Vanwall]] VW5 with [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]] to win the [[1957 British Grand Prix]].]]\nMoss raced from 1948 to 1962, winning 212 of the 529 races he entered, including 16 [[Formula One]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grands Prix]]. He would compete in as many as 62 races in a single year and drove 84 different makes of car over the course of his racing career, including [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper 500]], [[English Racing Automobiles#G-Type|ERA]], [[Lister Cars]], [[Rob Walker Racing Team|Lotus]], [[Maserati 250F|Maserati]], [[Mercedes-Benz W196|Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche 718|Porsche]] and [[Vanwall]] single-seaters, [[Aston Martin DBR1|Aston Martin]], [[Maserati]], [[Ferrari 250#250 GT Berlinetta SWB|Ferrari]], [[Jaguar C-Type|Jaguar]] and [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR|Mercedes-Benz]] sports cars, and [[Jaguar Mark VII|Jaguar]] saloons. Like many drivers of the era, he competed in several formulae, often on the same day.\n\nHe preferred to race British cars, stating, \"Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign one\".<ref name=\"motorsportshalloffame.com\"/>  At Vanwall, he was instrumental in breaking the German/Italian stranglehold on F1 racing (as was [[Jack Brabham]] at Cooper). He remained the English driver with the most Formula One victories until 1991 when [[Nigel Mansell]] overtook him after competing in more races.\n\n===1948\u20131954===\nMoss began his career at the wheel of his father Alfred's 328 BMW, DPX 653. Moss was one of the [[Cooper Car Company]]'s first customers, using winnings from competing in horse-riding events to pay the deposit on a [[Cooper Mark IV|Cooper 500]] racing car in 1948. He then persuaded his father, who opposed his racing and wanted him to be a dentist,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p04wf0d2/face-to-face-stirling-moss|title=Face to Face - Stirling Moss|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> to let him buy it. He soon demonstrated his ability with numerous wins at national and international levels, and continued to compete in [[Formula Three]], with Coopers and [[Kieft Cars|Kiefts]], after he had progressed to more senior categories.\n\nHis first major international race victory came on the eve of his 21st birthday at the wheel of a borrowed [[Jaguar XK120]] in the 1950 [[RAC Tourist Trophy]] on the [[Dundrod]] circuit in Northern Ireland. He went on to win the race six more times, in 1951 ([[Jaguar C-Type]]), 1955 (Mercedes-Benz 300SLR), 1958 and 1959 (Aston Martin DBR1), and 1960 and 1961 (Ferrari 250 GT).\n\nAlso a competent rally driver, he is one of three people to have won a ''Coupe d'Or'' (Gold Cup) for three consecutive penalty-free runs on the [[Alpine Rally]] (Coupe des Alpes). He finished second in the 1952 [[Monte Carlo Rally]] driving a [[Sunbeam-Talbot 90]] with Desmond Scannell and ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' magazine editor John Cooper as co-drivers.\n\nIn 1954, he became the first non-American to win the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], sharing the [[Briggs Cunningham|Cunningham]] team's 1.5-liter O.S.C.A. MT4 with American Bill Lloyd.\n\nIn 1953 Mercedes-Benz racing boss [[Alfred Neubauer]] had spoken to Moss's manager, Ken Gregory, about the possibility of Moss's joining the Mercedes Grand Prix team. Having seen him do well in a relatively uncompetitive car, and wanting to see how he would perform in a better one, Neubauer suggested Moss buy a Maserati for the 1954 season. He bought a [[Maserati 250F]], and although the car's unreliability prevented his scoring high points in the 1954 [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] he qualified alongside the Mercedes front runners several times and performed well in the races.  He achieved his first Formula One victory when he won the non-Championship [[Oulton Park International Gold Cup]] in the Maserati.\n\nIn the [[1954 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] at Monza he passed both drivers who were regarded as the best in Formula One at the time\u2014[[Juan Manuel Fangio]] in a Mercedes and [[Alberto Ascari]] in a Ferrari\u2014and took the lead. Ascari retired with engine problems, and Moss led until lap 68 when his engine also failed. Fangio took the victory, and Moss pushed his Maserati to the finish line. Neubauer, already impressed when Moss had tested a [[Mercedes-Benz W196]] at [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]], promptly signed him for 1955.\n\n===1955===\n\nMoss's first World Championship victory was in the [[1955 British Grand Prix]] at [[Aintree Motor Racing Circuit|Aintree]], a race he was also the first British driver to win. Leading a 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 finish for Mercedes, it was the first time he beat Fangio, his teammate and arch rival, who was also his friend and mentor. It has been suggested that Fangio sportingly allowed Moss to win in front of his home crowd. Moss himself asked Fangio repeatedly, and Fangio always replied: \"No. You were just better than me that day.\"<ref>Tremayne, David and Mark Hughes. ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Formula One''.

Based on the W196 Grand Prix car, they had [[Space frame|spaceframe]] chassis and [[Magnesium alloy|magnesium-alloy]] bodies, and their modified W196 engines ran on a mixture of petrol, [[benzene]], and alcohol.  The team's main race rivals were the factory-entered Ferraris of [[Piero Taruffi]], [[Eugenio Castellotti]], [[Umberto Maglioli]], and [[Paolo Marzotto]].\n\nJournalist [[Denis Jenkinson]] was Moss's navigator. He had intended to go with [[John Fitch (racing driver)|John Fitch]], whose idea it had been to take a navigator, but when Mercedes assigned a [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL|300 SL]] to Fitch, the American agreed to Jenkinson riding with Moss in the faster SLR. Jenkinson had come up with the idea of [[Pacenotes|pace notes]] in the form of a roller map of the route on which he had noted its hazards\u2014an innovation that helped Moss compete against drivers with greater local knowledge. Jenkinson used hand signals to tell him about the road ahead. Radio communication had proved ineffective when they tried it, because when Moss was fully concentrated on his driving he was oblivious to Jenkinson's voice.\n\nFangio, who regarded the race as too dangerous for passengers, drove his SLR  alone, as did [[Karl Kling]]. [[Hans Herrmann]] drove the fourth car with mechanic Herman Eger as passenger.\n\nThe race was a timed event, and competitors started singly at one-minute intervals. Moss's Mercedes left the starting ramp in [[Brescia]] at 7:22&nbsp;a.m. (hence the car's race number 722).  Castellotti's Ferrari left one minute later, and Taruffi's at 7:27.\n\nAfter about 90 miles, as Moss approached [[Padua]] at {{convert|175|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} he saw in his mirror that Castellotti was closing fast. When Moss misjudged a corner and collided with some straw bales Castellotti went past and built an increasing lead. After 188 miles of racing the Italian had to stop in [[Ravenna]] to replace the Ferrari's tyres, and fell behind again. Marzotto's Ferrari started well but the tread separated from a tyre at over {{convert|170|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and he had to withdraw from the race because the spare turned out to be the wrong size.\n\nThe petrol tank filler came adrift as they neared the Adriatic coast and drenched them both. Jenkinson's spectacles were blown off by the slipstream when he vomited over the side of the Mercedes; he carried a replacement pair. Arriving in Rome, he and Moss were told they were leading from Taruffi, Herrmann, Kling and Fangio, but from then on they had no way of knowing whether any of their rivals had gone ahead on elapsed time. Soon after Rome, Kling's race ended when he went off the road avoiding spectators and crashed into a tree.\n\nWhen Moss and Jenkinson finally arrived at the finish in Brescia they learned that Castellotti's Ferrari had retired with transmission trouble and they had won. Fangio took second place, nearly 33 minutes slower, his Mercedes delayed by engine trouble and running on only seven cylinders by the end. Maglioli, in the sole surviving factory-entered Ferrari, took 45 minutes longer than Moss and finished 3rd.\n\nMoss's time of  10 hours, 7 minutes and 48 seconds, and his average speed of {{convert|98.53|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for the 1000 miles, set course records that still stand. The race was discontinued two years later.\n\nBefore the race, he had taken a \"magic pill\" given to him by Fangio, and he has commented that although he did not know what was in it, \"Dexedrine and Benzedrine were commonly used in rallies. The object was simply to keep awake, like wartime bomber crews.\" After the win, he spent the night and the following day driving his girlfriend to Cologne, stopping for breakfast in Munich and lunch in Stuttgart.<ref name=Nye />\n\n===1956\u20131962===\n[[File:Moss and Ireland at 1961 Dutch Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|Moss (left) with [[Innes Ireland]] at the [[1961 Dutch Grand Prix]].]]\nMoss won the Nassau Cup at the 1956 and 1957 [[Bahamas Speed Week]].<ref name=si19601212>{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Alfred|title=A Long, Loud Huzzah For Nassau|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=12 December 1960|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134782/index.htm|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref> Also in 1957 he won on the longest circuit ever to hold a World Championship Grand Prix, the {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Pescara Circuit]], where he again demonstrated his mastery of long-distance racing. The event lasted three hours and Moss beat Fangio, who started from [[pole position]], by a little over 3 minutes.\n\nIn 1958, Moss's forward-thinking attitude made waves in the racing world. Moss won the first race of the season in a rear-engined F1 car, which became the common design by 1961. At Monza that year, he raced in the \"Eldorado\" Maserati, the first<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edsall |first1=Larry |title=Maserati celebrates 60th anniversary of Eldorado Racer |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2018/07/01/maserati-celebrates-60th-anniversary-of-eldorado-racer/ |website=The ClassicCars.com Journal |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> single-seater car in Europe to be sponsored by a non-racing brand\u2014the Eldorado Ice Cream Company. This was the first case in Europe of contemporary sponsorship, with the ice cream maker's colors replacing the ones assigned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA). \n\nMoss's sporting attitude cost him the 1958 Formula One World Championship. When rival [[Mike Hawthorn]] was threatened with a penalty after the [[Portuguese Grand Prix]], Moss defended him. Hawthorn was accused of reversing on the track after spinning and stalling his car on an uphill section. Moss had shouted advice to Hawthorn to steer downhill, against traffic, to bump-start the car. Moss's quick thinking, and his defence of Hawthorn before the stewards, preserved Hawthorn's 6 points for finishing second behind Moss. Hawthorn went on to beat Moss for the championship title by one point, even though he had won only one race that year to Moss's four.  Moss's loss in the championship could also be attributed to an error in communication between his pit crew and the driver at one race.  A point was given for the fastest lap in each race, and the crew signaled \"HAWT REC\" meaning Hawthorn had set a record lap.  Moss read this as \"HAWT REG\" and thought Hawthorn was making regular laps, so did not try to set a fast lap.  The crew was supposed to signal the time of the lap, so Moss would know what he had to beat.\n\nMoss was as gifted in sports cars as in Grand Prix cars. To his victories in the Tourist Trophy, the Sebring 12 Hours and the Mille Miglia he added three consecutive wins (1958\u20131960) in the gruelling [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]], the first two in an [[Aston Martin]] (in which he did most of the driving) and the third in a [[Maserati Tipo 61|Tipo'' 61]] \"birdcage\" [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]], co-driving with the American [[Dan Gurney]]. The pair lost nearly six minutes when an oil hose blew off, but despite miserable conditions they made up the time and took 1st place.\n[[File:Stirling Moss on track.JPG|thumb|left|Moss racing an [[Aston Martin DBR1]] at the [[1958 12 Hours of Sebring]]]]\n\nIn the 1960 Formula One season, Moss won the [[1960 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] in [[Rob Walker (motorsport)|Rob Walker]]'s [[Coventry-Climax]]-powered [[Lotus 18]].<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. \"Monaco: Road Racing on the Riviera\", in Northey, Tom, editor.

In addition to his skill, two other factors helped compensate for the Lotus's power deficit in these races. The tight circuit at Monaco favored the nimble Lotus, countering the horsepower advantage of the heavier, ill-handling Ferraris; and at the N\u00fcrburgring, Moss and manager Ken Gregory took the risky decision to fit rain tyres after a pre-race shower soaked the track. Had the skies cleared and the track dried, the decision would have worked against Moss. The rain returned in the race, and although Moss's tyres rapidly deteriorated he was able to drive away from Hill and von Trips to take the win.\n\nIn 1962, he crashed his Lotus heavily during the [[1962 Glover Trophy|Glover Trophy]] at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] held on Monday 23 April. The accident put him in a coma for a month, and for six months the left side of his body was partially paralysed.<ref name=\"motorsportshalloffame.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportshalloffame.com/halloffame/1990/Stirling_Moss_main.htm|title=International Motorsports Hall of Fame<!-- Bot generated title -->|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010224090724/http://www.motorsportshalloffame.com/halloffame/1990/Stirling_Moss_main.htm|archivedate=24 February 2001|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uVV3VknKa0|title=Stirling Moss Career Ending Crash|date=16 September 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He recovered, but retired from professional racing after a private test session in a [[Lotus 19]] the following year, when he lapped a few tenths of a second slower than before.

In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show ''What's My Line?'' (episode with [[Anita Ekberg]]). In 1959 he was the subject of the TV programme ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''. On June 12 the following year he was interviewed by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]] on ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]''; Freeman later said that he had thought before the interview that Moss was a playboy, but in their meeting he showed \"cold, precise, clinical judgement... a man who could live so close to the edge of death and danger, and trust entirely to his own judgement. This appealed to me\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2013/03/john-freeman-face-face-enigma |title=John Freeman: Face to face with an enigma |last=Purcell |first=Hugh |publisher=The New Statesman |date=7 March 2013}}</ref> Moss also appeared as himself in the 1964 film ''[[The Beauty Jungle]]'', and was one of several celebrities with cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''. He played Evelyn Tremble's ([[Peter Sellers]]) driver.\n\nFor many years during and after his career, the rhetorical phrase \"Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?\" was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists. Moss relates he himself was once stopped for speeding and asked just that; he reports the traffic officer had some difficulty believing him.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/9251916/Sir-Stirling-Moss-interview.html |title=Sir Stirling Moss interview |last=English |first=Andrew |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> As related in the book ''The Life and Times of Private Eye'', Moss was the subject of a less than respectful cartoon biography in the magazine ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]''. The cartoon, drawn by [[Willie Rushton]], showed him continually crashing, having his driving licence revoked and finally \"hosting television programmes on subjects he knows nothing about\". It also made reference to the amnesia Moss suffered from as a result of head injuries sustained in the crash at Goodwood in 1962. According to the book, Moss responded by offering to buy the original of the cartoon, an outcome the book describes as \"depressingly common\" for its satirical cartoons about famous people.\n\nMoss is the narrator of the popular children's series ''[[Roary the Racing Car]]'' which stars [[Peter Kay]], a role he took on, having been approached by both David Jenkins, who had the original idea, and Keith Chapman, the latter the creator of ''[[Bob the Builder]]'', as he saw the TV show as a way of introducing motorsport to the next generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stirlingmoss.com/video/stirling-narrator-roary-racing-car|title=Stirling \u2013 Narrator of Roary the Racing Car|work=www.stirlingmoss.com|accessdate=28 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327103011/http://www.stirlingmoss.com/video/stirling-narrator-roary-racing-car|archive-date=27 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe is one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content.

He was brought up at ''Long White Cloud'' house on the south bank of the [[River Thames]]. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the [[1924 Indianapolis 500]]. Aileen Moss had also been involved in motorsport, entering prewar hillclimbs at the wheel of a Singer Nine. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, [[Pat Moss]], who became a successful [[rallying|rally driver]] and married [[Erik Carlsson]].\n\nMoss was educated at several independent schools: [[Shrewsbury House School]] in [[Surbiton]], Clewer Manor Junior School, and the linked senior school, [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]], located at [[Hertford Heath]], near [[Hertford]].\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Vanwall VW5 Aintree 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Moss shared this [[Vanwall]] VW5 with [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]] to win the [[1957 British Grand Prix]].]]\nMoss raced from 1948 to 1962, winning 212 of the 529 races he entered, including 16 [[Formula One]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grands Prix]]. He would compete in as many as 62 races in a single year and drove 84 different makes of car over the course of his racing career, including [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper 500]], [[English Racing Automobiles#G-Type|ERA]], [[Lister Cars]], [[Rob Walker Racing Team|Lotus]], [[Maserati 250F|Maserati]], [[Mercedes-Benz W196|Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche 718|Porsche]] and [[Vanwall]] single-seaters, [[Aston Martin DBR1|Aston Martin]], [[Maserati]], [[Ferrari 250#250 GT Berlinetta SWB|Ferrari]], [[Jaguar C-Type|Jaguar]] and [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR|Mercedes-Benz]] sports cars, and [[Jaguar Mark VII|Jaguar]] saloons. Like many drivers of the era, he competed in several formulae, often on the same day.\n\nHe preferred to race British cars, stating, \"Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign one\".<ref name=\"motorsportshalloffame.com\"/>  At Vanwall, he was instrumental in breaking the German/Italian stranglehold on F1 racing (as was [[Jack Brabham]] at Cooper). He remained the English driver with the most Formula One victories until 1991 when [[Nigel Mansell]] overtook him after competing in more races.\n\n===1948\u20131954===\nMoss began his career at the wheel of his father Alfred's 328 BMW, DPX 653. Moss was one of the [[Cooper Car Company]]'s first customers, using winnings from competing in horse-riding events to pay the deposit on a [[Cooper Mark IV|Cooper 500]] racing car in 1948. He then persuaded his father, who opposed his racing and wanted him to be a dentist,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p04wf0d2/face-to-face-stirling-moss|title=Face to Face - Stirling Moss|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> to let him buy it. He soon demonstrated his ability with numerous wins at national and international levels, and continued to compete in [[Formula Three]], with Coopers and [[Kieft Cars|Kiefts]], after he had progressed to more senior categories.\n\nHis first major international race victory came on the eve of his 21st birthday at the wheel of a borrowed [[Jaguar XK120]] in the 1950 [[RAC Tourist Trophy]] on the [[Dundrod]] circuit in Northern Ireland. He went on to win the race six more times, in 1951 ([[Jaguar C-Type]]), 1955 (Mercedes-Benz 300SLR), 1958 and 1959 (Aston Martin DBR1), and 1960 and 1961 (Ferrari 250 GT).\n\nAlso a competent rally driver, he is one of three people to have won a ''Coupe d'Or'' (Gold Cup) for three consecutive penalty-free runs on the [[Alpine Rally]] (Coupe des Alpes). He finished second in the 1952 [[Monte Carlo Rally]] driving a [[Sunbeam-Talbot 90]] with Desmond Scannell and ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' magazine editor John Cooper as co-drivers.\n\nIn 1954, he became the first non-American to win the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], sharing the [[Briggs Cunningham|Cunningham]] team's 1.5-liter O.S.C.A. MT4 with American Bill Lloyd.\n\nIn 1953 Mercedes-Benz racing boss [[Alfred Neubauer]] had spoken to Moss's manager, Ken Gregory, about the possibility of Moss's joining the Mercedes Grand Prix team. Having seen him do well in a relatively uncompetitive car, and wanting to see how he would perform in a better one, Neubauer suggested Moss buy a Maserati for the 1954 season. He bought a [[Maserati 250F]], and although the car's unreliability prevented his scoring high points in the 1954 [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] he qualified alongside the Mercedes front runners several times and performed well in the races.  He achieved his first Formula One victory when he won the non-Championship [[Oulton Park International Gold Cup]] in the Maserati.\n\nIn the [[1954 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] at Monza he passed both drivers who were regarded as the best in Formula One at the time\u2014[[Juan Manuel Fangio]] in a Mercedes and [[Alberto Ascari]] in a Ferrari\u2014and took the lead. Ascari retired with engine problems, and Moss led until lap 68 when his engine also failed. Fangio took the victory, and Moss pushed his Maserati to the finish line. Neubauer, already impressed when Moss had tested a [[Mercedes-Benz W196]] at [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]], promptly signed him for 1955.\n\n===1955===\n\nMoss's first World Championship victory was in the [[1955 British Grand Prix]] at [[Aintree Motor Racing Circuit|Aintree]], a race he was also the first British driver to win. Leading a 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 finish for Mercedes, it was the first time he beat Fangio, his teammate and arch rival, who was also his friend and mentor. It has been suggested that Fangio sportingly allowed Moss to win in front of his home crowd. Moss himself asked Fangio repeatedly, and Fangio always replied: \"No. You were just better than me that day.\"<ref>Tremayne, David and Mark Hughes. ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Formula One''.

Based on the W196 Grand Prix car, they had [[Space frame|spaceframe]] chassis and [[Magnesium alloy|magnesium-alloy]] bodies, and their modified W196 engines ran on a mixture of petrol, [[benzene]], and alcohol.  The team's main race rivals were the factory-entered Ferraris of [[Piero Taruffi]], [[Eugenio Castellotti]], [[Umberto Maglioli]], and [[Paolo Marzotto]].\n\nJournalist [[Denis Jenkinson]] was Moss's navigator. He had intended to go with [[John Fitch (racing driver)|John Fitch]], whose idea it had been to take a navigator, but when Mercedes assigned a [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL|300 SL]] to Fitch, the American agreed to Jenkinson riding with Moss in the faster SLR. Jenkinson had come up with the idea of [[Pacenotes|pace notes]] in the form of a roller map of the route on which he had noted its hazards\u2014an innovation that helped Moss compete against drivers with greater local knowledge. Jenkinson used hand signals to tell him about the road ahead. Radio communication had proved ineffective when they tried it, because when Moss was fully concentrated on his driving he was oblivious to Jenkinson's voice.\n\nFangio, who regarded the race as too dangerous for passengers, drove his SLR  alone, as did [[Karl Kling]]. [[Hans Herrmann]] drove the fourth car with mechanic Herman Eger as passenger.\n\nThe race was a timed event, and competitors started singly at one-minute intervals. Moss's Mercedes left the starting ramp in [[Brescia]] at 7:22&nbsp;a.m. (hence the car's race number 722).  Castellotti's Ferrari left one minute later, and Taruffi's at 7:27.\n\nAfter about 90 miles, as Moss approached [[Padua]] at {{convert|175|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} he saw in his mirror that Castellotti was closing fast. When Moss misjudged a corner and collided with some straw bales Castellotti went past and built an increasing lead. After 188 miles of racing the Italian had to stop in [[Ravenna]] to replace the Ferrari's tyres, and fell behind again. Marzotto's Ferrari started well but the tread separated from a tyre at over {{convert|170|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and he had to withdraw from the race because the spare turned out to be the wrong size.\n\nThe petrol tank filler came adrift as they neared the Adriatic coast and drenched them both. Jenkinson's spectacles were blown off by the slipstream when he vomited over the side of the Mercedes; he carried a replacement pair. Arriving in Rome, he and Moss were told they were leading from Taruffi, Herrmann, Kling and Fangio, but from then on they had no way of knowing whether any of their rivals had gone ahead on elapsed time. Soon after Rome, Kling's race ended when he went off the road avoiding spectators and crashed into a tree.\n\nWhen Moss and Jenkinson finally arrived at the finish in Brescia they learned that Castellotti's Ferrari had retired with transmission trouble and they had won. Fangio took second place, nearly 33 minutes slower, his Mercedes delayed by engine trouble and running on only seven cylinders by the end. Maglioli, in the sole surviving factory-entered Ferrari, took 45 minutes longer than Moss and finished 3rd.\n\nMoss's time of  10 hours, 7 minutes and 48 seconds, and his average speed of {{convert|98.53|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for the 1000 miles, set course records that still stand. The race was discontinued two years later.\n\nBefore the race, he had taken a \"magic pill\" given to him by Fangio, and he has commented that although he did not know what was in it, \"Dexedrine and Benzedrine were commonly used in rallies. The object was simply to keep awake, like wartime bomber crews.\" After the win, he spent the night and the following day driving his girlfriend to Cologne, stopping for breakfast in Munich and lunch in Stuttgart.<ref name=Nye />\n\n===1956\u20131962===\n[[File:Moss and Ireland at 1961 Dutch Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|Moss (left) with [[Innes Ireland]] at the [[1961 Dutch Grand Prix]].]]\nMoss won the Nassau Cup at the 1956 and 1957 [[Bahamas Speed Week]].<ref name=si19601212>{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Alfred|title=A Long, Loud Huzzah For Nassau|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=12 December 1960|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134782/index.htm|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref> Also in 1957 he won on the longest circuit ever to hold a World Championship Grand Prix, the {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Pescara Circuit]], where he again demonstrated his mastery of long-distance racing. The event lasted three hours and Moss beat Fangio, who started from [[pole position]], by a little over 3 minutes.\n\nIn 1958, Moss's forward-thinking attitude made waves in the racing world. Moss won the first race of the season in a rear-engined F1 car, which became the common design by 1961. At Monza that year, he raced in the \"Eldorado\" Maserati, the first<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edsall |first1=Larry |title=Maserati celebrates 60th anniversary of Eldorado Racer |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2018/07/01/maserati-celebrates-60th-anniversary-of-eldorado-racer/ |website=The ClassicCars.com Journal |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> single-seater car in Europe to be sponsored by a non-racing brand\u2014the Eldorado Ice Cream Company. This was the first case in Europe of contemporary sponsorship, with the ice cream maker's colors replacing the ones assigned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA). \n\nMoss's sporting attitude cost him the 1958 Formula One World Championship. When rival [[Mike Hawthorn]] was threatened with a penalty after the [[Portuguese Grand Prix]], Moss defended him. Hawthorn was accused of reversing on the track after spinning and stalling his car on an uphill section. Moss had shouted advice to Hawthorn to steer downhill, against traffic, to bump-start the car. Moss's quick thinking, and his defence of Hawthorn before the stewards, preserved Hawthorn's 6 points for finishing second behind Moss. Hawthorn went on to beat Moss for the championship title by one point, even though he had won only one race that year to Moss's four.  Moss's loss in the championship could also be attributed to an error in communication between his pit crew and the driver at one race.  A point was given for the fastest lap in each race, and the crew signaled \"HAWT REC\" meaning Hawthorn had set a record lap.  Moss read this as \"HAWT REG\" and thought Hawthorn was making regular laps, so did not try to set a fast lap.  The crew was supposed to signal the time of the lap, so Moss would know what he had to beat.\n\nMoss was as gifted in sports cars as in Grand Prix cars. To his victories in the Tourist Trophy, the Sebring 12 Hours and the Mille Miglia he added three consecutive wins (1958\u20131960) in the gruelling [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]], the first two in an [[Aston Martin]] (in which he did most of the driving) and the third in a [[Maserati Tipo 61|Tipo'' 61]] \"birdcage\" [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]], co-driving with the American [[Dan Gurney]]. The pair lost nearly six minutes when an oil hose blew off, but despite miserable conditions they made up the time and took 1st place.\n[[File:Stirling Moss on track.JPG|thumb|left|Moss racing an [[Aston Martin DBR1]] at the [[1958 12 Hours of Sebring]]]]\n\nIn the 1960 Formula One season, Moss won the [[1960 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] in [[Rob Walker (motorsport)|Rob Walker]]'s [[Coventry-Climax]]-powered [[Lotus 18]].<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. \"Monaco: Road Racing on the Riviera\", in Northey, Tom, editor.

In addition to his skill, two other factors helped compensate for the Lotus's power deficit in these races. The tight circuit at Monaco favored the nimble Lotus, countering the horsepower advantage of the heavier, ill-handling Ferraris; and at the N\u00fcrburgring, Moss and manager Ken Gregory took the risky decision to fit rain tyres after a pre-race shower soaked the track. Had the skies cleared and the track dried, the decision would have worked against Moss. The rain returned in the race, and although Moss's tyres rapidly deteriorated he was able to drive away from Hill and von Trips to take the win.\n\nIn 1962, he crashed his Lotus heavily during the [[1962 Glover Trophy|Glover Trophy]] at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] held on Monday 23 April. The accident put him in a coma for a month, and for six months the left side of his body was partially paralysed.<ref name=\"motorsportshalloffame.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportshalloffame.com/halloffame/1990/Stirling_Moss_main.htm|title=International Motorsports Hall of Fame<!-- Bot generated title -->|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010224090724/http://www.motorsportshalloffame.com/halloffame/1990/Stirling_Moss_main.htm|archivedate=24 February 2001|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uVV3VknKa0|title=Stirling Moss Career Ending Crash|date=16 September 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He recovered, but retired from professional racing after a private test session in a [[Lotus 19]] the following year, when he lapped a few tenths of a second slower than before.

{"title_page": "Peerages in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Peerage (disambiguation)}}\n{{Peerage|state=expanded}}\n\nThe peerage in the [[United Kingdom]] is a legal system comprising both hereditary and lifetime [[titles]], composed of various [[British nobility|noble]] ranks, and forming a constituent part of the [[British honours system]]. The term ''peerage'' can be used both collectively to refer to the entire body of [[noble title|nobles]] (or a subdivision thereof), and individually to refer to a specific title (modern [[British English|English language]]-style using an initial capital in the former case but not the latter). British peerage title holders are termed [[peer of the realm|peers of the Realm]].\n\nPeerages are created by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], like all Crown honours, being affirmed by [[Letters Patent]] affixed with the [[Great Seal of the Realm]]. [[government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom]] makes recommendations to the Sovereign concerning who should be elevated to the peerage, after external vetting by the [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]]. Under present custom, the only new hereditary peerages granted are to members of the [[British royal family|royal family]]; the last non-royal awardees of hereditary titles were in the Thatcher era.  Since then, [[Government of the United Kingdom|ruling parties]] have refrained from recommending any others to be elevated.\n\n[[New Labour]], elected to power in 1997, sought to remove all the seats in the [[House of Lords]] reserved for hereditary peers, but Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] relented by allowing [[List of elected hereditary peers under the House of Lords Act 1999|92 members]] to remain by legislation enacted in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-information-office/hoflbpmembership.pdf |title=House of Lords briefing paper on Membership:Types of Member, Routes to membership, Parties & groups |accessdate=1 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718101633/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-information-office/hoflbpmembership.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}</ref> The House of Lords' purpose is now that of a revising legislative chamber, scrutinising and potentially changing proposed Parliamentary Bills before their enactment. Its membership for the most part comprises [[life peer]]s, created under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]], which includes those who can add value in specific areas of expertise in parliamentary debates, as well as former MPs and other political appointees from respective political parties.\n\nThe [[British monarchy#Constitutional role|Sovereign]], traditionally the [[fount of honour]], cannot hold a British peerage<ref>The opinion of the House of Lords in the ''[[Buckhurst Peerage Case]]'' stated that \"the fountain and source of all dignities cannot hold a dignity from him/herself\".</ref> (although the [[British Sovereign]], whether male or female, is informally accorded the style of '[[Duke of Lancaster]]'). All British subjects who were neither Royal nor Peers of the Realm were previously termed Commoners, regardless of wealth or other social factors, thus all members of a peer's family are (technically) commoners too; the British system thus differs fundamentally from continental European versions, where entire families, rather than individuals, were [[ennobled]]. Nobility in Britain is based on title rather than bloodline, and correspondingly [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal (Princess Anne)]] who enjoys Royal status as daughter of The Queen, opted for her children to be Commoners by refusing offers of titles, despite their being grandchildren of the Sovereign (''qv.'' [[Peter Phillips]] and [[Zara Tindall]]).\n\nCertain personal privileges are afforded to all peers and peeresses, but the main distinction of a peerage nowadays, apart from access to the House of Lords for life peers and some hereditary peers, is the title and style thereby accorded. Succession claims to existing hereditary peerages are regulated by the House of Lords [[Committee for Privileges and Conduct]] and administered by The Crown Office.\n\n== Baronage evolution ==\n{{Main|Baronage}}\nThe modern-day parliamentary peerage is a continuation of the renamed medieval [[baronage]] system which existed in [[feudalism|feudal]] times. The requirement of attending Parliament was both a liability and a privilege for those who held land as a [[tenant-in-chief]] from the [[King]] ''per baroniam'' \u2013 that is to say, under the feudal contract wherein a King's [[Baron]] was responsible for raising knights and troops for the royal military service. Certain other [[official|office-holders]] such as senior [[cleric]]s and Freemen of the [[Cinque Ports]] were deemed barons.\n\nThis right, entitlement or \"title\" began to be granted by decree in the form of a [[Writ]] of Summons from 1265 and by [[Letters Patent]] from 1388. Additionally, many holders of smaller fiefdoms ''per baroniam'' ceased to be summoned to [[English Parliament|parliament]], resulting in [[baron|baronial status]] becoming personal rather than territorial. Feudal baronies had always been hereditable by [[primogeniture]], but on condition of payment of a fine, termed \"[[Feudal relief|relief]]\", derived from the Latin verb ''levo'' to lift up, meaning a \"re-elevation\" to a former position of honour. Baronies and other titles of nobility became unconditionally hereditable on the abolition of feudal tenure by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660|Tenures Abolition Act of 1660]], and non-hereditable titles began to be created in 1876 for Law Lords, and in 1958 for Life Peers.\n\n== Peerage divisions ==\nIn the UK, five [[peerage]]s co-exist, namely:\n\n* The [[Peerage of England]] \u2014 titles created by the Kings and Queens of [[England]] before the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union in 1707]].\n* The [[Peerage of Scotland]] \u2014 titles created by the Kings and Queens of [[Scotland]] before 1707.\n* The [[Peerage of Ireland]] \u2014 titles created for the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] before the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union of 1801]], and some titles created later.\n* The [[Peerage of Great Britain]] \u2014 titles created for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] between 1707 and 1801.\n* The [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] \u2014 most titles created since 1801 to the present.\n\n== Ranks ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n{{See also|Official Roll of the Baronetage}}\n\nPeers are of five ranks, in descending order of hierarchy:\n* [[Duke]] comes from the [[Latin]] ''dux'', leader. The first duke in a peerage of the British Isles was created in 1337. The feminine form is Duchess.\n* [[Marquess]] comes from the French '[[Marquess|marquis]]', which is a derivative of 'marche' or march. This is a reference to the borders ('[[marches]]') between England, Scotland, and Wales, a relationship more evident in the feminine form: Marchioness. The first marquess in a peerage of the British Isles was created in 1385. The feminine form is Marchioness.\n* [[Earl]] comes from the [[Old English]] or Anglo-Saxon 'eorl', a military leader. The meaning may have been affected by the [[Old Norse]] 'jarl', meaning free-born warrior or nobleman, during the [[Danelaw]], thus giving rise to the modern sense. Since there was no feminine Old English or Old Norse equivalent for the term, 'Countess' is used (an Earl is analogous to the [[Continental Europe|Continental]] '[[count]]'), from the Latin 'comes'.  Created circa 800\u20131000.\n* [[Viscount]] comes from the Latin 'vicecomes', vice-count. Created in 1440. The feminine form is Viscountess.\n* [[Baron]] comes from the Old Germanic 'baro', freeman. Created in 1066. In the Peerage of Scotland alone, a holder of the fifth rank is not called a 'Baron' but rather a '[[Lord of Parliament]]'. [[Barons in Scotland]] were traditionally holders of feudal dignities, not peers, but they are considered minor barons and are recognized by the crown as noble. The feminine form is Baroness.\n\n[[Baronet]]s, while holders of [[hereditary title]]s, are not [[Peer of the Realm|peer]]s since baronetcies have never conferred noble status, although socially they came to be regarded as part of the aristocracy. [[Knights]], [[Dame (title)|Dames]] and holders of other British non-hereditary [[chivalric orders]], decorations, and medals are likewise not peers.\n\nThe titles of peers are in the form of '(Rank) (Name of Title)' or '(Rank) of (Name of Title)'. The name of the title can either be a place name or a surname. The precise usage depends on the rank of the peerage and on certain other general considerations. Dukes always use 'of'. Marquesses and Earls whose titles are based on place names normally use 'of', while those whose titles are based on surnames normally do not. Viscounts, Barons and Lords of Parliament generally do not use 'of'. However, there are several exceptions to the rule. For instance, Scottish vicecomital titles theoretically include 'of', though in practice it is usually dropped. (Thus, the 'Viscount of Falkland' is commonly known as the 'Viscount Falkland'.)\n\n== Geographic association ==\nA [[territorial designation]] is often added to the main peerage title, especially in the case of Barons and Viscounts: for instance, ''[[Margaret Thatcher|Baroness Thatcher]], of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire'', or ''[[Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]], of Hindhead in the County of Surrey''. Any designation after the comma does not form a part of the main title. Territorial designations in titles are not updated with [[local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] reforms, but new creations do take them into account. Thus there is a ''[[Viscount Knollys|Baron Knollys]], of [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]] in the [[Oxfordshire|County of Oxford]]'' (created in 1902), and a ''[[Jill Pitkeathley, Baroness Pitkeathley|Baroness Pitkeathley]], of [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]] in the [[Berkshire|Royal County of Berkshire]]'' (created in 1997).\n\nIt was once the case that a peer administered the place associated with his title (such as an Earl administering a County as [[High Sheriff]] or main landowner), but lordships by tenure have not been commonplace since the early [[Norman period]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msgb.co.uk/lordships.html|title=Untitled|website=msgb.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810055703/http://www.msgb.co.uk/lordships.html|archivedate=2015-08-10}}</ref> The only remaining peerages with certain associated [[land law|rights over land]] are the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] (place), which appertains to the [[Duke of Cornwall|Dukedom of Cornwall]], held by the eldest son and heir to the Sovereign, and the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] (place), which regular income (revenue) appertains to the [[Duke of Lancaster|Dukedom of Lancaster]], held by the Sovereign whose government owns the capital and all capital gains on disposals. In both cases due to the particular function of  [[bona vacantia]] in these areas, these titles afford rights encompassing the whole territorial designation of the holder, donated by the holder now to registered charities. Separate estates, smaller than counties, form the bulk of the two duchies.\n\n== Types of peers ==\n=== Hereditary peers ===\n{{Main|Hereditary peer}}\nAn hereditary peer is a peer of the realm whose dignity may be inherited; those able to inherit it are said to be \"in remainder\". Hereditary peerage dignities may be created with [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writs of summons]] or by [[letters patent]]; the former method is now obsolete. Writs of summons summon an individual to Parliament, in the old [[feudal]] tradition, and merely ''implied'' the existence or creation of an hereditary peerage dignity, which is automatically inherited, presumably according to the traditional medieval rules (male-preference [[primogeniture]], like the succession of the British crown until 2011). Letters patent explicitly create a dignity and specify its course of inheritance (usually [[agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] succession, like the [[Salic Law]]).<ref>[http://www.debretts.com/people/essential-guide-peerage/creation-and-inheritance-peerage www.debretts.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113163619/http://www.debretts.com/people/essential-guide-peerage/creation-and-inheritance-peerage |date=2015-11-13 }}</ref> Some hereditary titles can pass through and vest in female heirs in a system called [[coparcenary]].\n\nOnce created, a peerage dignity continues to exist as long as there are surviving legitimate descendants (or legitimate agnatic descendants) of the first holder, unless a contrary method of descent is specified in the letters patent. Once the heirs of the original peer die out, the peerage dignity becomes extinct. In former times, peerage dignities were often ''forfeit'' by Acts of Parliament, usually when peers were found guilty of [[treason]]. Often, however, the felonious peer's descendants successfully petitioned the Sovereign to restore the dignity to the family. Some dignities, such as the [[Duke of Norfolk|Dukedom of Norfolk]], have been forfeit and restored several times. Under the [[Peerage Act 1963]] an individual can [[Disclaimer of interest|disclaim]] his peerage dignity for his own lifetime within one year of inheriting it.\n\nWhen the holder of a peerage succeeds to the throne, the dignity \"merges in the Crown\" and ceases to exist.\n\nAll hereditary peers in the Peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom were entitled to sit in the House of Lords, subject only to qualifications such as age and citizenship, but under section 1 of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] they lost this right. The Act provided that 92 hereditary peers \u2014 the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] and the [[Earl Marshal]], along with 90 others exempted through [[Rules of order|standing orders]] of the House \u2014 would remain in the House of Lords in the interim,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=house+of+lords&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1459027&ActiveTextDocId=1459031&filesize=2306 |title=House of Lords Act 1999 (c. 34) (s. 2) |work=House of Lords Act 1999 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=25 March 2009 |quote=2 \u2014 Section 1 shall not apply in relation to anyone excepted from it by or in accordance with Standing Orders of the House.}}</ref> pending any reform of the membership to the House.

Since 1963 they have had the same rights as Peers of the United Kingdom. From 1801 until 1922 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peers]] elected 28 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords.  Since 1922, when the [[Irish Free State]] became a separate country, no Irish representative peers have been elected, though sitting members retained their seats for life.\n\n=== Life peers ===\n{{Main|Life peer}}\n\nApart from hereditary peerages, there exist peerages that may be held for life and whose title cannot be passed onto someone else by inheritance. The [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]] and the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]] authorise the regular creation of life peerages, with the right to sit in the House of Lords. Life peers created under both acts are of baronial rank and are always created under letters patent.\n\nSince the loss of the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords as a result of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], the majority of the House of Lords is made up of life peers. There is no limit on the number of peerages the sovereign may create under the Life Peerages Act. Normally life peerages are granted to individuals nominated by political parties or by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, and to honour important public figures such as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] on their retirement.<ref>[http://www.chinet.com/~laura/html/titles02.html Peerage Basics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604182048/http://chinet.com/~laura/html/titles02.html |date=2009-06-04 }}. Chinet.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-24.</ref>\n\nUntil the formal opening of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] on 1 October 2009, life peers created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act were known as \"Lords of Appeal in Ordinary\" or in common parlance \"Law Lords\". They performed the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] and served on the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. They remained peers for life, but ceased to receive judicial salaries at the age of 75. Under the terms of the Act, there may be no more than 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under the age of 75 at one time. However, after the transfer of the judicial functions of the Lords to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Act ceased to have meaningful effect.\n\nUnder the [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014]] and the [[House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015]] a life peer may lose membership of the House of Lords permanently in one of four ways:\n* Resignation or retirement effected by writing to the [[Clerk of the Parliaments]];\n* Automatic expulsion through failing to attend a single sitting of the House throughout a whole session of more than six months duration without leave of absence, being suspended for that session or being exempted by the House for special circumstances;\n* Automatic expulsion through conviction of a criminal offence where the punishment is imprisonment for more than one year;\n* Expulsion by resolution of the House.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK| type = act | year = 2014 | chapter = 24 | act = House of Lords Reform Act 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite legislation UK| type = act | year = 2015 | chapter = 14 | act = House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWhile these provide for non-membership of the House of Lords, they do not allow a life peer to disclaim their peerage in the same way that a hereditary peer can disclaim theirs.\n\n== Styles and titles ==\n{{main|Forms of address in the United Kingdom|Courtesy title}}\n\nDukes use ''His Grace'', Marquesses use ''The Most Honourable'' and other peers use ''The Right Honourable''. Peeresses (whether they hold peerages in their own right or are wives of peers) use equivalent styles.\n\nIn speech, any peer or peeress except a Duke or Duchess is referred to as ''Lord X'' or ''Lady X''. The exception is a ''[[suo jure]]'' baroness (that is, one holding the dignity in her own right, usually a life peeress), who may also be called ''Baroness X'' in normal speech, though ''Lady X'' is also common usage. Hence, [[Margaret Thatcher|Baroness Thatcher]], a ''suo jure'' life peeress, was referred to as either \"Baroness Thatcher\" or \"Lady Thatcher\". \"Baroness\" is incorrect for female holders of Scottish Lordships of Parliament, who are not Baronesses; for example, the [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|21st Lady Saltoun]] is known as \"Lady Saltoun\", not \"Baroness Saltoun\".\n\nA peer is referred to by his peerage even if it is the same as his surname, thus [[David Owen|Baron Owen]] is \"Lord Owen\" not \"Lord David Owen\", though such incorrect forms are commonly used.\n\nSome peers, particularly life peers who were well known before their ennoblement, do not use their peerage titles.  Others use a combination: for example, the author [[John Julius Norwich]] was John Julius Cooper, 2nd Viscount Norwich.\n\nIndividuals who use the style ''Lord'' or ''Lady'' are not necessarily peers. Children of peers use special titles called [[courtesy title]]s. The [[heir apparent]] of a duke, a marquess, or an earl generally uses his father's highest lesser peerage dignity as his own. Hence, the [[Duke of Devonshire]]'s son is called [[Marquess of Hartington]]. Such an heir apparent is called a ''courtesy peer'', but is a commoner until such time as he inherits (unless summoned by a [[writ in acceleration]]).\n\nYounger sons of dukes and marquesses prefix ''Lord'' to their first names as courtesy titles while daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls use ''Lady''. Younger sons of earls and children of viscounts, barons and lords of Parliament use ''The Honourable''.\n\n== Precedence ==\n{{main|Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom}}\n\nPeers are entitled to a special [[order of precedence|precedence]] because of their ranks. Wives and children of peers are also entitled to a special precedence because of their station.\n\nThe Sovereign may, as [[fount of honour]], vary the precedence of the peers or of any other people. For example, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] granted her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], precedence immediately following her; otherwise, he would have ranked along with the other dukes of the peerage of the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"velde\">Velde, Fran\u00e7ois R. (2007).

Then follow the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], the Great Officers of State and other important state functionaries such as the [[Prime Minister]]. Thereafter, dukes precede [[marquess]]es, who precede [[earl]]s, who precede [[viscount]]s, who precede bishops, who precede barons and lords of Parliament.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nWithin the members of each rank of the peerage, peers of England precede peers of Scotland. English and Scottish peers together precede peers of Great Britain. All of the aforementioned precede peers of Ireland created before 1801. Last come peers of Ireland created after 1801 and peers of the United Kingdom. Among peers of the same rank and Peerage, precedence is based on the creation of the title: those whose titles were created earlier precede those whose titles were created later. But in no case would a peer of a lower rank precede one of a higher rank. For example, the [[Duke of Fife]], the last non-royal to be created a duke, would come before the [[Marquess of Winchester]], though the latter's title was created earlier and is in a more senior peerage (the peerage of England).<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nThe place of a peer in the order for gentlemen is taken by his wife in the order for ladies, except that a Dowager peeress of a particular title precedes the present holder of the same title. Children of peers (and ''suo jure'' peeresses) also obtain a special precedence. The following algorithm may be used to determine their ranks:\n* Eldest sons of peers of rank X go after peers of rank X\u22121\n* Younger sons of peers of rank X go after eldest sons of peers of rank X\u22121\n* Wives have a precedence corresponding to those of their husbands\n* Daughters of peers of rank X go after wives of eldest sons of peers of rank X\nOver time, however, various offices were inserted at different points in the order, thereby varying it.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nEldest sons of dukes rank after marquesses; eldest sons of marquesses and then younger sons of dukes rank after earls; eldest sons of earls and then younger sons of marquesses rank after viscounts. Eldest sons of viscounts, younger sons of earls, and then eldest sons of barons, in that order, follow barons, with the [[Treasurer of the Household]], the [[Comptroller of the Household]], the [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household]] and Secretaries of State being interpolated between them and the barons. Younger sons of viscounts, and then younger sons of barons, come after the aforesaid eldest sons of barons, with Knights of the [[Order of the Garter]] and [[Order of the Thistle]], [[Privy Council]]lors and senior judges being intercalated between them and eldest sons of barons.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nChildren of the eldest son of a peer also obtain a special precedence. Generally, the eldest son of the eldest son of a peer comes immediately before his uncles, while the younger sons of the eldest son of a peer come after them. Therefore, eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before younger sons of dukes, and younger sons of eldest sons of dukes come after them, and so forth for all the ranks. Below the younger sons of barons are baronets, knights, circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry, followed by the eldest sons of younger sons of peers.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nWives of all of the aforementioned have precedence corresponding to their husbands', unless otherwise entitled to a higher precedence, for instance by virtue of holding a certain office. An individual's daughter takes precedence after the wife of that individual's eldest son and before the wives of that individual's younger sons. Therefore, daughters of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of peers; daughters of eldest sons of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of eldest sons of peers; daughters of younger sons of peers rank after wives of eldest sons of younger sons of peers. Such a daughter keeps her precedence if marrying a commoner (unless that marriage somehow confers a higher precedence), but rank as their husband if marrying a peer.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\n===Precedence within Parliament===\nThe order of precedence used to determine seating in the House of Lords chamber is governed by the [[House of Lords Precedence Act 1539]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(Old+English+Parliament)&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1517994&ActiveTextDocId=1517994&filesize=14887|title=House of Lords Precedence Act 1539 (c. 10)|publisher=The UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=2007-10-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306063631/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(Old+English+Parliament)&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1517994&ActiveTextDocId=1517994&filesize=14887|archivedate=2008-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/147/14703.htm|title=Standing Orders Of The House Of Lords Relating To Public Business: Appendix|publisher=The House of Lords|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=2007-10-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006201806/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/147/14703.htm|archivedate=6 October 2008}}</ref> Precedence as provided by the Act is similar to, but not the same as, the order outside Parliament. The Sovereign, however, does not have the authority to change the precedence assigned by the Act.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nLords Temporal assume precedence similar to precedence outside Parliament. One difference in the precedence of peers relates to the positions of the Great Officers of State and the officers of the Sovereign's Household. Some Great Officers\u2014the [[Lord Chancellor]], the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Lord President of the Council]] and the [[Lord Privy Seal]]\u2014provided they are peers, rank before all other peers except those who are of the Blood Royal (no precedence is accorded if they are not peers). The positions of the other Great Officers\u2014the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], the [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]], the [[Earl Marshal]] and the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]\u2014and the officers of the Household\u2014the [[Lord Steward]] and the [[Lord Chamberlain]]\u2014are based on their respective ranks. Thus, if the Lord Steward were a duke, he would precede all dukes, if a marquess, he would precede all marquesses, and so on. If two such officers are of the same rank, the precedence of the offices (reflected by the order in which they are mentioned above) is taken into account: if the Lord Great Chamberlain and Earl Marshal were both marquesses, for example, then the Great Chamberlain would precede the Earl Marshal, as the former office precedes the latter.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nIn practice, however, the Act is obsolete, as the Lords do not actually sit according to strict precedence; instead, peers sit with their political parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso04.htm#a16|title=Chapter 1 The House and Its Membership \u00a71.54\u20131.58|work=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords|publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|year=2010|accessdate=13 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014192043/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso04.htm#a16|archivedate=14 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Privilege of peerage ==\n{{Main|Privilege of peerage}}\nThe [[privilege of peerage]] is the body of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s that belongs to peers, their wives and their unremarried widows.

These robes differ slightly according to a peer's rank by identifying features that differ according to rank.\n\nSince the early Middle Ages, robes have been worn as a sign of nobility. At first, these seem to have been bestowed on individuals by the monarch or feudal lord as a sign of special recognition; but in the fifteenth century the use of robes became formalised with peers all wearing robes of the same design, though varied according to the rank of the wearer.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mansfield, A., ''Ceremonial Costume''.

The Lords Spiritual are wearing mitres with their distinctive robes. Mitres ceased to be worn after the Reformation, and the wearing of hats in Parliament ceased, for the most part, when wigs came into fashion. They survive today only as part of the dress of Lords Commissioners, when they are worn with the parliamentary robe: a bicorn hat for men (of black beaver, edged with silk grosgrain ribbon) and a tricorne-like hat for women. (The use of these hats at Introductions of peers to the House was discontinued in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/LLN-2010-007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ceremonial in the House of Lords |website=Parliament.uk|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>)\n\n== Heraldry ==\n{{COA elements}}\nPeers are generally entitled to use certain [[coats of arms|heraldic devices]]. Atop the arms, a peer may display a [[coronet]]. Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were [[engraving|engraved]] while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones.<ref name=\"cox\">Cox, Noel (1999).

The [[Bishop of Durham]], however, may use a duke's coronet atop the arms as a reference to the historical temporal authority of the Prince-Bishops of Durham.\n\nPeers wear their coronets at coronations. Otherwise, coronets are seen only in heraldic representations, atop a peer's arms. Coronets include a silver [[gilding|gilt]] chaplet and a base of [[ermine]] fur. The coronet varies with the rank of the peer. A member of the Royal Family uses a royal coronet instead of the coronet he or she would use as a peer or peeress.<ref name=\"cox\"/>\n\nDucal coronets include eight strawberry leaves atop the chaplet, five of which are displayed in heraldic representations. Marquesses have coronets with four strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls, of which three leaves and two balls are displayed. Coronets for earls have eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight silver balls (called \"pearls\" even though they are not) raised on spikes, of which five silver balls and four leaves are displayed. Coronets for viscounts have 16 silver balls, of which seven are displayed. Finally, baronial coronets have six silver balls, of which four are displayed. Peeresses use equivalent designs, but in the form of a [[circlet]], which encircles the head, rather than a coronet, which rests atop the head.<ref name=\"cox\"/>\n\nPeers are entitled to the use of [[supporter]]s in their achievements of arms. Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers, certain members of the Royal Family, chiefs of Scottish Clans, Scottish feudal barons whose baronies predate 1587. Non-hereditary supporters are granted to life peers, [[Order of the Garter|Knights of the Garter]], [[Order of the Thistle|Knights of the Thistle]], [[Order of the Bath|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Bath]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of St Michael and St George]], [[Royal Victorian Order|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]], [[Order of the British Empire|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the British Empire]], and [[Knight banneret|knights banneret]].\n\nPeers, like most other armigers, may display [[helmet#Heraldry|helms]] atop their arms. Helms of peers are depicted in silver and facing the viewer's left. The helm is garnished in gold and the closed visor has gold bars, normally numbering five. Along with the helm, peers use a [[mantling]], one side of which is red and the other a representation of the heraldic fur ermine. The mantling of peers is emblazoned ''gules, doubled ermine''. Peeresses and other female armigers do not bear helms or mantlings.<ref>For all this section see, for example, Sir [[Bernard Burke]]'s ''General Armoury'' (1884) pp. xv\u2013xx.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Peerage}}\nWhen [[William I of England|William of Normandy]] conquered England, he divided the nation into many \"[[Lord of the manor|manors]]\", the owners of which came to be known as barons; those who held many manors were known as \"greater barons\", while those with fewer manors were the \"lesser barons\". When Kings summoned their barons to Royal Councils, the greater barons were summoned individually by the Sovereign, lesser barons through sheriffs. In 1254, the lesser barons ceased to be summoned, and the body of greater barons evolved into the House of Lords. Since the Crown was itself a hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. By the beginning of the 14th century, the hereditary characteristics of the Peerage were well developed. The first peer to be created by patent was [[John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp (fourth creation)|Lord Beauchamp]] of Holt in the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].\n\nThe modern peerage system is a vestige of the custom of English kings in the 12th and 13th centuries; in the late 14th century, this right (or \"title\") began to be granted by decree, and titles also became inherited with the rest of an estate under the system of [[primogeniture]].  Non-hereditary positions began to be created again in 1867 for Law Lords, and 1958 generally.\n\nThe ranks of baron and earl date to feudal, and perhaps [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]], times. The ranks of duke and marquess were introduced in the 14th century, and that of viscount in the 15th century. While peerages for life were often created in the early days of the peerage, their regular creation was not provided for by Act of Parliament until the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act]] 1876.\n\n== Counterparts ==\nOther [[feudal monarchies]] equally held a similar system, grouping high nobility of different rank titles under one term, with common privileges and/or in an assembly, sometimes legislative and/or judicial.\n\n[[It\u014d Hirobumi]] and the other [[Meiji period|Meiji]] leaders deliberately modeled the Japanese [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] on the [[House of Lords]], as a counterweight to the popularly elected [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] (''Sh\u016bgiin'').\n\nIn France, the system of [[Peerage of France|pairie]]s (peerage) existed in two different versions: the exclusive 'old' in the French kingdom, in many respects an inspiration for the English and later British practice, and the very prolific [[Chambre des Pairs]] under the Bourbon Restoration (1814\u20131848).\n\nIn Spain and Portugal, the closest equivalent title was [[Grandee]]; in Hungary, [[Magnat]].\n\nIn the Kingdom of Sicily a peerage was instituted in 1812 in connection with the abolition of feudalism: peers were nominated based on the taxable incomes of their formerly-feudal estates.\n\nIn the [[Holy Roman Empire]], instead of an exclusive aristocratic assembly, the legislative body was the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], membership of which, expressed by the title [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]], was granted to allied princely families (and various minor ones), as well as to Princes of the Church (parallel to the Lords Spiritual) and in some cases was restricted to a collective 'curiate' vote in a 'bench', such as the [[Count|Grafenbank]].\n\nIn the medieval [[Irish nobility]], Gaelic nobles were those presented with the [[White Wand]] or ''slat'' in a formal ceremony, and presented it by another noble. It was the primary symbol of lordship and effectively reserved only for the three tiers of kings (provincial, regional, local) and for those princely and comital families descending from them in control of significant territories. The total number was between 100 and 150 at any time.\n\n== See also ==\n{{UK Peerages}}\n* [[List of courtesy titles in the peerages of Britain and Ireland]]\n* [[Aristocracy]]\n* [[Australian peers]]\n* [[Baronies created by error]]\n* [[British Honours System|British honours system]]\n* [[British nobility]]\n* [[Cash for Honours]]\n* [[Canadian peers and baronets|Canadian Peers and Baronets]]\n* [[Canadian titles debate]]\n* [[False titles of nobility]]\n* [[Forms of address in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the Peerage]]\n* [[House of Lords]]\n* [[Landed gentry]]\n* [[List of British Jewish nobility and gentry]]\n* [[List of Irish representative peers]]\n* [[List of law life peerages]] (Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876)\n* [[List of life peerages]] (Life Peerages Act, 1958)\n* [[List of spiritual peers]]\n* [[Orders, decorations, and medals of New Zealand]]\n* [[Peerage law]]\n* [[Peerage of England]]\n* [[Peerage of Ireland]]\n* [[Peerage of Scotland]]\n* [[Substantive title]]\n* [[Upper class]]\n* [[Welsh peers and baronets]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book|title=Commentaries on the Laws of England|url=http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/|date=1765|last=Blackstone|first=W.|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]}}\n* Bush, Michael L.

The term ''peerage'' can be used both collectively to refer to the entire body of [[noble title|nobles]] (or a subdivision thereof), and individually to refer to a specific title (modern [[British English|English language]]-style using an initial capital in the former case but not the latter). British peerage title holders are termed [[peer of the realm|peers of the Realm]].\n\nPeerages are created by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], like all Crown honours, being affirmed by [[Letters Patent]] affixed with the [[Great Seal of the Realm]]. [[government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom]] makes recommendations to the Sovereign concerning who should be elevated to the peerage, after external vetting by the [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]]. Under present custom, the only new hereditary peerages granted are to members of the [[British royal family|royal family]]; the last non-royal awardees of hereditary titles were in the Thatcher era.  Since then, [[Government of the United Kingdom|ruling parties]] have refrained from recommending any others to be elevated.\n\n[[New Labour]], elected to power in 1997, sought to remove all the seats in the [[House of Lords]] reserved for hereditary peers, but Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] relented by allowing [[List of elected hereditary peers under the House of Lords Act 1999|92 members]] to remain by legislation enacted in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-information-office/hoflbpmembership.pdf |title=House of Lords briefing paper on Membership:Types of Member, Routes to membership, Parties & groups |accessdate=1 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718101633/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-information-office/hoflbpmembership.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}</ref> The House of Lords' purpose is now that of a revising legislative chamber, scrutinising and potentially changing proposed Parliamentary Bills before their enactment. Its membership for the most part comprises [[life peer]]s, created under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]], which includes those who can add value in specific areas of expertise in parliamentary debates, as well as former MPs and other political appointees from respective political parties.\n\nThe [[British monarchy#Constitutional role|Sovereign]], traditionally the [[fount of honour]], cannot hold a British peerage<ref>The opinion of the House of Lords in the ''[[Buckhurst Peerage Case]]'' stated that \"the fountain and source of all dignities cannot hold a dignity from him/herself\".</ref> (although the [[British Sovereign]], whether male or female, is informally accorded the style of '[[Duke of Lancaster]]'). All British subjects who were neither Royal nor Peers of the Realm were previously termed Commoners, regardless of wealth or other social factors, thus all members of a peer's family are (technically) commoners too; the British system thus differs fundamentally from continental European versions, where entire families, rather than individuals, were [[ennobled]]. Nobility in Britain is based on title rather than bloodline, and correspondingly [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal (Princess Anne)]] who enjoys Royal status as daughter of The Queen, opted for her children to be Commoners by refusing offers of titles, despite their being grandchildren of the Sovereign (''qv.'' [[Peter Phillips]] and [[Zara Tindall]]).\n\nCertain personal privileges are afforded to all peers and peeresses, but the main distinction of a peerage nowadays, apart from access to the House of Lords for life peers and some hereditary peers, is the title and style thereby accorded. Succession claims to existing hereditary peerages are regulated by the House of Lords [[Committee for Privileges and Conduct]] and administered by The Crown Office.\n\n== Baronage evolution ==\n{{Main|Baronage}}\nThe modern-day parliamentary peerage is a continuation of the renamed medieval [[baronage]] system which existed in [[feudalism|feudal]] times. The requirement of attending Parliament was both a liability and a privilege for those who held land as a [[tenant-in-chief]] from the [[King]] ''per baroniam'' \u2013 that is to say, under the feudal contract wherein a King's [[Baron]] was responsible for raising knights and troops for the royal military service. Certain other [[official|office-holders]] such as senior [[cleric]]s and Freemen of the [[Cinque Ports]] were deemed barons.\n\nThis right, entitlement or \"title\" began to be granted by decree in the form of a [[Writ]] of Summons from 1265 and by [[Letters Patent]] from 1388. Additionally, many holders of smaller fiefdoms ''per baroniam'' ceased to be summoned to [[English Parliament|parliament]], resulting in [[baron|baronial status]] becoming personal rather than territorial. Feudal baronies had always been hereditable by [[primogeniture]], but on condition of payment of a fine, termed \"[[Feudal relief|relief]]\", derived from the Latin verb ''levo'' to lift up, meaning a \"re-elevation\" to a former position of honour. Baronies and other titles of nobility became unconditionally hereditable on the abolition of feudal tenure by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660|Tenures Abolition Act of 1660]], and non-hereditable titles began to be created in 1876 for Law Lords, and in 1958 for Life Peers.\n\n== Peerage divisions ==\nIn the UK, five [[peerage]]s co-exist, namely:\n\n* The [[Peerage of England]] \u2014 titles created by the Kings and Queens of [[England]] before the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union in 1707]].\n* The [[Peerage of Scotland]] \u2014 titles created by the Kings and Queens of [[Scotland]] before 1707.\n* The [[Peerage of Ireland]] \u2014 titles created for the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] before the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union of 1801]], and some titles created later.\n* The [[Peerage of Great Britain]] \u2014 titles created for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] between 1707 and 1801.\n* The [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] \u2014 most titles created since 1801 to the present.\n\n== Ranks ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n{{See also|Official Roll of the Baronetage}}\n\nPeers are of five ranks, in descending order of hierarchy:\n* [[Duke]] comes from the [[Latin]] ''dux'', leader. The first duke in a peerage of the British Isles was created in 1337. The feminine form is Duchess.\n* [[Marquess]] comes from the French '[[Marquess|marquis]]', which is a derivative of 'marche' or march. This is a reference to the borders ('[[marches]]') between England, Scotland, and Wales, a relationship more evident in the feminine form: Marchioness. The first marquess in a peerage of the British Isles was created in 1385. The feminine form is Marchioness.\n* [[Earl]] comes from the [[Old English]] or Anglo-Saxon 'eorl', a military leader. The meaning may have been affected by the [[Old Norse]] 'jarl', meaning free-born warrior or nobleman, during the [[Danelaw]], thus giving rise to the modern sense. Since there was no feminine Old English or Old Norse equivalent for the term, 'Countess' is used (an Earl is analogous to the [[Continental Europe|Continental]] '[[count]]'), from the Latin 'comes'.  Created circa 800\u20131000.\n* [[Viscount]] comes from the Latin 'vicecomes', vice-count. Created in 1440. The feminine form is Viscountess.\n* [[Baron]] comes from the Old Germanic 'baro', freeman. Created in 1066. In the Peerage of Scotland alone, a holder of the fifth rank is not called a 'Baron' but rather a '[[Lord of Parliament]]'. [[Barons in Scotland]] were traditionally holders of feudal dignities, not peers, but they are considered minor barons and are recognized by the crown as noble. The feminine form is Baroness.\n\n[[Baronet]]s, while holders of [[hereditary title]]s, are not [[Peer of the Realm|peer]]s since baronetcies have never conferred noble status, although socially they came to be regarded as part of the aristocracy. [[Knights]], [[Dame (title)|Dames]] and holders of other British non-hereditary [[chivalric orders]], decorations, and medals are likewise not peers.\n\nThe titles of peers are in the form of '(Rank) (Name of Title)' or '(Rank) of (Name of Title)'. The name of the title can either be a place name or a surname. The precise usage depends on the rank of the peerage and on certain other general considerations. Dukes always use 'of'. Marquesses and Earls whose titles are based on place names normally use 'of', while those whose titles are based on surnames normally do not. Viscounts, Barons and Lords of Parliament generally do not use 'of'. However, there are several exceptions to the rule. For instance, Scottish vicecomital titles theoretically include 'of', though in practice it is usually dropped. (Thus, the 'Viscount of Falkland' is commonly known as the 'Viscount Falkland'.)\n\n== Geographic association ==\nA [[territorial designation]] is often added to the main peerage title, especially in the case of Barons and Viscounts: for instance, ''[[Margaret Thatcher|Baroness Thatcher]], of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire'', or ''[[Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]], of Hindhead in the County of Surrey''. Any designation after the comma does not form a part of the main title. Territorial designations in titles are not updated with [[local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] reforms, but new creations do take them into account. Thus there is a ''[[Viscount Knollys|Baron Knollys]], of [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]] in the [[Oxfordshire|County of Oxford]]'' (created in 1902), and a ''[[Jill Pitkeathley, Baroness Pitkeathley|Baroness Pitkeathley]], of [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]] in the [[Berkshire|Royal County of Berkshire]]'' (created in 1997).\n\nIt was once the case that a peer administered the place associated with his title (such as an Earl administering a County as [[High Sheriff]] or main landowner), but lordships by tenure have not been commonplace since the early [[Norman period]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msgb.co.uk/lordships.html|title=Untitled|website=msgb.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810055703/http://www.msgb.co.uk/lordships.html|archivedate=2015-08-10}}</ref> The only remaining peerages with certain associated [[land law|rights over land]] are the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] (place), which appertains to the [[Duke of Cornwall|Dukedom of Cornwall]], held by the eldest son and heir to the Sovereign, and the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] (place), which regular income (revenue) appertains to the [[Duke of Lancaster|Dukedom of Lancaster]], held by the Sovereign whose government owns the capital and all capital gains on disposals. In both cases due to the particular function of  [[bona vacantia]] in these areas, these titles afford rights encompassing the whole territorial designation of the holder, donated by the holder now to registered charities. Separate estates, smaller than counties, form the bulk of the two duchies.\n\n== Types of peers ==\n=== Hereditary peers ===\n{{Main|Hereditary peer}}\nAn hereditary peer is a peer of the realm whose dignity may be inherited; those able to inherit it are said to be \"in remainder\". Hereditary peerage dignities may be created with [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writs of summons]] or by [[letters patent]]; the former method is now obsolete. Writs of summons summon an individual to Parliament, in the old [[feudal]] tradition, and merely ''implied'' the existence or creation of an hereditary peerage dignity, which is automatically inherited, presumably according to the traditional medieval rules (male-preference [[primogeniture]], like the succession of the British crown until 2011). Letters patent explicitly create a dignity and specify its course of inheritance (usually [[agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] succession, like the [[Salic Law]]).<ref>[http://www.debretts.com/people/essential-guide-peerage/creation-and-inheritance-peerage www.debretts.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113163619/http://www.debretts.com/people/essential-guide-peerage/creation-and-inheritance-peerage |date=2015-11-13 }}</ref> Some hereditary titles can pass through and vest in female heirs in a system called [[coparcenary]].\n\nOnce created, a peerage dignity continues to exist as long as there are surviving legitimate descendants (or legitimate agnatic descendants) of the first holder, unless a contrary method of descent is specified in the letters patent. Once the heirs of the original peer die out, the peerage dignity becomes extinct. In former times, peerage dignities were often ''forfeit'' by Acts of Parliament, usually when peers were found guilty of [[treason]]. Often, however, the felonious peer's descendants successfully petitioned the Sovereign to restore the dignity to the family. Some dignities, such as the [[Duke of Norfolk|Dukedom of Norfolk]], have been forfeit and restored several times. Under the [[Peerage Act 1963]] an individual can [[Disclaimer of interest|disclaim]] his peerage dignity for his own lifetime within one year of inheriting it.\n\nWhen the holder of a peerage succeeds to the throne, the dignity \"merges in the Crown\" and ceases to exist.\n\nAll hereditary peers in the Peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom were entitled to sit in the House of Lords, subject only to qualifications such as age and citizenship, but under section 1 of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] they lost this right. The Act provided that 92 hereditary peers \u2014 the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] and the [[Earl Marshal]], along with 90 others exempted through [[Rules of order|standing orders]] of the House \u2014 would remain in the House of Lords in the interim,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=house+of+lords&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1459027&ActiveTextDocId=1459031&filesize=2306 |title=House of Lords Act 1999 (c. 34) (s. 2) |work=House of Lords Act 1999 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=25 March 2009 |quote=2 \u2014 Section 1 shall not apply in relation to anyone excepted from it by or in accordance with Standing Orders of the House.}}</ref> pending any reform of the membership to the House.

Since 1963 they have had the same rights as Peers of the United Kingdom. From 1801 until 1922 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peers]] elected 28 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords.  Since 1922, when the [[Irish Free State]] became a separate country, no Irish representative peers have been elected, though sitting members retained their seats for life.\n\n=== Life peers ===\n{{Main|Life peer}}\n\nApart from hereditary peerages, there exists peerages that may be held for life and whose title cannot be passed onto someone else by inheritance. The [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]] and the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]] authorise the regular creation of life peerages, with the right to sit in the House of Lords. Life peers created under both acts are of baronial rank and are always created under letters patent.\n\nSince the loss of the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords as a result of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], the majority of the House of Lords is made up of life peers. There is no limit on the number of peerages the sovereign may create under the Life Peerages Act. Normally life peerages are granted to individuals nominated by political parties or by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, and to honour important public figures such as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] on their retirement.<ref>[http://www.chinet.com/~laura/html/titles02.html Peerage Basics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604182048/http://chinet.com/~laura/html/titles02.html |date=2009-06-04 }}. Chinet.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-24.</ref>\n\nUntil the formal opening of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] on 1 October 2009, life peers created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act were known as \"Lords of Appeal in Ordinary\" or in common parlance \"Law Lords\". They performed the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] and served on the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. They remained peers for life, but ceased to receive judicial salaries at the age of 75. Under the terms of the Act, there may be no more than 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under the age of 75 at one time. However, after the transfer of the judicial functions of the Lords to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Act ceased to have meaningful effect.\n\nUnder the [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014]] and the [[House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015]] a life peer may lose membership of the House of Lords permanently in one of four ways:\n* Resignation or retirement effected by writing to the [[Clerk of the Parliaments]];\n* Automatic expulsion through failing to attend a single sitting of the House throughout a whole session of more than six months duration without leave of absence, being suspended for that session or being exempted by the House for special circumstances;\n* Automatic expulsion through conviction of a criminal offence where the punishment is imprisonment for more than one year;\n* Expulsion by resolution of the House.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK| type = act | year = 2014 | chapter = 24 | act = House of Lords Reform Act 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite legislation UK| type = act | year = 2015 | chapter = 14 | act = House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWhile these provide for non-membership of the House of Lords, they do not allow a life peer to disclaim their peerage in the same way that a hereditary peer can disclaim theirs.\n\n== Styles and titles ==\n{{main|Forms of address in the United Kingdom|Courtesy title}}\n\nDukes use ''His Grace'', Marquesses use ''The Most Honourable'' and other peers use ''The Right Honourable''. Peeresses (whether they hold peerages in their own right or are wives of peers) use equivalent styles.\n\nIn speech, any peer or peeress except a Duke or Duchess is referred to as ''Lord X'' or ''Lady X''. The exception is a ''[[suo jure]]'' baroness (that is, one holding the dignity in her own right, usually a life peeress), who may also be called ''Baroness X'' in normal speech, though ''Lady X'' is also common usage. Hence, [[Margaret Thatcher|Baroness Thatcher]], a ''suo jure'' life peeress, was referred to as either \"Baroness Thatcher\" or \"Lady Thatcher\". \"Baroness\" is incorrect for female holders of Scottish Lordships of Parliament, who are not Baronesses; for example, the [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|21st Lady Saltoun]] is known as \"Lady Saltoun\", not \"Baroness Saltoun\".\n\nA peer is referred to by his peerage even if it is the same as his surname, thus [[David Owen|Baron Owen]] is \"Lord Owen\" not \"Lord David Owen\", though such incorrect forms are commonly used.\n\nSome peers, particularly life peers who were well known before their ennoblement, do not use their peerage titles.  Others use a combination: for example, the author [[John Julius Norwich]] was John Julius Cooper, 2nd Viscount Norwich.\n\nIndividuals who use the style ''Lord'' or ''Lady'' are not necessarily peers. Children of peers use special titles called [[courtesy title]]s. The [[heir apparent]] of a duke, a marquess, or an earl generally uses his father's highest lesser peerage dignity as his own. Hence, the [[Duke of Devonshire]]'s son is called [[Marquess of Hartington]]. Such an heir apparent is called a ''courtesy peer'', but is a commoner until such time as he inherits (unless summoned by a [[writ in acceleration]]).\n\nYounger sons of dukes and marquesses prefix ''Lord'' to their first names as courtesy titles while daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls use ''Lady''. Younger sons of earls and children of viscounts, barons and lords of Parliament use ''The Honourable''.\n\n== Precedence ==\n{{main|Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom}}\n\nPeers are entitled to a special [[order of precedence|precedence]] because of their ranks. Wives and children of peers are also entitled to a special precedence because of their station.\n\nThe Sovereign may, as [[fount of honour]], vary the precedence of the peers or of any other people. For example, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] granted her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], precedence immediately following her; otherwise, he would have ranked along with the other dukes of the peerage of the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"velde\">Velde, Fran\u00e7ois R. (2007). [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/order_precedence.htm \"Order of Precedence in England and Wales.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729222448/http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/order_precedence.htm |date=2010-07-29 }} Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref>\n\n===General precedence===\nIn England and Wales, the Sovereign ranks first, followed by the Royal Family. Then follow the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], the Great Officers of State and other important state functionaries such as the [[Prime Minister]]. Thereafter, dukes precede [[marquess]]es, who precede [[earl]]s, who precede [[viscount]]s, who precede bishops, who precede barons and lords of Parliament.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nWithin the members of each rank of the peerage, peers of England precede peers of Scotland. English and Scottish peers together precede peers of Great Britain. All of the aforementioned precede peers of Ireland created before 1801. Last come peers of Ireland created after 1801 and peers of the United Kingdom. Among peers of the same rank and Peerage, precedence is based on the creation of the title: those whose titles were created earlier precede those whose titles were created later. But in no case would a peer of a lower rank precede one of a higher rank. For example, the [[Duke of Fife]], the last non-royal to be created a duke, would come before the [[Marquess of Winchester]], though the latter's title was created earlier and is in a more senior peerage (the peerage of England).<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nThe place of a peer in the order for gentlemen is taken by his wife in the order for ladies, except that a Dowager peeress of a particular title precedes the present holder of the same title. Children of peers (and ''suo jure'' peeresses) also obtain a special precedence. The following algorithm may be used to determine their ranks:\n* Eldest sons of peers of rank X go after peers of rank X\u22121\n* Younger sons of peers of rank X go after eldest sons of peers of rank X\u22121\n* Wives have a precedence corresponding to those of their husbands\n* Daughters of peers of rank X go after wives of eldest sons of peers of rank X\nOver time, however, various offices were inserted at different points in the order, thereby varying it.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nEldest sons of dukes rank after marquesses; eldest sons of marquesses and then younger sons of dukes rank after earls; eldest sons of earls and then younger sons of marquesses rank after viscounts. Eldest sons of viscounts, younger sons of earls, and then eldest sons of barons, in that order, follow barons, with the [[Treasurer of the Household]], the [[Comptroller of the Household]], the [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household]] and Secretaries of State being interpolated between them and the barons. Younger sons of viscounts, and then younger sons of barons, come after the aforesaid eldest sons of barons, with Knights of the [[Order of the Garter]] and [[Order of the Thistle]], [[Privy Council]]lors and senior judges being intercalated between them and eldest sons of barons.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nChildren of the eldest son of a peer also obtain a special precedence. Generally, the eldest son of the eldest son of a peer comes immediately before his uncles, while the younger sons of the eldest son of a peer come after them. Therefore, eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before younger sons of dukes, and younger sons of eldest sons of dukes come after them, and so forth for all the ranks.

An individual's daughter takes precedence after the wife of that individual's eldest son and before the wives of that individual's younger sons. Therefore, daughters of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of peers; daughters of eldest sons of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of eldest sons of peers; daughters of younger sons of peers rank after wives of eldest sons of younger sons of peers. Such a daughter keeps her precedence if marrying a commoner (unless that marriage somehow confers a higher precedence), but rank as their husband if marrying a peer.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\n===Precedence within Parliament===\nThe order of precedence used to determine seating in the House of Lords chamber is governed by the [[House of Lords Precedence Act 1539]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(Old+English+Parliament)&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1517994&ActiveTextDocId=1517994&filesize=14887|title=House of Lords Precedence Act 1539 (c. 10)|publisher=The UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=2007-10-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306063631/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(Old+English+Parliament)&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1517994&ActiveTextDocId=1517994&filesize=14887|archivedate=2008-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/147/14703.htm|title=Standing Orders Of The House Of Lords Relating To Public Business: Appendix|publisher=The House of Lords|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=2007-10-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006201806/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/147/14703.htm|archivedate=6 October 2008}}</ref> Precedence as provided by the Act is similar to, but not the same as, the order outside Parliament. The Sovereign, however, does not have the authority to change the precedence assigned by the Act.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nLords Temporal assume precedence similar to precedence outside Parliament. One difference in the precedence of peers relates to the positions of the Great Officers of State and the officers of the Sovereign's Household. Some Great Officers\u2014the [[Lord Chancellor]], the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Lord President of the Council]] and the [[Lord Privy Seal]]\u2014provided they are peers, rank before all other peers except those who are of the Blood Royal (no precedence is accorded if they are not peers). The positions of the other Great Officers\u2014the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], the [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]], the [[Earl Marshal]] and the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]\u2014and the officers of the Household\u2014the [[Lord Steward]] and the [[Lord Chamberlain]]\u2014are based on their respective ranks. Thus, if the Lord Steward were a duke, he would precede all dukes, if a marquess, he would precede all marquesses, and so on. If two such officers are of the same rank, the precedence of the offices (reflected by the order in which they are mentioned above) is taken into account: if the Lord Great Chamberlain and Earl Marshal were both marquesses, for example, then the Great Chamberlain would precede the Earl Marshal, as the former office precedes the latter.<ref name=\"velde\"/>\n\nIn practice, however, the Act is obsolete, as the Lords do not actually sit according to strict precedence; instead, peers sit with their political parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso04.htm#a16|title=Chapter 1 The House and Its Membership \u00a71.54\u20131.58|work=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords|publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|year=2010|accessdate=13 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014192043/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso04.htm#a16|archivedate=14 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Privilege of peerage ==\n{{Main|Privilege of peerage}}\nThe [[privilege of peerage]] is the body of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s that belongs to peers, their wives and their unremarried widows.

These robes differ slightly according to a peer's rank by identifying features that differ according to rank.\n\nSince the early Middle Ages, robes have been worn as a sign of nobility. At first, these seem to have been bestowed on individuals by the monarch or feudal lord as a sign of special recognition; but in the fifteenth century the use of robes became formalised with peers all wearing robes of the same design, though varied according to the rank of the wearer.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mansfield, A., ''Ceremonial Costume''. London: A & C Black 1980</ref> Two distinct forms of robe emerged, and these remain in current use: one is worn for parliamentary occasions and the other is generally worn only at [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronations]].\n\n=== Coronets and headgear ===\nIn the United Kingdom, a peer wears his or her [[coronet]] on only one occasion: for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|monarch's coronation]], when it is worn along with coronation robes.\n\n*The coronet of a [[Dukes in the United Kingdom|duke]] (a silver-gilt circlet, [[Repouss\u00e9 and chasing|chased]] as jewelled but not actually gemmed) has eight [[strawberry]] leaves;\n*The coronet of a [[marquess]] has four strawberry leaves and four silver balls (known as \"pearls\", but not actually [[pearl]]s), slightly raised on points above the rim;\n*The coronet of an [[earl]] has eight strawberry leaves (four visible) and eight \"pearls\" raised on stalks;\n*The coronet of a [[viscount]] has sixteen \"pearls\" touching one another;\n*The coronet of a [[baron]] or Lord of Parliament in the Scots peerage (a plain silver-gilt circlet) has six \"pearls\".\n\nThe robes and coronets used at Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 cost about \u00a31,250<ref name=\"arma\">Cox, Noel (1999).

The [[State Opening of Parliament#Origins|Wriothesley Garter Book]] provides a contemporary illustration of the 1523 State Opening of Parliament: the two dukes present are shown wearing coronets with their parliament robes, but the other Lords Temporal are all wearing black hats. The Lords Spiritual are wearing mitres with their distinctive robes. Mitres ceased to be worn after the Reformation, and the wearing of hats in Parliament ceased, for the most part, when wigs came into fashion. They survive today only as part of the dress of Lords Commissioners, when they are worn with the parliamentary robe: a bicorn hat for men (of black beaver, edged with silk grosgrain ribbon) and a tricorne-like hat for women. (The use of these hats at Introductions of peers to the House was discontinued in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/LLN-2010-007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ceremonial in the House of Lords |website=Parliament.uk|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>)\n\n== Heraldry ==\n{{COA elements}}\nPeers are generally entitled to use certain [[coats of arms|heraldic devices]]. Atop the arms, a peer may display a [[coronet]]. Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were [[engraving|engraved]] while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones.<ref name=\"cox\">Cox, Noel (1999). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060415084228/http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/coronets.htm \"The Coronets of Members of the Royal Family and of the Peerage.\"] ''The Double Tressure, the Journal of The Heraldry Society of Scotland''. No. 22, pp. 8\u201313. Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref> Generally, only peers may use the coronets corresponding to their ranks. The [[Bishop of Durham]], however, may use a duke's coronet atop the arms as a reference to the historical temporal authority of the Prince-Bishops of Durham.\n\nPeers wear their coronets at coronations. Otherwise, coronets are seen only in heraldic representations, atop a peer's arms. Coronets include a silver [[gilding|gilt]] chaplet and a base of [[ermine]] fur. The coronet varies with the rank of the peer. A member of the Royal Family uses a royal coronet instead of the coronet he or she would use as a peer or peeress.<ref name=\"cox\"/>\n\nDucal coronets include eight strawberry leaves atop the chaplet, five of which are displayed in heraldic representations. Marquesses have coronets with four strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls, of which three leaves and two balls are displayed. Coronets for earls have eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight silver balls (called \"pearls\" even though they are not) raised on spikes, of which five silver balls and four leaves are displayed. Coronets for viscounts have 16 silver balls, of which seven are displayed. Finally, baronial coronets have six silver balls, of which four are displayed. Peeresses use equivalent designs, but in the form of a [[circlet]], which encircles the head, rather than a coronet, which rests atop the head.<ref name=\"cox\"/>\n\nPeers are entitled to the use of [[supporter]]s in their achievements of arms. Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers, certain members of the Royal Family, chiefs of Scottish Clans, Scottish feudal barons whose baronies predate 1587. Non-hereditary supporters are granted to life peers, [[Order of the Garter|Knights of the Garter]], [[Order of the Thistle|Knights of the Thistle]], [[Order of the Bath|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Bath]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of St Michael and St George]], [[Royal Victorian Order|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]], [[Order of the British Empire|Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the British Empire]], and [[Knight banneret|knights banneret]].\n\nPeers, like most other armigers, may display [[helmet#Heraldry|helms]] atop their arms. Helms of peers are depicted in silver and facing the viewer's left. The helm is garnished in gold and the closed visor has gold bars, normally numbering five. Along with the helm, peers use a [[mantling]], one side of which is red and the other a representation of the heraldic fur ermine. The mantling of peers is emblazoned ''gules, doubled ermine''. Peeresses and other female armigers do not bear helms or mantlings.<ref>For all this section see, for example, Sir [[Bernard Burke]]'s ''General Armoury'' (1884) pp. xv\u2013xx.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Peerage}}\nWhen [[William I of England|William of Normandy]] conquered England, he divided the nation into many \"[[Lord of the manor|manors]]\", the owners of which came to be known as barons; those who held many manors were known as \"greater barons\", while those with fewer manors were the \"lesser barons\". When Kings summoned their barons to Royal Councils, the greater barons were summoned individually by the Sovereign, lesser barons through sheriffs. In 1254, the lesser barons ceased to be summoned, and the body of greater barons evolved into the House of Lords. Since the Crown was itself a hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. By the beginning of the 14th century, the hereditary characteristics of the Peerage were well developed. The first peer to be created by patent was [[John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp (fourth creation)|Lord Beauchamp]] of Holt in the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].\n\nThe modern peerage system is a vestige of the custom of English kings in the 12th and 13th centuries; in the late 14th century, this right (or \"title\") began to be granted by decree, and titles also became inherited with the rest of an estate under the system of [[primogeniture]].  Non-hereditary positions began to be created again in 1867 for Law Lords, and 1958 generally.\n\nThe ranks of baron and earl date to feudal, and perhaps [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]], times. The ranks of duke and marquess were introduced in the 14th century, and that of viscount in the 15th century. While peerages for life were often created in the early days of the peerage, their regular creation was not provided for by Act of Parliament until the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act]] 1876.\n\n== Counterparts ==\nOther [[feudal monarchies]] equally held a similar system, grouping high nobility of different rank titles under one term, with common privileges and/or in an assembly, sometimes legislative and/or judicial.\n\n[[It\u014d Hirobumi]] and the other [[Meiji period|Meiji]] leaders deliberately modeled the Japanese [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] on the [[House of Lords]], as a counterweight to the popularly elected [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] (''Sh\u016bgiin'').\n\nIn France, the system of [[Peerage of France|pairie]]s (peerage) existed in two different versions: the exclusive 'old' in the French kingdom, in many respects an inspiration for the English and later British practice, and the very prolific [[Chambre des Pairs]] under the Bourbon Restoration (1814\u20131848).\n\nIn Spain and Portugal, the closest equivalent title was [[Grandee]]; in Hungary, [[Magnat]].\n\nIn the Kingdom of Sicily a peerage was instituted in 1812 in connection with the abolition of feudalism: peers were nominated based on the taxable incomes of their formerly-feudal estates.\n\nIn the [[Holy Roman Empire]], instead of an exclusive aristocratic assembly, the legislative body was the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], membership of which, expressed by the title [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]], was granted to allied princely families (and various minor ones), as well as to Princes of the Church (parallel to the Lords Spiritual) and in some cases was restricted to a collective 'curiate' vote in a 'bench', such as the [[Count|Grafenbank]].\n\nIn the medieval [[Irish nobility]], Gaelic nobles were those presented with the [[White Wand]] or ''slat'' in a formal ceremony, and presented it by another noble. It was the primary symbol of lordship and effectively reserved only for the three tiers of kings (provincial, regional, local) and for those princely and comital families descending from them in control of significant territories. The total number was between 100 and 150 at any time.\n\n== See also ==\n{{UK Peerages}}\n* [[List of courtesy titles in the peerages of Britain and Ireland]]\n* [[Aristocracy]]\n* [[Australian peers]]\n* [[Baronies created by error]]\n* [[British Honours System|British honours system]]\n* [[British nobility]]\n* [[Cash for Honours]]\n* [[Canadian peers and baronets|Canadian Peers and Baronets]]\n* [[Canadian titles debate]]\n* [[False titles of nobility]]\n* [[Forms of address in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the Peerage]]\n* [[House of Lords]]\n* [[Landed gentry]]\n* [[List of British Jewish nobility and gentry]]\n* [[List of Irish representative peers]]\n* [[List of law life peerages]] (Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876)\n* [[List of life peerages]] (Life Peerages Act, 1958)\n* [[List of spiritual peers]]\n* [[Orders, decorations, and medals of New Zealand]]\n* [[Peerage law]]\n* [[Peerage of England]]\n* [[Peerage of Ireland]]\n* [[Peerage of Scotland]]\n* [[Substantive title]]\n* [[Upper class]]\n* [[Welsh peers and baronets]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book|title=Commentaries on the Laws of England|url=http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/|date=1765|last=Blackstone|first=W.|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]}}\n* Bush, Michael L.

Initially, Jacobs' insistence on rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with the office's patrons, such as [[U.S. Senator]] [[Tom Harkin]].  Sen. Harkin, who had become convinced his allergies were cured by taking [[bee pollen]] pills, criticized the \"unbendable rules of randomized clinical trials,\" saying \"It is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies.\"<ref name=\"natural-causes\">{{cite book | title = Natural causes: death, lies, and politics in America's vitamin and herbal supplement industry | author = Dan Hurley | publisher = [[Broadway Books]] | year = 2006 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7679-2042-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/naturalcausesdea00hurl }}</ref> h Harkin's office reportedly pressured the OAM to fund studies of specific \"pet theories,\" including bee pollen and [[Burzynski Clinic|antineoplastons]]. In the face of increasing resistance to the use of scientific methodology in the study of alternative medicine, one of the OAM board members, [[Barrie Cassileth]], publicly criticized the office, saying: \"The degree to which nonsense has trickled down to every aspect of this office is astonishing&nbsp;... It's the only place where opinions are counted as equal to data.\"<ref name=\"natural-causes\"/>  Finally, in 1994, Harkin appeared on television with cancer patients who blamed Jacobs for blocking their access to antineoplastons, leading Jacobs to resign from the OAM in frustration.<ref name=\"natural-causes\"/>  In an interview with ''Science'', Jacobs \"blasted politicians \u2013 especially Senator Tom Harkin... for pressuring his office, promoting certain therapies, and, he says, attempting an end run around objective science.\"<ref name=\"Marshall1994\">{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Eliot |title=The Politics of Alternative Medicine |journal=Science |volume=265 |issue=5181 |pages=2000\u201302 |year=1994 |pmid=8091220 |doi=10.1126/science.8091220}}</ref>\n\nHarkin drew support also from Iowa Representative [[Berkley Bedell]], as Bedell had used cow [[colostrum]] against his [[Lyme disease]].<ref name=\"Offit\"/>\n\nWith the OAM's increasing budget in the 1990s, the office drew increasing criticism for its perceived lack of rigorous scientific study of alternative approaches in favor of uncritical boosterism.

NCCAM had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine, research training and career development, outreach, and \"integration\".\n\nStephen Strauss was the director of NCCAM from 1999 to 2006. He tried to bring more scientific rigor to the organization.<ref name=gorski/>  In 1999 the NCCAM budget was increased from $20 million to $50 million.<ref name=WNCCAMSBD/><ref name=SSOAGGRAM/> The United States Congress approved the appropriations without dissent.

She was \"...a [[nephrologist]] with impeccable scientific credentials...\".  The appointment was considered surprising since she did not have a background in complementary and alternative medicine or integrative medicine. Writing for [[Science-Based Medicine]], [[David Gorski]] states Briggs was in an impossible position.  \"She was a real scientist trying to impose scientific rigor on an enterprise that was inherently resistant to such an imposition\".  She attempted to impose a more scientific approach with two long term strategic plans. Unfortunately the plans used \"...one of the most harmful tactics of quacks to legitimize their quackery under the banner of \"integrative medicine\", the co-opting of the opioid crisis as an excuse to claim all nonpharmacological treatments for pain as being \"integrative\". The results are threatening great harm to chronic pain patients by misguided governments wanting to force them to undergo quack treatments like acupuncture as a means of getting them off opioids\".  However she was able to eliminate studies on homeopathy and tried to counter anti vaccine beliefs. Energy healing was \"...relegated to the fringes, if not eliminated\".

She attempted to impose a more scientific approach with two long term strategic plans. Unfortunately the plans used \"...one of the most harmful tactics of quacks to legitimize their quackery under the banner of \"integrative medicine\", the co-opting of the opioid crisis as an excuse to claim all nonpharmacological treatments for pain as being \"integrative\".

The authors argued that, after 20 years and an expenditure of $2 billion, the failure of NCCIH was evidenced by the lack of publications and the failure to report clinical trials in peer-reviewed medical journals.
