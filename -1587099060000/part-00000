As production of these plastics requires a lot of energy and creates long-lasting waste, the main impact from the life cycle of these products is fossil fuel use, though the waste produced is significant in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechicecologist.com/2010/04/the-environmental-impact-of-everyday-things/|title=The Environmental Impact of Everyday Things|work=The Chic Ecologist|date=2010-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWomen have used tampons during menstruation for thousands of years. In her book ''Everything You Must Know About Tampons'' (1981), Nancy Friedman writes, \"There is evidence of tampon use throughout history in a multitude of cultures. The oldest printed medical document, [[Papyrus Ebers]], refers to the use of soft papyrus tampons by Egyptian women in the 15th century BCE. Roman women used wool tampons. Women in ancient Japan fashioned tampons out of paper, held them in place with a bandage, and changed them 10 to 12 times a day. Traditional Hawaiian women used the furry part of a native fern called [[hapu'u]]; and grasses, mosses and other plants are still used by women in parts of Asia.\"<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2252/who-invented-tampons Who invented tampons?] June 6, 2006 The Straight Dope</ref>\n\nR.

Gertrude Schulte Tenderich (n\u00e9e Voss) bought the patent rights to her company trademark Tampax and started as a seller, manufacturer, and spokesperson in 1933.<ref>''A Short History of Periods''</ref> Tenderich hired women to manufacture the item and then hired two sales associates to market the product to drugstores in Colorado and Wyoming; and nurses to give public lectures on the benefits of the creation; and was also instrumental in inducing newspapers to run advertisements.\n\nIn 1945, Tampax presented a number of studies to prove the safety of tampons. A 1965 study by the Rock Reproductive Clinic stated that the use of tampons \"has no physiological or clinical undesired side effects\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nDuring her study of female anatomy, German gynecologist Dr. [[Judith Esser-Mittag]] developed a digital-style tampon, which was made to be inserted without an applicator. In the late 1940s, Dr. Carl Hahn, together with Heinz Mittag, worked on the mass production of this tampon.

In 2000, a 10% [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) was introduced in Australia. While lubricant, condoms, incontinence pads and numerous medical items were regarded as essential and exempt from the tax, tampons continue to be charged GST. Prior to the introduction of GST, several states also applied a luxury tax to tampons at a higher rate than GST.

{"title_page": "Canadian online media", "text_new": "{{Culture of Canada sidebar}}\n\n'''Canadian online media''' is content aimed at a [[Canadians|Canadian]] audience through the medium of the [[Internet]]. Presently, [[online media]] can be accessed by [[computers]], [[smart-phones]], [[gaming consoles]], [[Smart TV]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, and [[Tablet computer|tablets]]. The characteristics of Canadian online media are strongly shaped by the Canadian communications industry, even though their statistics and findings are more often than not associated with American research. Large media companies are increasingly on the move to start up online platforms for news and television content. The exponential growth of Canadians' dependency on online content for entertainment and information has been evident in the recent decades. However, it has proven slow for Canadian online media to catch up with the constant increase of American online media. Regardless of medium, entertainment and information hubs are not solely focusing on satisfying the audience they have, but are also heavily expanding their reach to new global audiences.\n\n== Types of online media ==\n\n=== News and magazines ===\n\nAs information is increasingly going digital, the Newspaper Audience Databank (NADbank) claims online readership for most Canadian newspapers have surpassed the numbers in print readership.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krashinsky|first=Susan|title=Online news readership rising: NADbank|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/online-news-readership-rising-nadbank/article1503405/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=March 17, 2010}}</ref> However, there is also lack of evidence that newspapers are coming to an end in Canada. For some of Canada's larger newspapers, readership has increased in both print and online formats. After [[The Globe and Mail]]'s redesign, they claim to have fueled a 10.2% increase in both their print and online readers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Globe readership grows, both for print and online|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/globe-readership-grows-both-for-print-and-online/article2183866/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> \nHighlights from a 2010 study conducted by NADbank revealed the national newspaper readership remains high. Though the migration from print to online newspapers is still ongoing, print editions are still the most popular amongst Canadians.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Overview of Results|url=http://nadbank.com/en/study/readership}}</ref>\n\nMany news writers are beginning to have an active [[Twitter]] presence to communicate with their audiences. Large newspapers{{Which|date=December 2011}} are urging writers to have a public persona on [[blog]]s or Twitter. Instant connection is becoming more substantial, as journalists are encouraged to interact with the public. Canadians are also becoming active participants in the journalistic process as journalists are realizing citizens' ability to perform fragments of journalism, such as taking on-the-scene pictures, tweeting, commenting online or simply editing a Wikipedia entry. Alfred Hermida of the [[University of British Columbia]] asserts that [[participatory journalism]] reinforces the [[public sphere]], while news specialization ironically undermines it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Lisa|title=Participatory Journalism: an interview with Alfred Hermida|url=http://j-source.ca/article/participatory-journalism-interview-alfred-hermida|publisher=The Canadian Journalism Project|date=Nov 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Online-only news====\n\n[[Openfile.ca]] was an online-only newspaper that concentrated on community-powered news, with the intent of connecting people with reporters to cover specific communities. Launched in May 2010, OpenFile aimed to promote [[citizen journalism]] by enabling anyone to suggest a story to cover, and then a paid journalist would conduct research and produce a polished piece. Stories were also [[Geotagging|geotagged]] to improve accessibility to citizens who wanted stories in their immediate neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Openfile|url=http://www.openfile.ca/about-openfile|publisher=Openfile|access-date=2011-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228191443/http://www.openfile.ca/about-openfile#|archive-date=2011-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> By 2012, the site saw about 400,000 unique visitors per month, but it was suddenly shuttered in September of that year due to reported financial problems.<ref>{{cite news|last=Houpt|first=Simon|title=We wanted to believe in OpenFile's community journalism - but the dream is dead|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/we-wanted-to-believe-in-openfiles-community-journalism---but-the-dream-is-dead/article8953664/|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=21 February 2013}}</ref> As of 2014, the Openfile website simply states, \"on hiatus\".\n\nThough news and magazine companies are increasing their presence online, publications such as [[Dose (magazine)|''Dose'' magazine]] have discontinued their print editions, but have gone on to develop their news website as it strategically targets a younger demographic.\n\n[[Rabble.ca]], another online-only news site, is a [[non-profit organization]] that publishes a mixture of original content and those of alternative publications. In 2008, they created rabbletv in an effort to branch out their multi-media presence. Rabble also hosts Babble, a forum pertaining mostly to political discussions, and most recently the Activist Toolkit, a [[wiki]] project that aims to enable members of the rabble community to engage in [[collaborative writing]] of content.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to rabble.ca|url=http://rabble.ca/about/landing|publisher=rabble.ca}}</ref>\n\n[[Canadian Online Explorer|The Canoe Network]] is an online-only news site in Canada with a network of French and English news content, as well as sub-divisions of a job-listing site, TV programs, e-commerce and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Profile|url=http://www.canoe.com/corpo/en/|publisher=Canoe inc.}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n\nIn the digital age, large media conglomerates are taking the opportunity to broaden their audiences by pushing to start up their own online platforms for multimedia content. [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]], one of Canada's largest communication companies, made the move in 2009 to create its version of [[Hulu|Hulu.com]], a popular on-demand streaming video service from the US. The concept was to provide free television programs in pursuance of promoting online content in Canada. It has also been noted as a way to secure Canada's future in broadcasting, as major cable companies were already losing customers to service cancellations in the United States. Much of the efforts to promote Canadian online content have proven to be difficult as the federal broadcast regulators are still in uncharted territories.<ref>{{cite web|last=Surridge|first=Grant|title=Rogers talks up Canadian version of Hulu.com|url=http://www.financialpost.com/news/Rogers+talks+Canadian+version+Hulu/1373987/story.html|publisher=Financial Post|date=March 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nMany satellite companies in Canada also own TV stations. In September 2011, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) decided against the hoarding of specific televised programs by such companies for fair competition. [[Bell Canada]] has made such offerings with [[National Football League|NFL]] games on Bell's Mobile TV package, as well as select [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] games on TSN.ca. Many communications companies{{Which|date=December 2011}} compete to provide instant entertainment content.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rogers hopes Leafs score with subscribers|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rogers-hopes-leafs-score-with-subscribers/article2200568/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=Oct 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLaunched in June 2011, [[Shaw Communications]] have received legal complaints that their online video-streaming consists of movies from major film studios, some of which aren't licensed to be broadcast through their video-streaming platform. The objective was to work towards a development that would adjust to the shifting viewer trends.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sturgeon|first=Jamie|title=Shaw steps on Hollywood's toes over rights|url=http://www.financialpost.com/news/Shaw+steps+Hollywood+toes+over+rights/5309779/story.html|publisher=[[National Post]]|date=Aug 26, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Entertainment and gaming consoles ===\n[[Microsoft Corporation]] plans to launch its [[Television on demand|on-demand]] and live TV service for the  [[Xbox 360]] gaming console in the winter of 2011.

The demographics for these statistics no longer side with the younger generation, as older people are finding instant online transactions convenient.<ref>{{cite journal|first=|title=Online life increasing for Canadians|journal=Canada AM - CTV Television|date=Apr 28, 2008|id={{ProQuest|190344230}}}}</ref>\n\n===Social media===\n\nAmerican online content is popular in Canada. In the spring of 2011, the [[2011 Canadian federal election|Canadian federal election]] was reported as the \"Twitter election\" by news media,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/the-house-the-twitter-election-1.1044391|title=The House: The Twitter election|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/the-big-data-election-political-parties-building-detailed-voter-records|title=The Big Data Election: Political parties building detailed voter records|date=2014-10-18|work=Ottawa Citizen|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}</ref> as the result of the wide usage of online [[social media]] for citizen discussions and for candidates' exposure. It was not possible to prevent the transmission of poll results to a district (in a different [[time zone]]) whose polls had yet to close. This objective is nearly impossible with the vast amount of instant blogging and sharing of information on the election. [[Hashtag]]s along the lines of #tweettheresults were being used by tweeters. Citizens discussed and deliberated that certain laws had to be changed to adjust to present day conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title='Tweet-in' to flout Elections Canada blackout law|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/04/21/cv-section329-reaction.html?ref=rss#|publisher=CBC News|date=April 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Norris|first=Gary|title=Canada Election Result Bloggers Face Fines Under 1938 Law|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-02/canada-election-result-bloggers-face-fines-under-1938-law.html|publisher=Bloomberg|date=May 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Elections Act: Section 329\n\nNo person shall transmit the result or purported result of the vote in an electoral district to the public in another electoral district before the close of all of the polling stations in that other electoral district.<ref name=\"financialpost\">{{cite web|last=Dobby|first=Christine|title=Canadian Internet ads hit $2.2-billion, outpace print in 2010|url=http://www.financialpost.com/news/Canadian+Internet+billion+outpace+print+2010/5194028/story.html|publisher=Financial Post|date=August 2, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n|}\n\nThe 73-year-old law became the subject of debate with the advent of instant social media. Meant to prevent influencing citizens of the [[Canadian west coast|West coast]] whose time zone is about four and a half hours behind the [[Atlantic Canada|East coast]], bloggers had the possibility of receiving a fine of $25,000 for prematurely releasing the election results before all polls close. Under the [[Canada Elections Act]], Section 329 applies to all forms of transmission regardless of the medium. In earlier days the Act was only directed towards television and radio outlets. Though a large amount of violation was anticipated in the 2011 Federal Election, only one case was prosecuted with a minimal fine.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} While some Tweeters and bloggers{{who|date=December 2011}} believe this is a violation of their freedom of expression, [[Elections Canada]] noted that results could be sent between individuals without breaching Section 329, though it was illegal to broadcast them on social media such as a [[Facebook Wall]].<ref name=postingresults>{{cite web|last=Humphreys|first=Adrian|title=Elections Canada warns against posting results on social media|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/04/20/elections-canada-warns-against-broadcasting-results-on-social-media/|publisher=The National Post|date=Apr 20, 2011}}</ref> Information technology specialists from Sequentia Environics and the Social Media Group have stated that people would not be able to conform to the policy conscientiously, and that enforcing confidentiality with the likes of Facebook and Twitter is nearly impossible.<ref name=postingresults/> Other professionals{{who|date=December 2011}}  have even stated there is no use of a law that cannot be enforced effectively. The numerous links and components to all growing social media platforms would necessite detailed examination of acceptable and prohibited sharing of election data.\n\nA recent study conducted by the [[Print Measurement Bureau]] (PMB) on Canadians' social media usage patterns showed that one third of Canadian social networkers are under the age of 25. Compared with the rest of the nation, social networkers are also twice as likely to visit online magazines, newspapers, television and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadians' Usage of Social Media|url=http://www.pmb.ca/public/e/product_data/social_media.pdf|publisher=PMB Print Measurement Bureau|year=2011|access-date=2011-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125014537/http://www.pmb.ca/public/e/product_data/social_media.pdf#|archive-date=2011-11-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSocial media use in agricultural and rural development sectors in Canada is rapidly growing in recent years. Facebook and Twitter are the most used social media tools by the stakeholders of agriculture and rural development. Although there are numerous research and development initiatives of social and collaborative media the interest about social media in agriculture has just grown recently. Some of the few researches done on this topic indicates that  social media use is mainly realized as a linear communication flows<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=Ataharul|last2=Odame|first2=Helen Hambly|date=2014-02-03|title=Social Media for Enhancing Innovation in Agri-food and Rural Development: Current Dynamics in Ontario, Canada|url=http://journals.brandonu.ca/jrcd/article/view/1007|journal=Journal of Rural and Community Development|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|issn=1712-8277}}</ref> among stakeholders of Canadian agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to move beyond and include strategies and capacity building initiatives for dialogical and social interaction approach to support innovative practices of stakeholders in this sector.\n\n=== Interactive media and advertisements ===\n\nAs a consequence of increased online audience, the Canadian online ad revenue rose to $2.2 billion in 2010.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Advertisers are now aiming to measure the attention of online users via [[clickthrough rate]]. The Interactive Advertising Bureau of Canada reported that the online ad revenue surpassed newspapers ad revenues dramatically.<ref name=\"financialpost\" /> Newspapers have always made revenue from advertisements, and not subscriptions,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and in recent years, this has not changed. Online newspapers are keen on increasing their readership to be more valuable to advertising.\n\n== Ethnic online media ==\nIn Canada, immigrant minorities' access to ethnic media online serves as a source of news from their home countries.\n\n[[Multicultural marketing]] is growing in Canada,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} with advertisers hoping to reach the country's hundreds of ethnic communities. In 2009, a study by Solutions Research Group revealed that the Internet has become the preferred medium amongst [[Canadians of Chinese descent|Chinese Canadians]] and [[South Asia]]n Canadians, two of the country's largest cultural groups.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Community [[Web portal|portals]] in particular are popular amongst Canada's ethnic groups.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Web portal [[51.ca]] is an example of a common online networking site for the Chinese community. In Canada, advertisers place [[Geo targeting|geo-targeted]] ads in foreign and online newspapers like [[Times of India|TimesOfIndia.com]] to reach local audiences. Though there is abundant web activity amongst the minority population, they remain loyal to traditional media that communicate in their native languages.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Semansky|first=Matt|title=New Canadians Migrating Online|journal=Marketing Magazine (Toronto)|date=Mar 22, 2010|volume=115|series=Marketing|issue=4|pages=44\u201345|publisher=Rogers Publishing Limited|location=Canada, Toronto|issn=1196-4650|id={{ProQuest|866215072}}}}</ref>\n\n== Canadian laws on online media ==\nThe [[Canadian Radio and Television Commission]] (CRTC) had recently deliberated on revising broadcasting rights from the many incoming internet-based broadcasters from other countries.

Companies like [[Netflix]] Inc. were criticized{{by whom|date=December 2011}} for posing a threat to the domestic broadcasting system, and accused of having a competitive advantage. Since the prolonged consultation revealed there is no evidence that these internet-based movie services are negatively affecting the Canadian broadcasting system, companies like Netflix aren't compelled to follow the same rules and regulations, and don't have to fund Canadian broadcasting content or face the same regulations as cable and satellite distributors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Argitis|first=Theophilos|title=Netflix won't face Canadian regulations|url=http://www.financialpost.com/related/topics/Netflix+face+Canadian+regulations/5487301/story.html|publisher=Financial Post|date=October 1, 2011|access-date=December 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113134938/http://www.financialpost.com/related/topics/Netflix+face+Canadian+regulations/5487301/story.html|archive-date=November 13, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sturgeon|first=Jamie|title=CRTC punts prospect of online television regulations to next year|url=http://www.financialpost.com/related/topics/CRTC+punts+prospect+online+television+regulations+next+year/5506233/story.html|publisher=The National Post|date=Oct 5, 2011|access-date=December 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113131930/http://www.financialpost.com/related/topics/CRTC+punts+prospect+online+television+regulations+next+year/5506233/story.html|archive-date=November 13, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Immediacy of communication and advanced connectivity ==\nIn the summer of 2011, a study by [[Angus Reid (market research)|Angus Reid]] revealed that an approximate one half of online Canadians surveyed would give up cable service before they would give up the Internet.

Presently, [[online media]] can be accessed by [[computers]], [[smart-phones]], [[gaming consoles]], [[Smart TV]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, and [[Tablet computer|tablets]]. The characteristics of Canadian online media are strongly shaped by the Canadian communications industry, even though their statistics and findings are more often than not associated with American research. Large media companies are increasingly on the move to start up online platforms for news and television content. The exponential growth of Canadians' dependency on online content for entertainment and information has been evident in the recent decades. However, it has proven slow for Canadian online media to catch up with the constant increase of American online media. Regardless of medium, entertainment and information hubs are not solely focusing on satisfying the audience they have, but are also heavily expanding their reach to new global audiences.\n\n== Types of online media ==\n\n=== News and magazines ===\n\nAs information is increasingly going digital, the Newspaper Audience Databank (NADbank) claims online readership for most Canadian newspapers have surpassed the numbers in print readership.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krashinsky|first=Susan|title=Online news readership rising: NADbank|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/online-news-readership-rising-nadbank/article1503405/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=March 17, 2010}}</ref> However, there is also lack of evidence that newspapers are coming to an end in Canada. For some of Canada's larger newspapers, readership has increased in both print and online formats. After [[The Globe and Mail]]'s redesign, they claim to have fueled a 10.2% increase in both their print and online readers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Globe readership grows, both for print and online|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/globe-readership-grows-both-for-print-and-online/article2183866/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> \nHighlights from a 2010 study conducted by NADbank revealed the national newspaper readership remains high. Though the migration from print to online newspapers is still ongoing, print editions are still the most popular amongst Canadians.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Overview of Results|url=http://nadbank.com/en/study/readership}}</ref>\n\nMany news writers are beginning to have an active [[Twitter]] presence to communicate with their audiences. Large newspapers{{Which|date=December 2011}} are urging writers to have a public persona on [[blog]]s or Twitter. Instant connection is becoming more substantial, as journalists are encouraged to interact with the public. Canadians are also becoming active participants in the journalistic process as journalists are realizing citizens' ability to perform fragments of journalism, such as taking on-the-scene pictures, tweeting, commenting online or simply editing a Wikipedia entry. Alfred Hermida of the [[University of British Columbia]] asserts that [[participatory journalism]] reinforces the [[public sphere]], while news specialization ironically undermines it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Lisa|title=Participatory Journalism: an interview with Alfred Hermida|url=http://j-source.ca/article/participatory-journalism-interview-alfred-hermida|publisher=The Canadian Journalism Project|date=Nov 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Online-only news====\n\n[[Openfile.ca]] was an online-only newspaper that concentrated on community-powered news, with the intent of connecting people with reporters to cover specific communities. Launched in May 2010, OpenFile aimed to promote [[citizen journalism]] by enabling anyone to suggest a story to cover, and then a paid journalist would conduct research and produce a polished piece. Stories were also [[Geotagging|geotagged]] to improve accessibility to citizens who wanted stories in their immediate neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Openfile|url=http://www.openfile.ca/about-openfile|publisher=Openfile|access-date=2011-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228191443/http://www.openfile.ca/about-openfile#|archive-date=2011-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> By 2012, the site saw about 400,000 unique visitors per month, but it was suddenly shuttered in September of that year due to reported financial problems.<ref>{{cite news|last=Houpt|first=Simon|title=We wanted to believe in OpenFile's community journalism - but the dream is dead|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/we-wanted-to-believe-in-openfiles-community-journalism---but-the-dream-is-dead/article8953664/|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=21 February 2013}}</ref> As of 2014, the Openfile website simply states, \"on hiatus\".\n\nThough news and magazine companies are increasing their presence online, publications such as [[Dose (magazine)|''Dose'' magazine]] have discontinued their print editions, but have gone on to develop their news website as it strategically targets a younger demographic.\n\n[[Rabble.ca]], another online-only news site, is a [[non-profit organization]] that publishes a mixture of original content and those of alternative publications. In 2008, they created rabbletv in an effort to branch out their multi-media presence. Rabble also hosts Babble, a forum pertaining mostly to political discussions, and most recently the Activist Toolkit, a [[wiki]] project that aims to enable members of the rabble community to engage in [[collaborative writing]] of content.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to rabble.ca|url=http://rabble.ca/about/landing|publisher=rabble.ca}}</ref>\n\n[[Canadian Online Explorer|The Canoe Network]] is an online-only news site in Canada with a network of French and English news content, as well as sub-divisions of a job-listing site, TV programs, e-commerce and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Profile|url=http://www.canoe.com/corpo/en/|publisher=Canoe inc.}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n\nIn the digital age, large media conglomerates are taking the opportunity to broaden their audiences by pushing to start up their own online platforms for multimedia content. [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]], one of Canada's largest communication companies, made the move in 2009 to create its version of [[Hulu|Hulu.com]], a popular on-demand streaming video service from the US. The concept was to provide free television programs in pursuance of promoting online content in Canada. It has also been noted as a way to secure Canada's future in broadcasting, as major cable companies were already losing customers to service cancellations in the United States. Much of the efforts to promote Canadian online content have proven to be difficult as the federal broadcast regulators are still in uncharted territories.<ref>{{cite web|last=Surridge|first=Grant|title=Rogers talks up Canadian version of Hulu.com|url=http://www.financialpost.com/news/Rogers+talks+Canadian+version+Hulu/1373987/story.html|publisher=Financial Post|date=March 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nMany satellite companies in Canada also own TV stations. In September 2011, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) decided against the hoarding of specific televised programs by such companies for fair competition. [[Bell Canada]] has made such offerings with [[National Football League|NFL]] games on Bell's Mobile TV package, as well as select [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] games on TSN.ca. Many communications companies{{Which|date=December 2011}} compete to provide instant entertainment content.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rogers hopes Leafs score with subscribers|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rogers-hopes-leafs-score-with-subscribers/article2200568/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=Oct 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLaunched in June 2011, [[Shaw Communications]] have received legal complaints that their online video-streaming consists of movies from major film studios, some of which aren't licensed to be broadcast through their video-streaming platform.

It was not possible to prevent the transmission of poll results to a district (in a different [[time zone]]) whose polls had yet to close. This objective is nearly impossible with the vast amount of instant blogging and sharing of information on the election. [[Hashtag]]s along the lines of #tweettheresults were being used by tweeters.

Meant to prevent influencing citizens of the [[Canadian west coast|West coast]] whose time zone is about four and a half hours behind the [[Atlantic Canada|East coast]], bloggers had the possibility of receiving a fine of $25,000 for prematurely releasing the election results before all polls close. Under the [[Canada Elections Act]], Section 329 applies to all forms of transmission regardless of the medium. In earlier days the Act was only directed towards television and radio outlets. Though a large amount of violation was anticipated in the 2011 Federal Election, only one case was prosecuted with a minimal fine.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} While some Tweeters and bloggers{{who|date=December 2011}} believe this is a violation of their freedom of expression, [[Elections Canada]] noted that results could be sent between individuals without breaching Section 329, though it was illegal to broadcast them on social media such as a [[Facebook Wall]].<ref name=postingresults>{{cite web|last=Humphreys|first=Adrian|title=Elections Canada warns against posting results on social media|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/04/20/elections-canada-warns-against-broadcasting-results-on-social-media/|publisher=The National Post|date=Apr 20, 2011}}</ref> Information technology specialists from Sequentia Environics and the Social Media Group have stated that people would not be able to conform to the policy conscientiously, and that enforcing confidentiality with the likes of Facebook and Twitter is nearly impossible.<ref name=postingresults/> Other professionals{{who|date=December 2011}}  have even stated there is no use of a law that cannot be enforced effectively.

Facebook and Twitter are the most used social media tools by the stakeholders of agriculture and rural development.

He subsequently participated in combat on [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Bougainville]], and Iwo Jima, where he was one of the six Marines who raised the second of two [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]s on top of [[Mount Suribachi]] on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. \n\nThe first flag raised and flown over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, so it was replaced on the same day by a larger one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on the mountain after it was captured, there was no single photograph taken of Marines raising the flag. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag raising after the photograph of it appeared worldwide in newspapers.

Captain Dave Severance, E Company's commander, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battalion. The patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30&nbsp;a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top of the volcano with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt.

Due to the high winds on Mount Suribachi, Sgt.

Johnson decided that a larger flag should be taken up the mountain after he determined that the battalion's flag was too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Mount Suribachi. In the early afternoon, Capt. Severance ordered  Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the larger flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Hayes, and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up the volcano with communication wire (or supplies). Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the company's runner (messenger), was ordered to take \"[[Walkie-talkie|walkie-talkie]]\" batteries and the second flag up the mountain and return the first flag to the battalion adjutant for safekeeping down below. \n\nWhen all five Marines were on top, a Japanese steel pipe was found by Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley who carried the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag. The second flag was attached to the pipe and, as Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines to help them raise it. At approximately 1&nbsp;p.m., Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the second flag and the lowering of the first flagstaff. The second flag was raised by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc.

Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended.

Strank was killed on March 1, Cpl. Block assumed command of Strank's squad in E Company's Second Platoon and, later the same day, Cpl. Block was mortally wounded by an enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round explosion while leading the squad during an attack toward Nishi Ridge. Cpl.

In January 1949, Cpl. Block's remains was re-interred in Weslaco, Texas. In 1995, his body was moved to a burial place at the [[Marine Military Academy]] near its Iwo Jima monument in [[Harlingen, Texas]].<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web|title=Block, Harlon Henry|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbl52|website=The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.mma-tx.org/about-us/MMA-News/MMA-honors-Iwo-Jima-flagraiser-Harlon-Block/ Marine Military Academy]</ref>\n\n== Second flag-raiser corrections ==\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, larger - edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Rosenthal]]'s flag-raising photograph]]\nOn March 20, 1945, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] ordered the flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph to Washington D.C. after the battle. Pfc. Gagnon was ordered to Washington and arrived on April 7. He was questioned the same day by a Marine public information officer about all the identities of the flag raisers including himself. He named Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, Pfc. Sousley, Navy corpsman John Bradley, Pfc. Hayes, and himself as flag-raisers in the photograph and that Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, and Pfc. Sousley were killed in action.<ref name=\"marines.mil\"/> Pfc. Hayes and PhM2c. Bradley were then ordered to appear before the officer (Bradley was recovering in the States from shrapnel wounds) and arrived on April 15. They were questioned separately when they each arrived. PhM2c. Bradley agreed with the identities of all the flag-raisers that Pfc. Gagnon's named. Pfc. Hayes agreed with all of the flag-raisers named in the photograph by Pfc. Gagnon except Sgt. Hansen who he said was Cpl. Block at the base of the flagstaff. The Marine lieutenant colonel told Pfc. Hayes that the identities were made public on April 8 and would not be changed, and to not say anything about it anymore (the lt. colonel later denied that Pfc. Hayes ever told him that Cpl. Block was in the photo).<ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p. 417.</ref>Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Sousley, and Pfc. Hayes, were in Second platoon, E Company; PhM2c. Bradley was in the Third Platoon, E Company; Pfc. Gangon was a Second Battalion runner (messenger) for E company; and Sgt. Hansen was in Third Platoon, Easy Company.\n\n=== Harlon Block ===\n[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|right|The six second-flag raisers]]\nAfter World War II, a controversy arose as to the identity of the person shown at the right end and bottom of the flagstaff in the famous photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi. When Block's mother first viewed Rosenthal's iconic photograph of the second flag-raising in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, 1945, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, \"That's Harlon\", pointing to the flag-raiser on the far right. She never wavered in her belief that it was Harlon in the photo, insisting, \"I know my boy.\"\n\nIn May 1946, after Hayes was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps (December 1945), he visited Mr. Block at his home in Texas and told him his son Harlon was in the photograph. Afterwards, Mrs. Block persuaded Mr. Block to write their congressman about the matter which he did in September, and the Marine Corps replied that an investigation would be held by them into the identities of the second flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. During the following investigation, Hayes' written statements and his letter to Mrs. Block in September 1945 were instrumental in proving Harlon Block was in the famous photograph and Henry Hansen (he was identified as wearing large parachutist boots on Mount Suribachi) was not; Block, Hayes, and Hansen were former [[Paramarines]]. Rene Gagnon and John Bradley who said it was Hansen, agreed that \"it could be Block\" after learning why Hayes said it was Block. The investigation which began in December and concluded in January 1947, found that it was indeed Block and not Hansen at the base of The flagstaff in the picture, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter.<ref name=\"Investigating Iwo\">{{cite book |editor-last=Robertson |editor-first=Breanne |date=2019 |title=Investigating Iwo: The Flag Raisings in Myth, Memory, and Esprit de Corps |url=https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Investigating%20Iwo_WEB3.pdf |location=Quantico, Virginia |publisher=Marine Corps History Division |pages=243, 312 |isbn=978-0-16-095331-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Harold Schultz ===\nIn June 2016, a Marine Corps review board looked once more into the identities of the six second flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph, this time concluding that PhM2c.

He subsequently participated in combat on [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Bougainville]], and Iwo Jima, where he was one of the six Marines who raised the second of two [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]s on top of [[Mount Suribachi]] on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. \n\nThe first flag raised and flown over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, so it was replaced on the same day by a larger one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on the mountain after it was captured, there was no single photograph taken of Marines raising the flag. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag raising after the photograph of it appeared worldwide in newspapers. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">YouTube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \"Shooting Iwo Jima\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOy6yRAB6BY] Retrieved March 14, 2020</ref> \n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], was modeled after the historic photograph of six Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\n== Early life ==\nBlock was born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], the third of six children to Edward Frederick Block and Ada Belle Brantley, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh day-Adventist]] family.<ref name=TSHA/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |title=Famed Iwo Jima flag raisers gone but not forgotten |publisher=Marines.mil |date= |access-date=2012-05-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007080257/http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |archive-date=2012-10-07 |df= }}</ref> The Block children were: Edward Jr., Maurine, Harlon, Larry, Corky, and Melford.<ref>Bradley, p. 31.</ref> Edward Frederick Block was a [[World War I]] veteran and supported his family by working as a dairy farmer.<ref>''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]], p. 29.</ref> In hopes of improving the family, the Block family relocated to [[Weslaco, Texas]], a city located in the [[Rio Grande Valley]].

Block landed on Iwo Jima from the [[USS Talladega]] after transferring off the [[USS Missoula (APA-211)|USS Missoula]]. His rifle company was part of the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marines]] amphibious assault landing at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi. The 28th Marines mission was to capture Mount Suribachi.\n\n===== First flag-raising =====\n[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|left|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]\nOn the morning of February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler Johnson, commander of the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], to take a platoon size patrol up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion's flag to signal the summit was secure. Captain Dave Severance, E Company's commander, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battalion. The patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30&nbsp;a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top of the volcano with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas|Ernest Thomas]], Sergeant [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]],<ref>[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living.

Due to the high winds on Mount Suribachi, Sgt. Hansen, Private Phil Ward, and Navy [[Hospital corpsman|corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] pitched in to help make the flagstaff stay in a vertical position. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Marine Staff Sergeant [[Louis R.

Johnson decided that a larger flag should be taken up the mountain after he determined that the battalion's flag was too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Mount Suribachi. In the early afternoon, Capt. Severance ordered  Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the larger flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Hayes, and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up the volcano with communication wire (or supplies). Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the company's runner (messenger), was ordered to take \"[[Walkie-talkie|walkie-talkie]]\" batteries and the second flag up the mountain and return the first flag to the battalion adjutant for safekeeping down below. \n\nWhen all five Marines were on top, a Japanese steel pipe was found by Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley who carried the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag. The second flag was attached to the pipe and, as Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines to help them raise it. At approximately 1&nbsp;p.m., Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the second flag and the lowering of the first flagstaff. The second flag was raised by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc.

Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt.

Sousley was killed on March 21.\n\n==== Death ====\nAccording to the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of Navy corpsman John Bradley), when Sgt. Strank was killed on March 1, Cpl. Block assumed command of Strank's squad in E Company's Second Platoon and, later the same day, Cpl. Block was mortally wounded by an enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round explosion while leading the squad during an attack toward Nishi Ridge. Cpl. Block's last words were, \"They killed me!\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=James|title=Flags of Our Fathers|date=May 2000|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553589-34-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flagsofourfather00jame/page/232 232\u2013233]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/flagsofourfather00jame/page/232}}</ref> However, Ralph Griffiths, a member of the same platoon as Cpl.

Block was originally buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima on March 5, 1945. A service was held there on March 26 with Pfc. Hayes and other members of E Company in attendance. In January 1949, Cpl. Block's remains was re-interred in Weslaco, Texas. In 1995, his body was moved to a burial place at the [[Marine Military Academy]] near its Iwo Jima monument in [[Harlingen, Texas]].<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web|title=Block, Harlon Henry|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbl52|website=The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.mma-tx.org/about-us/MMA-News/MMA-honors-Iwo-Jima-flagraiser-Harlon-Block/ Marine Military Academy]</ref>\n\n== Second flag-raiser corrections ==\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, larger - edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Rosenthal]]'s flag-raising photograph]]\nOn March 20, 1945, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] ordered the flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph to Washington D.C. after the battle. Pfc. Gagnon was ordered to Washington and arrived on April 7. He was questioned the same day by a Marine public information officer about all the identities of the flag raisers including himself. He named Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, Pfc. Sousley, Navy corpsman John Bradley, Pfc. Hayes, and himself as flag-raisers in the photograph and that Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, and Pfc. Sousley were killed in action.<ref name=\"marines.mil\"/> Pfc. Hayes and PhM2c. Bradley were then ordered to appear before the officer (Bradley was recovering in the States from shrapnel wounds) and arrived on April 15. They were questioned separately when they each arrived. PhM2c. Bradley agreed with the identities of all the flag-raisers that Pfc. Gagnon's named. Pfc. Hayes agreed with all of the flag-raisers named in the photograph by Pfc. Gagnon except Sgt. Hansen who he said was Cpl. Block at the base of the flagstaff. The Marine lieutenant colonel told Pfc. Hayes that the identities were made public on April 8 and would not be changed, and to not say anything about it anymore (the lt. colonel later denied that Pfc. Hayes ever told him that Cpl. Block was in the photo).<ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p. 417.</ref>Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Sousley, and Pfc. Hayes, were in Second platoon, E Company; PhM2c. Bradley was in the Third Platoon, E Company; Pfc. Gangon was a Second Battalion runner (messenger) for E company; and Sgt. Hansen was in Third Platoon, Easy Company.\n\n=== Harlon Block ===\n[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|right|The six second-flag raisers]]\nAfter World War II, a controversy arose as to the identity of the person shown at the right end and bottom of the flagstaff in the famous photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi. When Block's mother first viewed Rosenthal's iconic photograph of the second flag-raising in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, 1945, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, \"That's Harlon\", pointing to the flag-raiser on the far right. She never wavered in her belief that it was Harlon in the photo, insisting, \"I know my boy.\"\n\nIn May 1946, after Hayes was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps (December 1945), he visited Mr. Block at his home in Texas and told him his son Harlon was in the photograph. Afterwards, Mrs. Block persuaded Mr. Block to write their congressman about the matter which he did in September, and the Marine Corps replied that an investigation would be held by them into the identities of the second flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. During the following investigation, Hayes' written statements and his letter to Mrs. Block in September 1945 were instrumental in proving Harlon Block was in the famous photograph and Henry Hansen (he was identified as wearing large parachutist boots on Mount Suribachi) was not; Block, Hayes, and Hansen were former [[Paramarines]]. Rene Gagnon and John Bradley who said it was Hansen, agreed that \"it could be Block\" after learning why Hayes said it was Block. The investigation which began in December and concluded in January 1947, found that it was indeed Block and not Hansen at the base of The flagstaff in the picture, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter.<ref name=\"Investigating Iwo\">{{cite book |editor-last=Robertson |editor-first=Breanne |date=2019 |title=Investigating Iwo: The Flag Raisings in Myth, Memory, and Esprit de Corps |url=https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Investigating%20Iwo_WEB3.pdf |location=Quantico, Virginia |publisher=Marine Corps History Division |pages=243, 312 |isbn=978-0-16-095331-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Harold Schultz ===\nIn June 2016, a Marine Corps review board looked once more into the identities of the six second flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph, this time concluding that PhM2c.
