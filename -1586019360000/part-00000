The paleontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed not only several remnants of [[Cuvieronius]], but also several other species of vertebrates.

Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of [[Acajutla]] and waited for Alvarado and his forces.

Alvarado saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAlvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.\n\n[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]\n\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf |title=World Directory of Minorities |author=Minority Rights Group International |accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref> The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibuc\u00e1]].\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\n=== Spanish rule (1525\u20131821)===\n[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep. Centroam\u00e9rica).jpg|thumb|A painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in San Salvador.

The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[intendancy|intendencia]]'' in 1786.\n\nTowards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.\n\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.\n\n=== Independence (1821) ===\nIn 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas P.

In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tom\u00e1s Regalado]]\n\nIn 1898, Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]\n\nAraujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]].\n\nIn December 1931, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Mart\u00ednez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.\n\nThe Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas P.

Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.\n\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.\n\nFrom December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.\n\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]].]]\n\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.\n\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - Demographics |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - MIGRATION |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/32.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.

Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.\n\n=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)===\n{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}\n\nIn October 1979, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen.

In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block).

It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the \"[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascor\u00e1n River|Goascor\u00e1n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel]].\n\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km\u00b2). [[Lake G\u00fcija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km\u00b2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerr\u00f3n Grande]] (135&nbsp;km\u00b2). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.\n\nEl Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SLV present.svg|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of El Salvador.]]\n\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near [[Cerro El Pital]], snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country).\n\n===Natural disasters===\n\n====Extreme weather events====\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatit\u00e1n]]]]\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] and [[La Ni\u00f1a]] effects.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> On 4 October 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.<ref name=\"tdfiyp\"/> El Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean.<ref name=\"cdkn.org\"/>\n\n====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====\n[[File:Vulkan Chaparrastique, El Salvador 2013 01.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel]] volcano in 2013]]\nEl Salvador lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and is thus subject to significant [[tectonic plate|tectonic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

Of these four species, the most common is the olive ridley turtle, followed by the green sea turtle. The other two species, hawksbill and leatherback, are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered, while the olive ridley and green sea turtle are in danger of extinction.\n\nRecent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.{{when|date=July 2016}} In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.\n\nDespite these efforts, much remains to be done.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of El Salvador}}\nThe 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]\n# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n#  The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.\n#  The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n#\nAfter the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defence of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.\n\nThe political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Nayib Bukele]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]].

Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes.\n\nGeographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] belongs to the FMLN party.

Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94 billion to $3.51 billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95 billion to $7.63 billion.

With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy.

Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign [[income]] and offset the substantial [[trade deficit]] of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Remittances|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107112652/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html|archivedate=7 November 2007}}</ref> approximately 16.2% of [[gross domestic product]](GDP).\n\nRemittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador.

Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.\n\nMoney from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]\n\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.\n\nThere are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] \u2014 with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].\n\n===Official corruption and foreign investment===\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, \"While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reorganizing ARENA: The Partys Future After Avila's Defeat |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR947_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |accessdate=17 March 2020 |date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]\" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>\n\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, \"Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most \"business friendly\" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>\n\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<ref>{{cite news |title=CEL a punto de ir a otro arbitraje |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=elsalvador.com |date=21 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045947/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |archivedate=29 November 2014}}</ref> The government came to its defence claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy).

Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.\n\nSurfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.\n\nAccording to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Water supply and sanitation===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}\nThe level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly.

Notable 20th-century personages include the late filmmaker Baltasar Polio, female film director [[Patricia Chica]], artist [[Fernando Llort]], and [[caricaturist]] [[To\u00f1o Salazar]].\n\nAmong the more renowned representatives of the graphic arts are the painters [[Augusto Crespin]], [[Noe Canjura]], [[Carlos Ca\u00f1as]], [[Giovanni Gil]], Julia D\u00edaz, Mauricio Mejia, Maria Elena Palomo de Mejia, [[Camilo Minero]], Ricardo Carbonell, Roberto Huezo, Miguel Angel Cerna, (the painter and writer better known as MACLo), Esael Araujo, and many others.

''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de ma\u00edz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharr\u00f3n]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>\n\n''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\"/>\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n\nOne of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.\n\n[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.\n\n\"''Maria Luisa''\" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador \u2013 traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>\n\nOther popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.\n\nOne of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}\nSalvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''Xuc'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], [[Cuscatl\u00e1n Department|Cuscatlan]]. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America]]\n\n[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in  El Salvador.

Alvarado saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAlvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.\n\n[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]\n\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf |title=World Directory of Minorities |author=Minority Rights Group International |accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref> The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibuc\u00e1]].\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\n=== Spanish rule (1525\u20131821)===\n[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep.

The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[intendancy|intendencia]]'' in 1786.\n\nTowards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.\n\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.\n\n=== Independence (1821) ===\nIn 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas P.

In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tom\u00e1s Regalado]]\n\nIn 1898, Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]\n\nAraujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]].\n\nIn December 1931, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Mart\u00ednez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.\n\nThe Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas P.

Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.\n\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.\n\nFrom December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.\n\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]].]]\n\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.\n\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - Demographics |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - MIGRATION |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/32.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.  They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.\n\nPDC leader [[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]] was the mayor of [[San Salvador]] from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.\n\n=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)===\n{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}\n\nIn October 1979, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen.

In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 \u2013 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=T.D. |author2=D.A.

It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the \"[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascor\u00e1n River|Goascor\u00e1n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel]].\n\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km\u00b2). [[Lake G\u00fcija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km\u00b2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerr\u00f3n Grande]] (135&nbsp;km\u00b2). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.\n\nEl Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SLV present.svg|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of El Salvador.]]\n\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near [[Cerro El Pital]], snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country).\n\n===Natural disasters===\n\n====Extreme weather events====\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatit\u00e1n]]]]\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] and [[La Ni\u00f1a]] effects.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> On 4 October 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.<ref name=\"tdfiyp\"/> El Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean.<ref name=\"cdkn.org\"/>\n\n====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====\n[[File:Vulkan Chaparrastique, El Salvador 2013 01.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel]] volcano in 2013]]\nEl Salvador lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and is thus subject to significant [[tectonic plate|tectonic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]\n# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n#  The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.\n#  The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n#\nAfter the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defence of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.\n\nThe political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Nayib Bukele]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The country also has an independent [[Judiciary]] and [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Supreme Court]].\n\n===Political culture===\n{{Further|List of political parties in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Bukele Conferencia.png|thumb|[[President of El Salvador]], [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nEl Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes.\n\nGeographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] belongs to the FMLN party. In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly, ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Participates in Signing Ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension - 48342132177.jpg|thumb| U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] participates in a signing ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension with Salvadoran President [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nIn November, 1950 El Salvador helped the newly empowered [[14th Dalai Lama]] by supporting his [[Tibet]]an Government cabinet minister's [[telegram]] requesting an appeal before the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] to stop the Communist [[China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]]'s invasion of Tibet. \"Only the tiny country of El Salvador agreed to sponsor Tibet's plea.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Story of Tibet:Conversations with His Holiness the Dalai Lama|last=Laird|first=Thomas|publisher=Grove Press|year=2006|isbn=9780802118271|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303 303\u2013305]|url=https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303}}</ref>\"At the UN, no one was willing to stand up beside El Salvador.

Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.\n\nMoney from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]\n\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.\n\nThere are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] \u2014 with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].\n\n===Official corruption and foreign investment===\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, \"While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reorganizing ARENA: The Partys Future After Avila's Defeat |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR947_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |accessdate=17 March 2020 |date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]\" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>\n\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, \"Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most \"business friendly\" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>\n\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in.

Besides these two attractions, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.\n\nSurfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.\n\nAccording to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Water supply and sanitation===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}\nThe level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly.

''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de ma\u00edz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharr\u00f3n]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>\n\n''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\"/>\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n\nOne of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.\n\n[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.\n\n\"''Maria Luisa''\" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador \u2013 traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>\n\nOther popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.\n\nOne of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}\nSalvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''Xuc'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], [[Cuscatl\u00e1n Department|Cuscatlan]]. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America]]\n\n[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in  El Salvador.

To evangelicals, the central message of the gospel is [[justification by faith]] in Christ and [[repentance]], or turning away, from [[sin]]. Conversion differentiates the Christian from the non-Christian, and the change in life it leads to is marked by both a rejection of sin and a corresponding personal [[Sanctification|holiness]] of life. A conversion experience can be emotional, including grief and sorrow for sin followed by great relief at receiving forgiveness. The stress on conversion differentiates evangelicalism from other forms of Protestantism by the associated belief that an [[assurance (theology)|assurance]] will accompany conversion.<ref name=\"Yates2015\">{{cite book |last1=Yates |first1=Arthur S. |title=The Doctrine of Assurance: With Special Reference to John Wesley |date=2015 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=9781498205047 |language=English |quote=Writing to Arthur Bedford on 4th August 1738, Wesley says: 'That assurance of which alone I speak, I should not choose to call an assurance of salvation, but rather (with the Scriptures) the assurance of faith. . . .

The trouble is that evangelicals differ widely in how they interpret and emphasize 'fundamental' doctrines.

Some evangelicals have always viewed conversion as an incremental process rather than an instantaneous rebirth (and their numbers may be increasing).\"</ref>\n\nBiblicism is reverence for the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]] and high regard for [[biblical authority]]. All evangelicals believe in [[biblical inspiration]], though they disagree over how this inspiration should be defined. Many evangelicals believe in [[biblical inerrancy]], while other evangelicals believe in [[biblical infallibility]].{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=12\u201314}}\n\nCrucicentrism is the centrality that evangelicals give to the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]], the saving [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and the [[resurrection of Jesus]], that offers forgiveness of sins and new life. This is understood most commonly in terms of a [[substitutionary atonement]], in which Christ died as a substitute for sinful humanity by taking on himself the guilt and punishment for sin.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=15\u201316}}\n\nActivism describes the tendency toward active expression and sharing of the gospel in diverse ways that include preaching and social action.

He taught that in baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the \"ordinary means\" that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective. <br /> ''Baptism as Forgiveness of Sin''. In baptism God offers and we accept the forgiveness of our sin (Acts 2:38). With the pardoning of sin which has separated us from God, we are justified\u2014freed from the guilt and penalty of sin and restored to right relationship with God. This reconciliation is made possible through the atonement of Christ and made real in our lives by the work of the Holy Spirit. We respond by confessing and repenting of our sin, and affirming our faith that Jesus Christ has accomplished all that is necessary for our salvation. Faith is the necessary condition for justification; in baptism, that faith is professed. God's forgiveness makes possible the renewal of our spiritual lives and our becoming new beings in Christ. <br /> ''Baptism as New Life''. Baptism is the sacramental sign of new life through and in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Variously identified as regeneration, new birth, and being born again, this work of grace makes us into new spiritual creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). We die to our old nature which was dominated by sin and enter into the very life of Christ who transforms us. Baptism is the means of entry into new life in Christ (John 3:5; Titus 3:5), but new birth may not always coincide with the moment of the administration of water or the laying on of hands. Our awareness and acceptance of our redemption by Christ and new life in him may vary throughout our lives. But, in whatever way the reality of the new birth is experienced, it carries out the promises God made to us in our baptism.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Evangelical Alliance]] founded by the evangelical organizations of 21 countries, at the first general assembly in Woudschoten ([[Zeist]]) in the Netherlands in 1951 established a common [[confession of faith]] adhered to by its member denominations.<ref>Roger E.

Between 1950 and 2000 a mainstream evangelical consensus developed that sought to be more inclusive and more culturally relevant than fundamentalism while maintaining conservative Protestant teaching. According to [[Brian Stanley (historian)|Brian Stanley]], professor of [[world Christianity]], this new postwar consensus is termed ''neo-evangelicalism'', the ''new evangelicalism'', or simply ''evangelicalism'' in the United States, while in Great Britain and in other English-speaking countries, it is commonly termed ''[[conservative evangelicalism in the United Kingdom|conservative evangelicalism]]''. Over the years, less-conservative evangelicals have challenged this mainstream consensus to varying degrees. Such movements have been classified by a variety of labels, such as progressive, open, post-conservative, and post-evangelical.{{Sfn | Stanley | 2013 | pp=27\u201328}}\n\nSome commentators have complained that Evangelicalism as a movement is too broad and its definition too vague to be of any practical value. Theologian Donald Dayton has called for a \"moratorium\" on use of the term.{{Sfn|Dayton|1991|p=251}} Historian [[D. G.

Failing to reform the mainline churches, fundamentalists separated from them and established their own churches, refusing to participate in [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] organizations such as the [[National Council of Churches]] (founded in 1950). They also made [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separatism]] (rigid separation from non-fundamentalist churches and their [[culture]]) a true test of faith. According to historian [[George Marsden]], most fundamentalists are Baptists and [[dispensationalist]].{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\n===Mainstream varieties===\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer 1760.jpg|thumb|The Prayer Book of 1662 included the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] emphasized by [[evangelical Anglican]]s.]]\nMainstream evangelicalism is historically divided between two main orientations: [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] and [[revivalism]]. These two streams have been critical of each other. Confessional evangelicals have been suspicious of unguarded [[religious experience]], while revivalist evangelicals have been critical of overly intellectual teaching that (they suspect) stifles vibrant [[spirituality]].{{Sfn | Olson | 2011 | pp= 241\u2013242}} In an effort to broaden their appeal, many contemporary evangelical congregations intentionally avoid identifying with any single form of evangelicalism. These \"generic evangelicals\" are usually theologically and socially conservative, but their churches often present themselves as nondenominational (or, if a denominational member, strongly de-emphasizing its ties to such, such as a church name which excludes the denominational name) within the broader evangelical movement.{{Sfn | Reimer | 2003 | pp=29}}\n\nIn the words of [[Albert Mohler]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], confessional evangelicalism refers to \"that movement of Christian believers who seek a constant convictional continuity with the theological formulas of the Protestant Reformation\". While approving of the evangelical distinctions proposed by Bebbington, confessional evangelicals believe that authentic evangelicalism requires more concrete definition in order to protect the movement from theological liberalism and from [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. According to confessional evangelicals, subscription to the [[ecumenical creeds]] and to the Reformation-era confessions of faith (such as the [[Reformed confessions of faith|confessions of the Reformed churches]]) provides such protection.{{Sfn | Mohler | 2011 | pp=103\u2013104}} Confessional evangelicals are represented by conservative [[Presbyterian]] churches (emphasizing the [[Westminster Confession]]), certain Baptist churches that emphasize historic Baptist confessions such as the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Confession]], evangelical Anglicans who emphasize the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] (such as in the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]], Australia{{Sfn | Stanley | 2013 | pp= 58}}), [[Methodist]] churches that adhere to the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]], and some [[confessional Lutherans]] with pietistic convictions.{{Sfn | Ellingsen | 1991 | pp=222, 238}}<ref name=\"Coulter\">Dale M.

Retrieved December 17, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe emphasis on historic Protestant orthodoxy among confessional evangelicals stands in direct contrast to an anti-creedal outlook that has exerted its own influence on evangelicalism, particularly among churches strongly affected by revivalism and by [[pietism]]. Revivalist evangelicals are represented by some quarters of [[Methodism]], the [[Holiness Movement|Wesleyan Holiness]] churches, the Pentecostal/[[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] churches, some Anabaptist churches, and some Baptists and Presbyterians.<ref name=Coulter/> Revivalist evangelicals tend to place greater emphasis on religious experience than their confessional counterparts.{{Sfn | Olson | 2011 | pp=241\u2013242}}\n\n===Non-conservative varieties===\n\nEvangelicals dissatisfied with the movement's conservative mainstream have been variously described as progressive evangelicals, post-conservative evangelicals, [[Open Evangelical]]s and [[post-evangelicalism|post-evangelicals]]. Progressive evangelicals, also known as the [[evangelical left]], share theological or social views with other [[Progressive Christianity|progressive Christians]] while also identifying with evangelicalism. Progressive evangelicals commonly advocate for women's equality, [[pacifism]] and [[social justice]].{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=75}}\n\nAs described by Baptist theologian [[Roger E. Olson]], post-conservative evangelicalism is a theological school of thought that adheres to the four marks of evangelicalism, while being less rigid and more inclusive of other Christians. According to Olson, post-conservatives believe that doctrinal truth is secondary to spiritual experience shaped by [[Scripture]]. Post-conservative evangelicals seek greater dialogue with other Christian traditions and support the development of a multicultural evangelical theology that incorporates the voices of women, racial minorities, and Christians in the developing world. Some post-conservative evangelicals also support [[open theism]] and the possibility of near [[universal salvation]].<ref name=\"OlsonCentury\">Roger E. Olson, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=85 \"Postconservative Evangelicals Greet the Postmodern Age\"] {{Webarchive| url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160101003723/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=85 |date= 2016-01-01 }}, ''The Christian Century'' (May 3, 1995), pp. 480\u2013483. Retrieved December 16, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe term \"Open Evangelical\" refers to a particular Christian school of thought or [[churchmanship]], primarily in Great Britain (especially in the [[Church of England]]). Open evangelicals describe their position as combining a traditional evangelical emphasis on the nature of scriptural authority, the teaching of the ecumenical creeds and other traditional doctrinal teachings, with an approach towards culture and other [[theology|theological]] points-of-view which tends to be more inclusive than that taken by other evangelicals. Some open evangelicals aim to take a middle position between conservative and charismatic evangelicals, while others would combine conservative theological emphases with more liberal social positions.{{Sfn | Randall | 2005 | p=52}}\n\nBritish author Dave Tomlinson coined the phrase ''post-evangelical'' to describe a movement comprising various trends of dissatisfaction among evangelicals. Others use the term with comparable intent, often to distinguish evangelicals in the so-called [[emerging church movement]] from post-evangelicals and anti-evangelicals. Tomlinson argues that \"linguistically, the distinction ''[between evangelical and post-evangelical]'' resembles the one that sociologists make between the [[modernism|modern]] and [[postmodernism|postmodern]] eras\".{{Sfn | Tomlinson | 2007 | p= 28}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nEvangelicalism did not take recognizable form until the 18th century, first in Britain and its North American colonies. Nevertheless, there were earlier developments within the larger Protestant world that preceded and influenced the later evangelical revivals. According to religion scholar, social activist, and politician [[Randall Balmer]], Evangelicalism resulted \"from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans\".{{Sfn | Balmer| 2002 |pp=vii\u2013viii}} Historian [[Mark Noll]] adds to this list [[High Church]] Anglicanism, which contributed to Evangelicalism a legacy of \"rigorous spirituality and innovative organization\".{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=50}}\n\nDuring the 17th century, Pietism emerged in Europe as a movement for the revival of [[piety]] and devotion within the Lutheran church. As a protest against \"cold orthodoxy\" or an overly formal and rational Christianity, Pietists advocated for an experiential religion that stressed high moral standards for both clergy and lay people. The movement included both Christians who remained in the [[liturgical]], [[state church]]es as well as [[Separatism#Religious separatism|separatist]] groups who rejected the use of baptismal fonts, altars, pulpits, and confessionals. As Pietism spread, the movement's ideals and aspirations influenced and were absorbed into early Evangelicalism.{{Sfn | Balmer | 2002 | pp=542\u2013543}}\n\nThe Presbyterian heritage not only gave Evangelicalism a commitment to Protestant orthodoxy but also contributed a revival tradition that stretched back to the 1620s in Scotland and Northern Ireland.{{Sfn | Longfield | 2013 | pp=7}} Central to this tradition was the [[communion season]], which normally occurred in the summer months. For Presbyterians, celebrations of [[Holy Communion]] were infrequent but popular events preceded by several Sundays of preparatory preaching and accompanied with preaching, singing, and prayers.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=44, 112}}\n\nPuritanism combined Calvinism with teaching that conversion was a prerequisite for church membership and a stress on the study of Scripture by lay people. It took root in New England, where the [[Congregational church]] was an established religion. The [[Half-Way Covenant]] of 1662 allowed parents who had not testified to a conversion experience to have their children baptized, while reserving Holy Communion for converted church members alone.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=54\u201355}} By the 18th century, Puritanism was in decline and many ministers were alarmed at the loss of religious piety. This concern over declining religious commitment led many people to support evangelical revival.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=46\u201347}}\n\nHigh Church Anglicanism also exerted influence on early Evangelicalism. High Churchmen were distinguished by their desire to adhere to [[primitive Christianity]]. This desire included imitating the faith and ascetic practices of early Christians as well as regularly partaking of Holy Communion. High Churchmen were also enthusiastic organizers of voluntary religious societies. Two of the most prominent were the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], which distributed Bibles and other literature and built schools, and the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]], which was created to facilitate missionary work in British colonies. [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel]] and [[Susanna Wesley]], the parents of John and Charles Wesley, were both devoted advocates of High Churchmanship.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===18th century===\n{{See also|First Great Awakening}}\n[[File:A Faithful Narrative of the Surprizing Work of God by Jonathan Edwards 1737.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Jonathan Edwards' account of the revival in Northampton was published in 1737 as ''[[A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God in the Conversion of Many Hundred Souls in Northampton]]'']]\n\nIn the 1730s, Evangelicalism emerged as a distinct phenomenon out of religious revivals that began in Britain and New England. While religious revivals had occurred within Protestant churches in the past, the evangelical revivals that marked the 18th century were more intense and radical.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=76}} Evangelical revivalism imbued ordinary men and women with a confidence and enthusiasm for sharing the gospel and converting others outside of the control of established churches, a key discontinuity with the Protestantism of the previous era.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=74}}\n\nIt was developments in the doctrine of assurance that differentiated Evangelicalism from what went before. Bebbington says, \"The dynamism of the Evangelical movement was possible only because its adherents were assured in their faith.\"{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=42}} He goes on:\n\n{{Quote | Whereas the Puritans had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers, the Evangelicals believed it to be general, normally given at conversion and the result of simple acceptance of the gift of God. The consequence of the altered form of the doctrine was a metamorphosis in the nature of popular Protestantism. There was a change in patterns of piety, affecting devotional and practical life in all its departments. The shift, in fact, was responsible for creating in Evangelicalism a new movement and not merely a variation on themes heard since the Reformation.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}}}}\n\nThe first local revival occurred in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], under the leadership of Congregationalist minister [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. In the fall of 1734, Edwards preached a sermon series on \"Justification By Faith Alone\", and the community's response was extraordinary. Signs of religious commitment among the [[laity]] increased, especially among the town's young people. The revival ultimately spread to 25 communities in western Massachusetts and central Connecticut until it began to wane by the spring of 1735.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=76\u201378}} Edwards was heavily influenced by Pietism, so much so that one historian has stressed his \"American Pietism\".{{Sfn | Lovelace | 2007 | pp=}} One practice clearly copied from European Pietists was the use of small groups divided by age and gender, which met in private homes to conserve and promote the fruits of revival.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=77}}\n\nAt the same time, students at [[Yale University]] (at that time Yale College) in New Haven, Connecticut, were also experiencing revival. Among them was [[Aaron Burr, Sr.]], who would become a prominent Presbyterian minister and future president of [[Princeton University]]. In New Jersey, [[Gilbert Tennent]], another Presbyterian minister, was preaching the evangelical message and urging the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]] to stress the necessity of converted ministers.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe spring of 1735 also marked important events in England and Wales. [[Howell Harris]], a Welsh schoolteacher, had a conversion experience on May 25 during a communion service. He described receiving assurance of God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] after a period of [[fasting]], self-examination, and despair over his sins.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=79}} Sometime later, [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]], the Anglican [[curate]] of Llangeitho, Wales, experienced conversion as well. Both men began preaching the evangelical message to large audiences, becoming leaders of the [[Welsh Methodist revival]].{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=20}} At about the same time that Harris experienced conversion in Wales, [[George Whitefield]] was converted at Oxford University after his own prolonged spiritual crisis. Whitefield later remarked, \"About this time God was pleased to enlighten my soul, and bring me into the knowledge of His free grace, and the necessity of being justified in His sight by ''faith only''\".{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=79\u201380}}\n\n[[File:John Wesley preaching outside a church. Engraving. Wellcome V0006868.jpg|thumb|When forbidden from preaching from the pulpits of [[parish church]]es, [[John Wesley]] began [[open-air preaching]].]]\n\nWhitefield's fellow [[Holy Club]] member and spiritual mentor, [[Charles Wesley]], reported an evangelical conversion in 1738.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=20}} In the same week, Charles' brother and future founder of Methodism, [[John Wesley]] was also converted after a long period of inward struggle. During this spiritual crisis, John Wesley was directly influenced by Pietism. Two years before his conversion, Wesley had traveled to the newly established colony of Georgia as a missionary for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He shared his voyage with a group of [[Moravian Brethren]] led by [[August Gottlieb Spangenberg]]. The Moravians' faith and piety deeply impressed Wesley, especially their belief that it was a normal part of Christian life to have an assurance of one's salvation.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=84}} Wesley recounted the following exchange with Spangenberg on February 7, 1736:\n\n{{Quote|[Spangenberg] said, \"My brother, I must first ask you one or two questions. Have you the witness within yourself? Does the Spirit of God bear witness with your spirit that you are a child of God?\" I was surprised, and knew not what to answer. He observed it, and asked, \"Do you know Jesus Christ?\" I paused, and said, \"I know he is the Savior of the world.\" \"True,\" he replied, \"but do you know he has saved you?\" I answered, \"I hope he has died to save me.\" He only added, \"Do you know yourself?\" I said, \"I do.\" But I fear they were vain words.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=85}}}}\n\nWesley finally received the assurance he had been searching for at a meeting of a religious society in London. While listening to a reading from Martin Luther's preface to the [[Epistle to the Romans]], Wesley felt spiritually transformed:\n\n{{Quote|About a quarter before nine, while [the speaker] was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed.

It reached people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety and their self-awareness.

The NAE was partly a reaction to the founding of the [[American Council of Christian Churches]] (ACCC) under the leadership of the fundamentalist [[Carl McIntire]]. The ACCC in turn had been founded to counter the influence of the [[Federal Council of Churches]] (later merged into the [[National Council of Churches]]), which fundamentalists saw as increasingly embracing modernism in its [[ecumenism]].{{sfn| Carpenter | 1997 | 141-150}} Those who established the NAE had come to view the name fundamentalist as \"an embarrassment instead of a badge of honor.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kantzer |first=Kenneth |date=September 16, 1996 |title=Standing on the Promises |magazine=Christianity Today |volume=40 |page=30 |number=10}}</ref>\n\nWith the founding of the NAE, American Protestantism was divided into three large groups&mdash;the fundamentalists, the modernists, and the new evangelicals, who sought to position themselves between the other two. In 1947 Harold Ockenga coined the term ''neo-evangelicalism'' to identify a movement distinct from fundamentalism. The neo-evangelicals had three broad characteristics that distinguished them from the conservative fundamentalism of the ACCC:\n\n{{ordered list | They encouraged engagement in social concerns; | They promoted high standards of academic scholarship; and | They rejected the ecclesiastical separatism promoted by McIntire,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.amcouncilcc.org/constitution.asp |title=Constitution of the American Council of Christian Churches |last=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=American Council of Christian Churches |access-date=2011-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722180937/http://www.amcouncilcc.org/constitution.asp |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> often pursuing collaboration with others through parachurch organizations{{sfn|  Carpenter | 1997 | 240}}}}\n\nEach of these characteristics took concrete shape by the mid-1950s.

Graham had begun his career with the support of McIntire and fellow conservatives [[Bob Jones Sr.]] and [[John R. Rice]]. However, in broadening the reach of his London crusade of 1954, he accepted the support of denominations that those men disapproved of. When he went even further in his 1957 New York crusade, conservatives strongly condemned him and withdrew their support.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Martin |first=William |title=A Prophet with Honor: The Billy Graham Story |date=1991 |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |pages=218\u2013224}}</ref>{{sfn | Marsden | 1987 | 159-160}} According to William Martin:\n\n{{Quote | text=The New York crusade did not cause the division between the old Fundamentalists and the New Evangelicals; that had been signaled by the nearly simultaneous founding of the NAE and McIntire\u2019s American Council of Christian Churches 15 years earlier.

In a letter to Harold Lindsell, Graham said that ''CT'' would:\n\n{{Quote | text=plant the evangelical flag in the middle of the road, taking a conservative theological position but a definite liberal approach to social problems.

New charismatic groups such as the [[Association of Vineyard Churches]] and [[Newfrontiers]] trace their roots to this period (see also [[British New Church Movement]]).\n\nThe closing years of the 20th century saw controversial [[postmodern]] influences entering some parts of Evangelicalism, particularly with the [[emerging church]] movement. Also controversial is the relationship between spiritualism and contemporary military metaphors and practices animating many branches of Christianity but especially relevant in the sphere of Evangelicalism. [[Spiritual warfare]] is the latest iteration in a long-standing partnership between religious organization and [[militarization]], two spheres that are rarely considered together, although aggressive forms of prayer have long been used to further the aims of expanding Evangelical influence. Major moments of increased political militarization have occurred concurrently with the growth of prominence of militaristic imagery in evangelical communities. For example, in 1951, [[Bill Bright]] found an institutional means to harness military values to evangelical outreach when he founded [[Cru (Christian organization)|Campus Crusade for Christ]], which continues today to instruct young people, or \"warriors\" in codes of moral discipline articulated in militaristic imagery, using terms such as to \"enlist, rally, advance and blitz\" to describe conversion tactics. This paradigmatic language, paired with an increasing reliance on sociological and academic research to bolster militarized sensibility, serves to illustrate the violent ethos that effectively underscores militarized forms of evangelical prayer.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McAlister |first=Elizabeth |date=2015 |title=The militarization of prayer in America: white and Native American spiritual warfare |journal=Journal of Religious and Political Practice |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013130 |doi=10.1080/20566093.2016.1085239}}</ref>\n\n==Global statistics==\n[[File:Iurd russia.jpg|thumb|[[Worship service (evangelicalism)|Worship service]] in a [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]] in Russia]]\nAccording to a 2011 [[Pew Forum]] study on global Christianity, 285,480,000 or 13.1 percent of all Christians are Evangelicals.<ref name=\"PewGlobalChristianity67\">{{Citation |title=Global Christianity: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population |date=December 19, 2011 |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-exec/ |publisher=[[Pew Forum]] on Religion and Public Life}}</ref>{{rp|17}} These figures do not include the Evangelical movements Pentecostalism and Charismatic movement.

To evangelicals, the central message of the gospel is [[justification by faith]] in Christ and [[repentance]], or turning away, from [[sin]]. Conversion differentiates the Christian from the non-Christian, and the change in life it leads to is marked by both a rejection of sin and a corresponding personal [[Sanctification|holiness]] of life. A conversion experience can be emotional, including grief and sorrow for sin followed by great relief at receiving forgiveness. The stress on conversion differentiates evangelicalism from other forms of Protestantism by the associated belief that an [[assurance (theology)|assurance]] will accompany conversion.<ref name=\"Yates2015\">{{cite book |last1=Yates |first1=Arthur S. |title=The Doctrine of Assurance: With Special Reference to John Wesley |date=2015 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=9781498205047 |language=English |quote=Writing to Arthur Bedford on 4th August 1738, Wesley says: 'That assurance of which alone I speak, I should not choose to call an assurance of salvation, but rather (with the Scriptures) the assurance of faith. . . .

The trouble is that evangelicals differ widely in how they interpret and emphasize 'fundamental' doctrines.

Some evangelicals have always viewed conversion as an incremental process rather than an instantaneous rebirth (and their numbers may be increasing).\"</ref>\n\nBiblicism is reverence for the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]] and high regard for [[biblical authority]]. All evangelicals believe in [[biblical inspiration]], though they disagree over how this inspiration should be defined. Many evangelicals believe in [[biblical inerrancy]], while other evangelicals believe in [[biblical infallibility]].{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=12\u201314}}\n\nCrucicentrism is the centrality that evangelicals give to the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]], the saving [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and the [[resurrection of Jesus]], that offers forgiveness of sins and new life. This is understood most commonly in terms of a [[substitutionary atonement]], in which Christ died as a substitute for sinful humanity by taking on himself the guilt and punishment for sin.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=15\u201316}}\n\nActivism describes the tendency toward active expression and sharing of the gospel in diverse ways that include preaching and social action.

He taught that in baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the \"ordinary means\" that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective. <br /> ''Baptism as Forgiveness of Sin''. In baptism God offers and we accept the forgiveness of our sin (Acts 2:38). With the pardoning of sin which has separated us from God, we are justified\u2014freed from the guilt and penalty of sin and restored to right relationship with God. This reconciliation is made possible through the atonement of Christ and made real in our lives by the work of the Holy Spirit. We respond by confessing and repenting of our sin, and affirming our faith that Jesus Christ has accomplished all that is necessary for our salvation. Faith is the necessary condition for justification; in baptism, that faith is professed. God's forgiveness makes possible the renewal of our spiritual lives and our becoming new beings in Christ. <br /> ''Baptism as New Life''. Baptism is the sacramental sign of new life through and in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Variously identified as regeneration, new birth, and being born again, this work of grace makes us into new spiritual creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). We die to our old nature which was dominated by sin and enter into the very life of Christ who transforms us. Baptism is the means of entry into new life in Christ (John 3:5; Titus 3:5), but new birth may not always coincide with the moment of the administration of water or the laying on of hands. Our awareness and acceptance of our redemption by Christ and new life in him may vary throughout our lives. But, in whatever way the reality of the new birth is experienced, it carries out the promises God made to us in our baptism.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Evangelical Alliance]] founded by the evangelical organizations of 21 countries, at the first general assembly in Woudschoten ([[Zeist]]) in the Netherlands in 1951 established a common [[confession of faith]] adhered to by its member denominations.<ref>Roger E.

Between 1950 and 2000 a mainstream evangelical consensus developed that sought to be more inclusive and more culturally relevant than fundamentalism while maintaining conservative Protestant teaching. According to [[Brian Stanley (historian)|Brian Stanley]], professor of [[world Christianity]], this new postwar consensus is termed ''neo-evangelicalism'', the ''new evangelicalism'', or simply ''evangelicalism'' in the United States, while in Great Britain and in other English-speaking countries, it is commonly termed ''[[conservative evangelicalism in the United Kingdom|conservative evangelicalism]]''. Over the years, less-conservative evangelicals have challenged this mainstream consensus to varying degrees. Such movements have been classified by a variety of labels, such as progressive, open, post-conservative, and post-evangelical.{{Sfn | Stanley | 2013 | pp=27\u201328}}\n\nSome commentators have complained that Evangelicalism as a movement is too broad and its definition too vague to be of any practical value. Theologian Donald Dayton has called for a \"moratorium\" on use of the term.{{Sfn|Dayton|1991|p=251}} Historian [[D. G.

Failing to reform the mainline churches, fundamentalists separated from them and established their own churches, refusing to participate in [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] organizations such as the [[National Council of Churches]] (founded in 1950). They also made [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separatism]] (rigid separation from non-fundamentalist churches and their [[culture]]) a true test of faith. According to historian [[George Marsden]], most fundamentalists are Baptists and [[dispensationalist]].{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\n===Mainstream varieties===\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer 1760.jpg|thumb|The Prayer Book of 1662 included the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] emphasized by [[evangelical Anglican]]s.]]\nMainstream evangelicalism is historically divided between two main orientations: [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] and [[revivalism]]. These two streams have been critical of each other. Confessional evangelicals have been suspicious of unguarded [[religious experience]], while revivalist evangelicals have been critical of overly intellectual teaching that (they suspect) stifles vibrant [[spirituality]].{{Sfn | Olson | 2011 | pp= 241\u2013242}} In an effort to broaden their appeal, many contemporary evangelical congregations intentionally avoid identifying with any single form of evangelicalism. These \"generic evangelicals\" are usually theologically and socially conservative, but their churches often present themselves as nondenominational (or, if a denominational member, strongly de-emphasizing its ties to such, such as a church name which excludes the denominational name) within the broader evangelical movement.{{Sfn | Reimer | 2003 | pp=29}}\n\nIn the words of [[Albert Mohler]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], confessional evangelicalism refers to \"that movement of Christian believers who seek a constant convictional continuity with the theological formulas of the Protestant Reformation\". While approving of the evangelical distinctions proposed by Bebbington, confessional evangelicals believe that authentic evangelicalism requires more concrete definition in order to protect the movement from theological liberalism and from [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. According to confessional evangelicals, subscription to the [[ecumenical creeds]] and to the Reformation-era confessions of faith (such as the [[Reformed confessions of faith|confessions of the Reformed churches]]) provides such protection.{{Sfn | Mohler | 2011 | pp=103\u2013104}} Confessional evangelicals are represented by conservative [[Presbyterian]] churches (emphasizing the [[Westminster Confession]]), certain Baptist churches that emphasize historic Baptist confessions such as the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Confession]], evangelical Anglicans who emphasize the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] (such as in the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]], Australia{{Sfn | Stanley | 2013 | pp= 58}}), [[Methodist]] churches that adhere to the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]], and some [[confessional Lutherans]] with pietistic convictions.{{Sfn | Ellingsen | 1991 | pp=222, 238}}<ref name=\"Coulter\">Dale M.

Progressive evangelicals, also known as the [[evangelical left]], share theological or social views with other [[Progressive Christianity|progressive Christians]] while also identifying with evangelicalism. Progressive evangelicals commonly advocate for women's equality, [[pacifism]] and [[social justice]].{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=75}}\n\nAs described by Baptist theologian [[Roger E. Olson]], post-conservative evangelicalism is a theological school of thought that adheres to the four marks of evangelicalism, while being less rigid and more inclusive of other Christians. According to Olson, post-conservatives believe that doctrinal truth is secondary to spiritual experience shaped by [[Scripture]]. Post-conservative evangelicals seek greater dialogue with other Christian traditions and support the development of a multicultural evangelical theology that incorporates the voices of women, racial minorities, and Christians in the developing world. Some post-conservative evangelicals also support [[open theism]] and the possibility of near [[universal salvation]].<ref name=\"OlsonCentury\">Roger E. Olson, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=85 \"Postconservative Evangelicals Greet the Postmodern Age\"] {{Webarchive| url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160101003723/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=85 |date= 2016-01-01 }}, ''The Christian Century'' (May 3, 1995), pp. 480\u2013483. Retrieved December 16, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe term \"Open Evangelical\" refers to a particular Christian school of thought or [[churchmanship]], primarily in Great Britain (especially in the [[Church of England]]). Open evangelicals describe their position as combining a traditional evangelical emphasis on the nature of scriptural authority, the teaching of the ecumenical creeds and other traditional doctrinal teachings, with an approach towards culture and other [[theology|theological]] points-of-view which tends to be more inclusive than that taken by other evangelicals. Some open evangelicals aim to take a middle position between conservative and charismatic evangelicals, while others would combine conservative theological emphases with more liberal social positions.{{Sfn | Randall | 2005 | p=52}}\n\nBritish author Dave Tomlinson coined the phrase ''post-evangelical'' to describe a movement comprising various trends of dissatisfaction among evangelicals. Others use the term with comparable intent, often to distinguish evangelicals in the so-called [[emerging church movement]] from post-evangelicals and anti-evangelicals. Tomlinson argues that \"linguistically, the distinction ''[between evangelical and post-evangelical]'' resembles the one that sociologists make between the [[modernism|modern]] and [[postmodernism|postmodern]] eras\".{{Sfn | Tomlinson | 2007 | p= 28}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nEvangelicalism did not take recognizable form until the 18th century, first in Britain and its North American colonies. Nevertheless, there were earlier developments within the larger Protestant world that preceded and influenced the later evangelical revivals. According to religion scholar, social activist, and politician [[Randall Balmer]], Evangelicalism resulted \"from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans\".{{Sfn | Balmer| 2002 |pp=vii\u2013viii}} Historian [[Mark Noll]] adds to this list [[High Church]] Anglicanism, which contributed to Evangelicalism a legacy of \"rigorous spirituality and innovative organization\".{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=50}}\n\nDuring the 17th century, Pietism emerged in Europe as a movement for the revival of [[piety]] and devotion within the Lutheran church. As a protest against \"cold orthodoxy\" or an overly formal and rational Christianity, Pietists advocated for an experiential religion that stressed high moral standards for both clergy and lay people. The movement included both Christians who remained in the [[liturgical]], [[state church]]es as well as [[Separatism#Religious separatism|separatist]] groups who rejected the use of baptismal fonts, altars, pulpits, and confessionals. As Pietism spread, the movement's ideals and aspirations influenced and were absorbed into early Evangelicalism.{{Sfn | Balmer | 2002 | pp=542\u2013543}}\n\nThe Presbyterian heritage not only gave Evangelicalism a commitment to Protestant orthodoxy but also contributed a revival tradition that stretched back to the 1620s in Scotland and Northern Ireland.{{Sfn | Longfield | 2013 | pp=7}} Central to this tradition was the [[communion season]], which normally occurred in the summer months. For Presbyterians, celebrations of [[Holy Communion]] were infrequent but popular events preceded by several Sundays of preparatory preaching and accompanied with preaching, singing, and prayers.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=44, 112}}\n\nPuritanism combined Calvinism with teaching that conversion was a prerequisite for church membership and a stress on the study of Scripture by lay people. It took root in New England, where the [[Congregational church]] was an established religion. The [[Half-Way Covenant]] of 1662 allowed parents who had not testified to a conversion experience to have their children baptized, while reserving Holy Communion for converted church members alone.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=54\u201355}} By the 18th century, Puritanism was in decline and many ministers were alarmed at the loss of religious piety. This concern over declining religious commitment led many people to support evangelical revival.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=46\u201347}}\n\nHigh Church Anglicanism also exerted influence on early Evangelicalism. High Churchmen were distinguished by their desire to adhere to [[primitive Christianity]]. This desire included imitating the faith and ascetic practices of early Christians as well as regularly partaking of Holy Communion. High Churchmen were also enthusiastic organizers of voluntary religious societies. Two of the most prominent were the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], which distributed Bibles and other literature and built schools, and the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]], which was created to facilitate missionary work in British colonies.

While religious revivals had occurred within Protestant churches in the past, the evangelical revivals that marked the 18th century were more intense and radical.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=76}} Evangelical revivalism imbued ordinary men and women with a confidence and enthusiasm for sharing the gospel and converting others outside of the control of established churches, a key discontinuity with the Protestantism of the previous era.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=74}}\n\nIt was developments in the doctrine of assurance that differentiated Evangelicalism from what went before. Bebbington says, \"The dynamism of the Evangelical movement was possible only because its adherents were assured in their faith.\"{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=42}} He goes on:\n\n{{Quote | Whereas the Puritans had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers, the Evangelicals believed it to be general, normally given at conversion and the result of simple acceptance of the gift of God. The consequence of the altered form of the doctrine was a metamorphosis in the nature of popular Protestantism. There was a change in patterns of piety, affecting devotional and practical life in all its departments. The shift, in fact, was responsible for creating in Evangelicalism a new movement and not merely a variation on themes heard since the Reformation.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}}}}\n\nThe first local revival occurred in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], under the leadership of Congregationalist minister [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. In the fall of 1734, Edwards preached a sermon series on \"Justification By Faith Alone\", and the community's response was extraordinary. Signs of religious commitment among the [[laity]] increased, especially among the town's young people. The revival ultimately spread to 25 communities in western Massachusetts and central Connecticut until it began to wane by the spring of 1735.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=76\u201378}} Edwards was heavily influenced by Pietism, so much so that one historian has stressed his \"American Pietism\".{{Sfn | Lovelace | 2007 | pp=}} One practice clearly copied from European Pietists was the use of small groups divided by age and gender, which met in private homes to conserve and promote the fruits of revival.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=77}}\n\nAt the same time, students at [[Yale University]] (at that time Yale College) in New Haven, Connecticut, were also experiencing revival. Among them was [[Aaron Burr, Sr.]], who would become a prominent Presbyterian minister and future president of [[Princeton University]]. In New Jersey, [[Gilbert Tennent]], another Presbyterian minister, was preaching the evangelical message and urging the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]] to stress the necessity of converted ministers.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe spring of 1735 also marked important events in England and Wales. [[Howell Harris]], a Welsh schoolteacher, had a conversion experience on May 25 during a communion service. He described receiving assurance of God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] after a period of [[fasting]], self-examination, and despair over his sins.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=79}} Sometime later, [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]], the Anglican [[curate]] of Llangeitho, Wales, experienced conversion as well. Both men began preaching the evangelical message to large audiences, becoming leaders of the [[Welsh Methodist revival]].{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=20}} At about the same time that Harris experienced conversion in Wales, [[George Whitefield]] was converted at Oxford University after his own prolonged spiritual crisis. Whitefield later remarked, \"About this time God was pleased to enlighten my soul, and bring me into the knowledge of His free grace, and the necessity of being justified in His sight by ''faith only''\".{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=79\u201380}}\n\n[[File:John Wesley preaching outside a church.

During this spiritual crisis, John Wesley was directly influenced by Pietism. Two years before his conversion, Wesley had traveled to the newly established colony of Georgia as a missionary for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He shared his voyage with a group of [[Moravian Brethren]] led by [[August Gottlieb Spangenberg]]. The Moravians' faith and piety deeply impressed Wesley, especially their belief that it was a normal part of Christian life to have an assurance of one's salvation.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=84}} Wesley recounted the following exchange with Spangenberg on February 7, 1736:\n\n{{Quote|[Spangenberg] said, \"My brother, I must first ask you one or two questions. Have you the witness within yourself? Does the Spirit of God bear witness with your spirit that you are a child of God?\" I was surprised, and knew not what to answer. He observed it, and asked, \"Do you know Jesus Christ?\" I paused, and said, \"I know he is the Savior of the world.\" \"True,\" he replied, \"but do you know he has saved you?\" I answered, \"I hope he has died to save me.\" He only added, \"Do you know yourself?\" I said, \"I do.\" But I fear they were vain words.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=85}}}}\n\nWesley finally received the assurance he had been searching for at a meeting of a religious society in London. While listening to a reading from Martin Luther's preface to the [[Epistle to the Romans]], Wesley felt spiritually transformed:\n\n{{Quote|About a quarter before nine, while [the speaker] was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away ''my'' sins, even ''mine'', and saved ''me'' from the law of sin and death.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=97}}}}\n\nPietism continued to influence Wesley, who had translated 33 Pietist hymns from German to English. Numerous German Pietist hymns became part of the English Evangelical repertoire.{{Sfn | Shantz | 2013 | pp=279\u2013280}} By 1737, Whitefield had become a national celebrity in England where his preaching drew large crowds, especially in London where the [[Fetter Lane Society]] had become a center of evangelical activity.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=87, 95}} Whitfield joined forces with Edwards to \"fan the flame of revival\" in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in 1739\u201340. Soon the [[First Great Awakening]] stirred Protestants throughout America.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=20}}\n\nEvangelical preachers emphasized personal salvation and piety more than ritual and tradition.

Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality. It reached people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety and their self-awareness. To the evangelical imperatives of Reformation Protestantism, 18th century American Christians added emphases on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and forwarded the newly created Evangelicalism into the early republic.<ref>{{Citation |last=Stout |first=Harold 'Harry' |title=The Divine Dramatist: George Whitefield and the Rise of Modern Evangelicalism |year=1991}}.</ref>\n\nBy the 1790s, the [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical party]] in the Church of England remained a small minority but were not without influence. [[John Newton]] and [[Joseph Milner]] were influential evangelical clerics. Evangelical clergy networked together through societies such as the [[Eclectic Society (Christian)|Eclectic Society]] in London and the [[Elland Society]] in Yorkshire.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=36}} The Old [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]] denominations (the [[Baptists]], Congregationalists and [[Quakers]]) were falling under evangelical influence, with the Baptists most affected and Quakers the least. Evangelical ministers dissatisfied with both Anglicanism and Methodism often chose to work within these churches.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=38}} In the 1790s, all of these evangelical groups, including the Anglicans, were Calvinist in orientation.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=39}}   \n\nMethodism (the \"New Dissent\") was the most visible expression of evangelicalism by the end of the 18th century. The [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]] boasted around 70,000 members throughout the British Isles, in addition to the [[Calvinistic Methodists]] in Wales and the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], which was organized under George Whitefield's influence. The Wesleyan Methodists, however, were still nominally affiliated with the Church of England and would not completely separate until 1795, four years after Wesley's death. The Wesleyan Methodist Church's [[Arminianism]] distinguished it from the other evangelical groups.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=38\u201339}}  \n\nAt the same time, evangelicals were an important faction within the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]]. Influential ministers included [[John Erskine (theologian)|John Erskine]], [[Henry Wellwood Moncrieff]] and [[Stevenson Macgill]]. The church's [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]], however, was controlled by the [[Moderate Party (Scotland)|Moderate Party]], and evangelicals were involved in the [[First Secession|First]] and [[Second Secession]]s from the national church during the 18th century.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=37}}\n\n===19th century===\n\nThe start of the 19th century saw an increase in [[missionary]] work and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see [[Timeline of Christian missions]]). Both the Evangelical and [[high church]] movements sponsored missionaries.\n\nThe [[Second Great Awakening]] (which actually began in 1790) was primarily an American revivalist movement and resulted in substantial growth of the Methodist and Baptist churches. [[Charles Grandison Finney]] was an important preacher of this period.\n\n[[File:Wilberforce john rising.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[William Wilberforce]] was a politician, philanthropist and an evangelical Anglican, who led the British movement to [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolish the slave trade]].]]\n\nIn Britain in addition to stressing the traditional Wesleyan combination of \"Bible, cross, conversion, and activism\", the revivalist movement sought a universal appeal, hoping to include rich and poor, urban and rural, and men and women. Special efforts were made to attract children and to generate literature to spread the revivalist message.<ref>{{Citation |last=Bebbington |first=David W |title=The Evangelical Revival in Britain in the Nineteenth Century |date=Jan 2002 |work=Kyrkohistorisk Arsskrift |pages=63\u201370}}.</ref>\n\n\"Christian conscience\" was used by the British Evangelical movement to promote social activism.

Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and [[premillennialism]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Sweetnam |first=Mark S |title=Defining Dispensationalism: A Cultural Studies Perspective |journal=Journal of Religious History |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=191\u2013212 |year=2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2010.00862.x}}.</ref>\n\nNotable figures of the latter half of the 19th century include [[Charles Spurgeon]] in London and [[Dwight L.

One factor was the advent of the radio as a means of mass communication. When [Charles E.

The NAE was partly a reaction to the founding of the [[American Council of Christian Churches]] (ACCC) under the leadership of the fundamentalist [[Carl McIntire]]. The ACCC in turn had been founded to counter the influence of the [[Federal Council of Churches]] (later merged into the [[National Council of Churches]]), which fundamentalists saw as increasingly embracing modernism in its [[ecumenism]].{{sfn| Carpenter | 1997 | 141-150}} Those who established the NAE had come to view the name fundamentalist as \"an embarrassment instead of a badge of honor.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kantzer |first=Kenneth |date=September 16, 1996 |title=Standing on the Promises |magazine=Christianity Today |volume=40 |page=30 |number=10}}</ref>\n\nWith the founding of the NAE, American Protestantism was divided into three large groups&mdash;the fundamentalists, the modernists, and the new evangelicals, who sought to position themselves between the other two. In 1947 Harold Ockenga coined the term ''neo-evangelicalism'' to identify a movement distinct from fundamentalism. The neo-evangelicals had three broad characteristics that distinguished them from the conservative fundamentalism of the ACCC:\n\n{{ordered list | They encouraged engagement in social concerns; | They promoted high standards of academic scholarship; and | They rejected the ecclesiastical separatism promoted by McIntire,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.amcouncilcc.org/constitution.asp |title=Constitution of the American Council of Christian Churches |last=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=American Council of Christian Churches |access-date=2011-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722180937/http://www.amcouncilcc.org/constitution.asp |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> often pursuing collaboration with others through parachurch organizations{{sfn|  Carpenter | 1997 | 240}}}}\n\nEach of these characteristics took concrete shape by the mid-1950s. In 1947 [[Carl F. H. Henry]]'s book ''The Uneasy Conscience of Fundamentalism'' called on evangelicals to engage in addressing social concerns:\n\n{{Quote | text=[I]t remains true that the evangelical, in the very proportion that the culture in which he lives is not actually Christian, must unite with non-evangelicals for social betterment if it is to be achieved at all, simply because the evangelical forces do not predominate.

Graham had begun his career with the support of McIntire and fellow conservatives [[Bob Jones Sr.]] and [[John R. Rice]]. However, in broadening the reach of his London crusade of 1954, he accepted the support of denominations that those men disapproved of. When he went even further in his 1957 New York crusade, conservatives strongly condemned him and withdrew their support.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Martin |first=William |title=A Prophet with Honor: The Billy Graham Story |date=1991 |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |pages=218\u2013224}}</ref>{{sfn | Marsden | 1987 | 159-160}} According to William Martin:\n\n{{Quote | text=The New York crusade did not cause the division between the old Fundamentalists and the New Evangelicals; that had been signaled by the nearly simultaneous founding of the NAE and McIntire\u2019s American Council of Christian Churches 15 years earlier.

In a letter to Harold Lindsell, Graham said that ''CT'' would:\n\n{{Quote | text=plant the evangelical flag in the middle of the road, taking a conservative theological position but a definite liberal approach to social problems.

New charismatic groups such as the [[Association of Vineyard Churches]] and [[Newfrontiers]] trace their roots to this period (see also [[British New Church Movement]]).\n\nThe closing years of the 20th century saw controversial [[postmodern]] influences entering some parts of Evangelicalism, particularly with the [[emerging church]] movement. Also controversial is the relationship between spiritualism and contemporary military metaphors and practices animating many branches of Christianity but especially relevant in the sphere of Evangelicalism. [[Spiritual warfare]] is the latest iteration in a long-standing partnership between religious organization and [[militarization]], two spheres that are rarely considered together, although aggressive forms of prayer have long been used to further the aims of expanding Evangelical influence. Major moments of increased political militarization have occurred concurrently with the growth of prominence of militaristic imagery in evangelical communities. For example, in 1951, [[Bill Bright]] found an institutional means to harness military values to evangelical outreach when he founded [[Cru (Christian organization)|Campus Crusade for Christ]], which continues today to instruct young people, or \"warriors\" in codes of moral discipline articulated in militaristic imagery, using terms such as to \"enlist, rally, advance and blitz\" to describe conversion tactics. This paradigmatic language, paired with an increasing reliance on sociological and academic research to bolster militarized sensibility, serves to illustrate the violent ethos that effectively underscores militarized forms of evangelical prayer.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McAlister |first=Elizabeth |date=2015 |title=The militarization of prayer in America: white and Native American spiritual warfare |journal=Journal of Religious and Political Practice |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013130 |doi=10.1080/20566093.2016.1085239}}</ref>\n\n==Global statistics==\n[[File:Iurd russia.jpg|thumb|[[Worship service (evangelicalism)|Worship service]] in a [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]] in Russia]]\nAccording to a 2011 [[Pew Forum]] study on global Christianity, 285,480,000 or 13.1 percent of all Christians are Evangelicals.<ref name=\"PewGlobalChristianity67\">{{Citation |title=Global Christianity: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population |date=December 19, 2011 |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-exec/ |publisher=[[Pew Forum]] on Religion and Public Life}}</ref>{{rp|17}} These figures do not include the Evangelical movements Pentecostalism and Charismatic movement.
