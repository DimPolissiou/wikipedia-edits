Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week.

The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down. Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man.

Shortly after they met, Icke left home following one of a number of frequent arguments he had started having with his father.

Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the middle of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 93\u201395, 99\u2013100.</ref> He also published his first book that year, ''It's a Tough Game, Son!'', about how to break into football.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 98.</ref>\n\nIcke and his family moved in 1982 to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 109.</ref> His relationship with ''Grandstand'' was short-lived\u2014he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him\u2014but he continued working for [[BBC Sport]] until 1990, often on [[bowls]] and [[snooker]] programmes, and at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 104.</ref> Icke was by then a household name, but has said that a career in television began to lose its appeal to him; he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious.<ref>Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 7.</ref> \n\nIn August 1990 his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (also known as the \"poll tax\"), a local tax [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government introduced that year.

One of the most widely distributed ''[[Banksia]]'' species, it occurs between [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Central Queensland]] in a broad range of [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], from coastal [[dune]]s to [[mountain]]s. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82&nbsp;ft) in height. Its [[leaf|leaves]] have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.\n\nIt is one of the four original ''Banksia'' species collected by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] in 1770, and one of four species published in 1782 as part of [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]]'s original description of the genus. It has had a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, with numerous species and varieties ascribed to it, only to be rejected or promoted to separate species. The taxonomy is now largely settled, with three [[subspecies]] recognised: [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia|''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' subsp. ''integrifolia'']], [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar|''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' subsp. ''compar'']] and [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola|''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' subsp. ''monticola'']].\n\nA hardy and versatile [[garden]] plant, ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' is widely planted in Australian gardens. It is a popular choice for parks and streetscapes, and has been used for bush [[revegetation]] and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a [[rootstock]] in the [[floriculture|cut flower trade]], but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a [[weed]] outside its natural habitat.\n\n== Names ==\nNow widely known as '''coast banksia''' or '''coastal banksia''', ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' was previously known by a range of common names.

One of the most widely distributed ''[[Banksia]]'' species, it occurs between [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Central Queensland]] in a broad range of [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], from coastal [[dune]]s to [[mountain]]s. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82&nbsp;ft) in height. Its [[leaf|leaves]] have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.\n\nIt is one of the four original ''Banksia'' species collected by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] in 1770, and one of four species published in 1782 as part of [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]]'s original description of the genus. It has had a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, with numerous species and varieties ascribed to it, only to be rejected or promoted to separate species. The taxonomy is now largely settled, with three [[subspecies]] recognised: [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia|''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' subsp. ''integrifolia'']], [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar|''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' subsp. ''compar'']] and [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola|''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' subsp. ''monticola'']].\n\nA hardy and versatile [[garden]] plant, ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' is widely planted in Australian gardens. It is a popular choice for parks and streetscapes, and has been used for bush [[revegetation]] and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a [[rootstock]] in the [[floriculture|cut flower trade]], but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a [[weed]] outside its natural habitat.\n\n== Names ==\nNow widely known as '''coast banksia''' or '''coastal banksia''', ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' was previously known by a range of common names. The ''Checklist of Australian Trees'' lists four other common names: '''honeysuckle''', '''white banksia''', '''white bottlebrush''' and '''white honeysuckle''';<ref name=\"APNI\" /> and some older sources refer to it as '''honeysuckle oak'''.<ref name=\"Millett 1971\">{{cite book | author = Millett, Mervyn | year = 1971 | title = Native Trees of Australia | location = Melbourne | publisher = Lansdowne | isbn = 0-7018-0394-0}}</ref><ref name=\"APCND\">{{cite web | title = Australian plant common name database | publisher = [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/common.names/index.html | accessdate = 2006-11-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061207012033/http://www.anbg.gov.au/common.names/index.html| archivedate= 7 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIt was known to [[Indigenous Australians]] before its discovery and naming by [[Europe]]ans; for example, the [[Gunai people|Gunai]] people of [[Gippsland]] called it '''birrna'''.<ref name=\"Museum Victoria\">{{cite web | author = Museum Victoria | author-link = Museum Victoria | title = Aboriginal Plant Use | url = http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/infosheets/10319.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-10-25|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821090942/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/infosheets/10319.pdf |archivedate = 21 August 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of its wide range it would have a name in a number of other [[Australian Aboriginal languages|indigenous languages]], but these are now lost.

It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80&nbsp;ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110&nbsp;ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching to no more than about 5 metres (15&nbsp;ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small [[shrub]].<ref name=\"George 1999\">{{cite encyclopedia | author = George, Alex S. | authorlink = Alex George  | year = 1999 | title = Banksia | editor = Wilson, Annette | encyclopedia = [[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]] | volume = Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra | pages = 175\u2013251 | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / [[Australian Biological Resources Study]]| isbn = 978-0-643-06454-6}}</ref>\n\nIt usually has a single stout trunk, which is often twisted and gnarled, with the rough grey bark characteristic of ''Banksia''. The leaves are dark green with a white underside, and occur in [[Whorl (botany)|whorls]] of three to five. Adult leaves have entire margins; George specifies their dimensions as 4 to 20 centimetres (2\u20138&nbsp;in) long and 6 to 35 millimetres (0.2\u20131.4&nbsp;in) wide,<ref name=\"George 1999\"/><ref name=\"George 1981\">{{The genus Banksia L.f.

This is roughly cylindrical, 10 to 12 centimetres (4\u20135&nbsp;in) high and five centimetres (2&nbsp;in) wide. Flowers are usually pale yellow to yellow, but may be greenish or pinkish in bud. Each individual flower consists of a tubular [[perianth]] made up of four united [[tepal]]s, and one long wiry [[carpel|style]]. Characteristic of the taxonomic section in which it is placed, the styles are straight rather than hooked. The style ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at [[anthesis]].<ref name=\"George 1999\"/> This process starts with the flowers at the bottom of the inflorescence, sweeping up the spike at an unusually high rate of between 96 and 390 flowers per 24 hours.<ref name=\"McFarland 1985\">{{cite journal | author = McFarland, David C. | year = 1985 | title = Flowering Biology and Phenology of Banksia integrifolia and B.&nbsp;spinulosa (Proteaceae) in New England National Park, N.S.W | journal = [[Australian Journal of Botany]] | volume = 33 | pages = 705\u2013714 | doi = 10.1071/BT9850705 | issue = 6}}</ref>\n\nThe flower spikes are not as prominent as in some other ''Banksia'' species, as they arise from two- to three-year-old nodes nested within the foliage.

Originally operating as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]], it filled a void in the market after [[WFTX-TV]] (channel 36) joined [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] four years earlier in October 1986. The station first operated from studios located on Goodlette Road in Naples. The station was beset with problems early on, particularly with regard to finding programming. Despite this, from [[1993 Florida Marlins season|1993]] to [[1998 Florida Marlins season|1998]], the station carried [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] baseball games televised by [[WBFS-TV]] in [[Miami]] before the debut of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], which then claimed southwest Florida as the team's territory. It also was the area's affiliate for the [[Orlando Magic]] broadcast network.\n\nWNPL-TV filed for bankruptcy in 1993 after several lawsuits from creditors, including the [[Associated Press]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709389/tv_station_is_sued_again/|accessdate=February 7, 2020|title=TV station is sued again|work=News-Press|first=Denes|last=Husty|page=2E|date=May 20, 1993}}</ref> as well as two investors who claimed that Darling made misrepresentations to them when they were told they would be part of a general partnership to operate the station.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709427/two_investors_accuse_station_owner_of/|accessdate=February 7, 2020|work=News-Press|first=Denes|last=Husty|title=Two investors accuse station owner of fraud|date=June 12, 1993|page=1E}}</ref> The station was finally sold two years later to Second Generation, a [[Cleveland]]-based group, in a $4 million transaction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709637/ohio_firm_buys_naples_tv_station/|accessdate=February 7, 2020|title=Ohio firm buys Naples TV station|date=April 12, 1995|work=News-Press|first=Deborah|last=Austin|page=7A}}</ref> (Darling and his wife would be found guilty of bankruptcy fraud charges for filing fraudulent claims in connection with the WNPL sale in 1996.)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709376/lee_county/|title=Darling Verdict|date=November 17, 1996|page=2C|work=News-Press|accessdate=February 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\nUpon Second Generation's acquisition of WNPL, which had become a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) when that network launched on January 16, the call letters were changed to WTVK on June 30.

Indeed, on March 9, 2006, ACME indeed affiliated all but one of their stations with the CW upon launch on September 18, 2006; WNFM was left with [[MyNetworkTV]] and did not confirm their affiliation until August.\n\nOn May 15, 2006, ACME announced that it would sell WTVK to Sun Broadcasting.

Right from the start, it emerged at a strong second place behind WFTX's longer-established and hour-long 10 p.m. newscast. On October 20, 2007, WINK-TV became the first station in [[Southwest Florida]] to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]; the newscasts on WXCW were included in the upgrade. On January 7, 2008, WINK began producing a two-hour extension of its weekday morning newscast for WXCW, running from 7 to 9 a.m. The program was moved to WXCW, after WINK complied with CBS' new requirement for all of its affiliates to air its morning news program ''[[The Early Show]]'' (which was replaced by the revived ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' in January 2012) in its entirety. Originally, WINK-TV had preempted the first hour of that program due to the third hour of its weekday morning newscast, which was specifically titled as ''Hello Southwest Florida''.\n\nBeginning on October 31, 2008, the 10 p.m. newscast began to be presented commercial-free for the first 21 minutes of the broadcast. The 10 p.m. newscast was expanded to one hour on August 24, 2009. In the fall of 2010, WINK began producing a weekday 11 a.m. newscast on WXCW, that program has since been canceled until 2019. On September 16, 2013, the WINK-produced weekday morning newscast on the station was expanded by one hour, now running from 7:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Channel 32 digital TV stations in the United States]]\n*[[Channel 46 virtual TV stations in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official|wxcw.com}}\n*[http://somosestrella.com/ WXCW-DT2]\n*[http://www.winknews.com/ WINK-TV website]\n*[http://titantvguide.titantv.com/apg/ttv.aspx?siteid=396 Program Information for WXCW at TitanTV.com]\n*{{TVQ|WXCW}}\n*{{BIA|WXCW|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Ft.

Locally owned by Sun Broadcasting, WXCW is [[sister station|sister]] to two [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-powered]] stations: [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVF-LD]] (channel 2) and [[Azteca Am\u00e9rica]] affiliate [[WANA-LD]] (channel 18), both also licensed to Naples. Fort Myers Broadcasting Company, which owns Fort Myers-licensed [[CBS]] affiliate [[WINK-TV]] (channel 11), operates WXCW, WUVF and WANA under a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA). The four stations share studios on Palm Beach Boulevard ([[Florida State Road 80|SR 80]]) in northeast Fort Myers; WXCW's transmitter is located north of [[Fort Myers Shores, Florida|Fort Myers Shores]], near the [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte]]\u2013[[Lee County, Florida|Lee]] county line.\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on October 22, 1990 as WNPL-TV, which was founded and run by CEO William Darling of Southwest Florida Telecommunications. Originally operating as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]], it filled a void in the market after [[WFTX-TV]] (channel 36) joined [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] four years earlier in October 1986. The station first operated from studios located on Goodlette Road in Naples. The station was beset with problems early on, particularly with regard to finding programming. Despite this, from [[1993 Florida Marlins season|1993]] to [[1998 Florida Marlins season|1998]], the station carried [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] baseball games televised by [[WBFS-TV]] in [[Miami]] before the debut of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], which then claimed southwest Florida as the team's territory. It also was the area's affiliate for the [[Orlando Magic]] broadcast network.\n\nWNPL-TV filed for bankruptcy in 1993 after several lawsuits from creditors, including the [[Associated Press]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709389/tv_station_is_sued_again/|accessdate=February 7, 2020|title=TV station is sued again|work=News-Press|first=Denes|last=Husty|page=2E|date=May 20, 1993}}</ref> as well as two investors who claimed that Darling made misrepresentations to them when they were told they would be part of a general partnership to operate the station.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709427/two_investors_accuse_station_owner_of/|accessdate=February 7, 2020|work=News-Press|first=Denes|last=Husty|title=Two investors accuse station owner of fraud|date=June 12, 1993|page=1E}}</ref> The station was finally sold two years later to Second Generation, a [[Cleveland]]-based group, in a $4 million transaction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709637/ohio_firm_buys_naples_tv_station/|accessdate=February 7, 2020|title=Ohio firm buys Naples TV station|date=April 12, 1995|work=News-Press|first=Deborah|last=Austin|page=7A}}</ref> (Darling and his wife would be found guilty of bankruptcy fraud charges for filing fraudulent claims in connection with the WNPL sale in 1996.)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709376/lee_county/|title=Darling Verdict|date=November 17, 1996|page=2C|work=News-Press|accessdate=February 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\nUpon Second Generation's acquisition of WNPL, which had become a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) when that network launched on January 16, the call letters were changed to WTVK on June 30. Second Generation also relocated the station's operations to the former [[WZVN-TV|WEVU]] studios in Bonita Bay, which offered more room and easier access to satellite feeds.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/37843115/new_wtvktv_takes_root_in_bonita_springs/|title=New WTVK-TV takes root in Bonita Springs|work=News-Press|date=July 13, 1995|accessdate=February 7, 2020|first=Andrea|last=Stetson|page=10A}}</ref> In 1998, Second Generation sold the station to [[ACME Communications]], which swapped affiliations with the area's cable-only [[The WB|WB]] affiliate WSWF (later [[WNFM-TV|WNFM]], it is now off the air). It then adopted the on-air moniker \"WB 6\", after its cable channel location in the market.\n\n[[File:Wxcw dt2.png|thumb|46.2 logo as MundoFox]]\n[[File:Mundomax wxcw logo.png|thumb|46.2 logo as MundoMax]]\nOn January 24, 2006, the merger of UPN and The WB into [[The CW]] was announced.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/ 'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September], [[CNNMoney.com]], January 24, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 2006.</ref> With ACME's CEO [[Jamie Kellner]] being a former WB executive, WTVK's future CW affiliation was virtually assured to be a mere formality. Indeed, on March 9, 2006, ACME indeed affiliated all but one of their stations with the CW upon launch on September 18, 2006; WNFM was left with [[MyNetworkTV]] and did not confirm their affiliation until August.\n\nOn May 15, 2006, ACME announced that it would sell WTVK to Sun Broadcasting. The sale was completed on February 16, 2007, with the station subsequently changing its [[call signs in North America|call sign]] to '''WXCW''' on March 2.\n\nWXCW has been digital-only since February 17, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is also available on [[Xfinity|Comcast]] [[digital cable]] channel 229 in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] and channel 437 in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. Once MundoMax ceased operations on December 1, 2016, the channel began to carry a 720p simulcast of Estrella TV.\n\n==Newscasts==\nWINK-TV presently produces 27\u00bd of locally produced newscasts each week for WXCW (with 4\u00bd hours each weekday, 3\u00bd hours on Saturdays and 1\u00bd hours on Sundays).\n\nAs an independent station, from October 1991<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709331/wnpl_now_has_news_at_10/|accessdate=February 7, 2020|title=New News|date=November 11, 1991|work=News-Press|first=Kevin|last=Lollar|page=1D}}</ref> to October 1992,<ref>{{cite news|work=News-Press|date=November 30, 1992|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43709362/wnpl_dropped_its_newscast/|accessdate=February 7, 2020}}</ref> WNPL operated a news department, producing a prime time newscast entitled ''Channel 46 Ten O'Clock News''.\n\nOn March 26, 2007, [[WINK-TV]] (channel 11) began producing a half-hour prime time newscast for WXCW under a news share agreement. Right from the start, it emerged at a strong second place behind WFTX's longer-established and hour-long 10 p.m. newscast. On October 20, 2007, WINK-TV became the first station in [[Southwest Florida]] to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]; the newscasts on WXCW were included in the upgrade. On January 7, 2008, WINK began producing a two-hour extension of its weekday morning newscast for WXCW, running from 7 to 9 a.m. The program was moved to WXCW, after WINK complied with CBS' new requirement for all of its affiliates to air its morning news program ''[[The Early Show]]'' (which was replaced by the revived ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' in January 2012) in its entirety. Originally, WINK-TV had preempted the first hour of that program due to the third hour of its weekday morning newscast, which was specifically titled as ''Hello Southwest Florida''.\n\nBeginning on October 31, 2008, the 10 p.m. newscast began to be presented commercial-free for the first 21 minutes of the broadcast. The 10 p.m. newscast was expanded to one hour on August 24, 2009. In the fall of 2010, WINK began producing a weekday 11 a.m. newscast on WXCW, that program has since been canceled until 2019. On September 16, 2013, the WINK-produced weekday morning newscast on the station was expanded by one hour, now running from 7:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Channel 45 digital TV stations in the United States]]\n*[[Channel 46 virtual TV stations in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official|wxcw.com}}\n*[http://somosestrella.com/ WXCW-DT2]\n*[http://www.winknews.com/ WINK-TV website]\n*[http://titantvguide.titantv.com/apg/ttv.aspx?siteid=396 Program Information for WXCW at TitanTV.com]\n*{{TVQ|WXCW}}\n*{{BIA|WXCW|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Ft.
