He is noted for his aerial battles during the [[North African Campaign]] and his [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] lifestyle. One of the most successful fighter pilots, he was nicknamed the \"[[Star of Africa]]\". Marseille claimed all but seven of his 158 victories against the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth's]] [[Desert Air Force]] over [[North Africa]], flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter for his entire combat career. No other pilot claimed as many [[Western Allies|Western Allied]] aircraft as Marseille.\n\nMarseille, of [[French people|French]] [[Huguenot]] ancestry, joined the Luftwaffe in 1938. At the age of 20 he graduated from one of the Luftwaffe's fighter pilot schools just in time to participate in the [[Battle of Britain]], without notable success. A charming person, he had such a busy night life that sometimes he was too tired to be allowed to fly the next morning. As a result of poor discipline, he was transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 27|''Jagdgeschwader'' 27]] (Fighter Wing 27, JG 27), which relocated to North Africa in April 1941.\n  \t\t  \t\nUnder the guidance of his new commander, who recognised the latent potential in the young officer, Marseille quickly developed his abilities as a fighter pilot. He reached the zenith of his fighter pilot career on 1 September 1942, when during the course of three combat [[sortie]]s he claimed 17 enemy fighters shot down, earning him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds|''Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten'']] (Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds). Only 29&nbsp;days later, Marseille was killed in a flying accident, when he was forced to abandon his fighter due to engine failure. After he exited the smoke-filled cockpit, Marseille's chest struck the [[vertical stabilizer|vertical stabiliser]] of his aircraft. The blow either killed him instantly or incapacitated him so that he was unable to open his [[parachute]].\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life and career==\nHans-Joachim \"Jochen\"{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=172}} Walter Rudolf Siegfried Marseille was born to Charlotte ([[maiden name]]: Charlotte Marie Johanna Pauline Gertrud Riemer) and ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Siegfried Georg Martin Marseille, a family with paternal French ancestry, in [[Charlottenburg|Berlin-Charlottenburg]]  on 13 December 1919.{{refn|[[Birth certificate]] Nr. 696, [[Charlottenburg]], dated 15 December 1919, d.o.b. 13 December at 11:45&nbsp;pm. Berliner Strasse 164.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=90}}|group=Note}} As a child, he was physically weak, and he nearly died from a serious case of [[influenza]].{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=1}} His father was an [[German Army (German Empire)|Army]] officer during [[World War I]], and later left the armed forces to join the [[Berlin]] police force.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=89}} Hans-Joachim also had a younger sister, Ingeborg. While on sick leave in Athens at the end of December 1941, he was summoned to Berlin by a telegram from his mother. Upon arriving home, he learned his sister had been killed by a jealous lover while living in [[Vienna]]. Hans-Joachim reportedly never recovered emotionally from this blow.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=82}}\n\nWhen Marseille was still a young child his parents divorced and his mother subsequently married a police official named Reuter. Marseille initially assumed the name of his stepfather at school (a matter he had a difficult time accepting) but he reverted to his father's name of Marseille in adulthood. A lack of discipline gave him a reputation as a rebel, which plagued him early on in his Luftwaffe career.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=1\u20133}} Marseille also had a difficult relationship with his natural father, with whom he refused to visit in [[Hamburg]] for some time after the divorce. Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father, who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that initially hampered his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe. However, the rapprochement with his father did not last and he did not see him again.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=84\u201385}} Marseille attended a ''[[Volksschule]]'' in Berlin (1926\u20131930), and from the age of 10, the Prinz Heinrich [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg]] (1930\u20131938). Between April and September 1938, he served in the [[Reich Labour Service]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=99}} \n\nMarseille joined the [[Luftwaffe]] on 7 November 1938 as an officer candidate and received his basic training in [[Quedlinburg]] in the [[Harz]] region. On 1 March 1939 Marseille was transferred to the [[Luftkriegsschule 4]] (LKS 4\u2014air war school) near [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck]]. Among his classmates was [[Werner Schr\u00f6er]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=14}} \n\nMarseille completed his training at a [[Jagdfliegerschule|Fighter Pilot School]] in [[Vienna]] to which he was posted on 1 November 1939. One of his instructors' was the Austro-Hungarian World War I ace [[Julius Arigi]]. Marseille graduated with an outstanding evaluation on 18 July 1940 and was assigned to ''Erg\u00e4nzungsjagdgruppe'' Merseburg, stationed at the airport in [[Merseburg]]-West.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=46}} Marseille's unit was assigned to [[air defence]] duty over the [[Leuna|Leuna plant]] from the outbreak of war until the [[Battle of France|fall of France]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=114}} On 10 August 1940 he was assigned to the [[Lehrgeschwader 2|Instructional Squadron 2]], based in [[Calais]]-[[Marck, Pas-de-Calais|Marck]], to begin operations against Britain and again received an outstanding evaluation this time by commander [[Herbert Ihlefeld]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=126}}\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Battle of Britain===\nIn his first [[dogfight]] over England on 24 August 1940, Marseille engaged in a four-minute battle with a skilled opponent while flying [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] E-3 W.Nr. 3579.{{refn|Marseille's first combat victory is uncertain. Sources conflict over the aircraft type citing it as a [[Hawker Hurricane]] or [[Supermarine Spitfire]].|group=Note}} He defeated his opponent by pulling up into a tight [[chandelle]], to gain an altitude advantage before diving and firing. The British fighter was struck in the engine, pitched over and dove into the [[English Channel]]; this was Marseille's first victory. Marseille was then engaged from above by more Allied fighters. By pushing his aircraft into a steep dive, then pulling up metres above the water, Marseille escaped from the machine gun fire of his opponents: \"skipping away over the waves, I made a clean break. No one followed me and I returned to [[Leeuwarden]] [sic\u2014Marseille was based near Calais, not Leeuwarden].\" The act was not praised by his unit. Marseille was reprimanded when it emerged he had abandoned his wingman, and ''staffel'' to engage the opponent alone. In so doing, Marseille had violated a basic rule of air combat.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=15}} Reportedly, Marseille did not take any pleasure in this victory and found it difficult to accept the realities of aerial combat.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=83}}\n\nWhile returning from a bomber-escort mission on 23 September 1940 flying ''Werknummer'' (W.Nr.\u2014factory number) 5094, his engine failed {{convert|10|mi|0}} off [[Cap Gris Nez]] after combat damage sustained over [[Dover]]. [[Pilot Officer]] [[George Bennions]] from [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|41 Squadron]] may have shot Marseille down.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=227}} According to another source, W.Nr 5094 was destroyed in this engagement by [[Robert Stanford Tuck]], who had pursued a Bf&nbsp;109 to that location and whose pilot was rescued by a [[Heinkel]] [[Heinkel He 59|He 59]] naval aircraft. Marseille is the only German airman known to have been rescued by a He&nbsp;59 on that day and in that location.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=408}} Tuck's official claim was for a Bf&nbsp;109 destroyed off Cap Gris Nez at 09:45\u2014the only pilot to submit a claim in that location.{{sfn|Foreman|2003|p=244}} \n\nAlthough Marseille tried to radio his position, he bailed out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by the [[float plane]] based at [[Schellingwoude]]. Exhausted and suffering from [[Hypothermia|exposure]], he was sent to a field hospital. When he returned to duty, he received a stern rebuke from his commander, [[Herbert Ihlefeld]]. In engaging Bennions, or Tuck, Marseille had abandoned his leader ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. During his rebuke, his commander tore up Marseille's flight evaluations. Other pilots also voiced their dissatisfaction concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld eventually dismissed Marseille from LG 2.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=18\u201320}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-344-0741-30, Frankreich, notgelandete Me 109.jpg|thumb|right|Marseille claimed his 7th aerial victory on 28 September 1940 but had to crash land near [[Th\u00e9ville]] due to engine failure. Bf 109 E-7; ''W.Nr. 4091''{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=26}}]]\n\nA different account recalled how Marseille once ignored an order to turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, and Marseille received three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole ''F\u00e4hnrich'' in the ''Geschwader''. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=17}}\n\nShortly afterwards, in early October 1940, after having claimed seven aerial victories all of them while flying with ''I.(Jagd)/LG 2'' Marseille was transferred to ''4./[[Jagdgeschwader 52]]'',{{refn|For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II|Luftwaffe organisation]].|group=Note}} flying alongside the likes of [[Johannes Steinhoff]] and [[Gerhard Barkhorn]]. He wrote off four aircraft as a result of operations during this period.{{refn|One Bf 109E, ''Werknummer'' 3579, which it is claimed he crash-landed, has been recovered, restored, and painted in the colours of \"White 14\", an aircraft with which he was associated.|group=Note|name=\"White 14\"}}{{sfn|Scutts|1994|p=28}} Steinhoff,  later recalled:\n<blockquote>  \"Marseille was extremely handsome. He was a very gifted pilot, but he was unreliable. He had girl friends everywhere, and they kept him so busy that he was sometimes so worn out that he had to be grounded. His sometime irresponsible way of conducting his duties was the main reason I fired him. But he had irresistible charm.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=94}}</blockquote>\nAs punishment for \"[[insubordination]]\"\u2014rumoured to be his penchant for American [[jazz]] music, womanising and an overt \"playboy\" lifestyle\u2014and inability to fly as a wingman, Steinhoff transferred Marseille to ''[[Jagdgeschwader 27]]'' on 24 December 1940.  His new ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'', [[Eduard Neumann]], later recalled, \"His hair was too long and he brought with him a list of disciplinary punishments as long as your arm. He was tempestuous, temperamental and unruly. Thirty years later, he would have been called a playboy.\"{{sfn|Lucas|1983|p=151}} Nevertheless,  Neumann quickly recognised Marseille's potential as a pilot. He stated in an interview: \"Marseille could only be one of two, either a disciplinary problem or a great fighter pilot.\"{{sfn|Sims|1982|p=159}} ''Jagdgeschwader'' 27 was soon relocated to North Africa.\n\n===Arrival in North Africa===\nMarseille's unit briefly saw action during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], deployed to [[Zagreb]] on 10 April 1941, before transferring to Africa. On 20 April on his flight from [[Tripoli]] to his front airstrip Marseille's Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-7 (''Werknummer'' 1259) developed engine trouble and he had to make a forced landing in the desert short of his destination.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|p=374}} His squadron departed the scene after they had ensured that he had got down safely. Marseille continued his journey, first hitchhiking on an Italian truck, then, finding this too slow; he tried his luck at an airstrip in vain. Finally he made his way to the General in charge of a supply depot on the main route to the front, and convinced him that he should be available for operations next day. Marseille's character appealed to the General and he put at his disposal his own [[Opel Admiral]], complete with [[chauffeur]]. \"You can pay me back by getting fifty victories, Marseille!\" were his parting words. He caught up with his squadron on 21 April.{{sfn|Bekker|1994|p=246}}\n\nMarseille scored two more victories on 23 and 28 April, his first in the [[North African Campaign]]. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by [[Second Lieutenant|''Sous-Lieutenant'']] James Denis, a [[Free French]] pilot with [[No. 73 Squadron RAF]] (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-7 (''Werknummer'' 5160) received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was leaning forward the rounds missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter near Tobruk{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|p=374}}. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=99}} His  Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-7 (''Werknummer'' 1567) came down in the vicinity of Tobruk behind German lines.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|p=374}} In a postwar account, Denis wrote that he waited for Marseille \nto close on him while he feigned ignorance, then skidded [side slipped] forcing the faster German to over shoot. Marseille was lucky. Bullets passed in front of his face and behind his head. 30 hits were counted after Marseille crash landed.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012a|p=170}}\n\nIn between the battles with Denis, Marseille downed a [[Bristol Blenheim]] on 28 April. Blenheim ''T2429'', from [[No. 45 Squadron RAF]], piloted by Pilot Officer B. C. de G. Allan, crashed killing all five men aboard.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012a|p=175}} Jan Yindrich, a [[Polish Army]] soldier, witnessed the attack: \"when a Blenheim came roaring down over our heads at about 50 feet, there was a terrific rattle of machine gun fire and at first I thought the Blenheim had made a mistake and was firing at us or choosing an awkward spot to clear his guns. Bullets whistled around, so we dived into the [[slit trench]]. A Messerschmitt, hot on the tail of the Blenheim, was responsible for the bullets. The Blenheim roared down the wadi, out to sea, trying to escape from the Messerschmitt, but the Messerschmitt was too close. The Blenheim fell out of the sky and crashed into the sea. The plane disappeared completely not leaving a trace. The Messerschmitt banked and flew inland again.\"{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=37}}\n\nNeumann (''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' as of 10 June 1942) encouraged Marseille to self-train to improve his abilities. By this time, he had crashed or damaged another four {{nowrap|Bf 109E}} aircraft, including an aircraft he was ferrying on 23 April 1941.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=136}} Marseille's kill rate was low, and he went from June to August without a victory. He was further frustrated after damage forced him to land on two occasions: once on 14 June 1941 and again after he was hit by ground fire over [[Tobruk]] and was forced to land blind.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=46\u201347}} His tactic of diving into opposing formations often found him under fire from all directions, resulting in his aircraft frequently being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Neumann grew impatient with him. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not only in outstanding [[situational awareness]], marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle [[deflection (military)|deflection shooting]] attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics on the way back from missions with his comrades and became known as a master of deflection shooting.{{sfn|Spick|1996|pp=120\u2013124}}{{sfn|Zabecki|2014|p=830}}\n\nAs Marseille began to claim Allied aircraft regularly, on occasion he organised the welfare of the downed pilot personally, driving out to remote crash sites to rescue downed Allied airmen. On 13 September 1941 Marseille shot down Pat Byers of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[No. 451 Squadron RAAF|No. 451 Squadron]]. Marseille flew to Byers' airfield and dropped a note informing the Australians of his condition and treatment. He returned several days later to second the first note with news of Byers' death. Marseille repeated these sorties after being warned by Neumann that G\u00f6ring had forbade any more flights of this kind.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=6\u20137, 89}} After the war, Marseille's JG 27 comrade [[Werner Schr\u00f6er]] stated that Marseille attempted these gestures as \"penance\" for a group that \"loved shooting down aircraft\" but not killing a man; \"we tried to separate the two. Marseille allowed us that escape, our penance I suppose.\"{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=90}}{{refn|Marseille's trip to the airfield was witnessed by Byers' squadron-mate Geoffrey Morely-Mower, later an English professor at [[Madison University]]. Morley said \"his greatest deeds, only revealed by the patient work of scholars and the accident of my own involvement as an eye-witness, were almost private and purely compassionate.\" Morely died in 2005.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=109\u2013110}}|group=Note}}\n\nFinally on 24 September 1941, his practice came to fruition, with his first multiple victory sortie, claiming four Hurricanes of [[1 Squadron SAAF|No. 1 Squadron]], [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF). By mid December, he had reached 25 victories{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=22}} and was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold. His ''Staffel'' was rotated to Germany in November/December 1941 to convert to the Bf 109F-4/trop, the variant that was described as the ''Experten'' (experts) \"mount.\" These victories represented his 19\u201323rd victory.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=192}} Marseille became known amongst his peers for accounting for multiple enemy aircraft in a sortie.{{sfn|Zabecki|2014|p=830}}\n\n===The \"Star of Africa\"===\n{{Quote box\n|quote=\"Marseille was the unrivalled virtuoso among the fighter pilots of World War 2. His achievements had previously been regarded as impossible and they were never excelled by anyone after his death.\"{{sfn|Galland|1954|p=115}}\n|source=[[Adolf Galland]], ''General der Jagdflieger''\n|width=32%\n|align=left\n}}\nMarseille always strove to improve his abilities. He worked to strengthen his legs and abdominal muscles, to help him tolerate the extreme [[g force]]s of air combat. Marseille also drank an abnormal amount of milk and shunned sunglasses, in the belief that doing so would improve his eyesight.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=172}}\n\nTo counter German fighter attacks, the Allied pilots flew \"[[Lufbery circle]]s\" (in which each aircraft's tail was covered by the friendly aircraft behind). The tactic was effective and dangerous as a pilot attacking this formation could find himself constantly in the sights of the opposing pilots. Marseille often dived at high speed into the middle of these defensive formations from either above or below, executing a tight turn and firing a two-second deflection shot to destroy an enemy aircraft. Marseille's successes had begun to become readily apparent by early 1942. He claimed his 37\u201340th victories on 8 February 1942 and 41\u201344th victories four days later which earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] that same month for 46 victories.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=28, 48, 51, 193}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-440-1313-37, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 109, Waffenreinigen.jpg|thumb|left|Marseille's service men, Hoffmann (left) and Berger, cleaning the bore of one of the cannons of a Bf 109. \"Yellow 14\" ''W.Nr. 8673'' can be seen in the background.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=185}}]]\nMarseille attacked under conditions many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship allowed him to make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight made it possible for him to spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=123}} He was credited with outstanding [[situational awareness]].{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=14}}\n\nIn combat, Marseille's unorthodox methods led him to operate in a small leader/[[wingman]] unit, which he believed to be the safest and most effective way of fighting in the high-visibility conditions of the North African skies. Marseille \"worked\" alone in combat keeping his wingman at a safe distance so he would not collide or fire on him in error.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=172}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-440-1313-03, H.

Clade said of Marseille's tactics:\n<blockquote>Marseille developed his own special tactics, which differed significantly from the methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even took it to the point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\">''Hans-Joachim Marseille \u2013 The Star of Africa'' (Archive of War teleproduction). Egypt/Germany: AV-Medienproduktion, 1990. Note: Narrated by Brian Matthews.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Friedrich K\u00f6rner]] (36 victories) also recognised this as unique: \"Shooting in a curve (deflection shooting) is the most difficult thing a pilot can do. The enemy flies in a defensive circle, that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By pulling his aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, but if he does that, his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct.\"<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\"/> The attack was, however, carried out at close-range; Marseille dived from above, climbed underneath an opponent, fired as the enemy aircraft disappeared under his own, and then used the energy from the dive to climb and repeat the process.{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=138}} \n\nHis success as a fighter pilot also led to promotions and more responsibility as an officer. 1 May 1942 saw him receive an unusually early promotion to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' followed by appointment to ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' of ''3./JG 27'' on 8 June 1942, thus succeeding Oberleutnant [[Gerhard Homuth]] who took command of ''I./JG 27''.{{sfn|Sims|1982|p=171}}\n\nIn a conversation with his friend [[Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt]], Marseille commented on his style, and his idea of air-to-air combat:\n<blockquote>I often experience combat as it should be. I see myself in the middle of a British [sic] swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle \u2013 a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=55}}</blockquote>\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote=\"Telling Marseille that he was grounded was like telling a small child that it could not go out and play. He sometimes acted like one too.\"{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=117}}\n|source=[[Werner Schr\u00f6er]]\n|width=32%\n|align=right\n}}\nMarseille had a narrow escape on 13 May 1942, when his Bf 109 was damaged during a dogfight with 12 [[Curtiss Kittyhawk]]s (Mk I) from [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF]], southeast of [[Ain el Gazala|Gazala]] and over the [[Gulf of Bomba]] (\"Gazala Bay\"). With a wingman, Marseille bounced the Kittyhawks. After he downed one of the Australian pilots, Flying Officer Graham Pace in ''AL172'',{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=201}} Marseille's Bf 109 took hits in the oil tank and propeller, likely from [[Flying Officer]] [[Geoff Chinchen]], who reported damaging one of the Messerschmitts. Marseille nevertheless managed to shoot down another Kittyhawk (Sergeant Colin McDiarmid; ''AK855''), before nursing his overheating aircraft back to base. The repairs to Marseille's Bf 109 took two days.{{sfn|Brown|2000|p=109}} The aerial victories were recorded as numbers 57\u201358.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=193}}\n\nWeeks later, on 30 May, Marseille performed another mercy mission after witnessing his 65th victory\u2014Pilot Officer [http://www.raafdb.com/view_casualty.asp?id=9966 Graham George Buckland] of [[No. 250 Squadron RAF]]\u2014strike the tail plane of his fighter and fall to his death when the parachute did not open. After landing he drove out to the crash site. The P-40 had landed over Allied lines but they found the dead pilot within German territory. Marseille marked his grave, collected his papers and verified his identity, then flew to Buckland's airfield to deliver a letter of regret. Buckland died two days before his 21st birthday.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=106}}\n\nHis attack method to break up formations, which he perfected, resulted in a high proportion of victories, and in rapid, multiple victories per attack. On 3 June 1942, Marseille attacked alone a formation of 16 [[Curtiss P-40]] fighters and shot down six aircraft of No. 5 Squadron SAAF, five of them in six minutes, including three aces: Robin Pare (six victories), Cecil Golding (6.5 victories) and Andre Botha (five victories). This success inflated his score further, recording his 70\u201375th victories. Marseille was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 6 June 1942.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=194, 207}} His wingman Rainer P\u00f6ttgen, nicknamed ''Fliegendes Z\u00e4hlwerk'' (the \"Flying Counting Machine\"),{{sfn|Sims|1982|p=156}} said of this fight:\n<blockquote> All the enemy were shot down by Marseille in a turning dogfight. As soon as he shot, he needed only to glance at the enemy plane. His pattern [of gunfire] began at the front, the engine's nose, and consistently ended in the cockpit. How he was able to do this not even he could explain. With every dogfight he would throttle back as far as possible; this enabled him to fly tighter turns. His expenditure of ammunition in this air battle was 360 rounds (60 per aircraft shot down)</blockquote>\n\nSchr\u00f6er, did however, place Marseille's methods into context:\n<blockquote>He was the most amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw. He was also very lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us trying to catch up to him. He violated every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=28}}</blockquote>\n\nOn 17 June 1942, Marseille claimed his 100th aerial victory. He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=243}} Marseille then returned to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]]. On 6 August, he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fianc\u00e9e Hanne-Lies K\u00fcpper. On 13 August, he met [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Rome]] and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery, the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor|''Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare'']].{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=190}} While in [[Italy]] Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report, submitted by the ''[[Gestapo]]'' head in Rome, [[Herbert Kappler]]. He was finally located. According to rumours he had run off with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded to return to his unit. Unusually, nothing was ever said about the incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=135}}\n\nLeaving his fianc\u00e9e in Rome, Marseille returned to combat duties on 23 August. 1 September 1942 was Marseille's most successful day, claiming to destroy 17 Allied aircraft (nos. 105\u2013121), and September would see him claim 54 victories, his most productive month.{{sfn|Weal|2003|p=86}} The 17 aircraft claimed included eight in 10 minutes; as a result of this feat, he was presented with a [[Volkswagen K\u00fcbelwagen]] by a ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' squadron, on which his Italian comrades had painted \"Otto\" ([[Italian language]]: ''Otto'' = eight).{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=319}} This was the most aircraft from Western Allied air forces shot down by a single pilot in one day. Only one pilot, [[Emil Lang (fighter ace)|Emil \"Bully\" Lang]], on 4 November 1943, would better this score, against the Soviet Air Force on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Feist|1993|p=61}} The post-war analysis shows that the actual results of the day were probably eight to nine destroyed by Marseille with three or four more damaged.{{Sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012b|p=326}}\n\nOn 3 September 1942 Marseille claimed six victories (nos. 127\u2013132) but was hit by fire from the British-Canadian ace [[James Francis Edwards]].{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=165. [note 20]}} ''[[Der Adler]]'', a biweekly propaganda magazine published by the Luftwaffe, also reported his actions in volume 14 of 1942.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=186}} Marseille was made famous through propaganda that treated fighter pilots as superstars and continued to do so after his death.{{sfn|Cocks|2012|p=205}} He regularly signed postcards with his image. Aside from ''Der Adler'', his exploits were published in ''Die Berliner'', ''Illustrierte'', ''Zeitung'' and ''Die Wehrmacht''.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=186\u2013194}}\n\nThree days later Edwards likely killed [[G\u00fcnter Steinhausen]], a friend of Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend [[Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt]] was posted missing in action. These personal losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the last weeks of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent [[sleepwalking]] at night and other symptoms that could be construed as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Marseille never remembered these events.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=155\u2013158}}\nMarseille flew Bf 109 E-7 aircraft{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|pp=25, 26}}{{sfn|Prien|Rodeike|Stemmer|1998|p=540}} and Bf 109F-4/Z aircraft.{{sfn|Scutts|1994|p=90}}\n[[File:Bf109F-4 Gelbe14 Ma JG27 kl96.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-4/trop, W.Nr. 8673 \u2013 3./JG 27 \u2013 Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Marseille in September 1942|alt=A fighter aircraft, shown in profile, viewed from the left.]]\nMarseille continued scoring multiple victories throughout September, including seven on 15 September (nos. 145\u2013151). Between 16 and 25 September, Marseille failed to increase his score due to a fractured arm, sustained in a force landing soon after the 15 September mission. As a result, he had been forbidden to fly by Eduard Neumann. But the same day, Marseille borrowed the [[Macchi C.202]] '96\u201310' of the Italian ace ''Tenente'' Emanuele Annoni, from 96a ''Squadriglia'', 9\u00b0 ''Gruppo'', 4\u00b0 ''Stormo'', based at [[Fuka, Egypt|Fuka]], for a test flight. But the one-off flight ended in a wheels-up landing, when the German ace accidentally switched the engine off, as the throttle control in Italian aircraft was opposite to that of the German aircraft.{{sfn|Massimello|Apostolo|2000|p=35}} The event was photographed.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012b|p=352}} \n\nMarseille had nearly surpassed his friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt's score of 59 victories in just five weeks. However, the massive material superiority of the Allies meant the strain placed on the outnumbered German pilots was now severe. At this time, the strength of German fighter units was 112 (65 serviceable) aircraft against the British muster of some 800 machines.{{sfn|Weal|2003|p=82}}\nMarseille was becoming physically exhausted by the frenetic pace of combat. After his last combat on 26 September, Marseille was reportedly on the verge of collapse after a 15-minute battle with a formation of Spitfires, during which he scored his seventh victory of that day.{{sfn|Weal|2003|pp=32, 33}}\n\nOf particular note was Marseille's 158th claim. After landing in the afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, \"That was the toughest adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought it would be my last fight\". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=66}}\n\n===Death===\nThe two missions of 26 September 1942 had been flown in Bf 109 G-2/trop, in one of which Marseille had shot down seven Allied aircraft. The first six of these machines were to replace the ''Gruppe'''s Bf 109 Fs. All had been allocated to Marseille's 3 ''Staffel''. Marseille had previously ignored orders to use these new aircraft because of its high engine failure rate, but on the orders of [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Albert Kesselring]], Marseille reluctantly obeyed. One of these machines, WK-Nr. 14256 (Engine: [[Daimler-Benz DB 605]] A-1, W.Nr. 77 411), was to be the final aircraft Marseille flew.{{sfn|Weal|2003|p=8}}\n\nOver the next three days Marseille's ''Staffel'' was rested and taken off flying duties. On 28 September Marseille received a telephone call from ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]] asking to return with him to Berlin. Hitler was to make a speech at the [[Berlin Sportpalast]] on 30 September and Rommel and Marseille were to attend. Marseille rejected this offer, citing that he was needed at the front and had already taken three months' vacation that year. Marseille also said he wanted to take leave at Christmas, to marry his fianc\u00e9e Hanne-Lies K\u00fcpper.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p= 174}}\n\nOn 30 September 1942, ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Marseille was leading his ''Staffel'' on a ''Stuka'' escort mission covering the withdrawal of the group and relieving the outward escort, III./''[[Jagdgeschwader 53]]'' (JG 53), which had been deployed to support JG 27 in Africa. Marseille's flight was vectored onto Allied aircraft in the vicinity but the opponent withdrew and did not take up combat. Marseille vectored the heading and height of the formation to Neumann who directed III./JG 27 to engage. Marseille heard 8./JG 27 leader [[Werner Schr\u00f6er]] claim a Spitfire over the radio at 10:30.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=176\u2013177}} While returning to base, his new Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2/trop's cockpit began to fill with smoke; blinded, he was guided back to German lines by his wingmen, Jost Schlang and Lt Rainer P\u00f6ttgen. Upon reaching friendly lines, \"Yellow 14\" had lost power and was drifting lower and lower. P\u00f6ttgen called out after about 10 minutes that they had reached the White Mosque of [[Sidi Abdel Rahman]], and were thus within friendly lines. At this point, Marseille deemed his aircraft no longer flyable and decided to bail out, his last words to his comrades being \"I've got to get out now, I can't stand it any longer\".{{sfn|Tate|2008|p= 116}}{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=176\u2013178}}\n\nEduard Neumann was personally directing the mission from the command post:\n<blockquote>I was at the command post and listening to the radio communication between the pilots. I realised immediately something serious had happened; I knew they were still in flight and that they were trying to bring Marseille over the lines into our territory and that his aircraft was emitting a lot of smoke.<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\"/></blockquote>\n{{Location map\n |Egypt | label=Crash site\n |alt=\n |mark=<!--dot-->Green pog.svg\n |lat_deg=30|lat_min=53|lat_sec=26.80\n |lon_deg=28|lon_min=41|lon_sec=42.87\n |position=right\n |width=200\n |float=right\n |caption=Crash site\n}}\nHis ''Staffel'', which had been flying a tight formation around him, peeled away to give him the necessary room to manoeuvre. Marseille rolled his aircraft onto its back, the standard procedure for bail out, but due to the smoke and slight disorientation, he failed to notice that the aircraft had entered a steep dive at an angle of 70\u201380 degrees and was now travelling at a considerably faster speed (about {{convert|640|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}). He worked his way out of the cockpit only to be carried backwards by the slipstream. The left side of his chest struck the vertical stabiliser of his fighter, which either killed him instantly or rendered him unconscious to the point that he could not deploy his parachute. He fell almost vertically, hitting the desert floor {{Convert|7|km|mi}} south of [[Sidi Abdel Rahman]]. As it transpired, a gaping 40&nbsp;cm (16&nbsp;in) hole had been made in his parachute and the canopy  spilled out. After recovering the body, the parachute release handle was still on \"safe,\" suggesting Marseille had not  attempted to open it. Whilst the body was checked, a regimental doctor noted Marseille's wristwatch had stopped at exactly 11:42&nbsp;am. The doctor had been the first to reach the crash site, having been stationed just to the rear of the forward mine defences. He had also witnessed Marseille's fatal fall.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=116}} The autopsy report stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The pilot lay on his stomach as if asleep. His arms were hidden beneath his body. As I came closer, I saw a pool of blood that had issued from the side of his crushed skull; brain matter was exposed. I then noticed the awful wound above the hip. With certainty this could not have come from the fall. The pilot must have been slammed into the airplane when bailing out. I carefully turned the dead pilot over onto his back. opened the zipper of his flight jacket, saw the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Marseille never actually received the Diamonds personally) and I knew immediately who this was. The paybook also told me. I glanced at the dead man's watch. It had stopped at 11:42.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=117}}</blockquote>\n\n''[[Oberleutnant]]'' [[Ludwig Franzisket]] collected the body from the [[desert]]. Marseille lay in state in the ''Staffel'' sick bay, his comrades coming to pay their respects throughout the day. Marseille's funeral took place on 1 October 1942 at the Heroes Cemetery in [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] with Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] and [[Eduard Neumann]] delivering a eulogy.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=120}}\n\n[[File:MarseilleCrash.JPG|thumb|left|The wreckage of Marseille's aircraft on 30 September 1942; the vehicle in the background marks the spot where Marseille landed.]]\n\nAn enquiry into the crash was hastily set up. The commission's report concluded that the crash was caused by damage to the [[differential gear]], which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out.<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\"/> The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via [[Bari]], [[Italy]]. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=128}} Schland and P\u00f6ttgen's statements led Neuman concluded there was no fire and a glycol leak was responsible for the engine failure. He ruled out the existence of a fire, for he did not believe Marseille could have spoken for nine minutes without fatigue in smoke caused by a fire.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nJG 27 was moved out of Africa for about a month because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, [[G\u00fcnter Steinhausen]] and Marseille's friend [[Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt]], just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer suggests these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his ''staffel'' relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n[[File:Hans-Joachim Marseille Memorial 2.jpg|thumb|right|Marseille family grave in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]]]]\nHistorians Hans Ring and Christopher Shores also point to the fact that Marseille's promotions were based on personal success rates more than any other reason, and other pilots did not get to score air victories, let alone become ''Experten'' themselves. They flew support as the \"maestro showed them how it was done\", and often \"held back from attacking enemy aircraft to build his score still higher\".{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=30\u201331: Citing Shores and Ring.}} As a result there was no other ''Experten'' to step into Marseille's shoes if he was killed.\nEduard Neumann explained:\n<blockquote>\"This handicap [that very few pilots scored] was partially overcome by the morale effect on the whole Geschwader of the success of pilots like Marseille. In fact most of the pilots in Marseille's ''staffel'' acted in secondary role as escort to the 'master.'\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=31}}</blockquote>\n\nMarseille's impact on Allied fighter pilots and their morale is unclear. Andrew Thomas quoted [[Pilot Officer]] Bert Houle of [[No. 213 Squadron RAF]]; \"He was an extremely skilled pilot and a deadly shot. It was a helpless feeling to be continually bounced, and to do so little about it.\"{{sfn|Thomas|2003|p=56}} Robert Tate, on the other hand, is skeptical Allied pilots would have been familiar, asking, \"How well was Marseille known to [[Desert Air Force|DAF]] personnel in the Desert? Apparently not so well. Although there is a little indication that some Allied pilots may have heard of Marseille, this information did not readily make its way down to Allied Squadrons. Fanciful stories abound of how pilots knew of one another and hoped to duel with each other in the skies. This was more than likely not the case.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=100}}\n\n==In propaganda and popular culture==\nMarseille appeared four times in the ''[[Die Deutsche Wochenschau|Deutsche Wochenschau]]'', the German propaganda newsreel. The first time on Wednesday 17 February 1942 when [[Oberst]] Galland, the ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'', visited an airport in the desert. The second time on Wednesday 1 July 1942 when Marseille travelled to Rastenburg to receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords from Adolf Hitler. The third time on Wednesday 9 September 1942 announcing Marseille's 17 aerial victories from 1 September 1942 and that he had been awarded the Diamonds to his Knight's Cross. His last appearance was on 30 September 1942 showing Marseille visiting [[Erwin Rommel]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=51}}\n\nPrinting press used Marseille prolifically during 1942; from magazines to journals. ''[[Der Adler]]'' used his image for a front cover on 7 and 14 July 1942. Marseille's death did not prohibit his inclusion in the ''[[Die Wehrmacht]]'' on 21 and 28 October 1942. [[Signal\u00a0(magazine)|''Signal'']] used him as a cover in their September 1942. ''[[Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung]]'' used him for a cover on 4 July 1942.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=227\u2013233}}\n\nIn 1957, a German film, ''[[Der Stern von Afrika]]'' (''The Star of Africa'') directed by [[Alfred Weidenmann]], was made starring [[Joachim Hansen (actor)|Joachim Hansen]] as Hans-Joachim Marseille. The movie was a fictionalised account of Marseille's wartime service.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|pp=388\u2013389}}\n\n==National Socialism==\n===MGFA===\nThe German [[Military History Research Office (Germany)|Military History Research Office]] (MGFA) published a brief evaluation of Marseille in early 2013, stating that \"occasional attempts in the popular literature to suggest Marseille's unsoldierly bravado and honest character points to an ideological distance to National Socialism are misleading\".<!--- (''Der gelegentliche in der popul\u00e4ren Literatur unternommene Versuch, durch den Hinweis auf Marseilles unsoldatisches 'Draufg\u00e4ngertum' und seinen 'ehrlichen Charakter' eine ideologische Distanz zum Nationalsozialismus zu suggerieren, f\u00fchrt daher in die Irre) ---> MGFA concluded that, since there is no academic biography of Marseille, \"it is not known that Hans-Joachim Marseille has, through his overall actions or through a single outstanding deed, earned praise in the service for freedom and justice [as defined in the current guidelines for military tradition]\".<!---  (es nicht bekannt ist, dass sich Hans-Joachim Marseille durch sein gesamtes Wirken oder durch eine herausragende Tat um Freiheit und Recht [im Sinne der heute geltenden Traditionsrichtlinien] verdient gemacht hat)---><ref>[http://www.die-linke-pinneberg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/DIE_LINKE._/DIE_LINKE__Schleswig-Holstein_/KV_Pinneberg/MGFA_Marseille.pdf MGFA on Marseiile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126065246/http://www.die-linke-pinneberg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/DIE_LINKE._/DIE_LINKE__Schleswig-Holstein_/KV_Pinneberg/MGFA_Marseille.pdf |date=26 November 2016 }}, 2013, [[Military History Research Office (Germany)]]</ref>\n\nIn 2019, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_Birk Dr Eberhard Birk] and [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_M%C3%B6llers Heiner M\u00f6llers] published ''Die Luftwaffe und ihre Traditionen: Schriften zur Geschichte der Deutschen Luftwaffe''. In the chapter ''Ist das noch Tradition - oder muss das weg? Der Jagdflieger Hans-Joachim Marseille - Namensgeber der \"Marseille-Kaserne\" in Appen'' [Is this still tradition, or must it go? The fighter pilot Hans-Joachim Marseille, namesake of the Marseille-Kaserne] the historians discuss Marseille and his character. The chapter asserts that the stories told about Marseille are rooted in wartime [Nazi] propaganda. They doubt whether Marseille's reputation is sufficient to allow him to act as a role model in the [[Bundeswehr|modern German military]]. However, they assert, like [[Werner M\u00f6lders]], that Marseille was not a politicial soldier, but apolitical, despite the prevailing political situation in the [[Third Reich]].{{sfn|Birk|M\u00f6llers|2019|p=119}}\n\n===Biographies===\nSeveral biographies of Hans-Joachim Marseille have described his disdain for authority and for the [[National Socialist]] movement in general. Some biographers, such as Colin Heaton, describe him as \"openly anti-Nazi.\"{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=4}} When Marseille first met Hitler in 1942, he did not form a positive impression. After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, \"After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned and said that he thought 'the F\u00fchrer was a rather odd sort'.\" {{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=136}} On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and [[Nicolaus von Below]], overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within earshot of others, Marseille responded, \"that if he saw a party worth joining, he would consider it, but there would have to be plenty of attractive women in it.\" The remarks visibly upset Hitler, who was left \"puzzled\" by Marseille's behaviour.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=124}}\n\nAt the home of [[Willy Messerschmitt]], industrialist and designer of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter, Marseille played [[Jazz|American Jazz]] on Messerschmitt's piano in front of  Adolf Hitler, party chairman [[Martin Borman]], Hitler's deputy and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], head of the SS, [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Hitler purportedly left the room.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=126\u2013127}} [[Magda Goebbels]] found the prank amusing and [[Artur Axmann]] recalled how his \"blood froze\" when he heard this \"[[Ragtime]]\" music being played in front of the ''F\u00fchrer''.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nLater that month Marseille was invited to another party function, despite his earlier stunt. ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Karl Wolff]], of [[Personal Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]], confirmed that during his visit Marseille overheard a conversation which mentioned crimes against the [[Jews]] and other people. He stated:\n\n<blockquote>[[Odilo Globocnik|Globocnik]] and I were talking about [[Operation Reinhard]], which was in full effect following [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich's]] [[Operation Anthropoid|murder]], and also the construction of [[Sobibor]] and [[Treblinka]]. I know I asked him about [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|H\u00f6ss]], who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp ([[Auschwitz]]). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] that [[Lidice]] had been cleared, and all the Jews and [[Czechs]] had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=129}}</blockquote>\n\nWhen Marseille returned to his unit, he reportedly asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schr\u00f6er whether they had heard what was happening to Jews and if perhaps something was underway that they did not know about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his own neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, people changed the subject, or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nMarseille's friendship with his adopted helper also is used to show his anti-Nazi character. In 1942, Marseille befriended a South African Army prisoner of war, Corporal Mathew Letulu, nicknamed ''Mathias''. Marseille took him as a personal helper rather than allow him to be sent to a prisoner of war camp in Europe. Over time, Marseille and Mathias became inseparable. Marseille was concerned how Mathias would be treated by other units of the ''Wehrmacht'' and once remarked \"Where I go, Mathias goes.\"{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=4\u20139}} Marseille secured promises from his senior commander, Neumann, that if anything should happen to him [Marseille] Mathias was to be kept with the unit. Mathias duly remained with JG 27 until the end of the war and attended post-war reunions until his death in 1984.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=4\u20139, 149, 180}}\n\nBiographer Robert Tate went further in his examination. During his research, he contacted Professor Rafael Scheck, Head of History at [[Colby College]]. Scheck published ''Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940'' and is an acknowledged expert on racial theory and in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=90}} Without being familiar with Marseille, Scheck identified his friendship with [[Corporal]] Mathew P. Letuku was in direct contradiction to the Nazi mandate.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=91}} Letuku, alias Mathias to everyone in ''JG 27'', was a [[Black people|black]] South African soldier taken [[prisoner of war]] by German troops on the morning of 21 June 1941 at fortress Tobruk.

A USAF historian, Major Robert Tate states: \"[f]or years, many British historians and militarists refused to admit that they had lost any aircraft that day in North Africa. Careful review of records however do show that the British [and South Africans] did lose more than 17 aircraft that day, and in the area that Marseille operated.\"<ref>Tate, Major Robert (USAF). [http://www.warbirdsresourcegroup.org/LRG/hanstate.html \"Hans-Joachim Marseille\".]</ref> Tate also reveals 20 RAF single-engined fighters and one twin engined fighter were destroyed and several others severely damaged, as well as a further USAAF P-40 shot down.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=99}} However, overall Tate reveals that Marseille's kill total comes close to 65\u201370 percent corroboration, indicating as many as 50 of his claims may not have actually been kills. Tate also compares Marseilles rate of corroboration with the top six P-40 pilots. While only the Canadian [[James Francis Edwards]]' records shows a verification of 100 percent other aces like [[Clive Caldwell]] (50% to 60% corroboration), [[Billy Drake]] (70% to 80% corroboration), [[John Lloyd Waddy]] (70% to 80% corroboration) and Andrew Barr (60% to 70% corroboration) are at the same order of magnitude as Marseille's claims.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=124}} Christopher Shores and Hans Ring also support Tate's conclusions.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|1969|p=170}} British historian [[Stephen Bungay]] gives a figure of 20 Allied losses that day.{{sfn|Bungay|2002|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nHowever, the claims for 15 September 1942 are in serious doubt, following the first detailed scrutiny of the records of individual Allied squadrons by Australian historian [[Russell Brown (author)|Russell Brown]].

He is noted for his aerial battles during the [[North African Campaign]] and his [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] lifestyle. One of the most successful fighter pilots, he was nicknamed the \"[[Star of Africa]]\". Marseille claimed all but seven of his 158 victories against the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth's]] [[Desert Air Force]] over [[North Africa]], flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter for his entire combat career. No other pilot claimed as many [[Western Allies|Western Allied]] aircraft as Marseille.\n\nMarseille, of [[French people|French]] [[Huguenot]] ancestry, joined the Luftwaffe in 1938. At the age of 20 he graduated from one of the Luftwaffe's fighter pilot schools just in time to participate in the [[Battle of Britain]], without notable success. A charming person, he had such a busy night life that sometimes he was too tired to be allowed to fly the next morning. As a result of poor discipline, he was transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 27|''Jagdgeschwader'' 27]] (Fighter Wing 27, JG 27), which relocated to North Africa in April 1941.\n  \t\t  \t\nUnder the guidance of his new commander, who recognised the latent potential in the young officer, Marseille quickly developed his abilities as a fighter pilot. He reached the zenith of his fighter pilot career on 1 September 1942, when during the course of three combat [[sortie]]s he claimed 17 enemy fighters shot down, earning him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds|''Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten'']] (Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds). Only 29&nbsp;days later, Marseille was killed in a flying accident, when he was forced to abandon his fighter due to engine failure. After he exited the smoke-filled cockpit, Marseille's chest struck the [[vertical stabilizer|vertical stabiliser]] of his aircraft. The blow either killed him instantly or incapacitated him so that he was unable to open his [[parachute]].\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life and career==\nHans-Joachim \"Jochen\"{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=172}} Walter Rudolf Siegfried Marseille was born to Charlotte ([[maiden name]]: Charlotte Marie Johanna Pauline Gertrud Riemer) and ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Siegfried Georg Martin Marseille, a family with paternal French ancestry, in [[Charlottenburg|Berlin-Charlottenburg]]  on 13 December 1919.{{refn|[[Birth certificate]] Nr. 696, [[Charlottenburg]], dated 15 December 1919, d.o.b. 13 December at 11:45&nbsp;pm. Berliner Strasse 164.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=90}}|group=Note}} As a child, he was physically weak, and he nearly died from a serious case of [[influenza]].{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=1}} His father was an [[German Army (German Empire)|Army]] officer during [[World War I]], and later left the armed forces to join the [[Berlin]] police force.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=89}} Hans-Joachim also had a younger sister, Ingeborg. While on sick leave in Athens at the end of December 1941, he was summoned to Berlin by a telegram from his mother. Upon arriving home, he learned his sister had been killed by a jealous lover while living in [[Vienna]]. Hans-Joachim reportedly never recovered emotionally from this blow.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=82}}\n\nWhen Marseille was still a young child his parents divorced and his mother subsequently married a police official named Reuter. Marseille initially assumed the name of his stepfather at school (a matter he had a difficult time accepting) but he reverted to his father's name of Marseille in adulthood. A lack of discipline gave him a reputation as a rebel, which plagued him early on in his Luftwaffe career.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=1\u20133}} Marseille also had a difficult relationship with his natural father, with whom he refused to visit in [[Hamburg]] for some time after the divorce. Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father, who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that initially hampered his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe. However, the rapprochement with his father did not last and he did not see him again.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=84\u201385}} Marseille attended a ''[[Volksschule]]'' in Berlin (1926\u20131930), and from the age of 10, the Prinz Heinrich [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg]] (1930\u20131938). Between April and September 1938, he served in the [[Reich Labour Service]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=99}} \n\nMarseille joined the [[Luftwaffe]] on 7 November 1938 as an officer candidate and received his basic training in [[Quedlinburg]] in the [[Harz]] region. On 1 March 1939 Marseille was transferred to the [[Luftkriegsschule 4]] (LKS 4\u2014air war school) near [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck]]. Among his classmates was [[Werner Schr\u00f6er]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=14}} \n\nMarseille completed his training at a [[Jagdfliegerschule|Fighter Pilot School]] in [[Vienna]] to which he was posted on 1 November 1939. One of his instructors' was the Austro-Hungarian World War I ace [[Julius Arigi]]. Marseille graduated with an outstanding evaluation on 18 July 1940 and was assigned to ''Erg\u00e4nzungsjagdgruppe'' Merseburg, stationed at the airport in [[Merseburg]]-West.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=46}} Marseille's unit was assigned to [[air defence]] duty over the [[Leuna|Leuna plant]] from the outbreak of war until the [[Battle of France|fall of France]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=114}} On 10 August 1940 he was assigned to the [[Lehrgeschwader 2|Instructional Squadron 2]], based in [[Calais]]-[[Marck, Pas-de-Calais|Marck]], to begin operations against Britain and again received an outstanding evaluation this time by commander [[Herbert Ihlefeld]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=126}}\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Battle of Britain===\nIn his first [[dogfight]] over England on 24 August 1940, Marseille engaged in a four-minute battle with a skilled opponent while flying [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] E-3 W.Nr. 3579.{{refn|Marseille's first combat victory is uncertain. Sources conflict over the aircraft type citing it as a [[Hawker Hurricane]] or [[Supermarine Spitfire]].|group=Note}} He defeated his opponent by pulling up into a tight [[chandelle]], to gain an altitude advantage before diving and firing. The British fighter was struck in the engine, pitched over and dove into the [[English Channel]]; this was Marseille's first victory. Marseille was then engaged from above by more Allied fighters. By pushing his aircraft into a steep dive, then pulling up metres above the water, Marseille escaped from the machine gun fire of his opponents: \"skipping away over the waves, I made a clean break. No one followed me and I returned to [[Leeuwarden]] [sic\u2014Marseille was based near Calais, not Leeuwarden].\" The act was not praised by his unit. Marseille was reprimanded when it emerged he had abandoned his wingman, and ''staffel'' to engage the opponent alone. In so doing, Marseille had violated a basic rule of air combat.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=15}} Reportedly, Marseille did not take any pleasure in this victory and found it difficult to accept the realities of aerial combat.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=83}}\n\nWhile returning from a bomber-escort mission on 23 September 1940 flying ''Werknummer'' (W.Nr.\u2014factory number) 5094, his engine failed {{convert|10|mi|0}} off [[Cap Gris Nez]] after combat damage sustained over [[Dover]]. [[Pilot Officer]] [[George Bennions]] from [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|41 Squadron]] may have shot Marseille down.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=227}} According to another source, W.Nr 5094 was destroyed in this engagement by [[Robert Stanford Tuck]], who had pursued a Bf&nbsp;109 to that location and whose pilot was rescued by a [[Heinkel]] [[Heinkel He 59|He 59]] naval aircraft. Marseille is the only German airman known to have been rescued by a He&nbsp;59 on that day and in that location.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=408}} Tuck's official claim was for a Bf&nbsp;109 destroyed off Cap Gris Nez at 09:45\u2014the only pilot to submit a claim in that location.{{sfn|Foreman|2003|p=244}} \n\nAlthough Marseille tried to radio his position, he bailed out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by the [[float plane]] based at [[Schellingwoude]]. Exhausted and suffering from [[Hypothermia|exposure]], he was sent to a field hospital. When he returned to duty, he received a stern rebuke from his commander, [[Herbert Ihlefeld]]. In engaging Bennions, or Tuck, Marseille had abandoned his leader ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. During his rebuke, his commander tore up Marseille's flight evaluations. Other pilots also voiced their dissatisfaction concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld eventually dismissed Marseille from LG 2.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=18\u201320}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-344-0741-30, Frankreich, notgelandete Me 109.jpg|thumb|right|Marseille claimed his 7th aerial victory on 28 September 1940 but had to crash land near [[Th\u00e9ville]] due to engine failure. Bf 109 E-7; ''W.Nr. 4091''{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=26}}]]\n\nA different account recalled how Marseille once ignored an order to turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, and Marseille received three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole ''F\u00e4hnrich'' in the ''Geschwader''. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=17}}\n\nShortly afterwards, in early October 1940, after having claimed seven aerial victories all of them while flying with ''I.(Jagd)/LG 2'' Marseille was transferred to ''4./[[Jagdgeschwader 52]]'',{{refn|For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II|Luftwaffe organisation]].|group=Note}} flying alongside the likes of [[Johannes Steinhoff]] and [[Gerhard Barkhorn]]. He wrote off four aircraft as a result of operations during this period.{{refn|One Bf 109E, ''Werknummer'' 3579, which it is claimed he crash-landed, has been recovered, restored, and painted in the colours of \"White 14\", an aircraft with which he was associated.|group=Note|name=\"White 14\"}}{{sfn|Scutts|1994|p=28}} Steinhoff,  later recalled:\n<blockquote>  \"Marseille was extremely handsome. He was a very gifted pilot, but he was unreliable. He had girl friends everywhere, and they kept him so busy that he was sometimes so worn out that he had to be grounded. His sometime irresponsible way of conducting his duties was the main reason I fired him. But he had irresistible charm.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=94}}</blockquote>\nAs punishment for \"[[insubordination]]\"\u2014rumoured to be his penchant for American [[jazz]] music, womanising and an overt \"playboy\" lifestyle\u2014and inability to fly as a wingman, Steinhoff transferred Marseille to ''[[Jagdgeschwader 27]]'' on 24 December 1940.  His new ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'', [[Eduard Neumann]], later recalled, \"His hair was too long and he brought with him a list of disciplinary punishments as long as your arm. He was tempestuous, temperamental and unruly. Thirty years later, he would have been called a playboy.\"{{sfn|Lucas|1983|p=151}} Nevertheless,  Neumann quickly recognised Marseille's potential as a pilot. He stated in an interview: \"Marseille could only be one of two, either a disciplinary problem or a great fighter pilot.\"{{sfn|Sims|1982|p=159}} ''Jagdgeschwader'' 27 was soon relocated to North Africa.\n\n===Arrival in North Africa===\nMarseille's unit briefly saw action during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], deployed to [[Zagreb]] on 10 April 1941, before transferring to Africa. On 20 April on his flight from [[Tripoli]] to his front airstrip Marseille's Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-7 (''Werknummer'' 1259) developed engine trouble and he had to make a forced landing in the desert short of his destination.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|p=374}} His squadron departed the scene after they had ensured that he had got down safely. Marseille continued his journey, first hitchhiking on an Italian truck, then, finding this too slow; he tried his luck at an airstrip in vain. Finally he made his way to the General in charge of a supply depot on the main route to the front, and convinced him that he should be available for operations next day. Marseille's character appealed to the General and he put at his disposal his own [[Opel Admiral]], complete with [[chauffeur]]. \"You can pay me back by getting fifty victories, Marseille!\" were his parting words. He caught up with his squadron on 21 April.{{sfn|Bekker|1994|p=246}}\n\nMarseille scored two more victories on 23 and 28 April, his first in the [[North African Campaign]]. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by [[Second Lieutenant|''Sous-Lieutenant'']] James Denis, a [[Free French]] pilot with [[No. 73 Squadron RAF]] (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-7 (''Werknummer'' 5160) received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was leaning forward the rounds missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter near Tobruk{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|p=374}}. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=99}} His  Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-7 (''Werknummer'' 1567) came down in the vicinity of Tobruk behind German lines.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|p=374}} In a postwar account, Denis wrote that he waited for Marseille \nto close on him while he feigned ignorance, then skidded [side slipped] forcing the faster German to over shoot. Marseille was lucky. Bullets passed in front of his face and behind his head. 30 hits were counted after Marseille crash landed.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012a|p=170}}\n\nIn between the battles with Denis, Marseille downed a [[Bristol Blenheim]] on 28 April. Blenheim ''T2429'', from [[No. 45 Squadron RAF]], piloted by Pilot Officer B. C. de G. Allan, crashed killing all five men aboard.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012a|p=175}} Jan Yindrich, a [[Polish Army]] soldier, witnessed the attack: \"when a Blenheim came roaring down over our heads at about 50 feet, there was a terrific rattle of machine gun fire and at first I thought the Blenheim had made a mistake and was firing at us or choosing an awkward spot to clear his guns. Bullets whistled around, so we dived into the [[slit trench]]. A Messerschmitt, hot on the tail of the Blenheim, was responsible for the bullets. The Blenheim roared down the wadi, out to sea, trying to escape from the Messerschmitt, but the Messerschmitt was too close. The Blenheim fell out of the sky and crashed into the sea. The plane disappeared completely not leaving a trace. The Messerschmitt banked and flew inland again.\"{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=37}}\n\nNeumann (''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' as of 10 June 1942) encouraged Marseille to self-train to improve his abilities. By this time, he had crashed or damaged another four {{nowrap|Bf 109E}} aircraft, including an aircraft he was ferrying on 23 April 1941.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=136}} Marseille's kill rate was low, and he went from June to August without a victory. He was further frustrated after damage forced him to land on two occasions: once on 14 June 1941 and again after he was hit by ground fire over [[Tobruk]] and was forced to land blind.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=46\u201347}} His tactic of diving into opposing formations often found him under fire from all directions, resulting in his aircraft frequently being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Neumann grew impatient with him. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not only in outstanding [[situational awareness]], marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle [[deflection (military)|deflection shooting]] attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics on the way back from missions with his comrades and became known as a master of deflection shooting.{{sfn|Spick|1996|pp=120\u2013124}}{{sfn|Zabecki|2014|p=830}}\n\nAs Marseille began to claim Allied aircraft regularly, on occasion he organised the welfare of the downed pilot personally, driving out to remote crash sites to rescue downed Allied airmen. On 13 September 1941 Marseille shot down Pat Byers of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[No. 451 Squadron RAAF|No. 451 Squadron]]. Marseille flew to Byers' airfield and dropped a note informing the Australians of his condition and treatment. He returned several days later to second the first note with news of Byers' death. Marseille repeated these sorties after being warned by Neumann that G\u00f6ring had forbade any more flights of this kind.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=6\u20137, 89}} After the war, Marseille's JG 27 comrade [[Werner Schr\u00f6er]] stated that Marseille attempted these gestures as \"penance\" for a group that \"loved shooting down aircraft\" but not killing a man; \"we tried to separate the two. Marseille allowed us that escape, our penance I suppose.\"{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=90}}{{refn|Marseille's trip to the airfield was witnessed by Byers' squadron-mate Geoffrey Morely-Mower, later an English professor at [[Madison University]]. Morley said \"his greatest deeds, only revealed by the patient work of scholars and the accident of my own involvement as an eye-witness, were almost private and purely compassionate.\" Morely died in 2005.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=109\u2013110}}|group=Note}}\n\nFinally on 24 September 1941, his practice came to fruition, with his first multiple victory sortie, claiming four Hurricanes of [[1 Squadron SAAF|No. 1 Squadron]], [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF). By mid December, he had reached 25 victories{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=22}} and was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold. His ''Staffel'' was rotated to Germany in November/December 1941 to convert to the Bf 109F-4/trop, the variant that was described as the ''Experten'' (experts) \"mount.\" These victories represented his 19\u201323rd victory.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=192}} Marseille became known amongst his peers for accounting for multiple enemy aircraft in a sortie.{{sfn|Zabecki|2014|p=830}}\n\n===The \"Star of Africa\"===\n{{Quote box\n|quote=\"Marseille was the unrivalled virtuoso among the fighter pilots of World War 2. His achievements had previously been regarded as impossible and they were never excelled by anyone after his death.\"{{sfn|Galland|1954|p=115}}\n|source=[[Adolf Galland]], ''General der Jagdflieger''\n|width=32%\n|align=left\n}}\nMarseille always strove to improve his abilities. He worked to strengthen his legs and abdominal muscles, to help him tolerate the extreme [[g force]]s of air combat. Marseille also drank an abnormal amount of milk and shunned sunglasses, in the belief that doing so would improve his eyesight.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=172}}\n\nTo counter German fighter attacks, the Allied pilots flew \"[[Lufbery circle]]s\" (in which each aircraft's tail was covered by the friendly aircraft behind). The tactic was effective and dangerous as a pilot attacking this formation could find himself constantly in the sights of the opposing pilots. Marseille often dived at high speed into the middle of these defensive formations from either above or below, executing a tight turn and firing a two-second deflection shot to destroy an enemy aircraft. Marseille's successes had begun to become readily apparent by early 1942. He claimed his 37\u201340th victories on 8 February 1942 and 41\u201344th victories four days later which earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] that same month for 46 victories.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=28, 48, 51, 193}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-440-1313-37, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 109, Waffenreinigen.jpg|thumb|left|Marseille's service men, Hoffmann (left) and Berger, cleaning the bore of one of the cannons of a Bf 109. \"Yellow 14\" ''W.Nr. 8673'' can be seen in the background.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=185}}]]\nMarseille attacked under conditions many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship allowed him to make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight made it possible for him to spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=123}} He was credited with outstanding [[situational awareness]].{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=14}}\n\nIn combat, Marseille's unorthodox methods led him to operate in a small leader/[[wingman]] unit, which he believed to be the safest and most effective way of fighting in the high-visibility conditions of the North African skies. Marseille \"worked\" alone in combat keeping his wingman at a safe distance so he would not collide or fire on him in error.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=172}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-440-1313-03, H.

Clade said of Marseille's tactics:\n<blockquote>Marseille developed his own special tactics, which differed significantly from the methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even took it to the point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\">''Hans-Joachim Marseille \u2013 The Star of Africa'' (Archive of War teleproduction). Egypt/Germany: AV-Medienproduktion, 1990. Note: Narrated by Brian Matthews.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Friedrich K\u00f6rner]] (36 victories) also recognised this as unique: \"Shooting in a curve (deflection shooting) is the most difficult thing a pilot can do. The enemy flies in a defensive circle, that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By pulling his aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, but if he does that, his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct.\"<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\"/> The attack was, however, carried out at close-range; Marseille dived from above, climbed underneath an opponent, fired as the enemy aircraft disappeared under his own, and then used the energy from the dive to climb and repeat the process.{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=138}} \n\nHis success as a fighter pilot also led to promotions and more responsibility as an officer. 1 May 1942 saw him receive an unusually early promotion to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' followed by appointment to ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' of ''3./JG 27'' on 8 June 1942, thus succeeding Oberleutnant [[Gerhard Homuth]] who took command of ''I./JG 27''.{{sfn|Sims|1982|p=171}}\n\nIn a conversation with his friend [[Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt]], Marseille commented on his style, and his idea of air-to-air combat:\n<blockquote>I often experience combat as it should be. I see myself in the middle of a British [sic] swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle \u2013 a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=55}}</blockquote>\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote=\"Telling Marseille that he was grounded was like telling a small child that it could not go out and play.

With a wingman, Marseille bounced the Kittyhawks. After he downed one of the Australian pilots, Flying Officer Graham Pace in ''AL172'',{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=201}} Marseille's Bf 109 took hits in the oil tank and propeller, likely from [[Flying Officer]] [[Geoff Chinchen]], who reported damaging one of the Messerschmitts. Marseille nevertheless managed to shoot down another Kittyhawk (Sergeant Colin McDiarmid; ''AK855''), before nursing his overheating aircraft back to base. The repairs to Marseille's Bf 109 took two days.{{sfn|Brown|2000|p=109}} The aerial victories were recorded as numbers 57\u201358.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=193}}\n\nWeeks later, on 30 May, Marseille performed another mercy mission after witnessing his 65th victory\u2014Pilot Officer [http://www.raafdb.com/view_casualty.asp?id=9966 Graham George Buckland] of [[No. 250 Squadron RAF]]\u2014strike the tail plane of his fighter and fall to his death when the parachute did not open. After landing he drove out to the crash site. The P-40 had landed over Allied lines but they found the dead pilot within German territory. Marseille marked his grave, collected his papers and verified his identity, then flew to Buckland's airfield to deliver a letter of regret. Buckland died two days before his 21st birthday.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=106}}\n\nHis attack method to break up formations, which he perfected, resulted in a high proportion of victories, and in rapid, multiple victories per attack. On 3 June 1942, Marseille attacked alone a formation of 16 [[Curtiss P-40]] fighters and shot down six aircraft of No. 5 Squadron SAAF, five of them in six minutes, including three aces: Robin Pare (six victories), Cecil Golding (6.5 victories) and Andre Botha (five victories). This success inflated his score further, recording his 70\u201375th victories. Marseille was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 6 June 1942.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=194, 207}} His wingman Rainer P\u00f6ttgen, nicknamed ''Fliegendes Z\u00e4hlwerk'' (the \"Flying Counting Machine\"),{{sfn|Sims|1982|p=156}} said of this fight:\n<blockquote> All the enemy were shot down by Marseille in a turning dogfight. As soon as he shot, he needed only to glance at the enemy plane. His pattern [of gunfire] began at the front, the engine's nose, and consistently ended in the cockpit. How he was able to do this not even he could explain. With every dogfight he would throttle back as far as possible; this enabled him to fly tighter turns. His expenditure of ammunition in this air battle was 360 rounds (60 per aircraft shot down)</blockquote>\n\nSchr\u00f6er, did however, place Marseille's methods into context:\n<blockquote>He was the most amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw. He was also very lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us trying to catch up to him. He violated every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=28}}</blockquote>\n\nOn 17 June 1942, Marseille claimed his 100th aerial victory. He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=243}} Marseille then returned to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]]. On 6 August, he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fianc\u00e9e Hanne-Lies K\u00fcpper. On 13 August, he met [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Rome]] and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery, the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor|''Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare'']].{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=190}} While in [[Italy]] Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report, submitted by the ''[[Gestapo]]'' head in Rome, [[Herbert Kappler]]. He was finally located. According to rumours he had run off with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded to return to his unit. Unusually, nothing was ever said about the incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=135}}\n\nLeaving his fianc\u00e9e in Rome, Marseille returned to combat duties on 23 August. 1 September 1942 was Marseille's most successful day, claiming to destroy 17 Allied aircraft (nos. 105\u2013121), and September would see him claim 54 victories, his most productive month.{{sfn|Weal|2003|p=86}} The 17 aircraft claimed included eight in 10 minutes; as a result of this feat, he was presented with a [[Volkswagen K\u00fcbelwagen]] by a ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' squadron, on which his Italian comrades had painted \"Otto\" ([[Italian language]]: ''Otto'' = eight).{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=319}} This was the most aircraft from Western Allied air forces shot down by a single pilot in one day. Only one pilot, [[Emil Lang (fighter ace)|Emil \"Bully\" Lang]], on 4 November 1943, would better this score, against the Soviet Air Force on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Feist|1993|p=61}} The post-war analysis shows that the actual results of the day were probably eight to nine destroyed by Marseille with three or four more damaged.{{Sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012b|p=326}}\n\nOn 3 September 1942 Marseille claimed six victories (nos. 127\u2013132) but was hit by fire from the British-Canadian ace [[James Francis Edwards]].{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=165. [note 20]}} ''[[Der Adler]]'', a biweekly propaganda magazine published by the Luftwaffe, also reported his actions in volume 14 of 1942.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=186}} Marseille was made famous through propaganda that treated fighter pilots as superstars and continued to do so after his death.{{sfn|Cocks|2012|p=205}} He regularly signed postcards with his image. Aside from ''Der Adler'', his exploits were published in ''Die Berliner'', ''Illustrierte'', ''Zeitung'' and ''Die Wehrmacht''.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=186\u2013194}}\n\nThree days later Edwards likely killed [[G\u00fcnter Steinhausen]], a friend of Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend [[Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt]] was posted missing in action. These personal losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the last weeks of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent [[sleepwalking]] at night and other symptoms that could be construed as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Marseille never remembered these events.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=155\u2013158}}\nMarseille flew Bf 109 E-7 aircraft{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|pp=25, 26}}{{sfn|Prien|Rodeike|Stemmer|1998|p=540}} and Bf 109F-4/Z aircraft.{{sfn|Scutts|1994|p=90}}\n[[File:Bf109F-4 Gelbe14 Ma JG27 kl96.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-4/trop, W.Nr. 8673 \u2013 3./JG 27 \u2013 Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Marseille in September 1942|alt=A fighter aircraft, shown in profile, viewed from the left.]]\nMarseille continued scoring multiple victories throughout September, including seven on 15 September (nos. 145\u2013151). Between 16 and 25 September, Marseille failed to increase his score due to a fractured arm, sustained in a force landing soon after the 15 September mission. As a result, he had been forbidden to fly by Eduard Neumann. But the same day, Marseille borrowed the [[Macchi C.202]] '96\u201310' of the Italian ace ''Tenente'' Emanuele Annoni, from 96a ''Squadriglia'', 9\u00b0 ''Gruppo'', 4\u00b0 ''Stormo'', based at [[Fuka, Egypt|Fuka]], for a test flight. But the one-off flight ended in a wheels-up landing, when the German ace accidentally switched the engine off, as the throttle control in Italian aircraft was opposite to that of the German aircraft.{{sfn|Massimello|Apostolo|2000|p=35}} The event was photographed.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012b|p=352}} \n\nMarseille had nearly surpassed his friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt's score of 59 victories in just five weeks. However, the massive material superiority of the Allies meant the strain placed on the outnumbered German pilots was now severe. At this time, the strength of German fighter units was 112 (65 serviceable) aircraft against the British muster of some 800 machines.{{sfn|Weal|2003|p=82}}\nMarseille was becoming physically exhausted by the frenetic pace of combat. After his last combat on 26 September, Marseille was reportedly on the verge of collapse after a 15-minute battle with a formation of Spitfires, during which he scored his seventh victory of that day.{{sfn|Weal|2003|pp=32, 33}}\n\nOf particular note was Marseille's 158th claim. After landing in the afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, \"That was the toughest adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought it would be my last fight\". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=66}}\n\n===Death===\nThe two missions of 26 September 1942 had been flown in Bf 109 G-2/trop, in one of which Marseille had shot down seven Allied aircraft. The first six of these machines were to replace the ''Gruppe'''s Bf 109 Fs. All had been allocated to Marseille's 3 ''Staffel''. Marseille had previously ignored orders to use these new aircraft because of its high engine failure rate, but on the orders of [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Albert Kesselring]], Marseille reluctantly obeyed. One of these machines, WK-Nr. 14256 (Engine: [[Daimler-Benz DB 605]] A-1, W.Nr. 77 411), was to be the final aircraft Marseille flew.{{sfn|Weal|2003|p=8}}\n\nOver the next three days Marseille's ''Staffel'' was rested and taken off flying duties. On 28 September Marseille received a telephone call from ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]] asking to return with him to Berlin. Hitler was to make a speech at the [[Berlin Sportpalast]] on 30 September and Rommel and Marseille were to attend. Marseille rejected this offer, citing that he was needed at the front and had already taken three months' vacation that year. Marseille also said he wanted to take leave at Christmas, to marry his fianc\u00e9e Hanne-Lies K\u00fcpper.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p= 174}}\n\nOn 30 September 1942, ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Marseille was leading his ''Staffel'' on a ''Stuka'' escort mission covering the withdrawal of the group and relieving the outward escort, III./''[[Jagdgeschwader 53]]'' (JG 53), which had been deployed to support JG 27 in Africa. Marseille's flight was vectored onto Allied aircraft in the vicinity but the opponent withdrew and did not take up combat. Marseille vectored the heading and height of the formation to Neumann who directed III./JG 27 to engage. Marseille heard 8./JG 27 leader [[Werner Schr\u00f6er]] claim a Spitfire over the radio at 10:30.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=176\u2013177}} While returning to base, his new Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2/trop's cockpit began to fill with smoke; blinded, he was guided back to German lines by his wingmen, Jost Schlang and Lt Rainer P\u00f6ttgen. Upon reaching friendly lines, \"Yellow 14\" had lost power and was drifting lower and lower. P\u00f6ttgen called out after about 10 minutes that they had reached the White Mosque of [[Sidi Abdel Rahman]], and were thus within friendly lines. At this point, Marseille deemed his aircraft no longer flyable and decided to bail out, his last words to his comrades being \"I've got to get out now, I can't stand it any longer\".{{sfn|Tate|2008|p= 116}}{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=176\u2013178}}\n\nEduard Neumann was personally directing the mission from the command post:\n<blockquote>I was at the command post and listening to the radio communication between the pilots. I realised immediately something serious had happened; I knew they were still in flight and that they were trying to bring Marseille over the lines into our territory and that his aircraft was emitting a lot of smoke.<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\"/></blockquote>\n{{Location map\n |Egypt | label=Crash site\n |alt=\n |mark=<!--dot-->Green pog.svg\n |lat_deg=30|lat_min=53|lat_sec=26.80\n |lon_deg=28|lon_min=41|lon_sec=42.87\n |position=right\n |width=200\n |float=right\n |caption=Crash site\n}}\nHis ''Staffel'', which had been flying a tight formation around him, peeled away to give him the necessary room to manoeuvre. Marseille rolled his aircraft onto its back, the standard procedure for bail out, but due to the smoke and slight disorientation, he failed to notice that the aircraft had entered a steep dive at an angle of 70\u201380 degrees and was now travelling at a considerably faster speed (about {{convert|640|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}). He worked his way out of the cockpit only to be carried backwards by the slipstream. The left side of his chest struck the vertical stabiliser of his fighter, which either killed him instantly or rendered him unconscious to the point that he could not deploy his parachute. He fell almost vertically, hitting the desert floor {{Convert|7|km|mi}} south of [[Sidi Abdel Rahman]]. As it transpired, a gaping 40&nbsp;cm (16&nbsp;in) hole had been made in his parachute and the canopy  spilled out. After recovering the body, the parachute release handle was still on \"safe,\" suggesting Marseille had not  attempted to open it. Whilst the body was checked, a regimental doctor noted Marseille's wristwatch had stopped at exactly 11:42&nbsp;am. The doctor had been the first to reach the crash site, having been stationed just to the rear of the forward mine defences. He had also witnessed Marseille's fatal fall.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=116}} The autopsy report stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The pilot lay on his stomach as if asleep. His arms were hidden beneath his body. As I came closer, I saw a pool of blood that had issued from the side of his crushed skull; brain matter was exposed. I then noticed the awful wound above the hip. With certainty this could not have come from the fall. The pilot must have been slammed into the airplane when bailing out. I carefully turned the dead pilot over onto his back. opened the zipper of his flight jacket, saw the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Marseille never actually received the Diamonds personally) and I knew immediately who this was. The paybook also told me. I glanced at the dead man's watch. It had stopped at 11:42.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=117}}</blockquote>\n\n''[[Oberleutnant]]'' [[Ludwig Franzisket]] collected the body from the [[desert]]. Marseille lay in state in the ''Staffel'' sick bay, his comrades coming to pay their respects throughout the day. Marseille's funeral took place on 1 October 1942 at the Heroes Cemetery in [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] with Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] and [[Eduard Neumann]] delivering a eulogy.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=120}}\n\n[[File:MarseilleCrash.JPG|thumb|left|The wreckage of Marseille's aircraft on 30 September 1942; the vehicle in the background marks the spot where Marseille landed.]]\n\nAn enquiry into the crash was hastily set up. The commission's report concluded that the crash was caused by damage to the [[differential gear]], which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out.<ref name=\"Archive of War teleproduction\"/> The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via [[Bari]], [[Italy]]. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=128}} Schland and P\u00f6ttgen's statements led Neuman concluded there was no fire and a glycol leak was responsible for the engine failure. He ruled out the existence of a fire, for he did not believe Marseille could have spoken for nine minutes without fatigue in smoke caused by a fire.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nJG 27 was moved out of Africa for about a month because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, [[G\u00fcnter Steinhausen]] and Marseille's friend [[Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt]], just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer suggests these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his ''staffel'' relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n[[File:Hans-Joachim Marseille Memorial 2.jpg|thumb|right|Marseille family grave in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]]]]\nHistorians Hans Ring and Christopher Shores also point to the fact that Marseille's promotions were based on personal success rates more than any other reason, and other pilots did not get to score air victories, let alone become ''Experten'' themselves. They flew support as the \"maestro showed them how it was done\", and often \"held back from attacking enemy aircraft to build his score still higher\".{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=30\u201331: Citing Shores and Ring.}} As a result there was no other ''Experten'' to step into Marseille's shoes if he was killed.\nEduard Neumann explained:\n<blockquote>\"This handicap [that very few pilots scored] was partially overcome by the morale effect on the whole Geschwader of the success of pilots like Marseille. In fact most of the pilots in Marseille's ''staffel'' acted in secondary role as escort to the 'master.'\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=31}}</blockquote>\n\nMarseille's impact on Allied fighter pilots and their morale is unclear. Andrew Thomas quoted [[Pilot Officer]] Bert Houle of [[No. 213 Squadron RAF]]; \"He was an extremely skilled pilot and a deadly shot. It was a helpless feeling to be continually bounced, and to do so little about it.\"{{sfn|Thomas|2003|p=56}} Robert Tate, on the other hand, is skeptical Allied pilots would have been familiar, asking, \"How well was Marseille known to [[Desert Air Force|DAF]] personnel in the Desert? Apparently not so well. Although there is a little indication that some Allied pilots may have heard of Marseille, this information did not readily make its way down to Allied Squadrons. Fanciful stories abound of how pilots knew of one another and hoped to duel with each other in the skies. This was more than likely not the case.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=100}}\n\n==In propaganda and popular culture==\nMarseille appeared four times in the ''[[Die Deutsche Wochenschau|Deutsche Wochenschau]]'', the German propaganda newsreel. The first time on Wednesday 17 February 1942 when [[Oberst]] Galland, the ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'', visited an airport in the desert. The second time on Wednesday 1 July 1942 when Marseille travelled to Rastenburg to receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords from Adolf Hitler. The third time on Wednesday 9 September 1942 announcing Marseille's 17 aerial victories from 1 September 1942 and that he had been awarded the Diamonds to his Knight's Cross. His last appearance was on 30 September 1942 showing Marseille visiting [[Erwin Rommel]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=51}}\n\nPrinting press used Marseille prolifically during 1942; from magazines to journals. ''[[Der Adler]]'' used his image for a front cover on 7 and 14 July 1942. Marseille's death did not prohibit his inclusion in the ''[[Die Wehrmacht]]'' on 21 and 28 October 1942. [[Signal\u00a0(magazine)|''Signal'']] used him as a cover in their September 1942. ''[[Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung]]'' used him for a cover on 4 July 1942.{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=227\u2013233}}\n\nIn 1957, a German film, ''[[Der Stern von Afrika]]'' (''The Star of Africa'') directed by [[Alfred Weidenmann]], was made starring [[Joachim Hansen (actor)|Joachim Hansen]] as Hans-Joachim Marseille.

After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, \"After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned and said that he thought 'the F\u00fchrer was a rather odd sort'.\" {{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=136}} On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and [[Nicolaus von Below]], overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within earshot of others, Marseille responded, \"that if he saw a party worth joining, he would consider it, but there would have to be plenty of attractive women in it.\" The remarks visibly upset Hitler, who was left \"puzzled\" by Marseille's behaviour.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=124}}\n\nAt the home of [[Willy Messerschmitt]], industrialist and designer of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter, Marseille played [[Jazz|American Jazz]] on Messerschmitt's piano in front of  Adolf Hitler, party chairman [[Martin Borman]], Hitler's deputy and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], head of the SS, [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Hitler purportedly left the room.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=126\u2013127}} [[Magda Goebbels]] found the prank amusing and [[Artur Axmann]] recalled how his \"blood froze\" when he heard this \"[[Ragtime]]\" music being played in front of the ''F\u00fchrer''.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nLater that month Marseille was invited to another party function, despite his earlier stunt. ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Karl Wolff]], of [[Personal Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]], confirmed that during his visit Marseille overheard a conversation which mentioned crimes against the [[Jews]] and other people. He stated:\n\n<blockquote>[[Odilo Globocnik|Globocnik]] and I were talking about [[Operation Reinhard]], which was in full effect following [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich's]] [[Operation Anthropoid|murder]], and also the construction of [[Sobibor]] and [[Treblinka]]. I know I asked him about [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|H\u00f6ss]], who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp ([[Auschwitz]]). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] that [[Lidice]] had been cleared, and all the Jews and [[Czechs]] had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|p=129}}</blockquote>\n\nWhen Marseille returned to his unit, he reportedly asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schr\u00f6er whether they had heard what was happening to Jews and if perhaps something was underway that they did not know about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his own neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, people changed the subject, or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nMarseille's friendship with his adopted helper also is used to show his anti-Nazi character. In 1942, Marseille befriended a South African Army prisoner of war, Corporal Mathew Letulu, nicknamed ''Mathias''. Marseille took him as a personal helper rather than allow him to be sent to a prisoner of war camp in Europe. Over time, Marseille and Mathias became inseparable. Marseille was concerned how Mathias would be treated by other units of the ''Wehrmacht'' and once remarked \"Where I go, Mathias goes.\"{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=4\u20139}} Marseille secured promises from his senior commander, Neumann, that if anything should happen to him [Marseille] Mathias was to be kept with the unit. Mathias duly remained with JG 27 until the end of the war and attended post-war reunions until his death in 1984.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=4\u20139, 149, 180}}\n\nBiographer Robert Tate went further in his examination. During his research, he contacted Professor Rafael Scheck, Head of History at [[Colby College]]. Scheck published ''Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940'' and is an acknowledged expert on racial theory and in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=90}} Without being familiar with Marseille, Scheck identified his friendship with [[Corporal]] Mathew P. Letuku was in direct contradiction to the Nazi mandate.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=91}} Letuku, alias Mathias to everyone in ''JG 27'', was a [[Black people|black]] South African soldier taken [[prisoner of war]] by German troops on the morning of 21 June 1941 at fortress Tobruk. Mathias initially worked as a volunteer driver with ''3. Staffel'' then befriended Marseille and became his domestic helper in Africa.{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=396}} Sheck doubted that Marseille's \"acquisition\" of Matthais and his role as Marseille's \"[[Batman (military)|batman]]\" was done out of disrespect. Sheck said, \"I know of the camp commandant of the concentration camp of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], who held a black man as his personal servant. This was done out of disrespect, however. I do not think that aspect was relevant for Marseille.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=91}} When questioned on Marseille's behaviour, Sheck said, \"I do not find it odd because I am accustomed to seeing many nuances among the Germans of the Third Reich. But his behaviour would probably be startling for many other researchers.\"{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=91}} Tate also noted Marseille's penchant for [[Cuban rumba]] by [[Ernesto Lecuona]], jazz and swing, which he believes was another way Marsaille resisted Nazi ideals.{{sfn|Tate|2008|p=94}}\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:MarseillePyramidSW2.jpg|thumb|right|Marseille Pyramid in Sidi Abd el-Rahman, Egypt]]\n[[File:German war memorial, Tobruk01.JPG|thumb|right|German war memorial, Tobruk]]\n* A wartime pyramid was constructed by Italian engineers at the site of Marseille's fall but over time it decayed.

Moreover, Brown lists three occasions on which Marseille could not have downed as many aircraft as claimed.{{sfn|Brown|2000|pp=281\u2013282}}{{sfn|Tate|2008|pp=64\u201365}} Christopher Shores and his co-authors wrote that Marseille over-claimed on occasion, particularly in September 1942.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012b|p=359}} They concluded Marseille had developed such a supreme confidence in his ability his mentality dictated, \"If I fire at it, it must go down.\" They estimate two-thirds to three-quarters of his claims were aircraft that were destroyed, crash-landed or at least were heavily damaged.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012b|p=359}}\n\nStephan Bungay has pointed out the low military value of shooting down DAF fighters, rather than the bombers that, by mid-1942, were having a highly damaging effect on Axis ground units and convoy routes.{{sfn|Bungay|2002|pp=140\u2013141}}{{refn|One of the reasons Rommel cites for breaking off the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] on 2 September was the \"Allied air superiority\" which had played a key role in crippling his supply lines.|group=Note}} Referring to 1 September 1942, Bungay points out that even if Marseille shot down 15 of the 17 he claimed that day, \"the rest of the 100 or so German fighter pilots{{refn|The figure of \"100 or so German pilots\" represents the ''Geschwader's'' entire strength.|group=Note}} between them only got five. The British [sic] lost no bombers at all...{{sfn|Bungay|2002|pp=140\u2013141}} During this period the DAF lost only a few bombers, but all fell to [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]] and evidence shows that Rommel was forced onto the defensive because of the losses inflicted by bombers.{{sfn|Scutts|1994|p=29}}\n\n===Decorations===\n{|\n| style=\"width:130pt; vertical-align:top;\"| {{*}} 1 February 1940:\n| valign=\"top\" | [[Aviator badge#Germany|Aviator badge]]{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=48}}\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | {{*}} 9 September 1940:\n| valign=\"top\" | [[Iron Cross]] Second Class for two air victories.{{sfn|Thomas|1998|p=61}}\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | {{*}} 17 September 1940:\n| valign=\"top\" | Iron Cross First Class for fourth air victory.{{sfn|Thomas|1998|p=61}}\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | {{*}} 3 November 1941:\n| valign=\"top\" | [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Honorary Cup of the Luftwaffe]].{{sfn|W\u00fcbbe|2001|p=48}}\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | {{*}} 24 November 1941:\n| valign=\"top\" | [[German Cross|German Cross in Gold]]{{sfn|Patzwall|Scherzer|2001|p=295}} (the first German pilot to receive this award in Africa.) for 25 victories.
