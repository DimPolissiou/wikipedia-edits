The Jacobites declared that the natives of Newcastle were staunch supporters of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian kings]], in particular of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] during the 1715 rebellion. This contrasted with rural [[Northumberland]], which largely supported the Jacobite cause.

It occurs in the titles of two songs by songwriter Joe Wilson (1841\u20131875): \"Geordy, Haud the Bairn\" and \"Keep your Feet Still, Geordie\". Citing such examples as the song \"Geordy Black\", written by Rowland Harrison of Gateshead, she contends that, as a consequence of popular culture, the miner and the keelman had become icons of the region in the 19th century, and \"Geordie\" was a label that \"affectionately and proudly reflected this,\" replacing the earlier ballad emblem, the figure of [[Bob Crankie]].\n\nIn the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'' of 1900, [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] gave the definition ''A man from Tyneside; a miner; a north-country vessel'', quoting two sources from Northumberland, one from East Durham and one from Australia.

There are minimal pairs such as ''tack'' {{IPA|/tak/}} vs. ''talk'' {{IPA|/ta\u02d0k/}} (normal Geordie pronunciation: {{IPA|/t\u0254\u02d0k/}}). If they are disregarded, this {{IPAblink|a\u02d0}} is best regarded as a phonetic realisation of {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} in certain words (roughly, those spelt with ''a''). It occurs only in broad Geordie. Another {{IPAblink|a\u02d0}} appears as an allophone of {{IPA|/a/}} before final voiced consonants in words such as ''lad'' {{IPA|[la\u02d0d]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=360, 375}}\n\n; Phonetic quality and phonemic incidence\n* {{IPA|/i\u02d0, u\u02d0/}} are typically somewhat closer than in other varieties; {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} is also less prone to fronting than in other varieties of BrE and its quality is rather close to the cardinal {{IPAblink|u}}. However, younger women tend to use a central {{IPAblink|\u0289\u02d0}} instead.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* {{IPA|/i\u02d0, u\u02d0/}} are monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|i\u02d0}}, {{IPAplink|u\u02d0}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0289\u02d0}}]}} only in morphologically closed syllables. In morphologically open syllables, they are realised as closing diphthongs {{IPA|[ei, \u0275\u028a]}}. This creates minimal pairs such as ''freeze'' {{IPA|[f\u0279i\u02d0z]}} vs. ''frees'' {{IPA|[f\u0279eiz]}} and ''bruise'' {{IPA|[b\u0279u\u02d0z ~ b\u0279\u0289\u02d0z]}} vs. ''brews'' {{IPA|[b\u0279\u0275\u028az]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}} For simplicity, the monophthongal allophone of {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} is transcribed with {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} throughout the article.\n* The {{sc2|HAPPY}} vowel is tense {{IPAblink|i}} and is best analysed as belonging to the {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} phoneme.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=362, 376}}\n* As other Northern English varieties, Geordie lacks the {{sc2|FOOT}}-{{sc2|STRUT}} split, so that words like ''cut'', ''up'' and ''luck'' have the same {{IPA|/\u028a/}} phoneme as ''put'', ''sugar'' and ''butcher''. The typical phonetic realisation is unrounded {{IPAblink|\u0264}}, but it may be hypercorrected to {{IPAblink|\u0259}} among middle-class (especially female) speakers.{{sfnp|Beal|2004|pp=121\u2013122}}\n* The long close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e\u02d0, o\u02d0/}} may be realised as monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|e\u02d0}}, {{IPAplink|o\u02d0}}]}} or as opening diphthongs {{IPA|[\u026a\u0259, \u028a\u0259]}}. Alternatively, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} can be a closing diphthong {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} can be centralised to {{IPAblink|\u0275\u02d0}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} The opening diphthongs are recessive, as younger speakers reject them in favour of the monophthongal {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|e\u02d0}}, {{IPAplink|o\u02d0}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0275\u02d0}}]}}.{{sfnp|Beal|2004|pp=123\u2013124}}\n* Other, now archaic, realisations of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} include {{IPAblink|a\u02d0}} in ''snow'' {{IPA|[sna\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[a\u028a]}} in ''soldiers'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sa\u028ald\u0292\u0250z]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* Geordie does not always adhere to the same distributional patters of vowels found in Received Pronunciation or even the neighbouring accents. Examples of that include the words ''no'' and ''stone'', which may be pronounced {{IPA|[ni\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[st\u026a\u0259n]}}, so with vowels that are best analysed as belonging to the {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} phonemes.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* Many female speakers merge {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, but the exact phonetic quality of the merged vowel is uncertain.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} may be phonetically {{IPAblink|\u00f8\u02d0}} or a higher, unrounded vowel {{IPAblink|\u026a\u02d0}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} An RP-like vowel {{IPAblink|\u025c\u031d\u02d0}} is also possible.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}}\n* In broad Geordie, {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} merges with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} to {{IPAblink|\u0254\u02d0}} under the influence of a uvular {{IPAblink|\u0281}} that once followed it (when Geordie was still a rhotic dialect).{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}}{{sfnp|Beal|2004|p=126}} The fact that the original {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} vowel is never hypercorrected to {{IPAblink|\u00f8\u02d0}} or {{IPAblink|\u025c\u031d\u02d0}} suggests that either this merger was never categorical, or that speakers are unusually successful in sorting those vowels out again.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}}\n* The schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is often rather open ({{IPAblink|\u0250}}). It also tends to be longer in duration than the preceding stressed vowel, even if that vowel is phonologically long. Therefore, words such as ''water'' and ''meter'' are pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8w\u0254d\u0330\u0250\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8mid\u0330\u0250\u02d0]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} This feature is shared with the very conservative (''Upper Crust'') variety of Received Pronunciation.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=283}}\n* Words such as ''voices'' and ''ended'' have {{IPA|/\u0259/}} in the second syllable (so {{IPA|/\u02c8voes\u0259z, \u02c8\u025bnd\u0259d/}}), rather than the {{IPA|/\u026a/}} of RP. That does not mean that Geordie has undergone the [[weak vowel]] merger because {{IPA|/\u026a/}} can still be found in some unstressed syllables in place of the more usual {{IPA|/\u0259/}}. An example of that is the second syllable of ''seven'' {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025bv\u026an/}}, but it can also be pronounced with a simple schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}} instead. Certain weak forms also have {{IPA|/\u026a/}} instead of {{IPA|/\u0259/}}; these include ''at'' {{IPA|/\u026at/}}, ''of'' {{IPA|/\u026av/}}, ''as'' {{IPA|/\u026az/}}, ''can'' {{IPA|/k\u026an/}} and ''us'' {{IPA|/\u026az/}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=376}}\n* As in other Northern English dialects, the {{sc2|BATH}} vowel is short {{IPA|/a/}} in Geordie. There are very few exceptions to this rule; for instance, ''master'', ''plaster'' and sometimes also ''disaster'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0252\u02d0/}}.{{sfnp|Beal|2004|pp=122\u2013123}}\n* Some speakers unround {{IPA|/\u0252\u02d0/}} to {{IPAblink|\u0251\u02d0}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} Regardless of the rounding, the difference in backness between {{IPA|/\u0252\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} is very pronounced, a feature which Geordie shares with RP and some northern and midland cities such as Stoke-on-Trent and Derby, but not with the accents of the middle north.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=360, 375}}\n\n[[File:Geordie diphthong chart - part 1.svg|thumb|250px|Part 1 of Geordie [[diphthong]]s (from {{Harvcoltxt|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}})]]\n[[File:Geordie diphthong chart - part 2.svg|thumb|250px|Part 2 of Geordie diphthongs (from {{Harvcoltxt|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}}). {{IPA|/\u00e6u/}} has a considerable phonetic variation.]]\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Diphthongs of Geordie{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | \n! colspan=\"3\" | Endpoint\n|-\n! {{small|Front}}\n! {{small|Central}}\n! {{small|Back}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Start point\n! {{small|Front}}\n| {{IPA|ai}} || {{IPA|i\u0250}} || {{IPA|\u00e6u}}\n|-\n! {{small|Back}}\n| {{IPA|oe}} || {{IPA|u\u0250}} ||\n|}\n\n* As the transcription indicates, the second elements of {{IPA|/i\u0250, u\u0250/}} are commonly as open as the typical Geordie realisation of {{IPA|/\u0259/}} ({{IPAblink|\u0250}}).{{sfnp|Beal|2004|p=126}}\n* The first element of {{IPA|/\u00e6u/}} is phonetically {{IPAblink|\u00e4}} or {{IPAblink|\u025b}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=375\u2013376}} or an intermediate {{IPAblink|\u00e6}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}} Traditionally, this vowel was a monophthong {{IPAblink|u\u02d0}} and this pronunciation can still be heard, as can a narrower diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259u]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=376}}\n* {{IPA|/ai/}} is phonetically {{IPA|[\u00e4i]}}, but the [[Scottish vowel length rule]] applied by some speakers of Geordie creates an additional allophone {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} that has a shorter, higher and more front onset than the main allophone {{IPA|[\u00e4i]}}. {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} is used in words such as ''knife'' {{IPA|[n\u025bif]}}, whereas {{IPA|[\u00e4i]}} is used in e.g. ''knives'' {{IPA|[n\u00e4ivz]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} For simplicity, both of them are written {{IPA|[ai]}} in this article.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{Wiktionary category |category=Geordie English |type=the Geordie dialect}}\n\nThe Geordie dialect shares similarities with other Northern English dialects, as well as with the [[Scots language]] (See Rowe 2007, 2009).\n\nIn her column for the South [[Shields Gazette]], [[Dorothy Samuelson-Sandvid]] attests many samples of Geordie language usage, such as the nouns ''bairn'' (\"child\")<ref name=Drflkb2>{{cite web| title = Dorfy looking fondly back on her youth |quote = Aa wuz a bairn. |publisher = South Shields Gazette |date =29 July 2009 |url = http://www.shieldsgazette.com/cookson/Dorfy-looking-fondly-back-on.5504984.jp |accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and ''clarts'' (\"mud\");<ref name=Drfhrswrd8/> the adjectives ''canny'' (\"pleasant\")<ref name=Drfhrswrd3>{{cite web |title = Here's a word from Dorfy |quote = Is canny, friendly, hyemly wawds that waarms aall Geordie hearts. |publisher = South Shields Gazette |date =17 March 2009 |url = http://www.shieldsgazette.com/cookson/Here39s-a-word-from-Dorfy.5080123.jp |accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and ''clag'' (\"sticky\");<ref name=Drfhrswrd8>{{cite web |title = Here's a word from Dorfy |quote = Wor Geordie taalk is hyemly taalk; an wawds like 'clag' and 'clarts' |publisher = South Shields Gazette |date =17 March 2009 |url = http://www.shieldsgazette.com/cookson/Here39s-a-word-from-Dorfy.5080123.jp |accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] [[verb phrase]] ''howay'' (\"hurry up!\"; \"come on!\")<ref name=Drfhrswrd4/>\n\n''[[wikt:howay|Howay]]'' is broadly comparable to the invocation \"Come on!\" or the [[French language|French]] \"Allez-y!\" (\"Go on!\").

It occurs in the titles of two songs by songwriter Joe Wilson (1841\u20131875): \"Geordy, Haud the Bairn\" and \"Keep your Feet Still, Geordie\". Citing such examples as the song \"Geordy Black\", written by Rowland Harrison of Gateshead, she contends that, as a consequence of popular culture, the miner and the keelman had become icons of the region in the 19th century, and \"Geordie\" was a label that \"affectionately and proudly reflected this,\" replacing the earlier ballad emblem, the figure of [[Bob Crankie]].\n\nIn the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'' of 1900, [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] gave the definition ''A man from Tyneside; a miner; a north-country vessel'', quoting two sources from Northumberland, one from East Durham and one from Australia.

However, younger women tend to use a central {{IPAblink|\u0289\u02d0}} instead.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* {{IPA|/i\u02d0, u\u02d0/}} are monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|i\u02d0}}, {{IPAplink|u\u02d0}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0289\u02d0}}]}} only in morphologically closed syllables. In morphologically open syllables, they are realised as closing diphthongs {{IPA|[ei, \u0275\u028a]}}. This creates minimal pairs such as ''freeze'' {{IPA|[f\u0279i\u02d0z]}} vs. ''frees'' {{IPA|[f\u0279eiz]}} and ''bruise'' {{IPA|[b\u0279u\u02d0z ~ b\u0279\u0289\u02d0z]}} vs. ''brews'' {{IPA|[b\u0279\u0275\u028az]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}} For simplicity, the monophthongal allophone of {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} is transcribed with {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} throughout the article.\n* The {{sc2|HAPPY}} vowel is tense {{IPAblink|i}} and is best analysed as belonging to the {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} phoneme.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=362, 376}}\n* As other Northern English varieties, Geordie lacks the {{sc2|FOOT}}-{{sc2|STRUT}} split, so that words like ''cut'', ''up'' and ''luck'' have the same {{IPA|/\u028a/}} phoneme as ''put'', ''sugar'' and ''butcher''. The typical phonetic realisation is unrounded {{IPAblink|\u0264}}, but it may be hypercorrected to {{IPAblink|\u0259}} among middle-class (especially female) speakers.{{sfnp|Beal|2004|pp=121\u2013122}}\n* The long close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e\u02d0, o\u02d0/}} may be realised as monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|e\u02d0}}, {{IPAplink|o\u02d0}}]}} or as opening diphthongs {{IPA|[\u026a\u0259, \u028a\u0259]}}. Alternatively, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} can be a closing diphthong {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} can be centralised to {{IPAblink|\u0275\u02d0}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} The opening diphthongs are recessive, as younger speakers reject them in favour of the monophthongal {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|e\u02d0}}, {{IPAplink|o\u02d0}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0275\u02d0}}]}}.{{sfnp|Beal|2004|pp=123\u2013124}}\n* Other, now archaic, realisations of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} include {{IPAblink|a\u02d0}} in ''snow'' {{IPA|[sna\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[a\u028a]}} in ''soldiers'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sa\u028ald\u0292\u0250z]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* Geordie does not always adhere to the same distributional patters of vowels found in Received Pronunciation or even the neighbouring accents. Examples of that include the words ''no'' and ''stone'', which may be pronounced {{IPA|[ni\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[st\u026a\u0259n]}}, so with vowels that are best analysed as belonging to the {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} phonemes.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* Many female speakers merge {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, but the exact phonetic quality of the merged vowel is uncertain.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n* {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} may be phonetically {{IPAblink|\u00f8\u02d0}} or a higher, unrounded vowel {{IPAblink|\u026a\u02d0}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} An RP-like vowel {{IPAblink|\u025c\u031d\u02d0}} is also possible.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}}\n* In broad Geordie, {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} merges with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} to {{IPAblink|\u0254\u02d0}} under the influence of a uvular {{IPAblink|\u0281}} that once followed it (when Geordie was still a rhotic dialect).{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}}{{sfnp|Beal|2004|p=126}} The fact that the original {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} vowel is never hypercorrected to {{IPAblink|\u00f8\u02d0}} or {{IPAblink|\u025c\u031d\u02d0}} suggests that either this merger was never categorical, or that speakers are unusually successful in sorting those vowels out again.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=375}}\n* The schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is often rather open ({{IPAblink|\u0250}}). It also tends to be longer in duration than the preceding stressed vowel, even if that vowel is phonologically long. Therefore, words such as ''water'' and ''meter'' are pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8w\u0254d\u0330\u0250\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8mid\u0330\u0250\u02d0]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} This feature is shared with the very conservative (''Upper Crust'') variety of Received Pronunciation.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=283}}\n* Words such as ''voices'' and ''ended'' have {{IPA|/\u0259/}} in the second syllable (so {{IPA|/\u02c8voes\u0259z, \u02c8\u025bnd\u0259d/}}), rather than the {{IPA|/\u026a/}} of RP. That does not mean that Geordie has undergone the [[weak vowel]] merger because {{IPA|/\u026a/}} can still be found in some unstressed syllables in place of the more usual {{IPA|/\u0259/}}. An example of that is the second syllable of ''seven'' {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u025bv\u026an/}}, but it can also be pronounced with a simple schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}} instead. Certain weak forms also have {{IPA|/\u026a/}} instead of {{IPA|/\u0259/}}; these include ''at'' {{IPA|/\u026at/}}, ''of'' {{IPA|/\u026av/}}, ''as'' {{IPA|/\u026az/}}, ''can'' {{IPA|/k\u026an/}} and ''us'' {{IPA|/\u026az/}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=376}}\n* As in other Northern English dialects, the {{sc2|BATH}} vowel is short {{IPA|/a/}} in Geordie. There are very few exceptions to this rule; for instance, ''master'', ''plaster'' and sometimes also ''disaster'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0252\u02d0/}}.{{sfnp|Beal|2004|pp=122\u2013123}}\n* Some speakers unround {{IPA|/\u0252\u02d0/}} to {{IPAblink|\u0251\u02d0}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} Regardless of the rounding, the difference in backness between {{IPA|/\u0252\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} is very pronounced, a feature which Geordie shares with RP and some northern and midland cities such as Stoke-on-Trent and Derby, but not with the accents of the middle north.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=360, 375}}\n\n[[File:Geordie diphthong chart - part 1.svg|thumb|250px|Part 1 of Geordie [[diphthong]]s (from {{Harvcoltxt|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}})]]\n[[File:Geordie diphthong chart - part 2.svg|thumb|250px|Part 2 of Geordie diphthongs (from {{Harvcoltxt|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}}). {{IPA|/\u00e6u/}} has a considerable phonetic variation.]]\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Diphthongs of Geordie{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | \n! colspan=\"3\" | Endpoint\n|-\n! {{small|Front}}\n! {{small|Central}}\n! {{small|Back}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Start point\n! {{small|Front}}\n| {{IPA|ai}} || {{IPA|i\u0250}} || {{IPA|\u00e6u}}\n|-\n! {{small|Back}}\n| {{IPA|oe}} || {{IPA|u\u0250}} ||\n|}\n\n* As the transcription indicates, the second elements of {{IPA|/i\u0250, u\u0250/}} are commonly as open as the typical Geordie realisation of {{IPA|/\u0259/}} ({{IPAblink|\u0250}}).{{sfnp|Beal|2004|p=126}}\n* The first element of {{IPA|/\u00e6u/}} is phonetically {{IPAblink|\u00e4}} or {{IPAblink|\u025b}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=375\u2013376}} or an intermediate {{IPAblink|\u00e6}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}} Traditionally, this vowel was a monophthong {{IPAblink|u\u02d0}} and this pronunciation can still be heard, as can a narrower diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259u]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=376}}\n* {{IPA|/ai/}} is phonetically {{IPA|[\u00e4i]}}, but the [[Scottish vowel length rule]] applied by some speakers of Geordie creates an additional allophone {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} that has a shorter, higher and more front onset than the main allophone {{IPA|[\u00e4i]}}. {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} is used in words such as ''knife'' {{IPA|[n\u025bif]}}, whereas {{IPA|[\u00e4i]}} is used in e.g. ''knives'' {{IPA|[n\u00e4ivz]}}.{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}} For simplicity, both of them are written {{IPA|[ai]}} in this article.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{Wiktionary category |category=Geordie English |type=the Geordie dialect}}\n\nThe Geordie dialect shares similarities with other Northern English dialects, as well as with the [[Scots language]] (See Rowe 2007, 2009).\n\nIn her column for the South [[Shields Gazette]], [[Dorothy Samuelson-Sandvid]] attests many samples of Geordie language usage, such as the nouns ''bairn'' (\"child\")<ref name=Drflkb2>{{cite web| title = Dorfy looking fondly back on her youth |quote = Aa wuz a bairn. |publisher = South Shields Gazette |date =29 July 2009 |url = http://www.shieldsgazette.com/cookson/Dorfy-looking-fondly-back-on.5504984.jp |accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and ''clarts'' (\"mud\");<ref name=Drfhrswrd8/> the adjectives ''canny'' (\"pleasant\")<ref name=Drfhrswrd3>{{cite web |title = Here's a word from Dorfy |quote = Is canny, friendly, hyemly wawds that waarms aall Geordie hearts. |publisher = South Shields Gazette |date =17 March 2009 |url = http://www.shieldsgazette.com/cookson/Here39s-a-word-from-Dorfy.5080123.jp |accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and ''clag'' (\"sticky\");<ref name=Drfhrswrd8>{{cite web |title = Here's a word from Dorfy |quote = Wor Geordie taalk is hyemly taalk; an wawds like 'clag' and 'clarts' |publisher = South Shields Gazette |date =17 March 2009 |url = http://www.shieldsgazette.com/cookson/Here39s-a-word-from-Dorfy.5080123.jp |accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] [[verb phrase]] ''howay'' (\"hurry up!\"; \"come on!\")<ref name=Drfhrswrd4/>\n\n''[[wikt:howay|Howay]]'' is broadly comparable to the invocation \"Come on!\" or the [[French language|French]] \"Allez-y!\" (\"Go on!\").

From its head, the open canal immediately flows west under the eastbound lanes of [[Interstate 84 in Utah|Interstate&nbsp;84]] before reaching its first enclosure. The enclosed canal then flows westerly down the south edge of the canyon, and just south Weber River (with Interstate&nbsp;84 just north of the river). At the mouth of the Weber Canyon, the now open canal continues southwesterly (while the river and the highway continue west). After entering the city of [[South Weber, Utah|South Weber]], the canal passes under [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. Route 89]]. From there it continues northwesterly along the southern edge of South Weber, at the base of the plateau upon which Hill AFB is located. (The Bambrough Canal also flows along this course, just north of the Davis\u2013Weber Canal.) Between about 1650 East to about 600 East, the canal has been enclosed. On the western end of South Weber, the canal is once again enclosed, before passing under the south end of [[Utah State Route 168]] (just north of the unused North Gate of Hill AFB).\n\nAs the canal crosses the Davis\u2013Weber county line it also leaves South Weber to enter the city of [[Riverdale, Utah|Riverdale]]. The slope of the edge of the plateau is particularly steep as the still enclosed canal passes through Riverdale to the northernmost tip of Hill AFB, just east of [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]] (I\u201115). The canal then turns southerly to run between I\u201115 on the west and Hill AFB on the east. Just after turning south, the canal leaves Riverdale and briefly passes through the eastern edge of the city of [[Roy, Utah|Roy]]. Upon crossing the Davis\u2013Weber county line again, the canal leaves Roy and enters the city of [[Sunset, Utah|Sunset]], and the canal becomes open again.\n\nRunning south between I\u201115 and Hill AFB, the canal continues through Sunset until about 1700 North. After crossing southwesterly under I\u201115 and North Main Street ([[Utah State Route 126]]), the open canal continues south along the west side of North Main Street until about 1200 North. The canal then becomes enclosed again until after it crosses back under South Main Street at about 830 North. At 800 North, the canal leaves Sunset and enters the city of [[Clearfield, Utah|Clearfield]]. After passing under East 650 North ([[Utah State Route 103]]), the once again open canal turns southeasterly an begins passing through residential neighborhoods on the west side of I\u201115. Between East 650 North and East 300 North, the northern section of the [[Clearfield Canal Trail]] runs along the western bank of the canal. South of East 300 North, canal becomes enclosed again as it continues on its southeasterly course. At about 340 South, canal returns to the west side of I\u201115 and, not longer enclosed, passes east under the freeway.\n\nOn the east side of I\u201115, the canal is immediately joined by the southern section of the Clearfield Canal Trail (which been running southeast along the east edge the freeway from East 200 South). Continuing on, the still open canal runs southeasterly between I\u201115 on the southwest (with the Clearfield Canal Trail in between) and South 1000 East on the northeast. At about 615 South, the canal and trail abruptly and briefly tune east before the canal passes under East 1000 South. The still open canal continues east-southeasterly until it reaches East 700 South ([[Utah State Route 193]]/Bernard Fisher Highway); the trail runs along the west edge of South 1000 East for this short section. The canal is enclosed again to pass directly south under the highway and remains enclosed for another brief stretch. South of East 700 South, the enclosed canal resumes its east-southeastly course through residential neighborhoods, with the Clearfield Canal Trail on its southeastern bank. Just before crossing under South 1500 East, the canal opens once again, but continues its east-southeasterly course until it reaches University Park Boulevard/North 1200 West. The southern section of the Clearfield Canal Trail ends at that street as the canal leaves Clearfield and enters the city of [[Layton, Utah|Layton]].\n\nAfter entering Layton, the still open canal continues its east-southeasterly course through residential neighborhoods, but becomes enclosed once again, just before crossing under North 1000 East. Remaining enclosed on its east-southeasterly course, the canal passes under North 800 West and North 650 East. At about 550 East, the canal turns slightly to a more easterly course before passing under North Hill Field Road ([[Utah State Route 232]]). Resuming a more east-southeasterly course, the still enclosed canal passes by the southern edge of [[Northridge High School (Layton, Utah)|Northridge High School]] before crossing under North 50 West, Antelope Drive, and North Fort Lane. After North Fort Lane, the canal turns slightly north before heading southeast to the Church Street Reservoir. Surplus from that reservoir flows in an unlined ditch under Church Street and North Fairfield Road before emptying into [[Kays Creek]] (which flows southwesterly to the [[Farmington Bay]] of the [[Great Salt Lake]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:East Canyon Dam Morgan County Utah.jpg|thumb|East Canyon Dam, June 2009]]\nThe original canal was built by the DWCCC in the mid 1880s to provide water for agigultural needs<ref name=\"audit\"/>{{rp|1}} and eventually extended {{convert|23|mi|km}} south to reach [[Fruit Heights, Utah|Fruit Heights]]. To ensure the Weber River could sustain adequate water flow for the canal, an [[Embankment dam|earthen dam]] was built by the DWCCC on the East Canyon Creek (a tributary of the Weber River) in East Canyon. By the early 1910s the original earthen canal was reconstructed and lined with [[concrete]]. Although improvements continued on the dam, having been enlarged twice since it was originally constructed, the original dam in East Canyon was replaced in the mid-1910s with a new concrete dam, also built by the DWCCC. However, the second dam was replaced by a third dam, built below the second, in the mid-1960s. Although the third dam was built by the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]], it is still operated by the DWCCC, with financial support from the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.davisweber.org/history.htm |title = History |publisher = Davis and Weber Counties Canal Company |accessdate = April 16, 2019 }}</ref> Over the years much of agricultural land in the service area has transitioned to residential subdivisions.

From its head, the open canal immediately flows west under the eastbound lanes of [[Interstate 84 in Utah|Interstate&nbsp;84]] before reaching its first enclosure. The enclosed canal then flows westerly down the south edge of the canyon, and just south Weber River (with Interstate&nbsp;84 just north of the river). At the mouth of the Weber Canyon, the now open canal continues southwesterly (while the river and the highway continue west). After entering the city of [[South Weber, Utah|South Weber]], the canal passes under [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. Route 89]]. From there it continues northwesterly along the southern edge of South Weber, at the base of the plateau upon which Hill AFB is located. (The Bambrough Canal also flows along this course, just north of the Davis\u2013Weber Canal.) Between about 1650 East to about 600 East, the canal has been enclosed. On the western end of South Weber, the canal is once again enclosed, before passing under the south end of [[Utah State Route 168]] (just north of the unused North Gate of Hill AFB).\n\nAs the canal crosses the Davis\u2013Weber county line it also leaves South Weber to enter the city of [[Riverdale, Utah|Riverdale]]. The slope of the edge of the plateau is particularly steep as the still enclosed canal passes through Riverdale to the northernmost tip of Hill AFB, just east of [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]] (I\u201115). The canal then turns southerly to run between I\u201115 on the west and Hill AFB on the east. Just after turning south, the canal leaves Riverdale and briefly passes though the eastern edge of the city of [[Roy, Utah|Roy]]. Upon crossing the Davis\u2013Weber county line again, the canal leaves Roy and enters the city of [[Sunset, Utah|Sunset]], and the canal becomes open again.\n\nRunning south between I\u201115 and Hill AFB, the canal continues through Sunset until about 1700 North. After crossing southwesterly under I\u201115 and North Main Street ([[Utah State Route 126]]), the open canal continues south along the west side of North Main Street until about 1200 North. The canal then becomes enclosed again until after it crosses back under South Main Street at about 830 North. At 800 North, the canal leaves Sunset and enters the city of [[Clearfield, Utah|Clearfield]].

[[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby [[Union of the Crowns|uniting the crowns]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in a [[personal union]], although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]]. Hence Wales as a home country has no representation on the flag.

One theory goes that for some years it would have been called just the \"Jack\", or \"Jack flag\", or the \"King's Jack\", but by 1674, while formally referred to as \"His Majesty's Jack\", it was commonly called the \"Union Jack\", and this was officially acknowledged.<ref name=\"flaginst\" />\n\nAmongst the proclamations issued by King George III at the time of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union]] of 1801 was a proclamation concerning flags at sea, which repeatedly referred to \"Ensigns, Flags, Jacks, and Pendants\" and forbade merchant vessels from wearing \"Our Jack, commonly called the Union Jack\" nor any pendants or colours used by the King's ships.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\">{{London Gazette|issue=15325|date=3 January 1801|pages=25\u201327}}</ref>  Reinforcing the distinction the King's proclamation of the same day concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom (not colours at sea) called the new flag \"the Union Flag\".<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15325|date=3 January 1801|pages=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nThe size and power of the [[Royal Navy]] internationally at the time could also explain why the flag was named the \"Union Jack\"; considering the navy was so widely utilised and renowned by the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|colonies]], it is possible that the term ''jack'' occurred because of its regular use on all British ships using the jackstaff (a flag pole attached to the bow of a ship). The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.<ref name=Flagsofworld>{{FOTW|id=gb|title=United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack.

Its original [[blazon]], as decreed by [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on 1 January 1801, reads: \n<blockquote>\"the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter changed argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second  [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The European Magazine: And London Review|volume=39|publisher=Philological Society of London|year=1801|page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qV83AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA74}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Specification===\n[[File:United Kingdom Flag Specifications.svg|350px|right|Diagram of the Union Flag's design]]\nThe Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but 1:2 is for most purposes. In 2008, MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/unionflag.html |accessdate=2014-04-09 |title=Union Flag Bill 2007\u201308 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\n* The red [[St George's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|5}} of the flag's height with a {{frac|1|15}} flag height [[fimbriation]]\n* The white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] width is {{frac|6|30}} of the flag's height, visible on either side of the St Patrick's Cross in diagonals of  {{frac|3|30}} and {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height, respectively.\n* The red diagonal [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height. It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]]. The error had been spotted by readers of the BBC News website who had contacted the BBC after seeing a photograph of the event.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7866938.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Flag mistake at UK-China ceremony |date=3 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Other ratios===\n{{flag image|Image = Flag of the United Kingdom (3-5).svg|Caption = [[War flag]] variant [[File:FIAV 001000.svg|23px]]<br /> Proportions: 3:5}}\n\nAlthough the most common ratio is 1:2, other ratios exist.

It was then adopted by land forces as well, although the blue field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.\n\nVarious shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \"[[navy blue|navy]]\" blue ([[Pantone]] 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the [[Blue Ensign]] of the [[Royal Navy]]'s historic \"Blue Squadron\". (Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver). The [[blazon]] for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is ''azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.''\n\n[[Wales]] had no explicit recognition in the Union Jack as it had been a part of the Kingdom of England since being annexed by [[Edward I of England]] in 1282 and its full integration by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]], and was therefore represented by the flag of England.<ref name=\"KnowBritain\"/>\n[[File:Flag of the Commonwealth (1658-1660).svg|thumb|alt=Red cross with a white border over a white saltire and dark blue background.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that on 22 January 1922:\n\n{{quote|text=At the College of Arms it was stated that certain modifications were under consideration and that if any action were taken it would be done by the King in Council.

It was then estimated that the alteration would cost at least \u00a32,000,000. To remove all reference to Ireland from the present Union Jack and Royal Arms would be vastly more expensive.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/14/109830879.pdf |title=May Alter The Union Jack |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 1922 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n\nThere was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:\n{{quote|text=...the removal of the cross of St. Patrick Cross after 120 years will transform the appearance of the flag. It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great.

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton.

It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag.

On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]].

The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.<ref name=Flagsofworld>{{FOTW|id=gb|title=United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack.

In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but 1:2 is for most purposes. In 2008, MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/unionflag.html |accessdate=2014-04-09 |title=Union Flag Bill 2007\u201308 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\n* The red [[St George's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|5}} of the flag's height with a {{frac|1|15}} flag height [[fimbriation]]\n* The white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] width is {{frac|6|30}} of the flag's height, visible on either side of the St Patrick's Cross in diagonals of  {{frac|3|30}} and {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height, respectively.\n* The red diagonal [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height. It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

(Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver).

It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great.

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.  The Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 provided that the flags of the Union were (a) the Union Jack, to denote the association with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and (b) the new [[Flag of South Africa (1928-1994)|National Flag]].  The Union Jack was to be flown alongside the National Flag at the [[Parliament of South Africa|Houses of Parliament]], from the principal government buildings in the capitals, at Union ports, on government offices abroad, and at such other places as the government might determine.<ref name=unfa>Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 (renamed 'Flags Act 1927' in 1949).</ref><ref name=sava>Radburn, A.

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as [[Indian Military Flags|India]] and [[List of Jamaican flags#Ensigns|Jamaica]]) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Naval Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[White Ensign|Royal Navy White Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] [[Red Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|[[Royal Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[British Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Government Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Blue Ensign]]\n|Flag of Her Majesty's Coastguard.png|[[HM Coastguard]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the British Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses.svg|Ensign of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]\n|Civil Ensign of the Isle of Man.svg|[[Isle of Man]] Red Ensign\n|Government Ensign of Gibraltar.svg|Gibraltar State Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of the Cayman Islands.svg|[[Cayman Islands]] Red Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Royal Australian Navy]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the Royal Australian Air Force.svg|[[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Red Ensign|Australian Civil Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[New Zealand Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Navy]] Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of New Zealand.svg|New Zealand Civil Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Fiji.svg|[[Fiji|Fijian]] Naval Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Ensign\n|Civil Air Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Air Ensign\n}}\n\n===Pilot or Civil Jack===\n[[File:Civil Jack of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|alt=Union Flag with thick white border comprising about half of the area of the flag.|The Union Jack with a white border]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2011|reason=needs more refs}}\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the '''Pilot Jack'''. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival [[North West Company]] had a similar flag as well. The HBC jack is no longer in use and replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company's coat of arms.\n\nThe Union Jack is the third [[quartering (heraldry)|quarter]] of the 1939 [[coat of arms of Alabama]], which is also used on the flag of the Governor of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\n\nIn the former International Settlement of [[Kulangsu]] the Kulangsu Municipal Police had a badge contained multiple flags, including the Union Flag.

In March 1899 the young Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called ''The Anglo-Saxon Review''. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, 'Your title \"The Anglo Saxon\" with its motto \"Blood is thicker than water\" only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.'<ref>{{cite letter |url=http://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/page?contextId=CHAR%2028%2F26%2F11-12#image=0 |last=Churchill |first=Winston |recipient=Jeanette, Lady Randolph Churchill |date=2 March 1899}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of [[fashion]] since the [[British Invasion]] movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American [[Stars and Stripes flag]], and came back into fashion in the mid-1990s '[[Cool Britannia]] era, notably [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Geri Halliwell]]'s iconic [[Union Jack dress]] of the [[1997 Brit Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a40047/story-of-geri-halliwell-union-jack-brits-dress/|title=It has been 20 years since Geri Halliwell wore the Union Jack dress|author=Amy de Klerk|date=22 February 2017|work=Harper's Bazaar}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201202027142/geri-halliwell-launches-new-union-jack-range/ |title=Geri revisits Spice Girls' heyday in Union Jack dress |work=Hello Magazine |accessdate=3 February 2015 |date=2 February 2012 }}</ref> A notable increase in popularity was seen in [[Cuba]] following the [[2012 London Olympics]], with clothing, nail decoration, tattoos, and hairstyles in youths being observed featuring the pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21082793 |title=Close Up: Cuba's new love for the Union flag |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\nCommonly the Union Flag is used on computer software and Internet pages as an [[Computer icon|icon]] representing a choice of the [[English language]] where a choice among multiple languages may be presented to the user, though the American flag is also commonly used for this purpose.

No one is above it.\"<ref name=\"auto23\"/>\n\nMusician and activist [[Denise Ho]] also spoke at the rally, and encouraged broad participation at the upcoming 5 August [[general strike]]. Ho said that there was safety in numbers, and that the government is more likely to respond to continuous pressure and indefinite strike actions.<ref name=scmp3021240/> While police estimated attendance of 13,000, the organiser claimed 40,000 civil servants participated at the rally.<ref name=\"scmp3021276\"/>\n\n=== Ma On Shan police station blockades ===\n\n==== 1 August ====\nOn 1 August, a police station in [[Ma On Shan (town)|Ma On Shan]] was surrounded by a large number of protesters demanding the release of demonstrators facing riot charges from the previous week's protest.<ref name=\"AutoL4-88\"/> Photos show protesters hurling bricks that were dug out from pavements towards the police station, shattering windows. At around 3:50&nbsp;am, riot police cleared away the protesters.\n\n==== 2 August ====\nOn 2 August, hundreds gathered in response to police raids and arrests made for possession of protest supplies. At 11&nbsp;pm, a crowd assembled near the Sha Tin police station and constructed barricades. By 1&nbsp;am the protest shifted to the Ma On Shan police station, after word was received that the eight arrested individuals were being held there. Activists attempted to pry open the metal shutters, vandalised building walls, and removed the \"Ma On Shan Police Station\" sign. Riot police arrived on the scene and by 3:15&nbsp;am the crowds had dispersed.<ref name=\"hongkongfp.com\"/>\n\n==== 3 August ====\nOn 3 August, democracy activists again returned to Ma On Shan police station for the second consecutive night.<ref name=\"MOS police station\"/> They demanded the release of the eight arrested protesters, including pro-independence activist [[Chan Ho-tin|Andy Chan Ho-tin]], who had been arrested the day before during a police raid on a building in [[Fo Tan]] and charged on suspicion of offensive weapons.<ref name=\"hongkongfp.com\"/> The group of about 100 protesters banged on the metal shutters, threw [[hell money]] to curse the officers inside, and some painted graffiti messages such as \"[[liberate Hong Kong]]\" and \"all consequences are at your own risk.\" Riot police began clearing the crowds at 10:45&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"MOS police station\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-89\"/> The police attempted to enter [[Park Belvedere]], a private residential building, angering both protesters and residents.<ref name=\"AutoL4-90\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-91\"/> The police also allegedly threw pepper bombs at people on a bridge.<ref name=\"MOS police station\"/>\n\n=== 3 August protests ===\nA planned and approved march started from [[Anchor Street]] Playground at 3:30&nbsp;pm. Protesters in the front of the rally held a banner that read \"Police have too much power\" ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u6b0a\u904e\u5927}}); a popular slogan for the day was \"[[Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time]]\". Marchers urged people to join in the general strike on 5 August. The front of the rally arrived at [[Cherry Street, Hong Kong|Cherry Street]] park at 5&nbsp;pm, but some protesters did not follow the designated route, and headed directly to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui instead; other protesters first arrived at the park and then followed on to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui.<ref name=\"AutoHY-4\"/>\n\nAt around 6:30&nbsp;pm, protesters moved barricades into the toll plaza of the [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] in [[Hung Hom]], blocking vehicles and then disappeared. Around 9:30&nbsp;pm, riot police fired tear gas on protesters in both Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. Several arrests were made.<ref name=\"AutoHY-5\"/> A small group of protesters also removed the Chinese flag near the [[Star Ferry]] pier in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] and threw it into [[Victoria Harbour]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-6\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-7\"/>\n\nAfter having received multiple shots of tear gas, protesters moved to the police station at [[Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong|Wong Tai Sin]], then left via MTR. Riot police followed and arrested several alleged protesters in the [[Wong Tai Sin Station]]. However, the presence of riot police officers angered nearby residents, who requested police to release those arrested and leave the district. They threw umbrellas and set off fire extinguishers. Shortly after, police officers fired tear gas at residents to disperse the crowd, which then went to protest at the nearby police station and Disciplined Services quarters. Dormitory residents showered residents and protesters with sticks, glass bottles and firecrackers from the building. After multiple shots of tear gas, protesters retreated and occupied [[Lung Cheung Road]], then dispersed after.<ref name=\"AutoHY-8\"/>\n\nAt the same time, multiple protesters surrounded Mong Kok Police Station. Riot police also arrived shortly and arrested protesters. Some of those arrested stated that they were only passers-by or local residents, and not protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-9\"/> Two foreign nationals, a Filipino and a South Korean, were arrested by authorities who suspects their involvement in the protest. The Filipino was [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] employee who was wearing black at the time of his arrest and the South Korean a restaurant worker. This is believed to be the first arrests of expatriates since the escalation of the protest in June.<ref name=\"AutoHY-10\"/>\n\n[[File:190804 HK protest Causeway Bay.jpg|thumb|Protesters in Causeway Bay on 4 August.]]\n\n=== 4 August protests ===\nThe demonstrations on 4 August began with a permitted march in [[Tseung Kwan O]], starting from [[Po Tsui Park]] at 2&nbsp;pm, with organisers stating around 150,000 protesters in attendance.<ref name=\"AutoHY-11\"/> During the rally, protesters threw bricks towards the police station breaking windows. They chanted \"Hong Kong police knowingly break the law\" and \"Shame on the corrupt police\". Police officers then appeared with police dogs and protesters dispersed. At night, the crowds occupied Po Shun Road. Riot police arrived to disperse crowds, and they unreasonably attacked a passer-by.<ref name=\"flee\"/>\n\nAnother rally appeared in [[Kennedy Town]] after the Tseung Kwan O rally.<ref name=\"AutoHY-12\"/> By the evening, protesters defied the police ban and marched towards Sheung Wan. However, by about 7&nbsp;pm police deployed tear gas canisters and routed the group to Causeway Bay, where thousands of protesters setup blockades and occupied areas of the shopping district. Then again by 10&nbsp;pm riot police attempted to clear the streets with the use of tear gas.<ref name=\"AutoHY-13\"/>\n\nNear the end of the Kennedy Town protest, some protesters went and blocked the [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] and a small group of protesters sprayed graffiti on the sculpture at the [[Golden Bauhinia Square]].<ref name=\"August 4 locations\"/> At the same time, a group of protesters gathered at Wong Tai Sin police station, protesting their way of force to the residents in the 3 August protest. Fearing that the police may deploy heavy force following 3 August scuffles, some protesters opted to occupy sections in [[Ngau Tau Kok]] and [[Kwun Tong]].<ref name=\"August 4 locations\"/> At night, various protests and police operations were done in [[Mei Foo]], Wong Tai Sin, Tin Shui Wai, Ma On Shan, and [[Lam Tin]]. [[Eastern Harbour Crossing]] and [[Tseung Kwan O Tunnel]] were temporarily blocked during the protests.<ref name=\"flee\"/>\n\n=== 5 August general strike ===\nThere was a city-wide general strike on 5 August, with protests and sit-ins in different districts. The [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] was affected by street blockades, major roadways were obstructed and train lines stalled, as thousands of workers across 20 different sectors participated, putting pressure on the government to meet protesters demands.<ref name=\"AutoHY-14\"/> At least seven major rallies and organising assemblies were held throughout areas of Hong Kong. The main rallies took place in [[Tamar Park]] in Admiralty, [[Sha Tin Town Hall]], [[Tuen Mun Park]], [[Discovery Park (Hong Kong)|Discovery Park]] in Tsuen Wan, [[Wong Tai Sin]] Square, MacPherson Playground in [[Mong Kok]] and Tin Hau Temple Fung Shui Square in [[Tai Po]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-15\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-16\"/>\n\nWorkers from various industries as well as several trade unions had announced in advance that they would join the strike.<ref name=\"AutoHY-17\"/> The government of Hong Kong issued a statement, urging citizens to not participate in the strike as it would \"undermine further the local economy that is facing downside risks.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-18\"/> Employees at Hong Kong Disneyland announced work stoppages.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Many air traffic controllers called in sick, and over 200 flights were cancelled while only one of the airport runways was operational.<ref name=\"AutoHY-19\"/>\n\nCarrie Lam held a press conference at 10&nbsp;am, condemning those who joined the strike, and stated that they are \"destroying Hong Kong\". She continued to support the police force and rejected the five demands by protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-20\"/> Pro-Beijing legislator [[Ann Chiang]] voiced her disappointment towards Lam's speech with a Facebook post, stating that Lam had raised many issues but offered no solutions.<ref name=\"AutoHY-21\"/> Meanwhile, the [[Hang Seng Index]] started to drop during Lam's conference and fell 2.9% by the midday break.<ref name=\"AutoHY-22\"/>\n\nIn the evening, protesters near the [[North Point]] neighbourhood and [[Tsuen Wan]] were attacked by two groups of stick wielding men, some wearing white shirts and another group in professionally printed blue shirts.<ref name=\"AutoHY-23\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-24\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-25\"/> The scuffles were brief but unexpected, and similar in nature to the 21 July [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests#Yuen Long pro-Beijing attacks|Yuen Long attacks]]. However, unlike the Yuen Long attacks, protesters fought back.<ref name=\"AutoHY-26\"/> Later in the night several police stations were blockaded by protesters and vandalised.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Police arrested 148 people by the end of the day.<ref name=\"AutoHY-27\"/> To disperse the protesters, the police force used more than 800 canisters of tear gas, a record number for Hong Kong, in 14 out of 18 districts in Hong Kong. As the police used tear gas in close proximity to many densely populated residential areas, many residents, children, and pets were affected.<ref name=\"AutoHY-28\"/>\n\nOn 6 August, Chairwoman Carol Ng of the [[Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions|Confederation of Trade Unions]] stated: \"If there is still no proper response from the government ... I presume it is possible to have another strike.\" The HKCTU helped to organise the 5 August general strike. They estimate 350,000 people had joined the strike.

Protesters threw eggs at the police while the police used tear gas to disperse the protesters.<ref name=\"AutoL4-93\"/> Legislator [[Helena Wong (politician)|Helena Wong]] condemned the police over the treatment of the protester, calling the arrest \"extremely disrespectful of women\". Responding to the criticism, Yolanda Yu, senior superintendent said that the protester was \"struggling vigorously\" and therefore required male police officers to subdue her.<ref name=\"AutoL4-94\"/>\n\n=== Solidarity protest of laser pointer arrest ===\n\n==== 6 August ====\n[[File:190807 HK laser pen protest Incendo 02.jpg|thumb|left|Hundreds gathered at [[Hong Kong Space Museum]] with their laser pointers in protest of selective legal enforcement and the arrest of Fong. 7 August 2019]]\nIn the afternoon of 6 August, [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] student union president Keith Fong was arrested in [[Apliu Street]], [[Sham Shui Po]] district. Plainclothes officers said that they approached him as \"he was acting suspiciously\". Fong ran away but was caught. He was searched and 10 [[laser pointers]], were found in a plastic bag. Fong stated that he purchased those laser pointers for stargazing, while passers-by supported him and chanted \"release him\". However, police officers arrested him for \"possession of offensive weapon\". Fong then complained of feeling unwell after he was choked by the officers and was taken to [[Caritas Medical Centre]]. His parents, along with Baptist University principal [[Roland Chin]] and lawyers, went to the hospital to visit him.<ref name=\"AutoL4-95\"/> Chin asked the police ensure students are treated fairly.<ref name=\"AutoL4-96\"/>\n\nThe student union and other citizens voiced their anger, condemning police for their abuse of power and described it as part of a broader campaign to intimidate and silence democracy activists. They questioned how laser pointers could become an \"[[offensive weapon]]\", a police representative responded in a press conference that several police officers in previous protests were injured due to laser beams that were pointed at them. At night, around 300 protesters gathered outside [[Sham Shui Po Police Station]], chanting \"[[Triad (organized crime)|triads]]\" and \"mafia cops.\" Police fired several tear gas to disperse the crowd, and arrested several protesters, including [[Sha Tin District Council]]or Wong Hok-lai, for \"unlawful assembly\".<ref name=\"Hong Kong Free Press HKFP\"/>\n\n==== 7 August ====\n[[File:20190807 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protest (48480850197).jpg|thumb|Protesters pointing their laser pointer to a newspaper held, mocking the police's demonstration. 6 August 2019]]\nOn 7 August, a group of teachers and staff members from HKBU held a press conference supporting Fong and condemning police's excessive force. They stated that the arrest is \"unexplainable\" and question the selective police enforcement with \"unreasonable definition of offensive weapon\". They also said that the freedom granted by the Basic Law is shaken by the police's action.<ref name=\"AutoL4-97\"/>\n\nIn a police press conference in the afternoon, police representatives stated that the laser pointers he purchased were in fact \"[[laser guns]].\" They attempted to demonstrate the \"laser gun\" Fong purchased is able to burn a hole in a paper by pointing it to a black area of a newspaper and holding it steadily for 20 seconds at very short distance.<ref name=\"AutoL4-98\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-99\"/> According to ''Stand News'', hundreds of shoppers have since been searching for laser pointers with many shops completely sold out.<ref name=\"AutoL4-100\"/>\n\nAt night, a group of protesters gathered at [[Hong Kong Space Museum]] and shined laser pointers on the wall of the museum, some chanted slogans like \"laser pointer revolution\" and joked \"Is the building on fire yet?\" They hoped to show support to Fong and voice condemnation of his arrest by police, and to show that laser pointers are neither offensive weapons nor effective enough to cause a fire. Protesters also sang the song \"I Am Angry\" from Cantopop band [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]].<ref name=\"https\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-101\"/>\n\nFong was detained 48 hours without any criminal charges, and then released on 8 August.<ref name=\"AutoL4-102\"/>\n\n=== 7 August lawyers' silent march ===\n[[File:190807 HK lawyer second march.jpg|thumb|Thousands of lawyers marched in black against the selective prosecution by the [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] on 7 August 2019.]]\nA silent march by lawyers was staged on 7 August, the second one since [[#6 June lawyers' silent march|6 June]]. Around 3,000 legal sector professionals, in black, marched in silence from the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] in Central to the [[Former Central Government Offices|Department of Justice's office]] at around 12:45&nbsp;pm.\n\nThe group of protesters stated that [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]] frequently departed from usual procedures and well-established guidelines, and accused Cheng of bias in selecting prosecution cases. They quoted the difference in prosecuting the arrest of anti-extradition bill protesters as \"rioting\", versus prosecuting the arrests in the [[2019 Yuen Long violence|Yuen Long incident]] as \"unlawful assembly.\" Furthermore, the rioting charges against the anti-extradition bill protesters were fast-tracked ahead of prosecution of the perpetrators of the Yuen Long violence, which occurred weeks before the protesters were arrested. Barrister Kevin Yam stated \"All we want is justice, all we want is consistency, we don't want to see thugs get away while the best of our youth get prosecuted.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-30\"/> They believed that this was the latest evidence of a decline of the rule of law.\n\nCampaigners voiced concern over the use of excessive force and asked for an independent commission of inquiry. Teresa Cheng refused to meet the lawyers when they arrived at her office.<ref name=\"AutoHY-31\"/>\n\n=== 8 August Catholics march ===\n\nOn Thursday night, around 1200 Catholics held a candlelight march through Central before finishing outside the Court of Final Appeal. The march organised by four Christian organisations, called for the government to heed to the protesters demands and called for both sides to exercise restraint, stop the violence and sit down to reach an agreement to help society move forward.<ref name=\"AutoHY-32\"/>\n\n=== 9\u201311 August airport sit-ins ===\n\nA second airport sit-in was held in the [[Hong Kong International Airport]], which continued for three consecutive days.<ref name=\"AutoHY-33\"/> Protesters hoped to gain international support by having a \"warm welcome.\" Unlike previous sit-ins, this demonstration was not approved by the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]]. Extra security measures were put in place, with authorities preventing anyone without a boarding pass from entering the check-in area.<ref name=\"AutoHY-34\"/>\n\nThousands gathered in both Terminal 1 and 2 by 6&nbsp;pm. Dressed in black, democracy activists handed out leaflets and pamphlets to tourists in several languages, including English, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Spanish, and German. A large banner reading \"Liberate HK\" was also unfurled from the second floor balcony.<ref name=\"AutoHY-35\"/> Demonstrators chanted and sang [[Do You Hear the People Sing?]]<ref name=\"AutoHY-36\"/>\n\nDue to the protests, all flights in and out of the airport were cancelled since Monday (12 August).

Similarly, protesters burnt joss papers and images showing the faces of Carrie Lam and Police Commissioner [[Stephen Lo]] outside the Sham Shui Po police station. The protest was largely peaceful. The police then dispersed the protesters by shooting tear gas inside the police building complex and deploying riot police.<ref name=\"AutoL4-105\"/> Another similar protest was held in [[Tin Shui Wai]], in which riot police arrested 5 protesters.<ref name=\"AutoL4-106\"/>\n\n=== 10 August protests ===\nTwo generally peaceful protests occurred on [[Hong Kong Island]]. Early in the morning, hundreds of senior citizens marched from [[Wan Chai]] police HQ to Chief Executive's Office and handed out petition letters requesting the police to \"lay down their offensive weapons\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-38\"/> The protest was followed by a family rally named \"Guard our children's future\" in [[Edinburgh Place]]. Hundreds of parents showed up with their kids to demand the government to respond to the demands of the protesters. The parents then marched to the Government HQ and displayed banners drawn by children and balloons.<ref name=\"AutoHY-39\"/>\n\nLess than a thousand protesters protested in [[Tai Po]] in the afternoon despite a police ban on the protest. Protesters gathered in Tai Po bus station and marched past the original destination, Kwong Fuk Road Football Ground. It was generally peaceful. Protesters chanted slogans including \"liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" and \"our five demands must all be fulfilled\", and yelled \"rubbish\" and \"triad\" at the police. Around 6&nbsp;pm, as the protesters were surrounded by the police, they moved to [[Tai Wai]] and [[New Town Plaza]] in Sha Tin and obstructed various locations, though protesters in Tai Wai dispersed after the police used tear gas.<ref name=\"AutoHY-40\"/>\n\nThe protesters then moved to different districts in Hong Kong, including [[Kowloon Bay]], [[Kwun Tong]], [[Tsuen Wan]], and [[Wong Tai Sin]], but they dispersed before the riot police began to advance. The [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] was blocked temporarily. In [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], tension rose when a police officer arrested a bystander.

Demonstrators marched from Maple Street Playground, set up roadblocks on Yam Chow Street, [[Cheung Sha Wan Road]] and besieged the [[Sham Shui Po Police Station]]. At 5&nbsp;pm, the police dispersed protesters using tear gas, though some tear gas canisters landed on a pedestrian footbridge nearby, affecting both journalists and residents. Democracy activists moved on and besieged the police station in Tsim Sha Tsui. The police set up a defence line near the Lane Shopper's Boulevard district and fired [[bean bag round]]s that ruptured the right eye of a female protestor.<ref name=\"taikoo\"/><ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/>\n\nAt 8&nbsp;pm, protesters moved to [[Kwai Chung]] and besieged the Kwai Chung police station.

However, some protesters occupied major roads and intersections near the [[Sogo Hong Kong]] department store in Causeway Bay, while some moved along to [[Wan Chai]], where a [[molotov cocktail]] was thrown during clashes with police.<ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/> Red banners were seen posted throughout the North Point region, calling for [[Fujian]]ese residents to defend their neighbourhood.<ref name=\"AutoHY-45\"/> Protesters had largely avoided marching to [[North Point]], where democracy activists were previously assaulted by stick-wielding men, allegedly the local Fujianese residents, during the 5 August general strike. However, tensions rose in the region when locals dressed in red attacked two journalists and two other people.<ref name=\"AutoHY-46\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-47\"/>\n[[File:190811 HK protest Causeway Bay.jpg|thumb|Protesters in Causeway Bay on 11 August 2019.]]\nIn [[Causeway Bay]], several people disguised as protesters were seen and caught on video tackling and arresting other protesters with the help of the police force at 10&nbsp;pm. Around ten men dressed as protesters were seen and caught on video passing from under a staircase at a tramstop guarded by the police. This led to allegations that the police used undercover officers to infiltrate into the demonstration. When journalists approached one of these men, he refused to show his warrant card and told the press to \"put down the camera.\"<ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/> During a police press conference on 12 August, Deputy Police Commissioner Tang Ping-Keung defended the use of disguised \"decoy officers\" and stated: \"I can say that during the time when our police officers were disguised ... they [did not] provoke anything.

The police force was accused of planting evidence to frame the protester. The police defended the tactic, saying that the protester had held the stick before he was arrested.<ref name=\"AutoHY-50\"/>\n\nSome protesters then moved to [[Quarry Bay Station]] and a brief standoff with police followed.<ref name=\"now live\"/> The Special Tactical Unit then chased democracy activists down an escalator in [[Tai Koo Station]] and fired guns with pepper ball rounds, targeting protesters within a very close range and aiming directly at their heads.<ref name=\"AutoHY-51\"/> Police officers were also filmed by journalists and seen using their batons to beat fleeing protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-52\"/> The Civil Rights Observer organisation condemned police actions due excessive use of force and the possibility of causing a [[stampede]].<ref name=\"taikoo\"/>\n\nFurther conflicts occurred when protesters besieged the [[Sha Tin]] police station.<ref name=\"brief shatin conflict\"/> Disgruntled by aggressive policing strategies and excessive use of force, residents in [[Sha Tin]],<ref name=\"brief shatin conflict\"/> [[Quarry Bay]], [[Sai Wan Ho]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-53\"/> [[Taikoo Shing]],<ref name=\"now live\"/> and [[Whampoa Garden]]<ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/> gathered to drive off the police away from their neighbourhoods and homes.

A demonstration against police brutality was organised in response and held at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 12 August.<ref name=\"AutoHY-60\"/> Sit-ins and roving protests began by 1&nbsp;pm, as thousands of people turned up to speak out about police violence. Many held signs and chanted slogans such as \"police go back to China\" and \"evil police eye for an eye\", while some protesters organised mobile \"[[Lennon Wall#Lennon Walls in Hong Kong|Lennon Wall]]\" on their bodies during the protests. Due to the large amount of protesters going to the airport, the traffic to the airport was congested. At around 3&nbsp;pm, the thousands of protesters had exceeded the capacity of the two main arrival halls, and the overflow of incoming protesters then congregated in the departure halls. As many as 5,000 democracy activists may have been involved in the demonstrations.<ref name=\"AutoHY-61\"/> By 4&nbsp;pm, the Airport Authority announced that all other flights had been cancelled for the rest of the day, except for departure flights that had completed the check-in process, and the arrival flights already heading to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"AutoHY-62\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-63\"/> At the same time, there were rumours and news about the arrival of riot police and the clearance of the airport.

Protesters had used luggage trolleys as physical defence for themselves during Tuesday's protest at the airport. Passengers struggled to get through the airport as protesters had blocked the path to the gating area. As a result of the continued protests, at 4:30&nbsp;pm, Hong Kong airport officials announced that check-ins were suspended for the remainder of the day at least.<ref name=\"AutoHY-65\"/> Members of British [[pop rock]] band [[The Vamps (British band)|The Vamps]] became stranded at the airport due to the protests. In an interview from the airport with ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' on 13 August, the band publicly expressed their support for the protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-66\"/>\n\nOn the same day, protesters cornered a man suspected of being a mainland security officer.<ref name=\"AutoHY-67\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-68\"/> The man was severely beaten, and was taken away a few hours later by the police.<ref name=\"AutoHY-69\"/> Shortly afterward, another man with a press vest was questioned by protesters about whether he was truly a reporter. He was seen taking photos of protesters' faces and told protesters he is actually a \"traveller\". Protesters gathered around him and requested him to show his press passes, though he refused. Protesters then discovered a blue T-shirt with the words \"I Love Hong Kong Police\", which was identical to the shirts attackers wore in an attack before. His Chinese passport, identity card, and diary were also taken. Protesters tied him up and he was then taken away by first-aiders. He was later identified as Fu Guohao, a ''[[Global Times]]'' journalist.<ref name=\"AutoHY-70\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-71\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-72\"/> The violence against Fu Guohao has been condemned by the Program Director of [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], Carlos Martinez de la Serna, who stated that \"Journalists from all outlets must be allowed to cover the demonstrations in Hong Kong without having to fear for their safety.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-73\"/> HKJA also condemned the violence and urged reporters from Chinese media outlets to display their credentials clearly to avoid similar incidents from happening again.<ref name=\"AutoHY-74\"/> Protesters then offered apologies after the incidents.<ref name=\"AutoHY-75\"/>\n\nOn 14 August, the court has issued an interim [[injunction]] to restrict the protests inside the airport.

Demonstrators wore black in solidarity with the on-going democracy movement.<ref name=\"AutoHY-81\"/> Demonstrators covered their right eyes with gauze to support the female protester whose right eye was shot by the police. A doctor at the [[Tuen Mun Hospital]] protest stated that these solidarity rallies were a \"direct response\" to the shooting of that woman on 11 August.<ref name=\"AutoHY-82\"/> These protests were held during lunch breaks and hospital operations were not affected.<ref name=\"AutoHY-83\"/>\n\nOn 14 August, hospital staffs from [[Ruttonjee Hospital]] and [[Tang Shiu Kin Hospital]] joined the protest.

Protesters asked the US and the UK to provide assistance and urged both governments to enact sanction on the officials responsible for causing the protests.<ref name=\"AutoHY-86\"/> Exiled activists, including [[Ray Wong]] Toi-yeung and Brian Leung Kai-ping recorded video messages for the crowds. Organisers claimed that 60,000 people attended, though the police put the figure at 7,100.<ref name=\"AutoHY-87\"/>\n\n=== 17 August teachers march ===\nThe [[Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union]] organised a march named \"Safeguard the next generation, let our conscience speak\" to support Hong Kong students and show solidarity to the arrestees.

HKPTU claimed that 22,000 people attended, while the police put the figure at 8,300.<ref name=\"AutoHY-88\"/>\n\n=== 17 August Reclaim To Kwa Wan-Hung Hom ===\nThe protest was initially set to be held on 27 July, though it was later moved to 17 August to prevent clashing with \"Reclaim Yuen Long\".<ref name=\"AutoL4-107\"/> The police initially banned the protest, though they approved when it adopted a shorter route. Protesters marched from [[Hoi Sham Park]] to [[Whampoa station]] to call the government to solve the community issues brought by an excessive number of mainland tourists in the region and condemn police brutality. The branch offices of pro-Beijing parties [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong|DAB]] and [[HKFTU]] were vandalised, and protesters hurled eggs at the offices. Protesters placed pineapples, a slang for homemade explosives, outside HKFTU's office, reflecting their role during the [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]].<ref name=\"DAB FTU\"/> Some protesters marched back to To Kwa Wan and [[Kowloon City]] and occupied sections of Ma Tau Wai Road and [[To Kwa Wan Road]].<ref name=\"AutoL4-108\"/> Some protesters also moved to [[Mong Kok]], [[Jordan, Hong Kong|Jordan]] and [[Yau Ma Tei]] and besieged the Mong Kok police station. Overall, approximately 20,000 joined the rally.<ref name=\"DAB FTU\"/>\n\n=== 18 August rally ===\nThe [[Civil Human Rights Front]] initially applied to hold a march, though only a rally in [[Victoria Park (Hong Kong)|Victoria Park]] was approved. The march was called to condemn police brutality and reiterate the five core demands after the 11 August incident. Due to the sheer number of people showing up, MTR's trains skipped [[Causeway Bay station]], [[Tin Hau station]] and [[Fortress Hill station]]. A massive amount of protesters waited on [[Hennessy Road]], [[Gloucester Road, Hong Kong|Gloucester Road]], and [[Kings Road]] for hours to get into the park. At 3:29&nbsp;pm, former Legislative Councilors [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] led the protesters towards [[Charter Garden]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], the march's original end point, along [[Hennessy Road]] in defiance of the police's ban. Protesters soon spilled over onto [[Yee Wo Street]], Pennington Street, Jardine's Bazaar and [[Lockhart Road]]. [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] was forced to cancel all routes crossing the [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]].<ref name=\"chrf august 18\"/> Near the end of the rally, protesters briefly occupied sections of [[Harcourt Road]] outside the Government Headquarters, though some protesters called the people who stayed to go home to ensure that the protest can end peacefully.<ref name=\"chrf august 18\"/>\n\nAccording to CHRF, 1.7&nbsp;million protesters attended the rally and an additional estimated of 300,000 protesters marched between Central and Causeway Bay, but could not enter the park due to overcrowding. The police put the figure at 128,000 at peak of those only in Victoria Park football areas. According to Bonnie Leung, CHRF's vice convenor, the high turnout rate had \"revitalized\" the campaign against the extradition law, and that should Carrie Lam not respond to protesters' demands, her administration will face tougher and more radical measures from protesters. The association also intended to apply for a [[judicial review]] questioning the police's unjustifiable ban. The government recognised that the protest was largely peaceful, though it criticised the marchers for inconveniencing the public as they occupied major roads on Hong Kong Island during the march.<ref name=\"AutoHY-89\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 195858.jpg|Protesters inside Victoria Park for the rally by [[Civil Human Rights Front]].\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 190715 (1).jpg|Protesters in Causeway Bay, outside [[Sogo]] Department Store, that could not enter the park.\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 165749.jpg|Hundreds of protesters on the streets in Causeway Bay that could not enter the park.\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 202037.jpg|Protesters in Wan Chai after leaving the rally.\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 204524.jpg|Protesters near the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] after the rally.\nFile:190818 HK protesters make way for ambulance.jpg|Protesters making way for ambulance.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 21 August Yuen Long sit-in ===\n\nThousands of demonstrators staged a sit-in protest inside [[Yuen Long station]] to demand justice and to remember the victims of the 21 July [[2019 Yuen Long attack|Yuen Long mob attacks]] at the night of 21 August.<ref name=\"AutoHY-90\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-91\"/> Protesters sat silently in the station, and stood up for a moment of silence every hour. Some protesters also covered their right eyes to remember the victim whose right eye was ruptured during the 11 August protest.<ref name=\"AutoHY-92\"/> Protesters and the police began a brief stand-off near the end of the sit-in. Protesters sprayed a firehose and threw soaps on the floor while making makeshift blockades to slow police's advance.

During the march, protesters expressed concerns about recently installed [[Smart device|smart]] lampposts enabled with facial recognition and video surveillance capabilities. Many worried that the lampposts would be used to further restrict freedom in Hong Kong, as China continues to tighten its grip. During the protest, one of these smart lampposts was knocked down and dismantled.<ref name=\"AutoHY-105\"/>\n\nAt around 4:15&nbsp;pm, protesters began to occupy sections of Wai Yip Street near Ngau Tau Kok Police Station and hurled objects at the police, while the police responded by using tear gas, beanbag rounds and pepper balls to disperse the protesters. Some protesters then retreated to [[Telford Garden]] and sprayed water hose at officers, and the police used tear gas and sponge grenade in return.<ref name=\"AutoHY-106\"/> [[Kwun Tong Road]] was briefly occupied by both the police and the protesters. At night, protesters moved to [[Wong Tai Sin]], [[Lok Fu]] and [[Sham Shui Po]].<ref name=\"Kwun Tong protest\"/>\n\nBefore the protest began, MTR suddenly announced that stations between the proposed march area, [[Choi Hung station]] and [[Tiu Keng Leng station]], would be closed, and claimed the move was necessary to protect MTR facilities and staff safety. Many criticised this decision as an act to restrict freedom of protest, and that by closing these stations, MTR had caused greater disturbance to the public. MTR also arranged special trains for the officers. Protesters criticised MTR for co-operating with the police and called it the \"railway of the Communist Party\".<ref name=\"Kwun Tong protest\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-107\"/>\n\nFollowing the Kwun Tong protest, [[Richland Gardens]]'s management suddenly changed the passcodes for all buildings. People wearing black and residents who were not carrying the resident card could not enter their homes. Disgruntled residents then surrounded the management office. Security guards called the police, who arrested two residents and used pepper spray on the crowds.<ref name=\"AutoHY-108\"/>\n\nThe march's organiser, Ventus Lau, was arrested for \"unlawful assembly\" after the protest, even though the police has already approved the march.<ref name=\"Richland\"/>\n\n=== 25 August Tsuen Wan protest ===\nThe march was held in the [[Kwai Tsing District]] and the [[Tsuen Wan District]]. Similar to the Kwun Tong protest, the police lifted the ban after the organisers changed the route of the protest. On 25 August, thousands of protesters marched from [[Kwai Chung Sports Ground]] to [[Tsuen Wan Park]]. MTR also closed [[Kwai Fong station]], [[Tsuen Wan station]] and [[Tsuen Wan West station]] temporarily.<ref name=\"AutoHY-109\"/>\n\nNear Yeung Uk Road, some protesters occupied a section of Yeung Uk Road and created makeshift roadblocks. The police used tear gas to disperse protesters, who threw petrol bombs. The police also deployed two specialised crowd management vehicles equipped with [[water cannon]], firing it twice in the span of one hour. This was the first time the trucks were deployed.<ref name=\"Stand News\"/> The march ended abruptly, but the protests spread to different districts around the city.

Their demands were for Lam to respond to public demands, senior police commanders to plan operations to minimise clashes, establish a platform for dialogue between the force and the public, for officers to remain disciplined, and to create an independent inquiry into police misconduct (a key demand of the protests). However, due to a lack of response, they submitted their letter at police headquarters in Wan Chai, where they also expressed appreciation for officers' efforts to preserve order, recited the force's [[Passing out (military)|passing out]] oath, and criticised police brutality. Organisers claimed that 400 people marched, while police counted 270. They said that the police were drawn into a political problem and admitted some police officers lost control of their emotions while performing their duties.<ref name=\"AutoHY-116\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-117\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-118\"/>\n\n=== 28 August aviation industry rally ===\n[[File:190828 HK protest by aviation worker.jpg|thumb|Protesters gathered in Edinburgh Place against Cathay Pacific on 28 August 2019.]]\nAs of 28 August 20 aviation staff professionals had been sacked or had resigned after Beijing exerted pressure on companies to crack down on the anti-government movement.

The participants stated they are extremely concerned about the deployment of tear gas, saying it is unclear how the toxic chemicals would affect nearby animals since the animals\u2019 sense of smell is much more acute than that of humans, and it stands to reason that they would be more seriously affected when exposed to chemical crowd control agents.<ref name=\"AutoHY-125\"/>\n\n=== 31 August protest ===\n[[File:HK police storm Prince Edward station and attack civilians 20190831 11pm.webm|thumb|Hong Kong police storm [[Prince Edward station]] and attack protesters on 31 August 2019]]\nFollowing a police ban on a protest applied by the [[Civil Human Rights Front]] and the arrests of several high-profile activists including [[Agnes Chow]] and [[Joshua Wong]], and pan-democratic Legislative Councilors including [[Jeremy Tam]], [[Au Nok-hin]] and [[Cheng Chung-tai]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-126\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-127\"/> hundreds of thousands protesters<!-- Citation needed.

To avoid any misunderstandings, journalists should to clearly display their press badges when interviewing large-scale demonstrations in Hong Kong to facilitate the public's identification. The public can also exercise their rights to decide whether to accept interviews and filming by relevant organisations.<ref name=\"AutoHY-137\"/> On 16 August, about 20 supporters from pro-police group Protect Hong Kong League urge the Hospital Authority to ban medical staffs from wearing surgical masks at work.

The protest was organised by Politihk Social Strategic, which claimed 10,000 people were in attendance, while police stated only 1200 were present. They claimed RTHK engaged in biased reporting, and that it should represent the voice of the government as its Hong Kong's public broadcaster.

protests}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\nThis is a list of August [[2019 Hong Kong protests]].\n\n== Events ==\n\n=== 1 and 3 August rallies ===\n\n==== Financial sector ====\nOn the night of 1 August, hundreds of staff from about 80 different financial institutions participated in a [[flash mob]] rally at Chater Garden in Admiralty.<ref name=\"auto24\"/> Protesters were also concerned about incidents of alleged police collusion with triad gangsters and demanded respect for rule of law. At least 700 financial sector workers have posted images of staff cards in support of the upcoming 5 August city-wide [[general strike]].<ref name=\"auto24\"/> The organiser stated 4,300 attended the flash-mob.<ref name=\"ejinsight20190802\"/>\n\n==== Medical sector ====\n[[File:190802 HK medical sector rally 01.jpg|left|thumb|Medical professionals in the rally on 2 August, with the banner \"Condemn police obstructing rescue operation\" in Chinese.]]\nOn the evening of 2 August, medical professionals held a rally at [[Edinburgh Place]], Central. President of the Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association spoke critically of arrests being made inside hospitals while people are seeking treatment, and also spoke out about excessive use of tear gas by police against democracy activists.<ref name=\"auto23\"/> Organisers estimated 10,000 medical professionals attended the rally.<ref name=\"AutoHY-1\"/>\n\nThis was the third medical sector protest in a week. About 1,500 health care specialists had previously assembled at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei to raise concerns about the [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests#Yuen Long pro-Beijing attacks|coordinated attacks]] of 21 July that occurred in Yuen Long MTR station.<ref name=\"scmp3021240\"/> Medical students and graduates also held an assembly in the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] on 26 July. About 1000 people joined the assembly according to the organisers.<ref name=\"AutoHY-2\"/>\n\n==== Civil servants ====\n[[File:Civil Servants Protest in Chater Garden 20190802.jpg|thumb|civil servant rally on 2 August.]]\n\nShortly after the medical sector rally began at Edinburgh Place, another rally had also started in Chater Garden held by thousands of civil servants.<ref name=scmp3021240/> By 6:45&nbsp;pm the park was already overflowing with people, prompting police to close nearby [[Chater Road]] to traffic.<ref name=\"AutoHY-3\"/> Former [[Chief Secretary for Administration|chief secretary]] [[Anson Chan]] and former [[Secretary for the Civil Service]] [[Joseph Wong]] both urged an independent inquiry into police misconduct and defended freedom of expression, questioning the validity of Chief Secretary [[Matthew Cheung]]'s warning about the risks of joining the rally and \"breaching the principle of political neutrality.\" Wong stated, \"The first line [of the civil service code], which I wrote, is to safeguard the rule of law. Rule of law is higher than our loyalty to any official, any chief executive. No one is above it.\"<ref name=\"auto23\"/>\n\nMusician and activist [[Denise Ho]] also spoke at the rally, and encouraged broad participation at the upcoming 5 August [[general strike]]. Ho said that there was safety in numbers, and that the government is more likely to respond to continuous pressure and indefinite strike actions.<ref name=scmp3021240/> While police estimated attendance of 13,000, the organiser claimed 40,000 civil servants participated at the rally.<ref name=\"scmp3021276\"/>\n\n=== Ma On Shan police station blockades ===\n\n==== 1 August ====\nOn 1 August, a police station in [[Ma On Shan (town)|Ma On Shan]] was surrounded by a large number of protesters demanding the release of demonstrators facing riot charges from the previous week's protest.<ref name=\"AutoL4-88\"/> Photos show protesters hurling bricks that were dug out from pavements towards the police station, shattering windows. At around 3:50&nbsp;am, riot police cleared away the protesters.\n\n==== 2 August ====\nOn 2 August, hundreds gathered in response to police raids and arrests made for possession of protest supplies. At 11&nbsp;pm, a crowd assembled near the Sha Tin police station and constructed barricades. By 1&nbsp;am the protest shifted to the Ma On Shan police station, after word was received that the eight arrested individuals were being held there. Activists attempted to pry open the metal shutters, vandalised building walls, and removed the \"Ma On Shan Police Station\" sign. Riot police arrived on the scene and by 3:15&nbsp;am the crowds had dispersed.<ref name=\"hongkongfp.com\"/>\n\n==== 3 August ====\nOn 3 August, democracy activists again returned to Ma On Shan police station for the second consecutive night.<ref name=\"MOS police station\"/> They demanded the release of the eight arrested protesters, including pro-independence activist [[Chan Ho-tin|Andy Chan Ho-tin]], who had been arrested the day before during a police raid on a building in [[Fo Tan]] and charged on suspicion of offensive weapons.<ref name=\"hongkongfp.com\"/> The group of about 100 protesters banged on the metal shutters, threw [[hell money]] to curse the officers inside, and some painted graffiti messages such as \"[[liberate Hong Kong]]\" and \"all consequences are at your own risk.\" Riot police began clearing the crowds at 10:45&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"MOS police station\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-89\"/> The police attempted to enter [[Park Belvedere]], a private residential building, angering both protesters and residents.<ref name=\"AutoL4-90\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-91\"/> The police also allegedly threw pepper bombs at people on a bridge.<ref name=\"MOS police station\"/>\n\n=== 3 August protests ===\nA planned and approved march started from [[Anchor Street]] Playground at 3:30&nbsp;pm. Protesters in the front of the rally held a banner that read \"Police have too much power\" ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u6b0a\u904e\u5927}}); a popular slogan for the day was \"[[Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time]]\". Marchers urged people to join in the general strike on 5 August. The front of the rally arrived at [[Cherry Street, Hong Kong|Cherry Street]] park at 5&nbsp;pm, but some protesters did not follow the designated route, and headed directly to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui instead; other protesters first arrived at the park and then followed on to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui.<ref name=\"AutoHY-4\"/>\n\nAt around 6:30&nbsp;pm, protesters moved barricades into the toll plaza of the [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] in [[Hung Hom]], blocking vehicles and then disappeared. Around 9:30&nbsp;pm, riot police fired tear gas on protesters in both Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. Several arrests were made.<ref name=\"AutoHY-5\"/> A small group of protesters also removed the Chinese flag near the [[Star Ferry]] pier in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] and threw it into [[Victoria Harbour]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-6\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-7\"/>\n\nAfter having received multiple shots of tear gas, protesters moved to the police station at [[Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong|Wong Tai Sin]], then left via MTR. Riot police followed and arrested several alleged protesters in the [[Wong Tai Sin Station]]. However, the presence of riot police officers angered nearby residents, who requested police to release those arrested and leave the district. They threw umbrellas and set off fire extinguishers. Shortly after, police officers fired tear gas at residents to disperse the crowd, which then went to protest at the nearby police station and Disciplined Services quarters. Dormitory residents showered residents and protesters with sticks, glass bottles and firecrackers from the building. After multiple shots of tear gas, protesters retreated and occupied [[Lung Cheung Road]], then dispersed after.<ref name=\"AutoHY-8\"/>\n\nAt the same time, multiple protesters surrounded Mong Kok Police Station. Riot police also arrived shortly and arrested protesters. Some of those arrested stated that they were only passers-by or local residents, and not protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-9\"/> Two foreign nationals, a Filipino and a South Korean, were arrested by authorities who suspects their involvement in the protest. The Filipino was [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] employee who was wearing black at the time of his arrest and the South Korean a restaurant worker. This is believed to be the first arrests of expatriates since the escalation of the protest in June.<ref name=\"AutoHY-10\"/>\n\n[[File:190804 HK protest Causeway Bay.jpg|thumb|Protesters in Causeway Bay on 4 August.]]\n\n=== 4 August protests ===\nThe demonstrations on 4 August began with a permitted march in [[Tseung Kwan O]], starting from [[Po Tsui Park]] at 2&nbsp;pm, with organisers stating around 150,000 protesters in attendance.<ref name=\"AutoHY-11\"/> During the rally, protesters threw bricks towards the police station breaking windows. They chanted \"Hong Kong police knowingly break the law\" and \"Shame on the corrupt police\". Police officers then appeared with police dogs and protesters dispersed. At night, the crowds occupied Po Shun Road. Riot police arrived to disperse crowds, and they unreasonably attacked a passer-by.<ref name=\"flee\"/>\n\nAnother rally appeared in [[Kennedy Town]] after the Tseung Kwan O rally.<ref name=\"AutoHY-12\"/> By the evening, protesters defied the police ban and marched towards Sheung Wan. However, by about 7&nbsp;pm police deployed tear gas canisters and routed the group to Causeway Bay, where thousands of protesters setup blockades and occupied areas of the shopping district. Then again by 10&nbsp;pm riot police attempted to clear the streets with the use of tear gas.<ref name=\"AutoHY-13\"/>\n\nNear the end of the Kennedy Town protest, some protesters went and blocked the [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] and a small group of protesters sprayed graffiti on the sculpture at the [[Golden Bauhinia Square]].<ref name=\"August 4 locations\"/> At the same time, a group of protesters gathered at Wong Tai Sin police station, protesting their way of force to the residents in the 3 August protest. Fearing that the police may deploy heavy force following 3 August scuffles, some protesters opted to occupy sections in [[Ngau Tau Kok]] and [[Kwun Tong]].<ref name=\"August 4 locations\"/> At night, various protests and police operations were done in [[Mei Foo]], Wong Tai Sin, Tin Shui Wai, Ma On Shan, and [[Lam Tin]]. [[Eastern Harbour Crossing]] and [[Tseung Kwan O Tunnel]] were temporarily blocked during the protests.<ref name=\"flee\"/>\n\n=== 5 August general strike ===\nThere was a city-wide general strike on 5 August, with protests and sit-ins in different districts. The [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] was affected by street blockades, major roadways were obstructed and train lines stalled, as thousands of workers across 20 different sectors participated, putting pressure on the government to meet protesters demands.<ref name=\"AutoHY-14\"/> At least seven major rallies and organising assemblies were held throughout areas of Hong Kong. The main rallies took place in [[Tamar Park]] in Admiralty, [[Sha Tin Town Hall]], [[Tuen Mun Park]], [[Discovery Park (Hong Kong)|Discovery Park]] in Tsuen Wan, [[Wong Tai Sin]] Square, MacPherson Playground in [[Mong Kok]] and Tin Hau Temple Fung Shui Square in [[Tai Po]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-15\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-16\"/> \n\nWorkers from various industries as well as several trade unions had announced in advance that they would join the strike.<ref name=\"AutoHY-17\"/> The government of Hong Kong issued a statement, urging citizens to not participate in the strike as it would \"undermine further the local economy that is facing downside risks.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-18\"/> Employees at Hong Kong Disneyland announced work stoppages.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Many air traffic controllers called in sick, and over 200 flights were cancelled while only one of the airport runways was operational.<ref name=\"AutoHY-19\"/>\n\nCarrie Lam held a press conference at 10&nbsp;am, condemning those who joined the strike, and stated that they are \"destroying Hong Kong\". She continued to support the police force and rejected the five demands by protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-20\"/> Pro-Beijing legislator [[Ann Chiang]] voiced her disappointment towards Lam's speech with a Facebook post, stating that Lam had raised many issues but offered no solutions.<ref name=\"AutoHY-21\"/> Meanwhile, the [[Hang Seng Index]] started to drop during Lam's conference and fell 2.9% by the midday break.<ref name=\"AutoHY-22\"/>\n\nIn the evening, protesters near the [[North Point]] neighbourhood and [[Tsuen Wan]] were attacked by two groups of stick wielding men, some wearing white shirts and another group in professionally printed blue shirts.<ref name=\"AutoHY-23\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-24\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-25\"/> The scuffles were brief but unexpected, and similar in nature to the 21 July [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests#Yuen Long pro-Beijing attacks|Yuen Long attacks]]. However, unlike the Yuen Long attacks, protesters fought back.<ref name=\"AutoHY-26\"/> Later in the night several police stations were blockaded by protesters and vandalised.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Police arrested 148 people by the end of the day.<ref name=\"AutoHY-27\"/> To disperse the protesters, the police force used more than 800 canisters of tear gas, a record number for Hong Kong, in 14 out of 18 districts in Hong Kong. As the police used tear gas in close proximity to many densely populated residential areas, many residents, children, and pets were affected.<ref name=\"AutoHY-28\"/>\n\nOn 6 August, Chairwoman Carol Ng of the [[Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions|Confederation of Trade Unions]] stated: \"If there is still no proper response from the government ... I presume it is possible to have another strike.\" The HKCTU helped to organise the 5 August general strike. They estimate 350,000 people had joined the strike. About 290,000 attended protests and rallies city-wide, while the remainder stayed home and away from work that day.<ref name=\"AutoHY-29\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:20190806 Flight Information of CX and KA at PVG.jpg|Flights cancelled by [[Cathay Pacific]] shown in a notice board in [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]].\nFile:190805 HK general strike VOA 02.jpg|A restaurant in [[Wah Fu Estate]] participated the general strike.\nFile:New Town Plaza Entrance Arena people 20190805.jpg|Protesters inside [[New Town Plaza]], one of the seven locations for the main rallies on August 5.\nFile:190805 HK general strike VOA 04.jpg|Strikers near the [[Sogo Hong Kong|Sogo Department Store]] on [[Yee Wo Street]].

Protesters threw eggs at the police while the police used tear gas to disperse the protesters.<ref name=\"AutoL4-93\"/> Legislator [[Helena Wong (politician)|Helena Wong]] condemned the police over the treatment of the protester, calling the arrest \"extremely disrespectful of women\". Responding to the criticism, Yolanda Yu, senior superintendent said that the protester was \"struggling vigorously\" and therefore required male police officers to subdue her.<ref name=\"AutoL4-94\"/>\n\n=== Solidarity protest of laser pointer arrest ===\n\n==== 6 August ====\n[[File:190807 HK laser pen protest Incendo 02.jpg|thumb|left|Hundreds gathered at [[Hong Kong Space Museum]] with their laser pointers in protest of selective legal enforcement and the arrest of Fong. 7 August 2019]]\nIn the afternoon of 6 August, [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] student union president Keith Fong was arrested in [[Apliu Street]], [[Sham Shui Po]] district. Plainclothes officers said that they approached him as \"he was acting suspiciously\". Fong ran away but was caught. He was searched and 10 [[laser pointers]], were found in a plastic bag. Fong stated that he purchased those laser pointers for stargazing, while passers-by supported him and chanted \"release him\". However, police officers arrested him for \"possession of offensive weapon\". Fong then complained of feeling unwell after he was choked by the officers and was taken to [[Caritas Medical Centre]]. His parents, along with Baptist University principal [[Roland Chin]] and lawyers, went to the hospital to visit him.<ref name=\"AutoL4-95\"/> Chin asked the police ensure students are treated fairly.<ref name=\"AutoL4-96\"/>\n\nThe student union and other citizens voiced their anger, condemning police for their abuse of power and described it as part of a broader campaign to intimidate and silence democracy activists. They questioned how laser pointers could become an \"[[offensive weapon]]\", a police representative responded in a press conference that several police officers in previous protests were injured due to laser beams that were pointed at them. At night, around 300 protesters gathered outside [[Sham Shui Po Police Station]], chanting \"[[Triad (organized crime)|triads]]\" and \"mafia cops.\" Police fired several tear gas to disperse the crowd, and arrested several protesters, including [[Sha Tin District Council]]or Wong Hok-lai, for \"unlawful assembly\".<ref name=\"Hong Kong Free Press HKFP\"/>\n\n==== 7 August ====\n[[File:20190807 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protest (48480850197).jpg|thumb|Protesters pointing their laser pointer to a newspaper held, mocking the police's demonstration. 6 August 2019]]\nOn 7 August, a group of teachers and staff members from HKBU held a press conference supporting Fong and condemning police's excessive force. They stated that the arrest is \"unexplainable\" and question the selective police enforcement with \"unreasonable definition of offensive weapon\". They also said that the freedom granted by the Basic Law is shaken by the police's action.<ref name=\"AutoL4-97\"/>\n\nIn a police press conference in the afternoon, police representatives stated that the laser pointers he purchased were in fact \"[[laser guns]].\" They attempted to demonstrate the \"laser gun\" Fong purchased is able to burn a hole in a paper by pointing it to a black area of a newspaper and holding it steadily for 20 seconds at very short distance.<ref name=\"AutoL4-98\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-99\"/> According to ''Stand News'', hundreds of shoppers have since been searching for laser pointers with many shops completely sold out.<ref name=\"AutoL4-100\"/>\n\nAt night, a group of protesters gathered at [[Hong Kong Space Museum]] and shined laser pointers on the wall of the museum, some chanted slogans like \"laser pointer revolution\" and joked \"Is the building on fire yet?\" They hoped to show support to Fong and voice condemnation of his arrest by police, and to show that laser pointers are neither offensive weapons nor effective enough to cause a fire. Protesters also sang the song \"I Am Angry\" from Cantopop band [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]].<ref name=\"https\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-101\"/>\n\nFong was detained 48 hours without any criminal charges, and then released on 8 August.<ref name=\"AutoL4-102\"/>\n\n=== 7 August lawyers' silent march ===\n[[File:190807 HK lawyer second march.jpg|thumb|Thousands of lawyers marched in black against the selective prosecution by the [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] on 7 August 2019.]]\nA silent march by lawyers was staged on 7 August, the second one since [[#6 June lawyers' silent march|6 June]]. Around 3,000 legal sector professionals, in black, marched in silence from the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] in Central to the [[Former Central Government Offices|Department of Justice's office]] at around 12:45&nbsp;pm.\n\nThe group of protesters stated that [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]] frequently departed from usual procedures and well-established guidelines, and accused Cheng of bias in selecting prosecution cases. They quoted the difference in prosecuting the arrest of anti-extradition bill protesters as \"rioting\", versus prosecuting the arrests in the [[2019 Yuen Long violence|Yuen Long incident]] as \"unlawful assembly.\" Furthermore, the rioting charges against the anti-extradition bill protesters were fast-tracked ahead of prosecution of the perpetrators of the Yuen Long violence, which occurred weeks before the protesters were arrested. Barrister Kevin Yam stated \"All we want is justice, all we want is consistency, we don't want to see thugs get away while the best of our youth get prosecuted.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-30\"/> They believed that this was the latest evidence of a decline of the rule of law.\n\nCampaigners voiced concern over the use of excessive force and asked for an independent commission of inquiry. Teresa Cheng refused to meet the lawyers when they arrived at her office.<ref name=\"AutoHY-31\"/>\n\n=== 8 August Catholics march ===\n\nOn Thursday night, around 1200 Catholics held a candlelight march through Central before finishing outside the Court of Final Appeal. The march organised by four Christian organisations, called for the government to heed to the protesters demands and called for both sides to exercise restraint, stop the violence and sit down to reach an agreement to help society move forward.<ref name=\"AutoHY-32\"/>\n\n=== 9\u201311 August airport sit-ins ===\n\nA second airport sit-in was held in the [[Hong Kong International Airport]], which continued for three consecutive days.<ref name=\"AutoHY-33\"/> Protesters hoped to gain international support by having a \"warm welcome.\" Unlike previous sit-ins, this demonstration was not approved by the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]]. Extra security measures were put in place, with authorities preventing anyone without a boarding pass from entering the check-in area.<ref name=\"AutoHY-34\"/>\n\nThousands gathered in both Terminal 1 and 2 by 6&nbsp;pm. Dressed in black, democracy activists handed out leaflets and pamphlets to tourists in several languages, including English, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Spanish, and German. A large banner reading \"Liberate HK\" was also unfurled from the second floor balcony.<ref name=\"AutoHY-35\"/> Demonstrators chanted and sang [[Do You Hear the People Sing?]]<ref name=\"AutoHY-36\"/>\n\nDue to the protests, all flights in and out of the airport were cancelled since Monday (12 August). The protest was said to have disrupted as a result of the public assembly at the airport.<ref name=\"AutoHY-37\"/>\n\n=== 9-14 August Paper-burning protests ===\nA paper-burning protest was held in [[Wong Tai Sin]] and [[Sha Tin]], in line with traditional Chinese customs during the [[Ghost Festival]]. Protesters burnt [[joss paper]] and threw [[hell money]] and attempted to light a bundle of [[incense stick]]s using laser pointers. They also threw hell money with Carrie Lam's face and a paper doll representing [[Junius Ho]] into a burning bin. 5 people were arrested by the police in Wong Tai Sin.<ref name=\"AutoL4-103\"/><ref name=\"AutoL4-104\"/>\n\nAnother paper-burning protest was held in [[Sham Shui Po]]. Similarly, protesters burnt joss papers and images showing the faces of Carrie Lam and Police Commissioner [[Stephen Lo]] outside the Sham Shui Po police station. The protest was largely peaceful. The police then dispersed the protesters by shooting tear gas inside the police building complex and deploying riot police.<ref name=\"AutoL4-105\"/> Another similar protest was held in [[Tin Shui Wai]], in which riot police arrested 5 protesters.<ref name=\"AutoL4-106\"/>\n\n=== 10 August protests ===\nTwo generally peaceful protests occurred on [[Hong Kong Island]]. Early in the morning, hundreds of senior citizens marched from [[Wan Chai]] police HQ to Chief Executive's Office and handed out petition letters requesting the police to \"lay down their offensive weapons\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-38\"/> The protest was followed by a family rally named \"Guard our children's future\" in [[Edinburgh Place]]. Hundreds of parents showed up with their kids to demand the government to respond to the demands of the protesters. The parents then marched to the Government HQ and displayed banners drawn by children and balloons.<ref name=\"AutoHY-39\"/>\n\nLess than a thousand protesters protested in [[Tai Po]] in the afternoon despite a police ban on the protest. Protesters gathered in Tai Po bus station and marched past the original destination, Kwong Fuk Road Football Ground. It was generally peaceful. Protesters chanted slogans including \"liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" and \"our five demands must all be fulfilled\", and yelled \"rubbish\" and \"triad\" at the police. Around 6&nbsp;pm, as the protesters were surrounded by the police, they moved to [[Tai Wai]] and [[New Town Plaza]] in Sha Tin and obstructed various locations, though protesters in Tai Wai dispersed after the police used tear gas.<ref name=\"AutoHY-40\"/> \n\nThe protesters then moved to different districts in Hong Kong, including [[Kowloon Bay]], [[Kwun Tong]], [[Tsuen Wan]], and [[Wong Tai Sin]], but they dispersed before the riot police began to advance. The [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] was blocked temporarily. In [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], tension rose when a police officer arrested a bystander. Protesters besieged the police station, and the police used tear gas to disperse the protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-41\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:190810 HK family protest 01.jpg|Family rally with parents and kids to urge government to respond to the demands.\nFile:190810 HK family protest 02.jpg|Kids drawing and writing their wishes and vision of the future of Hong Kong.\nFile:190810 HK Protest Incendo 21.jpg|Protesters at Tai Po on 10 August 2019.\nFile:190810 HK Protest Incendo 20.jpg|Stand-off between protesters and police in Tai Po.\nFile:190810 HK Protest Incendo 23.jpg|Riot police showing the \"blue flag\", warning protesters to disperse.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 11 August protests ===\nDespite a police ban on the protest, thousands marched in the [[Sham Shui Po]] region at 2&nbsp;pm. Demonstrators marched from Maple Street Playground, set up roadblocks on Yam Chow Street, [[Cheung Sha Wan Road]] and besieged the [[Sham Shui Po Police Station]]. At 5&nbsp;pm, the police dispersed protesters using tear gas, though some tear gas canisters landed on a pedestrian footbridge nearby, affecting both journalists and residents. Democracy activists moved on and besieged the police station in Tsim Sha Tsui. The police set up a defence line near the Lane Shopper's Boulevard district and fired [[bean bag round]]s that ruptured the right eye of a female protestor.<ref name=\"taikoo\"/><ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/> \n\nAt 8&nbsp;pm, protesters moved to [[Kwai Chung]] and besieged the Kwai Chung police station. Riot police dispersed the protesters. Demonstrators fled to [[Kwai Fong station]] and television footage showed police had fired tear gas and several rounds of rubber bullets from inside the station.<ref name=\"AutoHY-42\"/> Some protesters retreated to [[Mei Foo]] station and set up roadblocks on [[Kwai Chung Road]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-43\"/> while another group besieged the police station again.<ref name=\"now live\"/> Traces of irritant smoke were still found inside Kwai Fong station the following day. [[MTR Corporation]], responding to the incident, said that it was \"very regretful\" and urged the police force to consider the safety of its staff and commuters during law enforcement actions.<ref name=\"AutoHY-44\"/>\n\nAn approved gathering was held in [[Victoria Park (Hong Kong)|Victoria Park]] at 1&nbsp;pm, though the police issued a Letter of Rejection to a protest that was to be held in the [[Eastern District, Hong Kong|Eastern District]]. However, some protesters occupied major roads and intersections near the [[Sogo Hong Kong]] department store in Causeway Bay, while some moved along to [[Wan Chai]], where a [[molotov cocktail]] was thrown during clashes with police.<ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/> Red banners were seen posted throughout the North Point region, calling for [[Fujian]]ese residents to defend their neighbourhood.<ref name=\"AutoHY-45\"/> Protesters had largely avoided marching to [[North Point]], where democracy activists were previously assaulted by stick-wielding men, allegedly the local Fujianese residents, during the 5 August general strike. However, tensions rose in the region when locals dressed in red attacked two journalists and two other people.<ref name=\"AutoHY-46\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-47\"/>\n[[File:190811 HK protest Causeway Bay.jpg|thumb|Protesters in Causeway Bay on 11 August 2019.]]\nIn [[Causeway Bay]], several people disguised as protesters were seen and caught on video tackling and arresting other protesters with the help of the police force at 10&nbsp;pm. Around ten men dressed as protesters were seen and caught on video passing from under a staircase at a tramstop guarded by the police. This led to allegations that the police used undercover officers to infiltrate into the demonstration. When journalists approached one of these men, he refused to show his warrant card and told the press to \"put down the camera.\"<ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/> During a police press conference on 12 August, Deputy Police Commissioner Tang Ping-Keung defended the use of disguised \"decoy officers\" and stated: \"I can say that during the time when our police officers were disguised ... they [did not] provoke anything. We won't ask them to stir up trouble.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-48\"/> According to one eyewitness, one of these men threw a molotov cocktail.{{cn|date=August 2019}} The violent arrest of a young man was filmed\u2014he was pressed by more than one undercover police officer to the concrete road with so much force on his head that he lost at least one front tooth. The protester is not seen to have been resisting arrest and is heard apologising in the video, begging for mercy, and yet the police rubbed his face on the rough concrete road, leaving him with a blood-covered face.<ref name=\"AutoHY-49\"/> The arrest of another protester, during which a police officer was found putting a stick inside his backpack, was filmed. The police force was accused of planting evidence to frame the protester. The police defended the tactic, saying that the protester had held the stick before he was arrested.<ref name=\"AutoHY-50\"/>\n\nSome protesters then moved to [[Quarry Bay Station]] and a brief standoff with police followed.<ref name=\"now live\"/> The Special Tactical Unit then chased democracy activists down an escalator in [[Tai Koo Station]] and fired guns with pepper ball rounds, targeting protesters within a very close range and aiming directly at their heads.<ref name=\"AutoHY-51\"/> Police officers were also filmed by journalists and seen using their batons to beat fleeing protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-52\"/> The Civil Rights Observer organisation condemned police actions due excessive use of force and the possibility of causing a [[stampede]].<ref name=\"taikoo\"/>\n\nFurther conflicts occurred when protesters besieged the [[Sha Tin]] police station.<ref name=\"brief shatin conflict\"/> Disgruntled by aggressive policing strategies and excessive use of force, residents in [[Sha Tin]],<ref name=\"brief shatin conflict\"/> [[Quarry Bay]], [[Sai Wan Ho]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-53\"/> [[Taikoo Shing]],<ref name=\"now live\"/> and [[Whampoa Garden]]<ref name=\"August 11 protest\"/> gathered to drive off the police away from their neighbourhoods and homes. In [[Tsuen Wan]], pedestrians were assaulted by men wearing white shirts.<ref name=\"AutoHY-54\"/>\n\nBy the end of the night, police had made dozens of arrests following the numerous flash-mob style police station blockades and in the many clashes during city-wide street protests that day.<ref name=\"AutoHY-55\"/> The escalation in arrests and new more assertive police tactics come within days of the Hong Kong Police Force bringing back from retirement Alan Lau Yip-shing, a former top officer who oversaw police strategy during the [[Umbrella Movement]] and [[2016 Mong Kok civil unrest|Mong Kok Fishball Revolution]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-56\"/> On 8 August, Lau was appointed deputy commissioner on special duty for a period of six months. Beginning on 9 August, Lau met with all top brass to discuss strategy and was charged with assisting the police commissioner to \"enhance strategic command and oversee [large-scale] public order events.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-57\"/>\n\nThe Hospital Authority reported that due to the events of 11 August, as many as 54 people were being treated for injuries, with two in serious condition.<ref name=\"AutoHY-58\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-59\"/>\n\n=== 12\u201314 August police brutality protests ===\n\nThe events of 11 August had sparked controversy, as several protesters, including a woman that was allegedly shot in the eye by the police, were seriously injured by police actions that day. A demonstration against police brutality was organised in response and held at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 12 August.<ref name=\"AutoHY-60\"/> Sit-ins and roving protests began by 1&nbsp;pm, as thousands of people turned up to speak out about police violence. Many held signs and chanted slogans such as \"police go back to China\" and \"evil police eye for an eye\", while some protesters organised mobile \"[[Lennon_Wall#Lennon_Walls_in_Hong_Kong|Lennon Wall]]\" on their bodies during the protests. Due to the large amount of protesters going to the airport, the traffic to the airport was congested. At around 3&nbsp;pm, the thousands of protesters had exceeded the capacity of the two main arrival halls, and the overflow of incoming protesters then congregated in the departure halls. As many as 5,000 democracy activists may have been involved in the demonstrations.<ref name=\"AutoHY-61\"/> By 4&nbsp;pm, the Airport Authority announced that all other flights had been cancelled for the rest of the day, except for departure flights that had completed the check-in process, and the arrival flights already heading to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"AutoHY-62\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-63\"/> At the same time, there were rumours and news about the arrival of riot police and the clearance of the airport. Most protesters then left, while some stayed with the remaining travellers who were stuck in the airport.<ref name=\"AutoHY-64\"/>\n\nOn 13 August, protesters demonstrated again at Hong Kong International Airport as the airport reopened following the airport's closure from the day prior. Protesters had used luggage trolleys as physical defence for themselves during Tuesday's protest at the airport. Passengers struggled to get through the airport as protesters had blocked the path to the gating area. As a result of the continued protests, at 4:30&nbsp;pm, Hong Kong airport officials announced that check-ins were suspended for the remainder of the day at least.<ref name=\"AutoHY-65\"/> Members of British [[pop rock]] band [[The Vamps (British band)|The Vamps]] became stranded at the airport due to the protests. In an interview from the airport with ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' on 13 August, the band publicly expressed their support for the protesters.<ref name=\"AutoHY-66\"/>\n\nOn the same day, protesters cornered a man suspected of being a mainland security officer.<ref name=\"AutoHY-67\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-68\"/> The man was severely beaten, and was taken away a few hours later by the police.<ref name=\"AutoHY-69\"/> Shortly afterward, another man with a press vest was questioned by protesters about whether he was truly a reporter. He was seen taking photos of protesters' faces and told protesters he is actually a \"traveller\". Protesters gathered around him and requested him to show his press passes, though he refused. Protesters then discovered a blue T-shirt with the words \"I Love Hong Kong Police\", which was identical to the shirts attackers wore in an attack before. His Chinese passport, identity card, and diary were also taken. Protesters tied him up and he was then taken away by first-aiders. He was later identified as Fu Guohao, a ''[[Global Times]]'' journalist.<ref name=\"AutoHY-70\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-71\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-72\"/> The violence against Fu Guohao has been condemned by the Program Director of [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], Carlos Martinez de la Serna, who stated that \"Journalists from all outlets must be allowed to cover the demonstrations in Hong Kong without having to fear for their safety.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-73\"/> HKJA also condemned the violence and urged reporters from Chinese media outlets to display their credentials clearly to avoid similar incidents from happening again.<ref name=\"AutoHY-74\"/> Protesters then offered apologies after the incidents.<ref name=\"AutoHY-75\"/>\n\nOn 14 August, the court has issued an interim [[injunction]] to restrict the protests inside the airport. Some continued to protest but they stayed inside the areas allowed by the [[Airport Authority]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-76\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Hong Kong IMG 20190812 165826 (48520207136).jpg|Protesters in the arrival halls in the [[Hong Kong International Airport]].\nFile:Hong Kong IMG 20190812 165740 (48520378377).jpg|Protesters handing leaflets and showing signs to tourists arriving Hong Kong.\nFile:Hong Kong IMG 20190812 170957 (48520377932).jpg|Protesters waving \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" flag.\nFile:Hong Kong IMG 20190812 172601-edit (48520206541).jpg|Signs held by protesters.\nFile:Hong Kong IMG 20190812 171204 (48520377812).jpg|Flights cancelled due to protest events.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 12\u201314 August hospital staff protests ===\nOn 12 August, about 100 medical professionals at the [[Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital]] in [[Chai Wan]] demonstrated against abuses of power by police during the recent protests, in which one woman was struck in the eye by an allegedly police projectile and seriously wounded.<ref name=\"AutoHY-77\"/> Medical staff held a banner that read \"Hong Kong police attempt to murder Hong Kong citizens.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-78\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-79\"/> A similar protest by medical staff was held that same day at [[Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong|Princess Margaret Hospital]] in [[Lai Chi Kok]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-80\"/>\n\nAnother demonstration was held on 13 August, by health care workers in at least 7 public hospitals, including [[Prince of Wales Hospital]], [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]], [[Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Mary Hospital]], and [[Tuen Mun Hospital]]. Demonstrators wore black in solidarity with the on-going democracy movement.<ref name=\"AutoHY-81\"/> Demonstrators covered their right eyes with gauze to support the female protester whose right eye was shot by the police. A doctor at the [[Tuen Mun Hospital]] protest stated that these solidarity rallies were a \"direct response\" to the shooting of that woman on 11 August.<ref name=\"AutoHY-82\"/> These protests were held during lunch breaks and hospital operations were not affected.<ref name=\"AutoHY-83\"/>\n\nOn 14 August, hospital staffs from [[Ruttonjee Hospital]] and [[Tang Shiu Kin Hospital]] joined the protest. A total of 15 public hospitals have held protests since the 11 August incident.<ref name=\"15 hospitals\"/> On the same day, people wearing red T-shirts harassed the medical staffs at [[Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong|Princess Margaret Hospital]], where the injured journalist Fu Guohao was hospitalised.<ref name=\"AutoHY-84\"/>\n\nAlso on 12 August, a group of front-line medical workers called for an indefinite strike, requesting that the government respond to the five demands of the protest movement.<ref name=\"AutoHY-85\"/> A total of 15 public hospitals have held protests since the 11 August incident.<ref name=\"15 hospitals\"/>\n\n=== 16 August rally ===\nThe Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs Delegation, an association composed of students from the 12 local universities and colleges, held a rally named \"Stand with Hong Kong \u2013 Power to the People\" in [[Charter Garden]]. Protesters asked the US and the UK to provide assistance and urged both governments to enact sanction on the officials responsible for causing the protests.<ref name=\"AutoHY-86\"/> Exiled activists, including [[Ray Wong]] Toi-yeung and Brian Leung Kai-ping recorded video messages for the crowds. Organisers claimed that 60,000 people attended, though the police put the figure at 7,100.<ref name=\"AutoHY-87\"/>\n\n=== 17 August teachers march ===\nThe [[Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union]] organised a march named \"Safeguard the next generation, let our conscience speak\" to support Hong Kong students and show solidarity to the arrestees. Despite heavy rain, thousands of teacher wearing black marched from [[Charter Garden]] to [[Government House]]. HKPTU claimed that 22,000 people attended, while the police put the figure at 8,300.<ref name=\"AutoHY-88\"/>\n\n=== 17 August Reclaim To Kwa Wan-Hung Hom ===\nThe protest was initially set to be held on 27 July, though it was later moved to 17 August to prevent clashing with \"Reclaim Yuen Long\".<ref name=\"AutoL4-107\"/> The police initially banned the protest, though they approved when it adopted a shorter route. Protesters marched from [[Hoi Sham Park]] to [[Whampoa station]] to call the government to solve the community issues brought by an excessive number of mainland tourists in the region and condemn police brutality. The branch offices of pro-Beijing parties [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong|DAB]] and [[HKFTU]] were vandalised, and protesters hurled eggs at the offices. Protesters placed pineapples, a slang for homemade explosives, outside HKFTU's office, reflecting their role during the [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]].<ref name=\"DAB FTU\"/> Some protesters marched back to To Kwa Wan and [[Kowloon City]] and occupied sections of Ma Tau Wai Road and [[To Kwa Wan Road]].<ref name=\"AutoL4-108\"/> Some protesters also moved to [[Mong Kok]], [[Jordan, Hong Kong|Jordan]] and [[Yau Ma Tei]] and besieged the Mong Kok police station. Overall, approximately 20,000 joined the rally.<ref name=\"DAB FTU\"/>\n\n=== 18 August rally ===\nThe [[Civil Human Rights Front]] initially applied to hold a march, though only a rally in [[Victoria Park (Hong Kong)|Victoria Park]] was approved. The march was called to condemn police brutality and reiterate the five core demands after the 11 August incident. Due to the sheer number of people showing up, MTR's trains skipped [[Causeway Bay station]], [[Tin Hau station]] and [[Fortress Hill station]]. A massive amount of protesters waited on [[Hennessy Road]], [[Gloucester Road, Hong Kong|Gloucester Road]], and [[Kings Road]] for hours to get into the park. At 3:29&nbsp;pm, former Legislative Councilors [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] led the protesters towards [[Charter Garden]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], the march's original end point, along [[Hennessy Road]] in defiance of the police's ban. Protesters soon spilled over onto [[Yee Wo Street]], Pennington Street, Jardine's Bazaar and [[Lockhart Road]]. [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] was forced to cancel all routes crossing the [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]].<ref name=\"chrf august 18\"/> Near the end of the rally, protesters briefly occupied sections of [[Harcourt Road]] outside the Government Headquarters, though some protesters called the people who stayed to go home to ensure that the protest can end peacefully.<ref name=\"chrf august 18\"/>\n\nAccording to CHRF, 1.7&nbsp;million protesters attended the rally and an additional estimated of 300,000 protesters marched between Central and Causeway Bay, but could not enter the park due to overcrowding. The police put the figure at 128,000 at peak of those only in Victoria Park football areas. According to Bonnie Leung, CHRF's vice convenor, the high turnout rate had \"revitalized\" the campaign against the extradition law, and that should Carrie Lam not respond to protesters' demands, her administration will face tougher and more radical measures from protesters. The association also intended to apply for a [[judicial review]] questioning the police's unjustifiable ban. The government recognised that the protest was largely peaceful, though it criticised the marchers for inconveniencing the public as they occupied major roads on Hong Kong Island during the march.<ref name=\"AutoHY-89\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 195858.jpg|Protesters inside Victoria Park for the rally by [[Civil Human Rights Front]].\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 190715 (1).jpg|Protesters in Causeway Bay, outside [[Sogo]] Department Store, that could not enter the park.\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 165749.jpg|Hundreds of protesters on the streets in Causeway Bay that could not enter the park.\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 202037.jpg|Protesters in Wan Chai after leaving the rally.\nFile:Hong Kong protests - IMG 20190818 204524.jpg|Protesters near the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] after the rally.\nFile:190818 HK protesters make way for ambulance.jpg|Protesters making way for ambulance.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 21 August Yuen Long sit-in ===\n\nThousands of demonstrators staged a sit-in protest inside [[Yuen Long station]] to demand justice and to remember the victims of the 21 July [[2019 Yuen Long attack|Yuen Long mob attacks]] at the night of 21 August.<ref name=\"AutoHY-90\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-91\"/> Protesters sat silently in the station, and stood up for a moment of silence every hour. Some protesters also covered their right eyes to remember the victim whose right eye was ruptured during the 11 August protest.<ref name=\"AutoHY-92\"/> Protesters and the police began a brief stand-off near the end of the sit-in. Protesters sprayed a firehose and threw soaps on the floor while making makeshift blockades to slow police's advance. Both protesters and the police retreated peacefully later.<ref name=\"AutoHY-93\"/>\n\n=== 22 August secondary school students demonstration ===\n\nAt Edinburgh Place in Central, near City Hall, thousands of secondary school students gathered to oppose the extradition bill legislation.<ref name=\"AutoHY-94\"/> Near the end of the rally, many students chanted \"September 2, class boycott!\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-95\"/> in reference to the planned strikes set to begin on the first day of classes.<ref name=\"AutoHY-96\"/>\n\n=== 23 August accountants march ===\nIn the afternoon, around 5,000 accountants marched silently from [[Charter Garden]] to the Governemnt HQ.

During the march, protesters expressed concerns about recently installed [[Smart device|smart]] lampposts enabled with facial recognition and video surveillance capabilities. Many worried that the lampposts would be used to further restrict freedom in Hong Kong, as China continues to tighten its grip. During the protest, one of these smart lampposts was knocked down and dismantled.<ref name=\"AutoHY-105\"/>\n\nAt around 4:15&nbsp;pm, protesters began to occupy sections of Wai Yip Street near Ngau Tau Kok Police Station and hurled objects at the police, while the police responded by using tear gas, beanbag rounds and pepper balls to disperse the protesters. Some protesters then retreated to [[Telford Garden]] and sprayed water hose at officers, and the police used tear gas and sponge grenade in return.<ref name=\"AutoHY-106\"/> [[Kwun Tong Road]] was briefly occupied by both the police and the protesters. At night, protesters moved to [[Wong Tai Sin]], [[Lok Fu]] and [[Sham Shui Po]].<ref name=\"Kwun Tong protest\"/>\n\nBefore the protest began, MTR suddenly announced that stations between the proposed march area, [[Choi Hung station]] and [[Tiu Keng Leng station]], would be closed, and claimed the move was necessary to protect MTR facilities and staff safety. Many criticised this decision as an act to restrict freedom of protest, and that by closing these stations, MTR had caused greater disturbance to the public. MTR also arranged special trains for the officers. Protesters criticised MTR for co-operating with the police and called it the \"railway of the Communist Party\".<ref name=\"Kwun Tong protest\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-107\"/>\n\nFollowing the Kwun Tong protest, [[Richland Gardens]]'s management suddenly changed the passcodes for all buildings. People wearing black and residents who were not carrying the resident card could not enter their homes. Disgruntled residents then surrounded the management office. Security guards called the police, who arrested two residents and used pepper spray on the crowds.<ref name=\"AutoHY-108\"/>\n\nThe march's organiser, Ventus Lau, was arrested for \"unlawful assembly\" after the protest, even though the police has already approved the march.<ref name=\"Richland\"/>\n\n=== 25 August Tsuen Wan protest ===\nThe march was held in the [[Kwai Tsing District]] and the [[Tsuen Wan District]]. Similar to the Kwun Tong protest, the police lifted the ban after the organisers changed the route of the protest. On 25 August, thousands of protesters marched from [[Kwai Chung Sports Ground]] to [[Tsuen Wan Park]]. MTR also closed [[Kwai Fong station]], [[Tsuen Wan station]] and [[Tsuen Wan West station]] tempoarily.<ref name=\"AutoHY-109\"/>\n\nNear Yeung Uk Road, some protesters occupied a section of Yeung Uk Road and created makeshift roadblocks. The police used tear gas to disperse protesters, who threw petrol bombs. The police also deployed two specialised crowd management vehicles equipped with [[water cannon]], firing it twice in the span of one hour. This was the first time the trucks were deployed.<ref name=\"Stand News\"/> The march ended abruptly, but the protests spread to different districts around the city. Several protestors damaged a Fujianese owned [[mahjong]] school in Yi Pei Square,<ref name=\"AutoHY-110\"/><ref name=standnews25August/> claiming the school are associated with the previous knife attacks in Tsuen Wan.<ref name=\"standnews25August\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-111\"/>\n\nThe first usage of live bullets during the protests occurred on this day.

Police later explained that they had no choice after being surrounded by protesters, but some residents questioned whether their action was necessary.<ref name=\"washingtonpostwarningshot\"/> One man with an umbrella knelt in front of an advancing police officer who had drawn a gun, in an effort to persuade the officer not to shoot. The man was kicked by the officer.<ref name=\"AutoHY-112\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-113\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-114\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-115\"/> Hong Kong police had responded by saying that the officer used his leg to \"push him away\".<ref name=\"KT and TW\"/> \n\nThe protest later spread to [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]], Sham Shui Po and Wong Tai Sin.<ref name=\"Stand News\"/> For both marches in Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan, the police had used 215 canisters of tear gas, 74 rubber bullets, 44 sponge grenades and four bean bag rounds.<ref name=\"KT and TW\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nHong Kong protests - Tsuen Wan March - 20190825 - IMG 20190825 151512.jpg|Peaceful protesters in Tsuen Wan\nFile:Hong Kong protests - Tsuen Wan March - 20190825 - IMG 20190825 183023-edit.jpg|The police, for the first time, deployed two specialised crowd management vehicles equipped with [[water cannon]].\nThe closed Kwai Fong Station exit E.jpg|[[Kwai Fong station]] was closed before the march.\nFile:Hong Kong protests - Tsuen Wan March - 20190825 - IMG 20190825 180613.jpg|Standoff between protesters and the police at Yeung Uk Road\n</gallery>\n\n=== 25 August Police Relatives Connection protest ===\n\nAt the same time as the protests in Tsuen Wan, the Police Relatives Connection, a group claiming to represent relatives of members of the police force, staged a march from Edinburgh Square in Central to the Chief Executive's Office in Admiralty to give a letter outlining their own version of the \"five demands\". Their demands were for Lam to respond to public demands, senior police commanders to plan operations to minimise clashes, establish a platform for dialogue between the force and the public, for officers to remain disciplined, and to create an independent inquiry into police misconduct (a key demand of the protests). However, due to a lack of response, they submitted their letter at police headquarters in Wan Chai, where they also expressed appreciation for officers' efforts to preserve order, recited the force's [[Passing out (military)|passing out]] oath, and criticised police brutality. Organisers claimed that 400 people marched, while police counted 270. They said that the police were drawn into a political problem and admitted some police officers lost control of their emotions while performing their duties.<ref name=\"AutoHY-116\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-117\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-118\"/>\n\n=== 28 August aviation industry rally ===\n[[File:190828 HK protest by aviation worker.jpg|thumb|Protesters gathered in Edinburgh Place against Cathay Pacific on 28 August 2019.]]\nAs of 28 August 20 aviation staff professionals had been sacked or had resigned after Beijing exerted pressure on companies to crack down on the anti-government movement.

The participants stated they are extremely concerned about the deployment of tear gas, saying it is unclear how the toxic chemicals would affect nearby animals since the animals\u2019 sense of smell is much more acute than that of humans, and it stands to reason that they would be more seriously affected when exposed to chemical crowd control agents.<ref name=\"AutoHY-125\"/>\n\n=== 31 August protest ===\n[[File:HK police storm Prince Edward station and attack civilians 20190831 11pm.webm|thumb|Hong Kong police storm [[Prince Edward station]] and attack protesters on 31 August 2019]]\nFollowing a police ban on a protest applied by the [[Civil Human Rights Front]] and the arrests of several high-profile activists including [[Agnes Chow]] and [[Joshua Wong]], and pan-democratic Legislative Councilors including [[Jeremy Tam]], [[Au Nok-hin]] and [[Cheng Chung-tai]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-126\"/><ref name=\"AutoHY-127\"/> hundreds of thousands protesters<!-- Citation needed.

[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-simple-story-9780199554720?cc=ge&lang=en& this edition] published by [[Oxford University Press]].</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe novel is divided into four volumes, two each devoted to its two storylines. \n\nThe first volumes books follow the love story of young Miss Milner (we are never told her first name) and her [[legal guardian|guardian]] Dorriforth, who begins the novel as a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. Miss Milner is a seventeen year old orphan, whose father's deathbed wish entrusted her to Dorriforth's guardianship despite disapproving of Catholicism. Miss Milner admires Dorriforth but struggles to obey his strict rules. She flirts with a Lord Lawnly whom Dorriforth must duel on her behalf, causing strife. Several deaths in Dorriforth's family cause him to inherit the title of Lord Elmwood, bringing with it a social obligation to marry and have children to carry on the Elmwood family name. Miss Milner falls in love with Dorriforth. The Pope releases Dorriforth from his vow of chastity, and he becomes engaged to the former heir's fiance\u00e9, Miss Fenton; their relationship is tepid but prudent on both sides. Dorriforth then realises that he has passionate feelings for Miss Milner, which he resists both due to his engagement and due to his doubts about Miss Milner's suitability as a wife. Through a series of machinations, however, assisted by Miss Woodley (a kindhearted spinster) and Sanford (a Jesuit mentor of Dorriforth's), Dorriforth's engagement to Miss Fenton is broken and he and Miss Milner are engaged.\n\nThe third volume then abruptly transitions to the deathbed of Lady Elmwood (the former Miss Milner), some seventeen or eighteen years later. We learn that Lord Elmwood had been at his estate in the [[History of the British West Indies|West Indies]] for so long that Lady Elmwood assumed he was unfaithful, and had an affair of her own with Lord Lawnly. When Lord Elmwood returns, he banishes Lady Elmwood and refuses to acknowledge their only child, Matilda. A desperate letter that Lady Elmwood writes before dying convinces him to permit Matilda to live on one of his estates, on the condition that he never sees her.\n\nVolumes three and four then narrate Matilda's young adulthood, as she \"haunts\" Lord Elmwood's house. She is tutored by Miss Woodley and Sanford, and is raised to idolize the father whom she never sees. She meets her cousin, Rushbrook, her father's nephew and heir, and they begin a secret friendship, based largely around reading. One day, Matilda accidentally meets her father on a staircase, and he banishes her. She languishes and falls ill. When a Lord Margrave learns she is no longer under her father's protection, he abducts her. He is about to rape her when Lord Elmwood (who has had a change of heart) rescues her. Rushbrook, who has fallen in love with her, is now able to secure Lord Elmwood's approval for their marriage. Lord Elmwood tells him that Matilda herself must decide. Rushbrook begs her for her hand, and the narrator says: \"Whether the heart of Matilda, such as it has been described, could sentence him to misery, the reader is left to surmise\u2014and if he supposes that it did not, he has every reason to suppose their wedded life was a life of happiness.\" This is the end of the narrative, and the narrator then provides a moral lesson for the novel.\n<!--== Characters == -->\n\n== Major themes ==\n\nThe book touches on issues including the [[education of women]], Catholicism, [[sensibility]],<ref name=\"Ward1999\"/> and [[gender roles]].\n<!--=== Religion ===-->\n<!--=== Women's education ===-->\nThe book thematizes a problem of women's education, highlighting the differences between the academic educations that men receive and the emphasis on personal appearance and [[sensibility]] in women's education.<ref name=\"Decker2014\"/><ref name=\"Nachumi1999\"/> The character of Miss Milner represents what Inchbald saw the current social norm for women's \"fashionable\" education, in which women are taught use use their bodies instead of their minds.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\"/><ref name=\"Decker2014\"/>{{rp|60}} The ending of the novel declares a moral lesson about women's education, which links Miss Milner's unhappy ending and Matilda's happy one to the difference in their educations:\n<blockquote>\n[The reader] has beheld the pernicious effects of an ''improper education'' in the destiny which attended the unthinking Miss Milner.\u2014On the opposite side, what may not be hoped from that school of prudence\u2014though of adversity\u2014in which Matilda was bred?\n\nAnd Mr. Milner, Matilda's grandfather, had better have given his ''fortune'' to a distant branch of his family\u2014as Matilda's father once meant to do\u2014so that he had given to his daughter\n\n<center>'''A PROPER EDUCATION.'''</center>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the \"proper\" education that Matilda has received is not the purely-intellectual education that men receive, as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] advocated the year after the novel's publication in her ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.<ref name=\"Decker2014\"/>{{rp|61}} Instead, Matilda's education balances both emotional sensibility and intellectual rationality.<ref name=\"Decker2014\"/><ref name=\"Nachumi1999\"/> Another important aspect of Matilda's education is that, unlike Miss Milner, who participated widely in fashionable society as an heiress, Matilda is imprisoned in her father's house, and her daily experience is characterized by [[abjection]].<ref name=\"Haggerty1996\"/>\n\n== Style ==\nMany scholars have observed theatrical aspects to this novel, attributed to Inchbald's career as an actress and playwright.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" /><ref name=\"Osland2003\" /><ref name=\"Anderson2006\"/> These scholars note that many scenes describe characters in terms of dramatic tableaus and theatrical gestures to evoke emotion. Nora Nachumi identifies these gestures as filling in to convey emotions that the characters are unable to express in other ways, such as when Dorriforth embraces the unconscious Matilda to communicate \"a love he refuses to utter.\"<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|332}} She argues that the emotional language of gestures allows women to resit the [[Logocentrism|logocentric]] discourse of patriarchy and achieve a limited degree of agency.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|337}}\n\n<!-- == Background == -->\n== Composition ==\nThe first half of the novel was written between 1776 and 1779, and the second half between 1780 and 1791.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|331}} Many believe that the novel was written with the famous actor [[John Philip Kemble]], for whom Inchbald had also written plays, imagined as the character Dorriforth.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|324}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe general reception of ''A Simple Story'' was favorable.

[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-simple-story-9780199554720?cc=ge&lang=en& this edition] published by [[Oxford University Press]].</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe novel is divided into four volumes, two each devoted to its two storylines. \n\nThe first volumes books follow the love story of young Miss Milner (we are never told her first name) and her [[legal guardian|guardian]] Dorriforth, who begins the novel as a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. Miss Milner is a seventeen year old orphan, whose father's deathbed wish entrusted her to Dorriforth's guardianship despite disapproving of Catholicism. Miss Milner admires Dorriforth but struggles to obey his strict rules. She flirts with a Lord Lawnly whom Dorriforth must duel on her behalf, causing strife. Several deaths in Dorriforth's family cause him to inherit the title of Lord Elmwood, bringing with it a social obligation to marry and have children to carry on the Elmwood family name. Miss Milner falls in love with Dorriforth. The Pope releases Dorriforth from his vow of chastity, and he becomes engaged to the former heir's fiance\u00e9, Miss Fenton; their relationship is tepid but prudent on both sides. Dorriforth then realises that he has passionate feelings for Miss Milner, which he resists both due to his engagement and due to his doubts about Miss Milner's suitability as a wife. Through a series of machinations, however, assisted by Miss Woodley (a kindhearted spinster) and Sanford (a Jesuit mentor of Dorriforth's), Dorriforth's engagement to Miss Fenton is broken and he and Miss Milner are engaged.\n\nThe third volume then abruptly transitions to the deathbed of Lady Elmwood (the former Miss Milner), some seventeen or eighteen years later. We learn that Lord Elmwood had been at his estate in the [[History of the British West Indies|West Indies]] for so long that Lady Elmwood assumed he was unfaithful, and had an affair of her own with Lord Lawnly. When Lord Elmwood returns, he banishes Lady Elmwood and refuses to acknowledge their only child, Matilda. A desperate letter that Lady Elmwood writes before dying convinces him to permit Matilda to live on one of his estates, on the condition that he never sees her.\n\nVolumes three and four then narrate Matilda's young adulthood, as she \"haunts\" Lord Elmwood's house. She is tutored by Miss Woodley and Sanford, and is raised to idolize the father whom she never sees. She meets her cousin, Rushbrook, her father's nephew and heir, and they begin a secret friendship, based largely around reading. One day, Matilda accidentally meets her father on a staircase, and he banishes her. She languishes and falls ill. When a Lord Margrave learns she is no longer under her father's protection, he abducts her. He is about to rape her when Lord Elmwood (who has had a change of heart) rescues her. Rushbrook, who has fallen in love with her, is now able to secure Lord Elmwood's approval for their marriage. Lord Elmwood tells him that Matilda herself must decide. Rushbrook begs her for her hand, and the narrator says: \"Whether the heart of Matilda, such as it has been described, could sentence him to misery, the reader is left to surmise\u2014and if he supposes that it did not, he has every reason to suppose their wedded life was a life of happiness.\" This is the end of the narrative, and the narrator then provides a moral lesson for the novel.\n<!--== Characters == -->\n\n== Major themes ==\n\nThe book touches on issues including the [[education of women]], Catholicism, [[sensibility]],<ref name=\"Ward1999\"/> and [[gender roles]].\n<!--=== Religion ===-->\n<!--=== Women's education ===-->\nThe book thematizes a problem of women's education, highlighting the differences between the academic educations that men receive and the emphasis on personal appearance and [[sensibility]] in women's education.<ref name=\"Decker2014\"/><ref name=\"Nachumi1999\"/> The character of Miss Milner represents what Inchbald saw the current social norm for women's \"fashionable\" education, in which women are taught use use their bodies instead of their minds.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\"/><ref name=\"Decker2014\"/>{{rp|60}} The ending of the novel declares a moral lesson about women's education, which links Miss Milner's unhappy ending and Matilda's happy one to the difference in their educations:\n<blockquote>\n[The reader] has beheld the pernicious effects of an ''improper education'' in the destiny which attended the unthinking Miss Milner.\u2014On the opposite side, what may not be hoped from that school of prudence\u2014though of adversity\u2014in which Matilda was bred?\n\nAnd Mr. Milner, Matilda's grandfather, had better have given his ''fortune'' to a distant branch of his family\u2014as Matilda's father once meant to do\u2014so that he had given to his daughter\n\n<center>'''A PROPER EDUCATION.'''</center>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the \"proper\" education that Matilda has received is not the purely-intellectual education that men receive, as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] advocated the year after the novel's publication in her ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.<ref name=\"Decker2014\"/>{{rp|61}} Instead, Matilda's education balances both emotional sensibility and intellectual rationality.<ref name=\"Decker2014\"/><ref name=\"Nachumi1999\"/> Another important aspect of Matilda's education is that, unlike Miss Milner, who participated widely in fashionable society as an heiress, Matilda is imprisoned in her father's house, and her daily experience is characterized by [[abjection]].<ref name=\"Haggerty1996\"/>\n\n== Style ==\nMany scholars have observed theatrical aspects to this novel, attributed to Inchbald's career as an actress and playwright.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" /><ref name=\"Osland2003\" /><ref name=\"Anderson2006\"/> These scholars note that many scenes describe characters in terms of dramatic tableaus and theatrical gestures to evoke emotion. Nora Nachumi identifies these gestures as filling in to convey emotions that the characters are unable to express in other ways, such as when Dorriforth embraces the unconscious Matilda to communicate \"a love he refuses to utter.\"<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|332}} She argues that the emotional language of gestures allows women to resit the [[Logocentrism|logocentric]] discourse of patriarchy and achieve a limited degree of agency.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|337}}\n\n<!-- == Background == -->\n== Composition ==\nThe first half of the novel was written between 1776 and 1779, and the second half between 1780 and 1791.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|331}} Many believe that the novel was written with the famous actor [[John Philip Kemble]], for whom Inchbald had also written plays, imagined as the character Dorriforth.<ref name=\"Nachumi1999\" />{{rp|324}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe general reception of ''A Simple Story'' was favorable.
