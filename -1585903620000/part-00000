It is stated in terms of three positive integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (hence the name) that are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] and satisfy ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''. If ''d'' denotes the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''abc'', the conjecture essentially states that ''d'' is usually not much smaller than ''c''. In other words: if ''a'' and ''b'' are composed from large powers of primes, then ''c'' is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.\nThe ''abc'' conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterl\u00e9 and Masser to understand the [[Szpiro conjecture]] about elliptic curves.<ref>{{citation|title=Arithmetic deformation theory via arithmetic fundamental groups and nonarchimedean theta functions, notes on the work of Shinichi Mochizuki|journal= European Journal of Mathematics|first=Ivan|last=Fesenko|volume=1 |issue=3| pages=405\u2013440 | year=2015 |url=https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/ibf/notesoniut.pdf |doi=10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0}}.</ref> The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the ''abc'' conjecture.\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture and its versions express, in concentrated form, some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry. A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the ''abc'' conjecture or its versions. {{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1996}} described the ''abc'' conjecture as \"the most important unsolved problem in [[Diophantine analysis]]\".\n\nVarious attempts to prove the abc conjecture have been made, but none are currently accepted by the mainstream mathematical community and the conjecture is still largely recognized to be unproven as of 2020. On April 3, 2020, two RIMS mathematicians announced in Japanese that Publications of the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences (RIMS) had accepted Mochizuki's proof. <ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00998-2 |title=Mathematical proof that rocked number theory will be published}}.</ref>\n\n==Formulations==\nBefore we state the conjecture we introduce the notion of the  [[radical of an integer]]: for a [[positive integer]] ''n'', the radical of ''n'', denoted rad(''n''), is the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''n''. For example\n\n:rad(16) = rad(2<sup>4</sup>) = rad(2) = 2,\n:rad(17) = 17,\n:rad(18) = rad(2 \u22c5 3<sup>2</sup>) = 2 \u00b7 3 = 6,\n:rad(1000000) = rad(2<sup>6</sup> \u22c5 5<sup>6</sup>) = 2 \u22c5 5 = 10.\n\nIf ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are [[coprime]]<ref group = notes>When ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', coprimeness of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' implies [[pairwise coprime]]ness of ''a'', ''b'', ''c''. So in this case, it does not matter which concept we use.</ref> positive integers such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', it turns out that \"usually\" ''c'' < rad(''abc''). The ''abc conjecture'' deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', such that\n::<math>c > \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nAn equivalent formulation:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture II.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exists a constant ''K<sub>\u03b5</sub>'' such that for all triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'':\n::<math>c < K_{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nA third equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the ''quality'' ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), defined as\n\n: <math> q(a, b, c) = \\frac{ \\log(c) }{ \\log\\big(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)\\big) }.</math>\n\nFor example:\n\n:''q''(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4\u00b7127\u00b7131)) = log(131) / log(2\u00b7127\u00b7131) = 0.46820...\n:''q''(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3\u00b7125\u00b7128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...\n\nA typical triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' will have ''c'' < rad(''abc''), i.e. ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') < 1. Triples with ''q'' > 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small [[prime number]]s.\n\n:'''ABC conjecture III.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1 + ''\u03b5''.\n\nWhereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have ''q'' > 1.01 or ''q'' > 1.001 or even ''q'' > 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true, then there must exist a triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') that achieves the maximal possible quality ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') .\n\n==Examples of triples with small radical==\nThe condition that ''\u03b5'' > 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. For example, let\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{6n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{6n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nThe integer ''b'' is divisible by 9:\n\n:<math> b = 2^{6n} - 1  =  64^n - 1 = (64 - 1) (\\cdots) = 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot (\\cdots).</math>\n\nUsing this fact we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{rad}(abc) &= \\operatorname{rad}(a) \\operatorname{rad}(b) \\operatorname{rad}(c) \\\\\n&= \\operatorname{rad}(1)  \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\operatorname{rad} \\left (2^{6n} \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 9 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\right )  \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2 \\cdot 3  \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\\\\n&= 2 \\tfrac{b}{3} \\\\\n&< \\tfrac{2}{3} c.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy replacing the exponent 6''n'' by other exponents forcing ''b'' to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and ''c'' can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let ''p'' > 2 be a prime and consider\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{p(p-1)n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nNow we claim that ''b'' is divisible by ''p''<sup>2</sup>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb &= 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)}\\right)^n - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)} - 1\\right) (\\cdots) \\\\\n&= p^2 \\cdot r (\\cdots).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe last step uses the fact that ''p''<sup>2</sup> divides 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. This follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]], which shows that, for ''p''\u00a0>\u00a02, 2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''pk''\u00a0+\u00a01 for some integer ''k''. Raising both sides to the power of ''p'' then shows that 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''p''<sup>2</sup>(...)\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nAnd now with a similar calculation as above we have\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{rad}(abc) < \\tfrac{2}{p} c.</math>\n\nA list of the [[#Highest-quality triples|highest-quality triples]] (triples with a particularly small radical relative to ''c'') is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat {{harv|Lando|Zvonkin|2004|p=137}} for\n:''a'' = 2,\n:''b'' = 3<sup>10</sup>\u00b7109 = {{val|6,436,341}},\n:''c'' = 23<sup>5</sup> = {{val|6,436,343}},\n:rad(''abc'') = {{val|15042}}.\n\n==Some consequences==\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a [[conditional proof]]. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the ''abc'' conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.

Bounds are known that are [[exponential function|exponential]]. Specifically, the following bounds have been proven:\n\n:<math>c < \\exp{ \\left(K_1 \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{15}\\right) } </math> {{harv|Stewart|Tijdeman|1986}},\n:<math>c < \\exp{ \\left(K_2 \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{\\frac{2}{3} + \\varepsilon}\\right) } </math> {{harv|Stewart|Yu|1991}}, and\n:<math>c < \\exp{ \\left(K_3 \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{\\frac{1}{3} + \\varepsilon}\\right) } </math> {{harv|Stewart|Yu|2001}}.\n\nIn these bounds, ''K''<sub>1</sub> is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] that does not depend on ''a'', ''b'', or ''c'', and ''K''<sub>2</sub> and ''K''<sub>3</sub> are constants that depend on ''\u03b5'' (in an [[effectively computable]] way) but not on ''a'', ''b'', or ''c''. The bounds apply to any triple for which ''c'' > 2.\n\n==Computational results==\nIn 2006, the Mathematics Department of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the [[ABC@Home]] project, a [[grid computing]] system, which aims to discover additional triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the ''abc'' conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Distribution of triples with ''q'' > 1<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{Citation|url=http://www.rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222221716/http://rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |title=Synthese resultaten |work=RekenMeeMetABC.nl |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |language=nl }}.</ref>\n|-\n!

It is stated in terms of three positive integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (hence the name) that are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] and satisfy ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''. If ''d'' denotes the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''abc'', the conjecture essentially states that ''d'' is usually not much smaller than ''c''. In other words: if ''a'' and ''b'' are composed from large powers of primes, then ''c'' is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.\nThe ''abc'' conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterl\u00e9 and Masser to understand the [[Szpiro conjecture]] about elliptic curves.<ref>{{citation|title=Arithmetic deformation theory via arithmetic fundamental groups and nonarchimedean theta functions, notes on the work of Shinichi Mochizuki|journal= European Journal of Mathematics|first=Ivan|last=Fesenko|volume=1 |issue=3| pages=405\u2013440 | year=2015 |url=https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/ibf/notesoniut.pdf |doi=10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0}}.</ref> The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the ''abc'' conjecture.\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture and its versions express, in concentrated form, some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry. A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the ''abc'' conjecture or its versions. {{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1996}} described the ''abc'' conjecture as \"the most important unsolved problem in [[Diophantine analysis]]\".\n\nVarious attempts to prove the abc conjecture have been made, but none are currently accepted by the mainstream mathematical community and the conjecture is still largely recognized to be unproven as of 2020.\n\n==Formulations==\nBefore we state the conjecture we introduce the notion of the  [[radical of an integer]]: for a [[positive integer]] ''n'', the radical of ''n'', denoted rad(''n''), is the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''n''. For example\n\n:rad(16) = rad(2<sup>4</sup>) = rad(2) = 2,\n:rad(17) = 17,\n:rad(18) = rad(2 \u22c5 3<sup>2</sup>) = 2 \u00b7 3 = 6,\n:rad(1000000) = rad(2<sup>6</sup> \u22c5 5<sup>6</sup>) = 2 \u22c5 5 = 10.\n\nIf ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are [[coprime]]<ref group = notes>When ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', coprimeness of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' implies [[pairwise coprime]]ness of ''a'', ''b'', ''c''. So in this case, it does not matter which concept we use.</ref> positive integers such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', it turns out that \"usually\" ''c'' < rad(''abc''). The ''abc conjecture'' deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', such that\n::<math>c > \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nAn equivalent formulation:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture II.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exists a constant ''K<sub>\u03b5</sub>'' such that for all triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'':\n::<math>c < K_{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nA third equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the ''quality'' ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), defined as\n\n: <math> q(a, b, c) = \\frac{ \\log(c) }{ \\log\\big(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)\\big) }.</math>\n\nFor example:\n\n:''q''(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4\u00b7127\u00b7131)) = log(131) / log(2\u00b7127\u00b7131) = 0.46820...\n:''q''(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3\u00b7125\u00b7128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...\n\nA typical triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' will have ''c'' < rad(''abc''), i.e. ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') < 1. Triples with ''q'' > 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small [[prime number]]s.\n\n:'''ABC conjecture III.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1 + ''\u03b5''.\n\nWhereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have ''q'' > 1.01 or ''q'' > 1.001 or even ''q'' > 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true, then there must exist a triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') that achieves the maximal possible quality ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') .\n\n==Examples of triples with small radical==\nThe condition that ''\u03b5'' > 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. For example, let\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{6n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{6n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nThe integer ''b'' is divisible by 9:\n\n:<math> b = 2^{6n} - 1  =  64^n - 1 = (64 - 1) (\\cdots) = 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot (\\cdots).</math>\n\nUsing this fact we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{rad}(abc) &= \\operatorname{rad}(a) \\operatorname{rad}(b) \\operatorname{rad}(c) \\\\\n&= \\operatorname{rad}(1)  \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\operatorname{rad} \\left (2^{6n} \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 9 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\right )  \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2 \\cdot 3  \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\\\\n&= 2 \\tfrac{b}{3} \\\\\n&< \\tfrac{2}{3} c.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy replacing the exponent 6''n'' by other exponents forcing ''b'' to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and ''c'' can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let ''p'' > 2 be a prime and consider\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{p(p-1)n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nNow we claim that ''b'' is divisible by ''p''<sup>2</sup>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb &= 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)}\\right)^n - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)} - 1\\right) (\\cdots) \\\\\n&= p^2 \\cdot r (\\cdots).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe last step uses the fact that ''p''<sup>2</sup> divides 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. This follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]], which shows that, for ''p''\u00a0>\u00a02, 2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''pk''\u00a0+\u00a01 for some integer ''k''. Raising both sides to the power of ''p'' then shows that 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''p''<sup>2</sup>(...)\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nAnd now with a similar calculation as above we have\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{rad}(abc) < \\tfrac{2}{p} c.</math>\n\nA list of the [[#Highest-quality triples|highest-quality triples]] (triples with a particularly small radical relative to ''c'') is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat {{harv|Lando|Zvonkin|2004|p=137}} for\n:''a'' = 2,\n:''b'' = 3<sup>10</sup>\u00b7109 = {{val|6,436,341}},\n:''c'' = 23<sup>5</sup> = {{val|6,436,343}},\n:rad(''abc'') = {{val|15042}}.\n\n==Some consequences==\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a [[conditional proof]]. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the ''abc'' conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.

The conjecture that 2 is such an upper bound suffices for a very short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for <math>n \\ge 6</math>.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Granville | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Tucker | first2 = Thomas | year = 2002 | title = It's As Easy As abc | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200210/fea-granville.pdf | journal = Notices of the AMS | volume = 49 | issue = 10| pages = 1224\u20131231 }}</ref>\n* The [[Beal conjecture]], a generalization of Fermat's last theorem proposing that if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are positive integers with ''A<sup>x</sup>'' + ''B<sup>y</sup>'' = ''C<sup>z</sup>'' and ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' > 2, then ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' have a common prime factor. The ''abc'' conjecture would imply that there are only finitely many counterexamples. \n*[[N\u00e9ron\u2013Tate height#Lower bounds for the N\u00e9ron\u2013Tate height|Lang\u2019s conjecture]], a lower bound for the [[height function|height]] of a non-torsion rational point of an elliptic curve.\n\n==Theoretical results==\nThe abc conjecture implies that ''c'' can be [[upper bound|bounded above]] by a near-linear function of the radical of ''abc''. Bounds are known that are [[exponential function|exponential]]. Specifically, the following bounds have been proven:\n\n:<math>c < \\exp{ \\left(K_1 \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{15}\\right) } </math> {{harv|Stewart|Tijdeman|1986}},\n:<math>c < \\exp{ \\left(K_2 \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{\\frac{2}{3} + \\varepsilon}\\right) } </math> {{harv|Stewart|Yu|1991}}, and\n:<math>c < \\exp{ \\left(K_3 \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{\\frac{1}{3} + \\varepsilon}\\right) } </math> {{harv|Stewart|Yu|2001}}.\n\nIn these bounds, ''K''<sub>1</sub> is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] that does not depend on ''a'', ''b'', or ''c'', and ''K''<sub>2</sub> and ''K''<sub>3</sub> are constants that depend on ''\u03b5'' (in an [[effectively computable]] way) but not on ''a'', ''b'', or ''c''. The bounds apply to any triple for which ''c'' > 2.\n\n==Computational results==\nIn 2006, the Mathematics Department of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the [[ABC@Home]] project, a [[grid computing]] system, which aims to discover additional triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the ''abc'' conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Distribution of triples with ''q'' > 1<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{Citation|url=http://www.rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222221716/http://rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |title=Synthese resultaten |work=RekenMeeMetABC.nl |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |language=nl }}.</ref>\n|-\n!
