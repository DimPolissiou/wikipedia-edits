She was also a lecturer.  From 1970 to 1974 she was an assistant staff manager at [[Marks and Spencer]].  From 1974 to 1976, she was an assistant area education officer.\n\nMaureen Hicks was heavily involved in local tourism at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], whilst realising the necessity to remain sensitive to the needs of the local residents. She was a former member of the Heart of England Tourist Board executive, and director of Stratford-upon-Avon Motor Museum from 1976 to 1982. In 1978 she helped to form Stratford-upon-Avon and District Marketing, which brought together hotels, retailers and attractions with District Council support.\n\nShe served as a councillor in [[Stratford upon Avon District Council]] from 1979 to 1984.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n\nIn the 1987 general election, Hicks stood as the Conservative candidate for the Wolverhampton North East constituency.  It had been a Labour seat for many years but had become marginal in the 1983 Conservative landslide.  The constituency's previous Labour MP, [[Renee Short]], had retired and was replaced as Labour candidate by [[Ken Purchase]].  Despite the small overall national swing to Labour, Hicks gained the seat against the tide with a swing of 0.5% to the Conservatives, winning by just 204 votes (0.4% of the total).\n\nOnce a Member of Parliament, Hicks made her [[maiden speech]] on 1 December 1987, during a House of Commons debate on an Education Reform Bill.  She was a member of the Conservative backbench tourism committee until 1990, and a member of the Select Committee on Education, Science and the Arts.  For the remainder of her time in the House of Commons, she was a parliamentary private secretary for the [[Earl of Caithness]] and for [[Mark Lennox-Boyd]], Minister of State and Under Secretary of State respectively for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].\n\nHicks stood for re-election in the 1992 general election in her Wolverhampton North East seat.  The polls were pointing towards a national swing to the Labour Party and her chances of retaining the seat were never rated highly.  She used a battle bus in her campaign to be re-elected, adopting [[Tina Turner]]\u2019s song \"Simply the Best,\" to be played out as the bus drove in the streets of her constituency, saying she had chosen a song by a strong woman to emphasise her own credentials as a steely female.\n\nIn the event, Hicks polled 20,167 votes, numerically more than she had achieved in 1987, and her share of the vote fell by just 0.9%.  Ken Purchase, who was running again for Labour, enjoyed an increase of 7.6% in his share of the vote, mostly at the expense of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' candidate.  Hicks thus lost her seat by 3,939 votes (8.1%) to Purchase on a 4.2% swing to Labour.  The election declaration was broadcast on ITN's Election Special.\n\n==After the House of Commons==\n\nFollowing Hicks's defeat, she re-located to Stratford-upon-Avon, where she was appointed by the local council to a role as town centre manager, and was involved in plans to develop the town's Bell Court Shopping Centre.  She was a project director for the Stratford-upon-Avon Visitor Management Action Programme (VMAP), and was a founder member of the Shakespeare Country Association of Tourist Attractions (SCATA) - which includes the Royal Shakespeare Company, Warwick Castle, Anne Hathaway's Cottage and other Shakespeare Birthplace Trust properties.\n\nIn November 1995, the Conservative MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, [[Alan Howarth, Baron Howarth of Newport|Alan Howarth]], announced that he was defecting to the Labour party.  The local Conservative association quickly moved to select a new candidate to replace him for the 1997 general election.  Hicks, as a local candidate, put her name forward and made a shortlist of six candidates, but she lost the nomination to [[John Maples]], the former MP for [[Lewisham West]] who had also lost his seat in the 1992 general election.\n\nHicks has held a number of directorships, including for Earl Mountbatten Hospice in Newport, Isle of Wight.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nHicks's interests in [[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]] include golf, music and travel.\n\nShe married Keith Hicks in 1973.  They have a son and a daughter.\n\n==References==\n*\"Times Guide to the House of Commons\", Times Newspapers Limited, 1992 edition.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mrs-maureen-hicks | Maureen Hicks }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Wolverhampton North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton North East]]\n  | years  = [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]\u2013[[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n  | before = [[Renee Short]]\n  | after  = [[Ken Purchase]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hicks, Maureen}}\n[[Category:1948 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992]]\n[[Category:Councillors in Warwickshire]]\n[[Category:20th-century British women politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2014}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix = \n| name = Maureen Patricia Hicks\n| honorific-suffix = \n| image            =\n| caption =\n| birth_name = Maureen Patricia Cutler\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1948|02|23|df=y}}\n| birth_place = \n| death_date       = <!-- {{death date and age|DDDD|MM|DD|1948|02|23|df=y}} -->\n| death_place      = \n| office = [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] <br> for [[Wolverhampton North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton North East]]\n| term_start = 11 June 1987\n| term_end = 8 April 1992\n| predecessor = [[Renee Short]]\n| successor = [[Ken Purchase]]\n| parliament = United Kingdom\n| party =  [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| spouse = Keith Hicks (m. 1973)\n| children = Two, a son and a daughter\n| nationality = [[United Kingdom|British]]\n| alma_mater = \n }}\n'''Maureen Patricia Hicks''', n\u00e9e Cutler, (born 23 February 1948) was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] of the United Kingdom for [[Wolverhampton North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton North East]] from 1987 to 1992.\n\n==Early life==\n\nHicks was educated at [[Furzedown]] College of Education.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970, as Maureen Cutler, she was a secondary school teacher of drama and English.

Despite the small overall national swing to Labour, Hicks gained the seat against the tide with a swing of 0.5% to the Conservatives, winning by just 204 votes (0.4% of the total).\n\nOnce a Member of Parliament, Hicks made her [[maiden speech]] on 1 December 1987, during a House of Commons debate on an Education Reform Bill.  She was a member of the Conservative backbench tourism committee until 1990, and a member of the Select Committee on Education, Science and the Arts.  For the remainder of her time in the House of Commons, she was a parliamentary private secretary for the [[Earl of Caithness]] and for [[Mark Lennox-Boyd]], Minister of State and Under Secretary of State respectively for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].\n\nHicks stood for re-election in the 1992 general election in her Wolverhampton North East seat.  The polls were pointing towards a national swing to the Labour Party and her chances of retaining the seat were never rated highly.  She used a battle bus in her campaign to be re-elected, adopting [[Tina Turner]]\u2019s song \"Simply the Best,\" to be played out as the bus drove in the streets of her constituency, saying she had chosen a song by a strong woman to emphasise her own credentials as a steely female.\n\nIn the event, Hicks polled 20,167 votes, numerically more than she had achieved in 1987, and her share of the vote fell by just 0.9%.  Ken Purchase, who was running again for Labour, enjoyed an increase of 7.6% in his share of the vote, mostly at the expense of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' candidate.  Hicks thus lost her seat by 3,939 votes (8.1%) to Purchase on a 4.2% swing to Labour.  The election declaration was broadcast on ITN\u2019s Election Special.\n\n==After the House of Commons==\n\nFollowing Hicks\u2019s defeat, she re-located to Stratford-upon-Avon, where she was appointed by the local council to a role as town centre manager, and was involved in plans to develop the town\u2019s Bell Court Shopping Centre.  She was a project director for the Stratford-upon-Avon Visitor Management Action Programme (VMAP), and was a founder member of the Shakespeare Country Association of Tourist Attractions (SCATA) - which includes the Royal Shakespeare Company, Warwick Castle, Anne Hathaway's Cottage and other Shakespeare Birthplace Trust properties.\n\nIn November 1995, the Conservative MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, [[Alan Howarth, Baron Howarth of Newport|Alan Howarth]], announced that he was defecting to the Labour party.  The local Conservative association quickly moved to select a new candidate to replace him for the 1997 general election.  Hicks, as a local candidate, put her name forward and made a shortlist of six candidates, but she lost the nomination to [[John Maples]], the former MP for [[Lewisham West]] who had also lost his seat in the 1992 general election.\n\nHicks has held a number of directorships, including for Earl Mountbatten Hospice in Newport, Isle of Wight.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nHicks's interests in [[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]] include golf, music and travel.\n\nShe married Keith Hicks in 1973.  They have a son and a daughter.\n\n==References==\n*\"Times Guide to the House of Commons\", Times Newspapers Limited, 1992 edition.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mrs-maureen-hicks | Maureen Hicks }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Wolverhampton North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton North East]]\n  | years  = [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]\u2013[[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n  | before = [[Renee Short]]\n  | after  = [[Ken Purchase]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hicks, Maureen}}\n[[Category:1948 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992]]\n[[Category:Councillors in Warwickshire]]\n[[Category:20th-century British women politicians]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_Hicks"}
