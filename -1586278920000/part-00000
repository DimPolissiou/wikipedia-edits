Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Suck on it, Jenny Beckman \n| url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer \n| work = Salon \n| last = Williams \n| first = Mary Elizabeth \n| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5jxwVeJ5z?url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer/ \n| archive-date = September 22, 2009 \n| url-status = dead \n| accessdate = September 2, 2019\n| df = mdy \n}}</ref> Weber also stated that, \"we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way to tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place.

He stated, \"We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be something you could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title \u2013 it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt\".<ref name=\"Eva\">{{cite news\n| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/500-days-of-summer\n| title='Is there such a thing as \"the one\" \u2013 and what happens if you lose her?\n| work=The Guardian\n| last=Wiseman\n| first=Eva\n| accessdate=August 16, 2009\n| location=London\n| date=August 16, 2009\n}}</ref>\nWebb also stated that Deschanel's character, Summer, is based on a [[stock character]] type; \"Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase.\"<ref name=\"Eva\" /> Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. \"I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about ''500 Days of Summer'' is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny\".<ref name=\"Eva\" />\n\n=== Filming locations ===\n[[File:Bradbury building Los Angeles c2005 01383u crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photograph of a building interior showing stairs climbing up five storeys to the final floor where we can see the glass roof.|The [[Bradbury Building]] in Los Angeles was a filming location.]]\nDavid Ng of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describes architecture as a star of the film.<ref name=\"DavidNg\" />\nTom is seen reading [[Alain de Botton]]'s ''[[The Architecture of Happiness]]''.\nThe film was originally set in San Francisco but was later moved to Los Angeles and the script rewritten to make better use of the location.<ref name=\"LACurbed\">{{cite web\n| url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2009/06/tk.php\n| title=Screenwriter explains ''500 Days'' Focus on Architecture, Downtown LA\n| work=Curbed LA\n| last=Gluck\n| first=Marissa\n| accessdate=June 8, 2009\n}}\n</ref> Buildings used include the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] (which includes the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]]) and the towers of [[One California Plaza|California Plaza]].<ref name=\"DavidNg\">{{cite news\n| author=David Ng\n| date=June 9, 2009\n| title=Downtown L.A. architecture stars in ''500 Days of Summer''\n| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/06/500-days-of-summer-frank-gehry-architecture-joseph-gordonlevitt-zooey-deschanel.html\n| work=Los Angeles Times\n| accessdate=January 8, 2010\n}}</ref>\nThe older [[Fine Arts Building (Los Angeles)|Fine Arts Building]] is featured in the film, in a scene where Tom shows it to Summer and mentions its designers, [[Walker & Eisen|Walker and Eisen]], two of his favorite architects, although he incorrectly gives the partners' names as \"Walker and Eisner.\"\n\nChristopher Hawthorne of the ''Los Angeles Times'' describes the film as having \"finely honed sense of taste\" to include the [[Bradbury Building]] where Tom goes for his job interview.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Christopher |title=L.A. as filtered by love in ''500 Days of Summer'' |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-500days-2009jul31,0,3332091.story |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |date=July 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=July 30, 2009 |first=Christopher |last=Hawthorne |title=500 Days of architecture |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/07/500-days-of-architecture.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=January 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTom\u2019s favourite spot in Los Angeles was shot at Angel's Knoll, which became a popular tourist attraction after the film\u2019s release.

There is an on-screen timer showing the day.  The following is a linear summary of the plot.}}\n\nOn January 8, Tom Hansen meets Summer Finn, his boss' new assistant. Tom is trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. After discovering they have a similar taste in music, they have a conversation about love at a [[karaoke]] night; Tom believes in it, but Summer does not. Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie drunkenly reveals that Tom likes Summer, which Tom asserts is only \"as friends\", something Summer agrees with. A few days later, Summer kisses Tom in the office. During the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer.\n\nTom shows Summer his favorite spot in the city, a park bench which overlooks a number of buildings he likes, though the view is somewhat spoiled by parking lots. After several months of dating, both Tom's friends and his preteen half-sister Rachel push him to question Summer where they are in their relationship, though Summer brushes this off, saying that it should not matter if they are both happy. One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick up Summer in a bar, which causes their first argument. They make up and Summer concedes Tom deserves some certainty, but that his demand that she promises to always feel the same way about him would be impossible for anyone to make.\n\nOn day 290, they are hanging out in a cafe. Tom wants to go back to Summer's place but she insists on seeing ''[[The Graduate]]'' and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he'd always thought it was a romantic fairy tale. They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost interest in Tom, and kisses him good night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Tom is horrified and begins to sink into depression.\n\nSummer quits her job at the greeting card company. Tom's boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is making him unsuitable for happier events. Tom goes on a blind date with a woman named Alison. The date does not go well as he spends it complaining about Summer until an exasperated Alison ends up taking Summer's side. Months later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. They have a good time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet. She invites Tom to a party at her apartment and falls asleep on Tom's shoulder on the train ride back. He attends the party hoping to rekindle their relationship but barely gets to talk to Summer and spends most of the night drinking alone, until he spots her engagement ring. Tom leaves, close to tears. He enters a deep depression, only leaving his apartment for alcohol and junk food. After a few days, he returns to work with a hangover and, after an emotional outburst, quits his job. Rachel tells Tom that she does not believe Summer was \"the one\" and that his depression is being worsened by the fact that he is [[Euphoric recall|only looking back on the positive aspects]] of their relationship.\n\nOne day he suddenly finds the energy to get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. He informs her that he left the office, and notes that she got married, which he admits he doesn't understand since she never even wanted to be someone's girlfriend. Summer says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom.  When Tom asserts that he was wrong about true love existing, she counters that he was actually right about it, he was just wrong about it being with her. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.\n\nTwelve days later, on Wednesday, May 23, Tom attends a job interview and meets a girl who is also applying for the same job. He finds that she shares his favorite spot and dislike for the parking lots. As he is entering the interview, he invites her for coffee afterwards. She politely declines, then changes her mind. Her name is Autumn. \n<!-- Do not add references to \"the counter\" -->\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Tom Hansen, a trained architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Summer Finn, assistant to Tom's boss and Tom's love interest.\n* [[Geoffrey Arend]] as McKenzie, Tom's co-worker at the greeting card company.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Rachel Hansen, Tom's younger half-sister.\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Paul, one of Tom's friends.\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Vance, Tom's boss.\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Millie\n* [[Rachel Boston]] as Alison, Tom's blind date.\n* [[Minka Kelly]] as Autumn\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as Rhoda\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Vance's New Secretary\n* Olivia Bagg as Young Summer\n* [[Richard McGonagle]] as Narrator\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe style of the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film [[Scott Neustadter]] admitted the film was based on a real romance.<ref>{{cite web|title=''500 Days of...'' Jenny Beckman? |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/07/02/500-days-of-jenny-beckman |publisher=Cinematical.com |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5jxwVCdh1?url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/07/02/500-days-of-jenny-beckman/ |archive-date=September 22, 2009 |url-status= dead |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref> Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the [[London School of Economics]] in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell \"crazily, madly, hopelessly in love\" with the girl who \"returned his kisses but not his ardor.\" The ending of the relationship was \"painfully and unforgettably awful,\" which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Suck on it, Jenny Beckman \n| url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer \n| work = Salon \n| last = Williams \n| first = Mary Elizabeth \n| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5jxwVeJ5z?url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer/ \n| archive-date = September 22, 2009 \n| url-status = dead \n| accessdate = September 2, 2019\n| df = mdy \n}}</ref> Weber also stated that, \"we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way to tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy\".<ref name=\"Eva\" />\n\n=== Direction ===\nDirector Marc Webb has described the film as more of a \"[[coming of age]]\" story as opposed to a \"[[romantic comedy|rom-com]]\". He stated, \"We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be something you could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title \u2013 it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt\".<ref name=\"Eva\">{{cite news\n| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/500-days-of-summer\n| title='Is there such a thing as \"the one\" \u2013 and what happens if you lose her?\n| work=The Guardian\n| last=Wiseman\n| first=Eva\n| accessdate=August 16, 2009\n| location=London\n| date=August 16, 2009\n}}</ref>\nWebb also stated that Deschanel's character, Summer, is based on a [[stock character]] type; \"Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase.\"<ref name=\"Eva\" /> Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. \"I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about ''500 Days of Summer'' is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny\".<ref name=\"Eva\" />\n\n=== Filming locations ===\n[[File:Bradbury building Los Angeles c2005 01383u crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photograph of a building interior showing stairs climbing up five storeys to the final floor where we can see the glass roof.|The [[Bradbury Building]] in Los Angeles was a filming location.]]\nDavid Ng of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describes architecture as a star of the film.<ref name=\"DavidNg\" />\nTom is seen reading [[Alain de Botton]]'s ''[[The Architecture of Happiness]]''.\nThe film was originally set in San Francisco but was later moved to Los Angeles and the script rewritten to make better use of the location.<ref name=\"LACurbed\">{{cite web\n| url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2009/06/tk.php\n| title=Screenwriter explains ''500 Days'' Focus on Architecture, Downtown LA\n| work=Curbed LA\n| last=Gluck\n| first=Marissa\n| accessdate=June 8, 2009\n}}\n</ref> Buildings used include the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] (which includes the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]]) and the towers of [[One California Plaza|California Plaza]].<ref name=\"DavidNg\">{{cite news\n| author=David Ng\n| date=June 9, 2009\n| title=Downtown L.A. architecture stars in ''500 Days of Summer''\n| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/06/500-days-of-summer-frank-gehry-architecture-joseph-gordonlevitt-zooey-deschanel.html\n| work=Los Angeles Times\n| accessdate=January 8, 2010\n}}</ref>\nThe older [[Fine Arts Building (Los Angeles)|Fine Arts Building]] is featured in the film, in a scene where Tom shows it to Summer and mentions its designers, [[Walker & Eisen|Walker and Eisen]], two of his favorite architects, although he incorrectly gives the partners' names as \"Walker and Eisner.\"\n\nChristopher Hawthorne of the ''Los Angeles Times'' describes the film as having \"finely honed sense of taste\" to include the [[Bradbury Building]] where Tom goes for his job interview.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Christopher |title=L.A. as filtered by love in ''500 Days of Summer'' |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-500days-2009jul31,0,3332091.story |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |date=July 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=July 30, 2009 |first=Christopher |last=Hawthorne |title=500 Days of architecture |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/07/500-days-of-architecture.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=January 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTom\u2019s favourite spot in Los Angeles was shot at Angel's Knoll, which became a popular tourist attraction after the film\u2019s release.

He based his decision on Zooey Deschanel's eye colour, but as Hanafin disclosed, it works on a subconscious level as well, attracting attention at all times. The only scene to break this \"rule\" is the Hall & Oates dance sequence where many of the extras appear in blue. \"The point of that was to show that, in his morning-after glow, Tom's whole world is a reflection of Summer\" as Hanafin explained to ''[[Elle (magazine)|ELLE]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/pop-culture/reviews/screen-style-500-days-of-summer-389995|title=A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Fashion in (500) Days of Summer|last=Cox|first=Johanna|date=2009-12-22|website=ELLE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> The costumes are a mixture of vintage and fast fashion with the emphasis on staying realistic to what the characters could afford.

During vulcanization, sulfur bridges are formed between these sites, crosslinking the polymer. These bridges may consist of one or several sulfur atoms. \nBoth the extent of crosslinking and the number of sulfur atoms in the crosslinks strongly influences the physical properties of the rubber produced:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nasir |first1=M. |last2=Teh |first2=G.K. |title=The effects of various types of crosslinks on the physical properties of natural rubber |journal=European Polymer Journal |date=January 1988 |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=733\u2013736 |doi=10.1016/0014-3057(88)90007-9}}</ref>\n\n* Excessive crosslinking can convert the rubber into a hard and brittle substance (i.e. [[ebonite]]).\n* Short crosslinks, possessing lower numbers of sulfur atoms, give the rubber better resistance to heat and weathering. \n* Longer crosslinks, with higher numbers of sulfur atoms, give the rubber improved physical durability and [[tensile strength]].\n\nSulfur, by itself, is a slow vulcanizing agent and does not vulcanize synthetic polyolefins. Even with natural rubber, large amounts of sulfur as well as high temperatures and long heating periods are necessary, with the end products often being of an unsatisfactory quality.\n\nOver the last 200 years, various chemicals have been developed to improve the speed and efficiency of vulcanization, as well as to control the nature of the cross-linking, in order to produce rubber articles with the desired properties.<ref name=\"Ullmann's\">{{cite book |last1=Engels|first1=Hans-Wilhelm|last2=Weidenhaupt|first2=Herrmann-Josef|last3=Pieroth|first3=Manfred|last4=Hofmann|first4=Werner|last5=Menting|first5=Karl-Hans|last6=Mergenhagen|first6=Thomas|last7=Schmoll|first7=Ralf|last8=Uhrlandt|first8=Stefan|title=Rubber, 9.

Secondary amines like [[dicyclohexylamine]] can be used and result in even slower accelerants. Such a slow accelerant is required in applications in which the rubber is being cured onto a metal component to which it is required to adhere, such as the steel cords in vehicle tires.\n\n;Secondary (ultra-accelerants)\nSecondary or ultra-accelerants are used in small amounts to augment the behaviour of primary accelerants. They act to boost the cure speed and increase cross-link density, but also shorten the induction time, which can lead to premature vulcanization.<ref name=\"Ullmann's\" /> Chemically, they consist mainly of thio-carbonyl species such as [[Thiuram disulfide|thiurams]], [[dithiocarbamate]]s, [[xanthate]]s and organic [[thiourea]]s; aromatic [[guanidine]]s are also used.

However, they can be used as primary accelerants in compounds with fewer curing site such as [[EPDM rubber|EPDM]]. Xanthates (principally, zinc isopropyl xanthate) are important in the vulcanization of latex, which is cured at relatively low temperature (100-120&nbsp;\u00b0C), and therefore needs an inherently rapid accelerant. The major thiurams used are TMTD ([[Thiram|tetramethylthiuram disulfide]]) and TETD ([[Disulfiram|tetraethylthiuram disulfide]]).

In practice, mixing can result in melting the sulfur (melting point 115&nbsp;\u00b0C for S<sub>8</sub>).  At these temperatures vulcanization can begin prematurely, which is often undesirable, as the mixture may still need to be pumped and moulded into its final form before it sets solid. Premature vulcanization is often called \"'''scorch'''\". Scorch can be prevented by the use of retarders or inhibitors, which increase the [[induction period]] before vulcanization commences and thus provide scorch resistance. A retarder slows both the onset and rate of vulcanization, whereas inhibitors only delay the start of vulcanization and do not affect the rate to any great extent.<ref name=\"DeWhite2001\">{{cite book|author1=Sadhan K.

He wrote the story of the discovery in 1853 in his autobiographical book ''Gum-Elastica''. Here is Goodyear's account of the [[invention]], taken from ''Gum-Elastica''. Although the book is an [[autobiography]], Goodyear chose to write it in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] so that {{em|the inventor}} and {{em|he}} referred to in the text are the author. He describes the scene in a rubber [[factory]] where his brother worked:\n\n<blockquote>The inventor made experiments to ascertain the effect of heat on the same compound that had decomposed in the mail-bags and other articles. He was surprised to find that the specimen, being carelessly brought into contact with a hot stove, charred like leather.</blockquote>\n\nGoodyear goes on to describe how his discovery was not readily accepted.\n\n<blockquote>He directly inferred that if the process of charring could be stopped at the right point, it might divest the gum of its native adhesiveness throughout, which would make it better than the native gum. Upon further trial with heat, he was further convinced of the correctness of this inference, by finding that the India rubber could not be melted in boiling sulfur at any heat, but always charred.\n\nHe made another trial of heating a similar fabric before an open fire. The same effect, that of charring the gum, followed. There were further indications of success in producing the desired result, as upon the edge of the charred portion appeared a line or border, that was not charred, but perfectly cured.</blockquote>\n\nGoodyear then goes on to describe how he moved to [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] and carried out a series of systematic experiments to optimize the curing of rubber, collaborating with [[Nathaniel Hayward]].\n\n<blockquote>On ascertaining to a certainty that he had found the object of his search and much more, and that the new substance was proof against cold and the solvent of the native gum, he felt himself amply repaid for the past, and quite indifferent to the trials of the future.</blockquote>\n\n=== Later developments ===\nThe discovery of the rubber-sulfur reaction revolutionized the use and applications of rubber, changing the face of the [[Industry|industrial]] world. Formerly, the only way to seal a small gap between moving machine parts was to use [[leather]] soaked in oil. This practice was acceptable only at moderate pressures, but above a certain point, machine designers were forced to compromise between the extra [[friction]] generated by tighter packing and greater leakage of steam. Vulcanized rubber solved this problem. It could be formed to precise shapes and dimensions, it accepted moderate to large deformations under load and recovered quickly to its original dimensions once the load is removed. These exceptional qualities, combined with good durability and lack of stickiness, were critical for an effective sealing material. Further experiments in the processing and compounding of rubber by Hancock and his colleagues led to a more reliable process.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAround 1900, [[disulfiram]] was introduced as a vulcanizing agent, and became widely used.<ref name=Kragh>{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=Helge |title=From Disulfiram to Antabuse: The Invention of a Drug |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |date=2008 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=82\u201388 |url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/v33-2/v33-2%20p82-88.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905 [[George Oenslager]] discovered that a derivative of [[aniline]] called [[thiocarbanilide]] accelerated the reaction of sulfur with rubber, leading to shorter cure times and [[Energy conservation|reducing energy consumption]]. This breakthrough was almost as fundamental to the rubber industry as Goodyear's sulfur cure. Accelerators made the cure process faster, improved the reliability of the process and enabled vulcanization to be applied to synthetic polymers. One year after his discovery, Oenslager had found hundreds of applications for his additive. Thus, the science of accelerators and retarders was born. An accelerator speeds up the cure reaction, while a retarder delays it. A typical retarder is [[cyclohexylthiophthalimide]]. In the subsequent century chemists developed other accelerators and ultra-accelerators, which are used in the manufacture of most modern rubber goods.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Chemical processes]]\n[[Category:Rubber]]\n[[Category:1837 introductions]]\n", "text_old": "{{About| processes specifically based around sulfur| a wider range of processes |Vulcanization}}\n\n[[File:VulcanizationMold1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Worker placing tire in a mold before vulcanization.]]\n\n'''Sulfur vulcanization''' is a [[chemical process]] for converting [[natural rubber]] or related [[polymer]]s into materials of a variety of hardness, elasticity, and mechanical durability by heating them with [[sulfur]]<ref name=\"James E.

Secondary amines like [[dicyclohexylamine]] can be used and result in even slower accelerants. Such a slow accelerant is required in applications in which the rubber is being cured onto a metal component to which it is required to adhere, such as the steel cords in vehicle tires.\n\n;Secondary (ultra-accelerants)\nSecondary or ultra-accelerants are used in small amounts to augment the behaviour of primary accelerants. They act to boost the cure speed and increase cross-link density, but also shorten the induction time, which can lead to premature vulcanization.<ref name=\"Ullmann's\" /> Chemically, they consist mainly of thio-carbonyl species such as [[Thiuram disulfide|thiurams]], [[dithiocarbamate]]s, [[xanthate]]s and organic [[thiourea]]s; aromatic [[guanidine]]s are also used. These compounds need to be combined with activators, typically zinc ions, in order to be fully active.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\">\nThiuram.svg | [[Thiuram disulfide|Thiuram]]\nZn(Me2dtc)2Improved.png | Zinc bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate) ([[Zinc bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate)|Ziram]])\n1,3-difenylguanidine t.png | diphenylguanidine (DPG)\n</gallery>\n\nSecondary accelerants have very fast vulcanization speeds with minimal induction time, making them unsuitable as primary accelerants in highly unsaturated rubbers such as NR or SBR. However, they can be used as primary accelerants in compounds with fewer curing site such as [[EPDM rubber|EPDM]]. Xanthates (principally, zinc isopropyl xanthate) are important in the vulcanization of latex, which is cured at relatively low temperature (100-120&nbsp;\u00b0C), and therefore needs an inherently rapid accelerant. The major thiurams used are TMTD ([[Thiram|tetramethylthiuram disulfide]]) and TETD ([[Disulfiram|tetraethylthiuram disulfide]]). The major dithiocarbamates are the zinc salts ZDMC ([[zinc bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate)|zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate]]), ZDEC (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate) and ZDBC (zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate).\n\n===Activators===\nActivators consist of various metal salts, fatty acids, as well as nitrogen-containing bases, the most important these being [[zinc oxide]].

In practice, mixing can result in melting the sulfur (melting point 115&nbsp;\u00b0C for S<sub>8</sub>).  At these temperatures vulcanization can begin prematurely, which is often undesirable, as the mixture may still need to be pumped and moulded into its final form before it sets solid. Premature vulcanization is often called \"'''scorch'''\". Scorch can be prevented by the use of retarders or inhibitors, which increase the [[induction period]] before vulcanization commences and thus provide scorch resistance. A retarder slows both the onset and rate of vulcanization, whereas inhibitors only delay the start of vulcanization and do not affect the rate to any great extent.<ref name=\"DeWhite2001\">{{cite book|author1=Sadhan K.

The auto industry consumes a substantial fraction of natural and synthetic rubber. Reclaimed rubber has altered properties and is unsuitable for use in many products, including tires. Tires and other vulcanized products are potentially amenable to devulcanization, but this technology has not produced material that can supplant unvulcanized materials. The main problem is that the carbon-sulfur linkages are not readily broken, without the input of costly reagents and heat. Thus, more than half of scrap rubber is simply burned for fuel.<ref>Myhre, Marvin; MacKillop, Duncan A. \"Rubber Recycling\" ''Rubber Chemistry and Technology'' (2002), volume 75, number 3, pp 429\u2013474.  {{DOI|10.5254/1.3547678}}</ref>\n\n==Inverse vulcanization==\nAlthough polymeric sulfur reverts to its monomer at room temperature, polymers consisting mostly of sulfur can be stabilized with organic linkers such as 1,3\u2010diisopropenylbenzene.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=Woo Jin |last2=Griebel |first2=Jared J. |last3=Kim |first3=Eui Tae |last4=Yoon |first4=Hyunsik |last5=Simmonds |first5=Adam G. |last6=Ji |first6=Hyun Jun |last7=Dirlam |first7=Philip T. |last8=Glass |first8=Richard S. |last9=Wie |first9=Jeong Jae |last10=Nguyen |first10=Ngoc A. |last11=Guralnick |first11=Brett W. |last12=Park |first12=Jungjin |last13=Somogyi |first13=\u00c1rp\u00e1d |last14=Theato |first14=Patrick |last15=Mackay |first15=Michael E. |last16=Sung |first16=Yung-Eun |last17=Char |first17=Kookheon |last18=Pyun |first18=Jeffrey |title=The Use of Elemental Sulfur as an Alternative Feedstock for Polymeric Materials |journal=Nature Chemistry |year= 2013 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=518\u2013524 |doi=10.1038/nchem.1624|pmid=23695634 }}</ref> This process is called inverse vulcanization and produces polymers where sulfur is the main component.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=Darryl A. |title=Sulfur and Its Role In Modern Materials Science |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=2016 |volume=55 |issue=50 |pages=15486\u201315502 |doi=10.1002/anie.201604615|pmid=27860133 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] of rubber has been carried out since prehistoric times.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite journal|last1=Hosler|first1=D.|title=Prehistoric Polymers: Rubber Processing in Ancient Mesoamerica|journal=Science|date=18 June 1999|volume=284|issue=5422|pages=1988\u20131991|doi=10.1126/science.284.5422.1988|pmid=10373117}}</ref> The name of the first major civilization in Guatemala and Mexico, the [[Olmec]], means 'rubber people' in the [[Aztec]] language.

He wrote the story of the discovery in 1853 in his autobiographical book ''Gum-Elastica''. Here is Goodyear's account of the [[invention]], taken from ''Gum-Elastica''. Although the book is an [[autobiography]], Goodyear chose to write it in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] so that {{em|the inventor}} and {{em|he}} referred to in the text are the author. He describes the scene in a rubber [[factory]] where his brother worked:\n\n<blockquote>The inventor made experiments to ascertain the effect of heat on the same compound that had decomposed in the mail-bags and other articles. He was surprised to find that the specimen, being carelessly brought into contact with a hot stove, charred like leather.</blockquote>\n\nGoodyear goes on to describe how his discovery was not readily accepted.\n\n<blockquote>He directly inferred that if the process of charring could be stopped at the right point, it might divest the gum of its native adhesiveness throughout, which would make it better than the native gum. Upon further trial with heat, he was further convinced of the correctness of this inference, by finding that the India rubber could not be melted in boiling sulfur at any heat, but always charred.\n\nHe made another trial of heating a similar fabric before an open fire. The same effect, that of charring the gum, followed. There were further indications of success in producing the desired result, as upon the edge of the charred portion appeared a line or border, that was not charred, but perfectly cured.</blockquote>\n\nGoodyear then goes on to describe how he moved to [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] and carried out a series of systematic experiments to optimize the curing of rubber, collaborating with [[Nathaniel Hayward]].\n\n<blockquote>On ascertaining to a certainty that he had found the object of his search and much more, and that the new substance was proof against cold and the solvent of the native gum, he felt himself amply repaid for the past, and quite indifferent to the trials of the future.</blockquote>\n\n=== Later developments ===\nThe discovery of the rubber-sulfur reaction revolutionized the use and applications of rubber, changing the face of the [[Industry|industrial]] world. Formerly, the only way to seal a small gap between moving machine parts was to use [[leather]] soaked in oil. This practice was acceptable only at moderate pressures, but above a certain point, machine designers were forced to compromise between the extra [[friction]] generated by tighter packing and greater leakage of steam. Vulcanized rubber solved this problem. It could be formed to precise shapes and dimensions, it accepted moderate to large deformations under load and recovered quickly to its original dimensions once the load is removed. These exceptional qualities, combined with good durability and lack of stickiness, were critical for an effective sealing material. Further experiments in the processing and compounding of rubber by Hancock and his colleagues led to a more reliable process.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAround 1900, [[disulfiram]] was introduced as a vulcanizing agent, and became widely used.<ref name=Kragh>{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=Helge |title=From Disulfiram to Antabuse: The Invention of a Drug |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |date=2008 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=82\u201388 |url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/v33-2/v33-2%20p82-88.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905 [[George Oenslager]] discovered that a derivative of [[aniline]] called [[thiocarbanilide]] accelerated the reaction of sulfur with rubber, leading to shorter cure times and [[Energy conservation|reducing energy consumption]]. This breakthrough was almost as fundamental to the rubber industry as Goodyear's sulfur cure. Accelerators made the cure process faster, improved the reliability of the process and enabled vulcanization to be applied to synthetic polymers. One year after his discovery, Oenslager had found hundreds of applications for his additive. Thus, the science of accelerators and retarders was born. An accelerator speeds up the cure reaction, while a retarder delays it. A typical retarder is [[cyclohexylthiophthalimide]]. In the subsequent century chemists developed other accelerators and ultra-accelerators, which are used in the manufacture of most modern rubber goods.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Chemical processes]]\n[[Category:Rubber]]\n[[Category:1837 introductions]]\n", "name_user": "Wutwut1n1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChemistry", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_vulcanization"}

At one point Alloy was a major producer of [[quarter inch cartridge|QIC]] format [[tape drive]]s and other computer peripherals. In the mid 1990s the company was no longer profitable.

Alloy was initially founded to supply hard drive and tape backup systems for [[S-100 bus]] computers running [[CP/M]].  When [[IBM]]'s PC was released, Alloy provided hard drive storage and tape backup solutions for the new system. Alloy Computer Products later developed and marketed multi-user computer systems for the emerging microcomputer marketplace. Alloy later developed printing accelerator hardware.\n\nIn 1984 Alloy developed the PC-Slave card which consisted of an X86 (8086 or V20) processor, either 256k or 1 Meg of memory and two serial ports.  Later, an Intel 80286-based version was released, called the PC-Slave/286.  These cards used RTNX (later renamed NTNX) to allow the host computer to provide disk storage and printing support.  Dumb PC-Term terminals were attached to the PC-Slave to allow the running of DOS programs.  At the time, using this solution was more cost-effective than using separate networked computers, but as computers and networking hardware became cheaper and cheaper, Alloy's advantage was overshadowed by the disadvantages of not being able to support graphics, etc.   Alloy also developed a PC-Bus expansion bus system to allow the install of up to 32 PC-Slave cards attached to a single host PC.  This allowed 32 user networks to be created, but each network was completely standalone.  \n\nBased on the knowledge learned by developing the PC-Slave card, in 1985 Alloy developed the [[3B1|DOS-73]] co-processor board for the [[AT&T]] Unix-PC, allowing AT&T's Unix based Unix-PC (aka the [[3B1|PC-7300]] and the [[3B1]]) to run [[MS-DOS]] based programs.  \n\nAlloy grew to $50 million in annual sales by 1986 and executed a successful IPO in June of that year. Alloy had an installed base of 150,000 users by the early 1990s, largely small businesses, comprising a relatively significant portion of the multi-user DOS marketplace. One DOS based computer was equipped with a multi-user/multi-tasking operating system called \"386/MultiWare\" which along with specialized hardware could provide serial connectivity to up to 20 dumb terminal clients. Each dumb terminal was connected to a session running up to 8 concurrent DOS virtual machines, all running on the host computer.  If a problem arose with a single DOS virtual machine it could be rebooted without an effect on other terminals attached. Later \"MultiNode\" was introduced to meet client needs using the Novell network operating system allowing both Client/Server network connectivity as well as serial terminal users.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Multiuser DOS Federation]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.alloy.com.au/ Corporate website].\n* [http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/australian-alloy-forges-a-winning-technical-connection/2005/11/03/1130823342395.html Buyout info].\n* [http://www.textfiles.com/digitize/items/1983-alloy-computer-products/ Scans] of magazine advertisements from 1983 illustrating their then-current product line.\n* [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_1992_June_15/ai_12370599] [https://web.archive.org/web/20121103000235/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8746341.html] Alloy files for bankruptcy.\n* [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_1993_March_1/ai_13731142] Alloy Computer Products to market Micro Advice's JETstream! printer accelerator card\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121033454/http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=1164] AT&T Unix-PC system\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies of Australia]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Framingham, Massachusetts]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2019}}{{Citation style|date=October 2019}}{{Infobox company\n| name                = Alloy Computer Products\n| logo                = Alloy-logo.jpg\n| type                = \n| industry            = [[Information technology]]\n| fate                = \n| founded             = {{Start date and age|1979}} in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]] \n| founder             = \n| hq_location_city    = Near [[Melbourne]]\n| hq_location_country = Australia\n| key_people          = \n| products            = Networking and [[VoIP]] products\n| num_employees       = \n| num_employees_year  = \n| revenue             =\n| homepage            = {{URL|http://www.alloy.com.au/}}\n}}\n'''Alloy Computer Products''' is an Australian manufacturer of [[information technology]] products based near [[Melbourne]].

The most abundant genera found were 48 species of Puccinia and 12 species of Uromyces {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Source and links ==\n* https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Attraction_Review-g2350619-d15873720-Reviews-Ketmen_Ridge-Almaty_Region.html\n* \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 / \u0422. \u041f. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.). \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a: \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, 2011. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-5-9523-0332-4}}\n* \u041a\u0435\u0442\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442 // \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b: \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b, 2005. \u2014 \u0422.

Bryant arrived in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]] on February 8, 1954, and began cleaning house. He felt that many of the players on the team were weak and not properly trained or coached. He decided that his players needed a camp away from the distractions on campus; thus, he arranged for the camp to be held in the small [[Texas Hill Country|Hill Country]] town of Junction, where Texas A&M had a 411-acre (1.7-km<sup>2</sup>) adjunct campus (now the [[Texas Tech University Center at Junction]]).\n\nAt the time of the camp, the Hill Country was experiencing an epic [[drought]] and [[heat wave]].  The drought, the worst in the recorded history of the region, had lasted four years and would last another two after the camp was over. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]], all 10 days of the camp had hot temperatures with a few days topping 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C).\n\nPractices began before dawn and usually lasted all day with meetings in the evening until 11:00 pm.  The oppressive heat combined with the brutal practice schedule was too much for many of the players.  Each day, fewer and fewer players would be at practice, as many players quit the team from illness or disgust. The situation was compounded by Bryant's refusal to allow [[water break]]s. This practice, which is now widely recognized as dangerous, was at the time commonly employed by coaches at all levels in an attempt to \"toughen up\" their players. The only relief provided the players were two towels soaked in cold water; one towel was to be shared by the offensive players, and one by the defense. One of the Junction Boys, future [[NFL]] coach [[Jack Pardee]], would later say in an interview that it was not unheard of for players to sweat away 10% of their body weight.\n\n==List of \"survivors\"==\nBy the end of the 10-day camp, only a fraction of those who started were left.  The list of \"survivors\" varies from 27 to 38.

In fact, a smaller number actually went to the camp. Although Bryant started out with over 100 players on the roster, many had already quit or been cut by the time of the Junction camp. Accounts of the exact number who left for Junction vary, but all the survivors insist that it was less than 100.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn 1954, Richard Vick had his photograph taken with Bryant. The photo was featured on the cover of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Today, the photo of Vick and Bryant, as well as Vick's uniform, can be seen at the Texas A&M Sports Museum at [[Kyle Field]].\n\nIn 2008, 19 of the Junction Boys had a 54th anniversary reunion at a ranch in [[Brenham, Texas]]. The remaining members have agreed to have a reunion every 5 years.\n\nIn April 2010, the surviving Junction Boys were honored by the Texas Children's Cancer Center at \"An Evening with Texas Legends\" in Houston, Texas, at the Hilton Americas Hotel. They were interviewed by sportswriter Mickey Herskowitz at the event.\n\n==Impact==\nAlthough the \"survivors\", as they came to be called, were mentally tougher after the experience, this new strength did not translate into immediate success on the field.  In 1954, Texas A&M won only one game against nine losses (1-9-0 record), the only losing season in Bryant's 38 years as a head coach. In 1956, however, and in spite of a postseason ban, the team finished 9-0-1, punctuated with a win against rival Texas and an end to their Southwest Conference championship drought.\n\n==1954 schedule and results==\n*vs. Texas Tech     lost 9-41\n*vs. Oklahoma State lost 6-14\n*at Georgia         won 6-0\n*at Houston         lost 7-10\n*vs. TCU            lost 20-21\n*at Baylor          lost 7-20\n*vs. Arkansas       lost 7-14\n*at SMU             lost 3-6\n*vs. Rice           lost 19-29\n*at Texas           lost 13-22\n\nIn 1955, Texas A&M went 7-2-1, and in 1956, the team went 9-0-1 and won the [[Southwest Conference]].\n\nTwo of the Junction Boys, [[Jack Pardee]] and [[Gene Stallings]], went on to become head coaches in the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Pardee was a two-time All-Pro with the [[1971 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] [[1963 Los Angeles Rams season|(1963)]] and the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] [[1971 Washington Redskins season|(1971)]]. Stallings also became Texas A&M head coach, and his Aggie team beat Bryant's Alabama team in the 1968 [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]]. He later took over Bryant's [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Crimson Tide]] and won a national championship in [[1992 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1992]] - Alabama's first national championship since Bryant's death.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Texas A&M Aggies football navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Texas A&M Aggies football players]]\n[[Category:Nicknamed groups of American football players]]\n\nhttps://www.freemancitronelle.com/notices/Joseph-Rowell\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=December 2007}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Junction Boys''' were the \"survivors\" of [[Texas A&M Aggies football]] coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant's]] 10-day summer camp in [[Junction, Texas]], beginning September 1, 1954.

In fact, a smaller number actually went to the camp. Although Bryant started out with over 100 players on the roster, many had already quit or been cut by the time of the Junction camp. Accounts of the exact number who left for Junction vary, but all the survivors insist that it was less than 100.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn 1954, Richard Vick had his photograph taken with Bryant. The photo was featured on the cover of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Today, the photo of Vick and Bryant, as well as Vick's uniform, can be seen at the Texas A&M Sports Museum at [[Kyle Field]].\n\nIn 2008, 19 of the Junction Boys had a 54th anniversary reunion at a ranch in [[Brenham, Texas]]. The remaining members have agreed to have a reunion every 5 years.\n\nIn April 2010, the surviving Junction Boys were honored by the Texas Children's Cancer Center at \"An Evening with Texas Legends\" in Houston, Texas, at the Hilton Americas Hotel. They were interviewed by sportswriter Mickey Herskowitz at the event.\n\n==Impact==\nAlthough the \"survivors\", as they came to be called, were mentally tougher after the experience, this new strength did not translate into immediate success on the field.  In 1954, Texas A&M won only one game against nine losses (1-9-0 record), the only losing season in Bryant's 38 years as a head coach. In 1956, however, and in spite of a postseason ban, the team finished 9-0-1, punctuated with a win against rival Texas and an end to their Southwest Conference championship drought.\n\n==1954 schedule and results==\n*vs. Texas Tech     lost 9-41\n*vs. Oklahoma State lost 6-14\n*at Georgia         won 6-0\n*at Houston         lost 7-10\n*vs. TCU            lost 20-21\n*at Baylor          lost 7-20\n*vs. Arkansas       lost 7-14\n*at SMU             lost 3-6\n*vs. Rice           lost 19-29\n*at Texas           lost 13-22\n\nIn 1955, Texas A&M went 7-2-1, and in 1956, the team went 9-0-1 and won the [[Southwest Conference]].\n\nTwo of the Junction Boys, [[Jack Pardee]] and [[Gene Stallings]], went on to become head coaches in the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Pardee was a two-time All-Pro with the [[1971 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] [[1963 Los Angeles Rams season|(1963)]] and the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] [[1971 Washington Redskins season|(1971)]]. Stallings also became Texas A&M head coach, and his Aggie team beat Bryant's Alabama team in the 1968 [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]]. He later took over Bryant's [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Crimson Tide]] and won a national championship in [[1992 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1992]] - Alabama's first national championship since Bryant's death.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Texas A&M Aggies football navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Texas A&M Aggies football players]]\n[[Category:Nicknamed groups of American football players]]\n\nhttps://www.freemancitronelle.com/notices/Joseph-Rowell\n", "name_user": "BryantDBrown", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eList of \"survivors\" Individual Player profiles", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_Boys"}

It is similar in character to [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI) in that both techniques are relatively soft (low fragmentation) ways of obtaining ions of large molecules in the gas phase, though MALDI typically produces far fewer multi-charged ions.\n\nMALDI methodology is a three-step process. First, the sample is mixed with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate. Second, a pulsed [[laser]] irradiates the sample, triggering [[ablation]] and [[desorption]] of the sample and matrix material.

This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several [[conjugated double bond]]s, as seen in the structure of [[cinnamic acid]].

A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both [[hydrophobic]] and water-soluble ([[hydrophilic]]) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This solution is spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte are said to be co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality mass spectrum of the analyte of interest.\n\nIn analysis of biological systems, Inorganic salts, which are also part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process.

The TOF measurement procedure is also ideally suited to the MALDI ionization process since the pulsed laser takes individual 'shots' rather than working in continuous operation. MALDI-TOF instruments are often equipped with a [[reflectron]] (an \"ion mirror\")  that reflects ions using an electric field. This increases the ion flight path, thereby increasing time of flight between ions of different m/z and increasing resolution.

MALDI/TOF is a diagnostic tool with much potential because it allows for the rapid identification of proteins and changes to proteins without the cost or computing power of [[Next-generation sequencing|sequencing]] nor the skill or time needed to solve a crystal structure in [[X-ray crystallography]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nOne example of this is [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects the bowels of premature infants. The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of [[sepsis]], and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC. There is hope that a similar technique could be used as a quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.<ref>Sim, K.; Shaw, A. G.; Randell, P.; Cox, M. J.; McClure, Z. E.; Li, M.

MALDI/TOF serves as a method for determining the [[drug resistance]] of bacteria, especially to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|\u03b2-lactams]] (Penicillin family). The MALDI/TOF detects the presence of carbapenemases, which indicates drug resistance to standard antibiotics.

A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both [[hydrophobic]] and water-soluble ([[hydrophilic]]) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This solution is spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte are said to be co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality mass spectrum of the analyte of interest.\n\nIn analysis of biological systems, Inorganic salts, which are also part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process.

MALDI-TOF instruments are often equipped with a [[reflectron]] (an \"ion mirror\")  that reflects ions using an electric field. This increases the ion flight path, thereby increasing time of flight between ions of different m/z and increasing resolution.

MALDI/TOF is a diagnostic tool with much potential because it allows for the rapid identification of proteins and changes to proteins without the cost or computing power of [[Next-generation sequencing|sequencing]] nor the skill or time needed to solve a crystal structure in [[X-ray crystallography]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nOne example of this is [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects the bowels of premature infants. The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of [[sepsis]], and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC. There is hope that a similar technique could be used as a quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.<ref>Sim, K.; Shaw, A. G.; Randell, P.; Cox, M. J.; McClure, Z. E.; Li, M.

MALDI/TOF serves as a method for determining the [[drug resistance]] of bacteria, especially to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|\u03b2-lactams]] (Penicillin family). The MALDI/TOF detects the presence of carbapenemases, which indicates drug resistance to standard antibiotics. It is predicted that this could serve as a method for identifying a bacterium as drug resistant in as little as three hours. This technique could help physicians decide whether to prescribe more aggressive antibiotics initially.<ref>Hrab\u00e1k, Jaroslav (2015). \"Detection of Carbapenemases Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Meropenem Hydrolysis Assay\".
