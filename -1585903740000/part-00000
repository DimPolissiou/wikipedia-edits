The choir was simply the east part of the nave, and was fenced off by a screen or low railing, called ''cancelli'', which is where the English word [[chancel]] comes from. The development of the architectural feature known as the choir is the result of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] development brought about by the end of persecutions under [[Constantine the Great]] and the rise of [[monasticism]]. The word \"choir\" is first used by members of the [[Latin Church]]. [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Honorius of Autun]] write that the term is derived from the \"corona\", the circle of clergy or singers who surrounded the altar.\n\nWhen first introduced, the choir was attached to the [[Bema#Christianity|bema]], the elevated platform in the center of the nave on which were placed seats for the higher clergy and a [[lectern]] for scripture readings. This arrangement can still be observed at the [[Basilica]] of [[St. Mary Major]] in Rome. Over time, the bema (or [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]]) and choir moved eastward to their current position. In some churches, such as [[Westminster Cathedral]], the choir is arranged in the [[apse]] behind the [[altar]].\n\nThe architectural details of the choir developed in response to its function as the place where the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] was chanted by the monastic brotherhood or the [[chapter house|chapter]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]]. The chancel was regarded as the clergy's part of the church, and any choirboys from a choir school counted as part of the clergy for this purpose. After the Reformation, when the number of clergy present even in large churches and cathedrals tended to reduce, and lay singing choirs became more frequent, there were often objections to placing them in the traditional choir stalls in the chancel. The [[pulpit]] and [[lectern]] are also usually found at the front of the choir, though both Catholic and Protestant churches have sometimes moved the pulpit to the nave for better audibility. The [[organ (instrument)|organ]] may be located here, or in a loft elsewhere in the church. Some [[cathedral]]s have a retro-choir behind the High Altar, opening eastward towards the [[chapel]]s ([[chantry|chantries]]) in the eastern extremity.\n\nAfter the Reformation Protestant churches generally moved the altar (now often called the [[communion table]]) forward, typically to the front of the chancel, and often used lay choirs who were placed in a gallery at the west end. The choir and rear of deep chancels became little used in churches surviving from the Middle Ages, and new churches very often omitted one. With the emphasis on sermons, and their audibility, some churches simply converted their chancels to seat part of the congregation. In 19th-century England one of the battles of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], the architectural wing of the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s in the [[Church of England]], was to restore the chancel, including the choir, as a necessary part of a church. By pushing the altar back to its medieval position and having the choir used by a lay choir, they were largely successful in this, although the harder end of the [[High Church]] objected to allowing a large group of laity into the chancel.<ref>White, James F., ''The Cambridge Movement: The Ecclesiologists and the Gothic Revival'', 93\u201397, 1962 (2004 reprint), Wipf and Stock Publishers, {{ISBN|1592449379}}, 9781592449378, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zDhLAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA94 google books]</ref> Different approaches to worship in the 20th century again tended to push altars in larger churches forward, to be closer to the congregation, and the chancel again risks being a less used area of the church.\n\n==Seating==\n[[Image:Stalles.eglise.Anellau.png|thumb|Illustration showing monk's stalls at Anellau, France, 14th century]]\nThe choir area is occupied by sometimes finely carved and decorated wooden seats known as ''choir stalls'', where the clergy sit, stand or kneel during services. The choir may be furnished either with long benches ([[pew]]s) or individual choir stalls. There may be several rows of seating running parallel to the walls of the church.\n\nThe use of choir stalls (as opposed to benches) is more traditional in [[monasteries]] and [[collegiate church]]es. Monastic choir stalls are often fitted with seats that fold up when the [[Monasticism|monastics]] stand and fold down when they sit. Often the hinged seat will have a [[misericord]] (small wooden seat) on the underside on which he can lean while standing during the long services. The upper part of the monk's stall is so shaped as to provide a headrest while sitting, and arm rests when standing. Monasteries will often have strict rules as to when the monastics may sit and when they must stand during the services.\n\nChoir benches are more common in [[parish church]]es. Each bench may have padded [[kneeler]]s attached to the back of it so that the person behind may kneel at the appropriate times during services.

Surjit goes to Thakur's house in order to get Manjit to marry his sister. The Thakur humiliates him; making him, a vegetarian, eat dog food and beg on his knees. Surjit does so and is told to go home and make wedding preparations. The next day, Thakur visits Surjit and kills him and his wife in broad daylight. Surjit's last dying wish is that his two sons Raju ([[Ajay Devgn]]) and Kishan ([[Arshad Warsi]]) must marry Thakur's and his brother's two daughters Meena ([[Shabana Raza]]) and Preeti ([[Mayuri Kango]]) and they must have the Thakur come begging to their doorstep for this marriage alliance. Surjit's sister agrees to this and accordingly brings up the two children. Unfortunately, Raju goes missing leaving her alone to bring up Kishan. Years later they are reunited when Raju returns home and they join together to fulfill Surjit's last wish. What they do not know is Meena and Preeti are to be married to Minister Khurana's two sons and nothing in the world is going to make the Thakur change his mind.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Surjit does so and is told to go home and make wedding preparations. The next day, Thakur visits Surjit and kills him and his wife in broad daylight. Surjit's last dying wish is that his two sons Raju ([[Ajay Devgn]]) and Kishan ([[Arshad Warsi]]) must get married to Thakur's and his brother's two daughters Meena ([[Shabana Raza]]) and Preeti ([[Mayuri Kango]]) and they must have the Thakur come begging to their doorstep for this marriage alliance.

In 2011, he discussed the story with then-assistant director Narayanan, who decided to make his directorial debut with it. By 2016, Faasil and Pothan, both of whom had worked closely with Narayanan and Pushkaran on previous films, had agreed to co-produce the film.

Saji's father had married Bonny's mother, who then gave birth to Bobby and Franky. When their father dies, the mother abandons the boys to join a religious mission, leaving Saji to be the man of the house. Saji has anger management issues, and often gets into fights with Bobby, an unemployed youngster. Franky is ashamed of Saji and Bobby but gets along well with Bonny, who is [[muteness|mute]].\n\nBobby starts dating Baby, a girl who lives nearby. He eventually proposes to her, but asks him to talk to her family first. Bobby asks Saji to accompany him, and together they go to meet Shammi, Baby's brother-in-law. Shammi rejects the proposal and ridicules the poor reputation that Bobby's family has among the villagers. Saji tries to console Bobby and asks him to get a job, which  he does.\n\nOne day, a fight breaks out between Saji and Franky. Bonny, who is very protective of Franky, hits Saji. Ashamed, Saji leaves the house and takes to drinking with his friend Vijay. In his drunken stupor, Saji tries to commit suicide. Vijay saves him but loses his own life in the process.\nStricken with remorse, Saji goes to Vijay's house to apologise to his wife, Sathi, where he finds her in labour. He takes her to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby girl. Saji takes Sathi and her daughter to his house. Meanwhile, Bonny has brought home an American tourist, Nylah, who has been kicked out of her hotel for inviting Bonny there. Franky is pleased to have the two women in the house, as it gives them some semblance of being a regular family.\n\nSome time later, Saji approaches Shammi again and asks him to reconsider the proposal, which Shammi refuses. Baby makes up her mind to elope with Bobby. However, Shammi finds out about Baby's plans, and turns abusive and violent. He assaults Baby, her sister and their mother, holding them captive in their own home. When Baby fails to return his calls, Bobby get anxious and decides to check up on her. Bobby's brothers volunteer to help, and the four arrive at Baby's house. Together, they manage to trap Shammi with a fishing net and set the women free. Bobby and Baby are finally reunited and get married.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as Saji \nThe eldest of the four brothers, Saji is a wastrel who lives off the earnings of his hardworking migrant friend Vijay, and regularly gets into violent fights with his younger brothers.

Pushkaran came up with the idea for the film based on the time he spent in the village in his twenties. In 2011, he discussed the story with then-assistant director Narayanan, who decided to make his directorial debut with it. By 2016, Faasil and Pothan, both of whom had worked closely with Narayanan and Pushkaran on previous films, had agreed to co-produce the film. Narayanan then spent a year in Kumbalangi to understand its culture better, before shooting began in September 2018. \n\nThe film premiered on 24 May 2019 at the Habitat International Film Festival in Delhi, and was released in India and [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] territories on 7 February 2019.<ref name=\"Cinestaan\">{{cite web | title=Kumbalangi Nights Movie Duration: Film Length, Worldwide Release Date & Tech Specs | website=Cinestaan | url=https://www.cinestaan.com/movies/kumbalangi-nights-41485/technical-specifications | access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> It received widespread critical acclaim, and has been listed by several publications as one of the [[List of Malayalam films of the 2010s|best Malayalam films of the decade]].

Saji's father had married Bonny's mother, who then gave birth to Bobby and Franky. When their father dies, the mother abandons the boys to join a religious mission, leaving Saji to be the man of the house. Saji has anger management issues, and often gets into fights with Bobby, an unemployed youngster. Franky is ashamed of Saji and Bobby but gets along well with Bonny, who is [[muteness|mute]].\n\nBobby starts dating Baby, a girl who lives nearby. He eventually proposes to her, but asks him to talk to her family first. Bobby asks Saji to accompany him, and together they go to meet Shammi, Baby's brother-in-law. Shammi rejects the proposal and ridicules the poor reputation that Bobby's family has among the villagers. Saji tries to console Bobby and asks him to get a job, which  he does.\n\nOne day, a fight breaks out between Saji and Franky. Bonny, who is very protective of Franky, hits Saji.

Created by [[Eduard Zimmermann]], it aims to combat and solve crimes. The programme is currently presented by [[Rudi Cerne]]. It airs monthly, with 12 episodes in a year, on Wednesday at 8:15 PM.\n\nUntil December 2002 it was produced in cooperation with the Austrian public service broadcaster [[ORF (television)|ORF]] and [[Schweizer Fernsehen]], a division of the Swiss public broadcaster [[SRG SSR]].\n\nThe programme was adapted by the [[BBC]] as ''[[Crimewatch]]'' and for the US market as ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', and ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''. Other adaptations aired in Canada, Poland, Hungary and New Zealand.\n\nThe goal of the programme is to throw light on unsolved offences with the aid of viewers. Each episode contains three to five short films, each lasting about ten minutes, in which a real criminal case is reconstructed. The cases are mostly complex ones in which the criminals and chains of events are still unknown. In addition cases are discussed in the studio in which, for example, the identities of criminals or unknown murder victims are sought with the aid of a photo. Viewers can use the telephone or Internet to give information. According to a study by the programme's editorial department, about forty percent of cases shown on the programme are solved.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Aktenzeichen XY Log.svg|thumb|Logo used from the early-2000s until October 2014]]\nThe creator and first presenter of the programme was [[Eduard Zimmermann]]. After the programme's 300th episode he passed the presentership onto [[Butz Peters]], who fronted the show together with Zimmermann's daughter Sabine. Since 18 January 2002 ''Aktenzeichen XY'' has been presented by [[Rudi Cerne]].\n\nWith ''Aktenzeichen XY'' Eduard Zimmermann and ZDF succeeded in starting a TV format that had not existed worldwide until 1967. Although news reports had often shown [[photofit]]s, an actual independent show of this type was unknown at this time.\n\nThe idea came to Zimmermann during his work with the programme ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vorsicht Falle!|de}}'' (Eng: ''Beware, Trap!'') first broadcast in 1963, in which he warned the viewers of ''\"Nepper, Schlepper und Bauernf\u00e4nger\"'' (Eng: ''[[Scammer]]s, [[Hustler]]s and [[Conmen]]''). The viewers frequently sent him information regarding descriptions of the [[fraudster]]s on the programme. This gave him the idea to use the medium of TV to work with the police on unsolved crimes. In a biographical statement Zimmerman also admitted that his motivation for both programmes was partly a personal one; he himself is a victim of fraud.\n\n''Aktenzeichen XY'' was initially produced in the ZDF studios in [[Wiesbaden]], before moving to the FSM studios in [[Unterf\u00f6hring]] from 1969. From 15 March 1968, the Austrian public broadcaster ORF became a joint producer of ''Aktenzeichen XY'', with a segment focusing on Austria hosted first by [[Thadd\u00e4us Podgorski|Thadd\u00e4us \"Teddy\" Podgorski]] <small>([[:de:Thadd\u00e4us Podgorski|de]])</small> from 1968 until 1971, then by [[Peter Nidetzky]] <small>([[:de:Peter Nidetzky|de]])</small> from 1971 until 2002; which from 24 January 1969 was also joined by Schweizer Fernsehen (SF), with a segment focused on Switzerland hosted firstly by [[Werner Vetterli]] from 1969 until 1976, then by [[Konrad Toenz]] <small>([[:de:Konrad Toenz|de]])</small> from 1976 until 1998, and finally [[Stephan Schifferer]] from 1998 until 2002. \n\nAn attempt to extend ''Aktenzeichen XY'' beyond West Germany first took place on 18 July 1969, when ZDF and the Dutch public broadcaster [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] produced a joint episode featuring Dutch journalist [[Johan van Minnen]] from a studio in [[Enschede]], with NOS providing simultaneous translations from German to Dutch. That project was however unsuccessful due to [[language barrier]]s and was abandoned after said broadcast. A more successful attempt took place on 14 July 1972, when the West German branch of the [[American Forces Network]] (AFN) took part in a broadcast of ''Aktenzeichen XY'', with simultaneous interpretation into English on AFN TV. The first colour episode of ''Aktenzeichen XY'' aired on ZDF on 16 January 1975.\n\nOn 8 November 2002, the broadcast of the 350th episode was celebrated, after ''Aktenzeichen XY'' had been on the air for 35 years. Eduard Zimmermann was the guest of Rudi Cerne on his own programme, which concerned a several-decades-old crime that had particularly touched him - the [[Ursula Herrmann kidnapping]], about a young girl who was buried alive in a crate for extortion on 15 September 1981 (a case similar to the case of [[Barbara Mackle kidnapping|Barbara Jane Mackle]], although the ''Mail Online'' states that the inspiration actually came from ''[[Dirty Harry]]''), but suffocated in her prison because the ventilation duct was clogged up by leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1151002/Clint-Eastwood-film-Dirty-Harry-inspired-couple-kidnap-kill-girl-10-ransom-court-told.html|title=Clint Eastwood film 'Dirty Harry' inspired couple to kidnap and kill girl, 10, for ransom, court told|publisher=MailOnline}}</ref> At the time 3,228 cases had been featured on the show, of which 1,182 had been solved. 1,880 people had been sought and 914 of them had been caught. This included 624 murder cases.\n\nIn April 2012 the program received international public attention of a somewhat amusing nature when one of its case re-enactment performers, German actor {{Interlanguage link multi|Aaron Defant|de}}, was erroneously arrested in [[Stuttgart]] following his portrayal of a jewel robber in the episode of 14 March 2012 and a call to the police by one of the program's viewers. This misunderstanding was, however, cleared very swiftly.<ref>Jens Witte: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/0,1518,829134,00.html So gut wie echt]'', Spiegel Online, April 23, 2012.

McCann's parents and a [[Scotland Yard]] detective were also featured in the broadcast.

In 2014, ''Aktenzeichen XY'' is still watched by around six million viewers with an audience share by 20%.\n\n== Similar formats ==\n\n=== In Germany ===\nThe private broadcaster [[Sat.1]] and the public broadcaster [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] both produced similar programmes, known as ''Fahndungsakte'' (Eng: ''Manhunt Files'') and ''Kripo live'' respectively. SAT.1 cancelled ''Fahndungsakte'' in 2000 after three years' run due to low audience figures. MDR has had more success with ''[[Kripo live|Kripo Live]]'' since 1992, which concentrates on [[Kriminalpolizei]].\n\n=== Internationally ===\nThe format has been sold to several countries, including [[Great Britain]], where it has been known as ''[[Crimewatch]]'' since 1984, the [[Netherlands]] (''Opsporing verzocht'', 1975), [[Israel]] (''Crime Investigation'', 1986), [[Poland]] (\"Magazyn Kryminalny 997\", 1986-2010, 2017-; \"997: Fajbusiewicz na tropie\" 2013-2017), [[Hungary]] (''Az XY Akta Megoldatlan'', 1992) and Ireland (\"[[Crimecall]]\", 2005).\n\n''Aktenzeichen XY'' is the only German television format to have entered the American market, where it is known as ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' and was broadcast from 1988-2013.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Notes ==\n*''This article incorporates text translated from [[:de:Aktenzeichen XY... ungel\u00f6st|the corresponding German Wikipedia article]] as of March 25, 2006, which cites the following reference:''\n** Ummenhofer, Stefan and Thaidigsmann, Michael: ''Aktenzeichen XY . . . ungel\u00f6st &ndash; Kriminalit\u00e4t, Kontroverse, Kult'' {{ISBN|3-9809278-1-4}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{in lang|de}} Official site (ZDF): [http://aktenzeichenxy.zdf.de aktenzeichenxy.zdf.de] [[ZDF]] \n* {{in lang|de}} [http://www.zuschauerreaktionen.de zuschauerreaktionen.de Comprehensive fan site]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aktenzeichen XY ... ungelost}}\n[[Category:ORF (broadcaster)]]\n[[Category:ZDF television series]]\n[[Category:Non-fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1967 German television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1967 Austrian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1967 Swiss television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Austria]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Germany]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:1960s German television series]]\n[[Category:1970s German television series]]\n[[Category:1980s German television series]]\n[[Category:1990s German television series]]\n[[Category:2000s German television series]]\n[[Category:2010s German television series]]\n[[Category:German-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name          = Aktenzeichen XY ... ungel\u00f6st\n| image              = XY Logo.jpg\n| picture_format     = [[16:9]]\n| runtime            = 90 minutes \n| creator            = [[Eduard Zimmermann]]\n| executive_producer = Claus Legal\n| presenter          = [[Eduard Zimmermann]] (1967\u20131997)<br>Thadd\u00e4us \"Teddy\" Podgorski (1968\u20131971)<br>Peter Nidetzky (1971\u20132002)<br>[[Werner Vetterli]] (1969\u20131976)<br>Konrad Toenz (1979\u20131998)<br>Stephan Schifferer (1998\u20132002)<br/>Sabine Zimmermann (1987\u20132001)<br/>Butz Peters (1997\u20132001)<br>[[Rudi Cerne]] (2002\u2013&#65279;present)\n| narrated           = Wolfgang Gr\u00f6nebaum (1967\u20131989)<br>Michael Brennicke (1989\u20132019)\n| opentheme          = Heinz Kiessling<br/>Ernst-August Quelle \n| country            = Germany\n| language           = German\n| company            = Securitel, [[ZDF]]\n| network            = [[ZDF]]\n| first_aired        = {{start date|1967}}\u2013present \n| website            = http://aktenzeichenxy.zdf.de/ \n}}\n'''''Aktenzeichen XY&nbsp;... ungel\u00f6st''''' (German for \"Case number XY&nbsp;\u2026 Unsolved\") is an interactive [[German television|German television programme]] first broadcast on 20 October 1967 on [[ZDF]].
