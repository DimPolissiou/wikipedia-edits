The Nintendo eShop features downloadable games, demos, applications, streaming videos, consumer rating feedback, and other information on upcoming game releases.\n\n== Features ==\nThe Nintendo eShop icon appears as part of the HOME Menu on the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch. It requires an Internet connection to access. Initially, the two versions of the Nintendo eShop between the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U were independent of each other. Whilst this still remains largely true, after the implementation of Nintendo Network ID for the Nintendo 3DS, users that register the same ID account between both systems (currently at one time per console) could share certain data between both versions of the eShop, such as a combined funds balance, home address, saved credit and debit card information, [[wish list]] entries, and (formerly) linked Club Nintendo accounts. With the release of the Nintendo Switch version of the Nintendo eShop, balance stored on a Nintendo Network ID can be shared or transferred to a Nintendo Account to be spent on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe eShop stores a record of all downloads and purchases, allowing users to re-download previously purchased software at no additional charge, provided the software is still available on the eShop. Downloads can be started immediately, or they can be queued up and be pushed to the console while it is not in use or when the eShop application is not running.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> Users upgrading from a [[Nintendo DSi]] system can transfer their previous DSiWare purchases to the Nintendo 3DS, with limited exceptions, such as ''Flipnote Studio'' and the DSi web browser.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/gi_index.jsp?menu=applications%20and%20features&submenu=ctr-gi-apps-dsiware-wont-transfer|title=Nintendo 3DS \u2013 General Information|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> A December 2011 update enabled a similar feature allowing users to transfer their purchases between 3DS systems.<ref>[http://www.ripten.com/2011/10/21/3ds-november-firmware-update-details/ 3DS November Firmware Update Detailed | RipTen Videogame Blog].

The limit on system transfers has since been permanently waived.\n\n=== Currency ===\nUnlike the [[Wii Shop Channel]] and the [[DSi Shop]] services, which use [[Nintendo Points]] for purchases, the Nintendo eShop (on the [[Nintendo 3DS family]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch]]) lists pricing in the appropriate regional currencies, such as [[US dollar|dollars]] and [[euro]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6316665/the-3ds-eshop-what-you-need-to-know/?tag=updates%3Beditor%3Ball%3Btitle%3B4|title=The 3DS eShop: What You Need to Know|author=Giancarlo Varanini|work=GameSpot.com|publisher=CNet|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref> Accounts can be funded using either credit cards or prepaid cards purchased in stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/ht_apps.jsp|title=Nintendo 3DS \u2013 How To \u2013 Applications & Features|work=support.nintendo.com|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn China, Nintendo eShop released on December 10, 2019. However, due to Mainland China version developed by [[Tencent Games]] instead, it can only log in with [[WeChat]] account, and the account can be funded only by [[WeChat Pay]]. Also, with the limited of Chinese Version Nintendo Switch, the online purchase of DLC for games from other regions is disabled.\n\n=== Multitasking ===\nThe Nintendo eShop can be accessed any time via the HOME menu screen, even when a game is already running. This feature, however, is only available on [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. Background downloading is also possible via [[SpotPass]] while using any other application on the Wii U or Nintendo Switch, and while in Sleep Mode on [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|title=Nintendo Adding Playable Demos, eShop Web Interface and Sleep Mode Downloads to 3DS|url=http://kotaku.com/5854187/nintendo-adding-playable-demos-eshop-web-interface-and-sleep-mode-downloads-to-3ds|publisher=Kotaku}}</ref> Currently, 10 downloads can be queued at a time. The status of the downloads can be checked on the HOME menu under the \"Download Manager\". If notifications are activated, a pop-up message will appear in the top right corner of the screen to notify the user that a download is finished.\n\n=== Ratings ===\nThe Nintendo eShop supports user reviews of games, applications, and other media. After an eShop title has been acquired and used for at least one hour, users can then submit a review consisting of a crescent range of one to five \"stars\", representing the title's quality. Users can also categorize games by age and gender, and as being suitable for either hardcore or casual gamers. The Wii U had [[Miiverse]] integration for user reviews on the Nintendo eShop.\n\n=== Deluxe Digital Promotion and Nintendo Network Premium ===\n[[File:Nintendo Network Premium Logo.png|thumb|right|220px|Nintendo Network Premium logo]]\n{{main|Nintendo Network}}\nOn September 13, 2012, during a Japanese [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation, Satoru Iwata introduced a new service called Deluxe Digital Promotion (North America)/Nintendo Network Premium (Europe, Australia and Japan). It was a loyalty program similar to [[PlayStation Plus]] offered on [[PlayStation Network]] and Xbox Live Gold on [[Xbox Live]].\n\nConsumers who purchased the Wii U Deluxe Pack in North America, or the Wii U Premium Pack in Europe and Japan, would receive a free two-year subscription to this service which lets [[Wii U]] owners receive points for each digital purchase.\n\nMembers who bought games and apps through the Wii U Nintendo eShop would receive ten percent of the price back in the form of [[Nintendo Points]], which could subsequently be put towards future online purchases on both the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS eShop. The promotion was available through March 31, 2015.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe program was discontinued on April 1, 2015 and the URL just leads to a discontinuation message and the reader gets a URL redirecting to Nintendo's official website. The service was never fully implemented beyond its promotional period. The [[My Nintendo]] program features a similar concept for anyone who links their Nintendo Network ID to their Nintendo Account profile, where users can earn Gold Points via any Nintendo eShop purchase and redeem them for full downloads or discount coupons available.\n\n== List of available content ==\nThe following types of games, applications and media are available to download from the Nintendo eShop (or [[Wii Shop Channel]] in the Wii U's Wii Mode):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Special features in this interpretation of the Virtual Console allow players to create Restore Points, temporarily saving the game state for use later, and the optional ability to view games in their original resolution accompanied with special borders or templates.\n\nGBA Ambassador games like Nintendo DS and DSi games and DSiWare can be displayed at their original screen resolution but don't support: Sleep Mode (Certain GBA games can be put into sleep mode by button combinations or in menu options), Restore Points, Home Menu functionality, SpotPass, StreetPass, Multiplayer, and Auto Brightness (New Nintendo 3DS models only).\n\n== WiiWare ==\n{{main|WiiWare}}\nWiiWare, for the [[Wii]] [[video game console]], has been available for the [[Wii U]] since launch day, when an update added support for the [[Wii Shop Channel]]'s library of WiiWare games. Unlike the Nintendo 3DS, [[WiiWare]] software is only available for download on the Wii U through [[Wii Mode]], not the Nintendo eShop. Similarly to using Wii software on the Wii U, WiiWare can only be played in its original resolution, via Wii Mode, and [[Wii U system software#Home Menu|Wii U Home Menu]] functionality is disabled whilst WiiWare software is being played. There are over 450 downloadable games available in North America {{as of|2012|10|lc=y}}. Initially all titles, with sole exception of ''[[LostWinds]]'', were made available on the Wii U.

With a few exceptions for certain games or applications such as ''[[Flipnote Studio]]'' and the DSi Internet Browser, the majority of existing DSiWare software is available for download on the Nintendo 3DS through the Nintendo eShop. Similar to using [[Nintendo DS]] software, DSiWare can be optionally viewed in its original resolution and [[Nintendo 3DS system software|Home Menu]] functionality, SpotPass, StreetPass, Auto Brightness (New Nintendo 3DS only) and 3D Functionality is disabled whilst DSiWare software is being played.

The Nintendo eShop features downloadable games, demos, applications, streaming videos, consumer rating feedback, and other information on upcoming game releases.\n\n== Features ==\nThe Nintendo eShop icon appears as part of the HOME Menu on the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch. It requires an Internet connection to access. Initially, the two versions of the Nintendo eShop between the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U were independent of each other. Whilst this still remains largely true, after the implementation of Nintendo Network ID for the Nintendo 3DS, users that register the same ID account between both systems (currently at one time per console) could share certain data between both versions of the eShop, such as a combined funds balance, home address, saved credit and debit card information, [[wish list]] entries, and (formerly) linked Club Nintendo accounts. With the release of the Nintendo Switch version of the Nintendo eShop, balance stored on a Nintendo Network ID can be shared or transferred to a Nintendo Account to be spent on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe eShop stores a record of all downloads and purchases, allowing users to re-download previously purchased software at no additional charge, provided the software is still available on the eShop. Downloads can be started immediately, or they can be queued up and be pushed to the console while it is not in use or when the eShop application is not running.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> Users upgrading from a [[Nintendo DSi]] system can transfer their previous DSiWare purchases to the Nintendo 3DS, with limited exceptions, such as ''Flipnote Studio'' and the DSi web browser.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/gi_index.jsp?menu=applications%20and%20features&submenu=ctr-gi-apps-dsiware-wont-transfer|title=Nintendo 3DS \u2013 General Information|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> A December 2011 update enabled a similar feature allowing users to transfer their purchases between 3DS systems.<ref>[http://www.ripten.com/2011/10/21/3ds-november-firmware-update-details/ 3DS November Firmware Update Detailed | RipTen Videogame Blog].

Also, with the limited of Chinese Version Nintendo Switch, the online purchase of DLC for games from other regions is disabled.\n\n=== Multitasking ===\nThe Nintendo eShop can be accessed any time via the HOME menu screen, even when a game is already running. This feature, however, is only available on [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. Background downloading is also possible via [[SpotPass]] while using any other application on the Wii U or Nintendo Switch, and while in Sleep Mode on [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|title=Nintendo Adding Playable Demos, eShop Web Interface and Sleep Mode Downloads to 3DS|url=http://kotaku.com/5854187/nintendo-adding-playable-demos-eshop-web-interface-and-sleep-mode-downloads-to-3ds|publisher=Kotaku}}</ref> Currently, 10 downloads can be queued at a time. The status of the downloads can be checked on the HOME menu under the \"Download Manager\". If notifications are activated, a pop-up message will appear in the top right corner of the screen to notify the user that a download is finished.\n\n=== Ratings ===\nThe Nintendo eShop supports user reviews of games, applications, and other media. After an eShop title has been acquired and used for at least one hour, users can then submit a review consisting of a crescent range of one to five \"stars\", representing the title's quality. Users can also categorize games by age and gender, and as being suitable for either hardcore or casual gamers. The Wii U had [[Miiverse]] integration for user reviews on the Nintendo eShop.\n\n=== Deluxe Digital Promotion and Nintendo Network Premium ===\n[[File:Nintendo Network Premium Logo.png|thumb|right|220px|Nintendo Network Premium logo]]\n{{main article|Nintendo Network}}\nOn September 13, 2012, during a Japanese [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation, Satoru Iwata introduced a new service called Deluxe Digital Promotion (North America)/Nintendo Network Premium (Europe, Australia and Japan). It was a loyalty program similar to [[PlayStation Plus]] offered on [[PlayStation Network]] and Xbox Live Gold on [[Xbox Live]].\n\nConsumers who purchased the Wii U Deluxe Pack in North America, or the Wii U Premium Pack in Europe and Japan, would receive a free two-year subscription to this service which lets [[Wii U]] owners receive points for each digital purchase.\n\nMembers who bought games and apps through the Wii U Nintendo eShop would receive ten percent of the price back in the form of [[Nintendo Points]], which could subsequently be put towards future online purchases on both the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS eShop. The promotion was available through March 31, 2015.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe program was discontinued on April 1, 2015 and the URL just leads to a discontinuation message and the reader gets a URL redirecting to Nintendo's official website. The service was never fully implemented beyond its promotional period. The [[My Nintendo]] program features a similar concept for anyone who links their Nintendo Network ID to their Nintendo Account profile, where users can earn Gold Points via any Nintendo eShop purchase and redeem them for full downloads or discount coupons available.\n\n== List of available content ==\nThe following types of games, applications and media are available to download from the Nintendo eShop (or [[Wii Shop Channel]] in the Wii U's Wii Mode):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Most of the Virtual Console library available on the original Wii is also available on Wii U, but only through the implementation of the console's \"[[Wii]] Mode\" and [[Wii Shop Channel]], to access and purchase Virtual Console titles.

Special features in this interpretation of the Virtual Console allow players to create Restore Points, temporarily saving the game state for use later, and the optional ability to view games in their original resolution accompanied with special borders or templates.\n\nGBA Ambassador games like Nintendo DS and DSi games and DSiWare can be displayed at their original screen resolution but don't support: Sleep Mode (Certain GBA games can be put into sleep mode by button combinations or in menu options), Restore Points, Home Menu functionality, SpotPass, StreetPass, Multiplayer, and Auto Brightness (New Nintendo 3DS models only).\n\n== WiiWare ==\n{{main article|WiiWare}}\nWiiWare, for the [[Wii]] [[video game console]], has been available for the [[Wii U]] since launch day, when an update added support for the [[Wii Shop Channel]]'s library of WiiWare games. Unlike the Nintendo 3DS, [[WiiWare]] software is only available for download on the Wii U through [[Wii Mode]], not the Nintendo eShop. Similarly to using Wii software on the Wii U, WiiWare can only be played in its original resolution, via Wii Mode, and [[Wii U system software#Home Menu|Wii U Home Menu]] functionality is disabled whilst WiiWare software is being played. There are over 450 downloadable games available in North America {{as of|2012|10|lc=y}}. Initially all titles, with sole exception of ''[[LostWinds]]'', were made available on the Wii U.

With a few exceptions for certain games or applications such as ''[[Flipnote Studio]]'' and the DSi Internet Browser, the majority of existing DSiWare software is available for download on the Nintendo 3DS through the Nintendo eShop. Similar to using [[Nintendo DS]] software, DSiWare can be optionally viewed in its original resolution and [[Nintendo 3DS system software|Home Menu]] functionality, SpotPass, StreetPass, Auto Brightness (New Nintendo 3DS only) and 3D Functionality is disabled whilst DSiWare software is being played.
