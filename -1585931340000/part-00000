In 2009, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]], and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=25 new titles added to National Film Registry |newspaper=Yahoo News |publisher=Yahoo |date=December 30, 2009 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091230/ap_en_mo/us_classic_films_glance |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102065458/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091230/ap_en_mo/us_classic_films_glance |archivedate=January 2, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn August 22, 1972, first-time crook [[John Wojtowicz|Sonny Wortzik]], his friend [[Salvatore Naturale|Salvatore \"Sal\" Naturale]], and Stevie attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. The plan immediately goes awry when Stevie loses his nerve and flees, and Sonny discovers they have arrived after the daily cash pickup, finding only $1,100 in cash.\n\nSonny takes the bank's [[traveler's cheque]]s and burns the register in a trash can, but the smoke raises suspicion outside, and the building is surrounded by police. The two panicked robbers take the bank employees hostage.\n\nPolice Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti calls the bank and Sonny bluffs that he is prepared to kill the hostages. Sal assures Sonny that he is ready to kill if necessary. A security guard has an [[asthma]] attack and Sonny releases him as a display of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside. Using the head teller as a shield, Sonny begins a dialogue with Moretti that culminates in his shouting \"Attica!  Attica!\" to invoke the recent [[Attica Prison riot]]. The crowd begins cheering for Sonny.\n\nSonny demands a vehicle to drive himself and Sal to the airport so they can board a jet. He also demands for pizzas to be brought for the hostages, and for his wife to be brought to the bank. Sonny's partner, Leon Shermer, arrives and reveals that the robbery was intended to pay for her [[sex reassignment surgery]], as she is a trans woman. She divulges that Sonny has children with his estranged wife, Angie. \n\nAs night sets in, the bank's lights are shut off as [[FBI]] Agent Sheldon takes command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager Mulvaney goes into diabetic shock, Sheldon lets a doctor inside. Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone; she reveals that she attempted suicide to escape the abusive Sonny, and was hospitalized at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] when police found her. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal in their escape. Sonny tells police that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery.\n\nSonny agrees to let Mulvaney leave, but he refuses to leave his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank to talk to his mother, who unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give himself up. Back inside, Sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance to Leon for her surgery and to Angie.\n\nWhen the requested limousine arrives, Sonny checks for hidden weapons or booby traps, and selects Agent Murphy to drive him, Sal, and the remaining hostages to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy Airport]]. Sonny sits in the front beside Murphy with Sal behind. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him.\n\nAs they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Sal releases another hostage, who gives him her rosary beads for his first plane trip. Murphy again reminds Sal to aim his gun away. Sal does, and Sheldon seizes Sonny's weapon, allowing Murphy to pull a revolver hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested, and the hostages are freed.\n\nThe film ends as Sonny watches Sal's body being taken from the car on a stretcher. Subtitles reveal that Sonny was sentenced to 20 years in prison, Angie and her children subsisted on welfare, and Leon, who changed her name to Elizabeth, was able to have the surgery.\n\n==Cast==\nThe ''Life'' article described Wojtowicz as \"a dark, thin fellow with the broken-faced good looks of an Al Pacino or [[Dustin Hoffman]]\".<ref name=\"life\"/> Hoffman was later offered the role when Pacino briefly quit the production.

It adheres to the basic facts of what happened, according to a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' article published on September 22, 1972, entitled \"The Boys in the Bank\".

He did, however, praise Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon's portrayals of himself and Elizabeth Eden. <ref>[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/RealDogDay.html Real ''Dog Day'' hero tells his story] by John Wojtowicz from Jump Cut, no. 15, 1977, pp. 31\u201332.

There are few things you can complain about in Dog Day -- a second act that relies on a few too many variations of the same \"the cops are scheming\" bit, and that's about it.

The plan immediately goes awry when Stevie loses his nerve and flees, and Sonny discovers they have arrived after the daily cash pickup, finding only $1,100 in cash.\n\nSonny takes the bank\u2019s [[traveler's cheque]]s and burns the register in a trash can, but the smoke raises suspicion outside, and the building is surrounded by police. The two panicked robbers take the bank employees hostage.\n\nPolice Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti calls the bank and Sonny bluffs that he is prepared to kill the hostages. Sal assures Sonny that he is ready to kill if necessary. A security guard has an [[asthma]] attack and Sonny releases him as a display of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside. Using the head teller as a shield, Sonny begins a dialogue with Moretti that culminates in his shouting \"Attica!  Attica!\" to invoke the recent [[Attica Prison riot]]. The crowd begins cheering for Sonny.\n\nSonny demands a vehicle to drive himself and Sal to the airport so they can board a jet. He also demands for pizzas to be brought for the hostages, and for his wife to be brought to the bank. Sonny's partner, Leon Shermer, arrives and reveals that the robbery was intended to pay for her [[sex reassignment surgery]], as she is a trans woman. She divulges that Sonny has children with his estranged wife, Angie. \n\nAs night sets in, the bank\u2019s lights are shut off as [[FBI]] Agent Sheldon takes command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager Mulvaney goes into diabetic shock, Sheldon lets a doctor inside. Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone; she reveals that she attempted suicide to escape the abusive Sonny, and was hospitalized at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] when police found her. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal in their escape. Sonny tells police that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery.\n\nSonny agrees to let Mulvaney leave, but he refuses to leave his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank to talk to his mother, who unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give himself up. Back inside, Sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance to Leon for her surgery and to Angie.\n\nWhen the requested limousine arrives, Sonny checks for hidden weapons or booby traps, and selects Agent Murphy to drive him, Sal, and the remaining hostages to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy Airport]]. Sonny sits in the front beside Murphy with Sal behind. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him.\n\nAs they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Sal releases another hostage, who gives him her rosary beads for his first plane trip. Murphy again reminds Sal to aim his gun away. Sal does, and Sheldon seizes Sonny's weapon, allowing Murphy to pull a revolver hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested, and the hostages are freed.\n\nThe film ends as Sonny watches Sal's body being taken from the car on a stretcher. Subtitles reveal that Sonny was sentenced to 20 years in prison, Angie and her children subsisted on welfare, and Leon, who changed her name to Elizabeth, was able to have the surgery.\n\n==Cast==\nThe ''Life'' article described Wojtowicz as \"a dark, thin fellow with the broken-faced good looks of an Al Pacino or [[Dustin Hoffman]]\".<ref name=\"life\"/> Hoffman was later offered the role when Pacino briefly quit the production.  An 18-year-old actor was originally to be cast in the role of Sal to match the age of the actual Salvatore.<ref name=commentary2>Lumet, Sidney.

He did, however, praise Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon's portrayals of himself and Elizabeth Eden. <ref>[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/RealDogDay.html Real ''Dog Day'' hero tells his story] by John Wojtowicz from Jump Cut, no. 15, 1977, pp. 31\u201332.

Over the course of his career he worked for several different automobile brands, and many of his designs went into full production. He is best known for his work at [[Citro\u00ebn]], which he joined in 1962 and where he became ''Responsable de Style'', head of the design department, in 1964.<ref name=\"caspersbook\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nOpron was born in [[Amiens]] in Picardy, France. His father was in the military and received several postings to locations in French Colonial Africa, so Opron grew up in places like Algeria, Mali and Abidjan.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/>\n\nAt 18 Opron contracted tuberculosis, and had to spend time in a sanatorium.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> He returned to France in 1952 and enrolled in the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Amiens; one year later he transferred to the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He studied architecture under [[Auguste Perret]].<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"clubzeitung\"/> Altogether Opron spent eight years studying architecture, painting, and sculpture.<ref name=\"influx\"/>\n\nAt age 21 he married Genevi\u00e8ve Mercier.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> In the early 1950s Opron's interest in aircraft led him to take up flying, including acrobatic flying.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1952 Opron began his professional career as a machine designer for the Compagnie Nationale des Sucreries in Ham in the Somme.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> In 1954 he was hired by aircraft builder Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Constructions A\u00e9ronautices du Nord.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He specialised in cockpit design, and worked on the [[Nord Noratlas]] aircraft.\n\nOpron began working at Simca in 1958 at age 26.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> His department was eliminated in 1961, and Opron received a two-year severance payout, but with a non-compete clause that prevented him from moving to another automaker.<ref name=\"icon-mag\"/> Instead Opron went to ''Arthur Martin'', a company that produced housewares and home appliances, where he became ''Director of Style''.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/><ref name=\"drive-my\"/><ref name=\"lavoz\"/> Opron returned to automotive design with Citro\u00ebn in 1962. \n\nOver the course of his career Opron became known for balancing a collaborative, team-based approach to design with creative input from individuals.<ref name=\"lawsonbook\"/> He finally retired from design work in 2001.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"icon-mag\"/>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nOpron was one of twenty-five designers nominated for the 1999 [[Car Designer of the Century]] competition.\n\nA celebration of his work, ''OPRON 50 Years of Style'', was held on 11 May 2002 in Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson on the occasion of his 70th birthday.<ref name=\"gs-gsa-50ans\"/><ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron received Car Design News\u2019 Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\nThe Carlisle Import & Performance Nationals of 15\u201317 May 2020 is to include a featured display titled: \u201cCars of Robert Opron\u201d.<ref name=\"carlisle1\"/>\n\n==Design history==\n{{quote|text=The dolphin, the leopard, the swift, they each move at a speed consistent with their environment, each using a minimum of energy.

The magazine supplied a list of anticipated standard features that included radar obstacle detection and gyroscopic stabilisation. Opron consulted with an astrophysicist friend to help integrate these not-yet realised concepts into the car.<ref name=\"drive-my\"/>\n\nWhile at Simca he sketched out a [[Car body configurations#Two-box design|two-box]] hatchback that caught the attention of Fiat's designers. This sketch eventually led to the [[Simca 1100]].<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/><ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"curbside-sins1\"/>\n\nAnother sketch by Opron at Simca has been suggested to have been the original concept for what later became the Renault Espace.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> Others dispute this claim, and the design of the Espace is generally credited to [[Fergus Pollock]].<ref name=\"dtw-opron\"/> In the late 1970s Matra designer Antoine Volanis addressed the need for a replacement for the [[Matra Rancho]] by designing an [[Minivan|MPV]] using Simca parts and with input from Opron.<ref name=\"amk-p16\"/> This design was presented to PSA management in 1979 as \"Project P16\", but did not reach production. Opron was at Renault throughout most of the Espace's development and for one year after sales started.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn===\nIn 1962 Mme. Opron-Mercier noticed an advertisement in [[Le Monde]] saying that an \"Important industrial group\" was looking to hire an experienced designer.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron responded to the ad, and was directed to report to the Quai de Javel, the home of Citro\u00ebn. The personnel manager asked Opron to return later that day to the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre to meet with [[Flaminio Bertoni]], Citro\u00ebn's chief designer and originator of the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] and [[Citro\u00ebn DS|DS]].\n\nWhen Opron arrived for the meeting with Bertoni, the older man asked to see Opron's portfolio of drawings. Opron recalled that Bertoni \"threw them on the floor, poking them with his cane and stated that he did not think much of them.\"<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron collected his drawings and indicated that he found Bertoni's behavior unacceptable, to which Bertoni replied \"I do find you interesting though!\". Opron left, vowing to never work for such a man. Three weeks later, he received a letter of appointment from Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> \n\nOpron joined Citro\u00ebn\u2019s Bureau d\u2019\u00c9tudes in 1962. For the first three months he worked in the \"M\u00e9thodes\" section.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron became Citro\u00ebn's Responable de Style, or chief stylist, in 1964 following the death of Bertoni.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron was tasked with developing a replacement for the 2CV, which evolved into the 1965 [[Citro\u00ebn G-Mini]] design study.<ref name=\"cn-gmini\"/>\n\nIn 1965 Citro\u00ebn launched new lines of {{convert|3.5|\u2013|8.0|t|ST|0|abbr=on}} trucks; the 350 and 600 series that earned the nickname [[Citro\u00ebn Belph\u00e9gor|Belph\u00e9gor]] for their unique cab design. The trucks were designed by Bertoni and Opron.<ref name=\"cn-belphegor\"/><ref name=\"cj-aug2017\"/><ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>{{rp|176, 189}}\n\nOpron began working on the second restyling of the Citro\u00ebn DS as early as 1963 with ''Projet D29''. His \"Nouveau Visage\" (new face) front appearing on the 1968 model year DS was a four-headlamp design with two lamps on each side under glass covers that blended with the body's lines. The inner headlamp on each side pivoted with the steering wheel, while the outer lamps were self-leveling.\n\nIn 1967, having abandoned the ambitious ''Projet F'' begun by Bertoni and taken over by Opron, Citro\u00ebn initiated a competition for a new mid-range model that pitted Opron and the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes against [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/> Both teams submitted designs for front wheel drive 3- and 5-door cars powered by flat-four engines. Opron's proposal carried the day, and his ''Project G'' eventually became the [[Citro\u00ebn GS|GS]] released in 1970.<ref name=\"ean-designers\"/><ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> Some have claimed that Opron based the GS' shape on the Pininfarina Austin 1800 Aerodinamica Berline of 1967.<ref name=\"cb-bmc1800\"/> Others assert that, while it may have been influenced by the Italo-English concept car, Opron's design was an independent work, and point out that Citro\u00ebn has never acknowledged any link.<ref name=\"colebook\"/>{{rp|322\u2013324}}<ref name=\"cv-bmc-cx\"/><ref name=\"landcrab-pinin\"/> Giugiaro's rejected design was taken up by Alfa Romeo and developed into the [[Alfasud]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Citro\u00ebn opened a new Centre d'\u00c9tudes at [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay|V\u00e9lizy]], France. Opron oversaw the arrangements for the move, which was completed progressively over several years.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron refreshed the [[Citro\u00ebn Ami|Ami 6]] to create the Ami 8 of 1969.<ref name=\"om-ami8\"/><ref name=\"cn-projectm\"/> He also led the team that developed the [[Citro\u00ebn M35]], a two-door fastback based on the Ami 8 chassis that was powered by a single rotor [[Comotor]] engine.<ref name=\"colebook\"/> Production ran from 1969\u20131971, and although 500 M35s were planned to be built, the total number is believed to be just more than half that.\n\nThe first completely new model of the Opron era, and the car he is most closely associated with, was the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]]. Assigned the development name ''Projet S'', the original goal was to produce a racing car suitable for Le Mans. Through the influence of Opron and [[Pierre Bercot]], Citro\u00ebn's managing director, it evolved from a racing car into a premium model in the old Grand Routier tradition.<ref name=\"hagerty-sm\"/>\n\nThe SM team, which included Jean Giert, built a full-scale model in the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes workshops on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, making the SM the last model developed in this location before the last of the style department moved to their new location in V\u00e9lizy.<ref name=\"dsa-smretro\"/>\n\nA design for a possible GS-based coup\u00e9 progressed to the full-scale model stage.<ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> The car was to be built by [[Ligier]] when their contract to assemble the SM expired in 1974\u201375 but did not go into production.\n\nThe project that was Opron's personal favorite was also his last design for Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/><ref name=\"cn-projetl\"/> Initially called ''Projet L'', the result was the [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], which debuted in 1974 as the successor to the DS.\n\nWhen Citro\u00ebn declared bankruptcy in 1974, the French Government stepped in and arranged a merger of Citro\u00ebn with [[Peugeot]]. Opron left shortly after this.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\n===Renault===\nIn 1975 Opron started work at Renault after reportedly being the target of an [[executive search]] by them.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> For his new employers he led the redesign of the [[Alpine A310]], a project that stylist [[Peter Stevens]] was also involved in.<ref name=\"bat-alpine\"/> The original 4-cylinder A310 was modified to accommodate the [[V6 PRV engine]], and to address some aerodynamic deficiencies of the original shape.\n\nOpron developed a design for an ultra-compact city car called the V\u00e9hicule Bas de Gamme (VBG), or Entry Level Vehicle.<ref name=\"lignes-7691\"/> He was also involved in the Vesta II concept car of 1987, along with designer [[Gaston Juchet]].<ref name=\"jpb-juchet\"/>\n\nOpron's designs at Renault included the [[Renault Fuego]] sports coup\u00e9 of 1980, as well as the [[Renault 9 and 11]], with the 9 sedan released in 1981 and the 11 hatchback in 1983.<ref name=\"hemmings-fuego\"/><ref name=\"bonhams\"/> Opron worked with [[American Motors|AMC]]'s [[Dick Teague]] to adapt the 9 and 11 models to the American market, where they were sold as the Alliance and Encore respectively.<ref name=\"om-amc-renault\"/>\n\nOpron's tenure at Renault was marked by extensive collaborations with other well-known designers and carrosserie.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"rc-juchet\"/> [[Marcello Gandini]] influenced the shape of the [[Renault 25|25]] of 1983, and produced the shape for the Super Cinq in 1984.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> <ref name=\"lignes-14522\"/> An association with Giugiaro and Italdesign resulted in the Renault Gabbiano of 1983, and later the [[Renault 21]] of 1986 and [[Renault 19]] of 1988.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> \n\nIn May 1977 Opron sent a letter to director Fran\u00e7ois Zanotti, director of Renault\u2019s commercial division, with a proposal for a new line of commercial trucks, and included two sketches by designer Guy Greffier. Zanotti approved further development, and Greffier refined his original sketches. As the project progressed, Opron invited Gandini to join the design effort. The end result was the Renault AE Magnum truck line released in 1990, when it also won \"European Truck of the Year\".<ref name=\"lam-win2019\"/>\n\nOpron wanted to establish a centre of advanced styling in the United States.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"lam-spr2018\"/> He spent time in the States working to that end, but it did not materialise. When he returned to Europe he arrived to changes in the leadership of Renault.\n\nOpron left Renault in 1985.\n\n===Fiat===\nAfter Renault Opron moved to Centro Stile at [[Fiat]], where he was put in charge of advanced studies.\n\nHe is credited with creating the earliest sketches for a design project called the ES 30, for ''Experimental Sportscar 3.0 litres''. Opron's early concept, which won out against a competing proposal from Giugiaro, was fully developed by [[Antonio Castellana]].<ref name=\"petrol-sz\"/><ref name=\"dkbook\"/><ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> The prototype was completed in just nineteen months \u2014 quickly enough to appear at the 1989 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. This highly controversial design went into limited production as the [[Alfa Romeo SZ]] coup\u00e9 and the later RZ convertible, where the \"Z\" refers to coachbuilder [[Zagato]].

His father was in the military and received several postings to locations in French Colonial Africa, so Opron grew up in places like Algeria, Mali and Abidjan.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/>\n\nAt 18 Opron contracted tuberculosis, and had to spend time in a sanatorium.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> He returned to France in 1952 and enrolled in the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Amiens; one year later he transferred to the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He studied architecture under [[Auguste Perret]].<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"clubzeitung\"/> Altogether Opron spent eight years studying architecture, painting, and sculpture.<ref name=\"influx\"/>\n\nAt age 21 he married Genevi\u00e8ve Mercier.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> In the early 1950s Opron's interest in aircraft led him to take up flying, including acrobatic flying.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1952 Opron began his professional career as a machine designer for the Compagnie Nationale des Sucreries in Ham in the Somme.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> In 1954 he was hired by aircraft builder Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Constructions A\u00e9ronautices du Nord.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He specialised in cockpit design, and worked on the [[Nord Noratlas]] aircraft.\n\nOpron began working at Simca in 1958 at age 26.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> His department was eliminated in 1961, and Opron received a two-year severance payout, but with a non-compete clause that prevented him from moving to another automaker.<ref name=\"icon-mag\"/> Instead Opron went to ''Arthur Martin'', a company that produced housewares and home appliances, where he became ''Director of Style''.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/><ref name=\"drive-my\"/><ref name=\"lavoz\"/> Opron returned to automotive design with Citro\u00ebn in 1962. \n\nOver the course of his career Opron became known for balancing a collaborative, team-based approach to design with creative input from individuals.<ref name=\"lawsonbook\"/> He finally retired from design work in 2001.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"icon-mag\"/>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nOpron was one of twenty-five designers nominated for the 1999 [[Car Designer of the Century]] competition.\n\nA celebration of his work, ''OPRON 50 Years of Style'', was held on 11 May 2002 in Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson on the occasion of his 70th birthday.<ref name=\"gs-gsa-50ans\"/><ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron received Car Design News\u2019 Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\nThe Carlisle Import & Performance Nationals of 15\u201317 May 2020 is to include a featured display titled: \u201cCars of Robert Opron\u201d.<ref name=\"carlisle1\"/>\n\n==Design history==\n{{quote|text=The dolphin, the leopard, the swift, they each move at a speed consistent with their environment, each using a minimum of energy. What a great lesson for a stylist.|sign=Robert Opron|source=<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|text=All Opron\u2019s car designs have an organic wholeness as if they have been grown or shaped by the forces of wind, light, scale and structure.

The magazine supplied a list of anticipated standard features that included radar obstacle detection and gyroscopic stabilisation. Opron consulted with an astrophysicist friend to help integrate these not-yet realised concepts into the car.<ref name=\"drive-my\"/>\n\nWhile at Simca he sketched out a [[Car body configurations#Two-box design|two-box]] hatchback that caught the attention of Fiat's designers. This sketch eventually led to the [[Simca 1100]].<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/><ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"curbside-sins1\"/>\n\nAnother sketch by Opron at Simca has been suggested to have been the original concept for what later became the Renault Espace.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> Others dispute this claim, and the design of the Espace is generally credited to [[Fergus Pollock]].<ref name=\"dtw-opron\"/> In the late 1970s Matra designer Antoine Volanis addressed the need for a replacement for the [[Matra Rancho]] by designing an [[Minivan|MPV]] using Simca parts and with input from Opron.<ref name=\"amk-p16\"/> This design was presented to PSA management in 1979 as \"Project P16\", but did not reach production. Opron was at Renault throughout most of the Espace's development and for one year after sales started.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn===\nIn 1962 Mme. Opron-Mercier noticed an advertisement in [[Le Monde]] saying that an \"Important industrial group\" was looking to hire an experienced designer.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron responded to the ad, and was directed to report to the Quai de Javel, the home of Citro\u00ebn. The personnel manager asked Opron to return later that day to the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre to meet with [[Flaminio Bertoni]], Citro\u00ebn's chief designer and originator of the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] and [[Citro\u00ebn DS|DS]].\n\nWhen Opron arrived for the meeting with Bertoni, the older man asked to see Opron's portfolio of drawings. Opron recalled that Bertoni \"threw them on the floor, poking them with his cane and stated that he did not think much of them.\"<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron collected his drawings and indicated that he found Bertoni's behavior unacceptable, to which Bertoni replied \"I do find you interesting though!\". Opron left, vowing to never work for such a man. Three weeks later, he received a letter of appointment from Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> \n\nOpron joined Citro\u00ebn\u2019s Bureau d\u2019\u00c9tudes in 1962. For the first three months he worked in the \"M\u00e9thodes\" section.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron became Citro\u00ebn's Responable de Style, or chief stylist, in 1964 following the death of Bertoni.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron was tasked with developing a replacement for the 2CV, which evolved into the 1965 [[Citro\u00ebn G-Mini]] design study.<ref name=\"cn-gmini\"/>\n\nIn 1965 Citro\u00ebn launched new lines of {{convert|3.5|\u2013|8.0|t|ST|0|abbr=on}} trucks; the 350 and 600 series that earned the nickname [[Citro\u00ebn Belph\u00e9gor|Belph\u00e9gor]] for their unique cab design. The trucks were designed by Bertoni and Opron.<ref name=\"cn-belphegor\"/><ref name=\"cj-aug2017\"/><ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>{{rp|176, 189}}\n\nOpron began working on the second restyling of the Citro\u00ebn DS as early as 1963 with ''Projet D29''. His \"Nouveau Visage\" (new face) front appearing on the 1968 model year DS was a four-headlamp design with two lamps on each side under glass covers that blended with the body's lines. The inner headlamp on each side pivoted with the steering wheel, while the outer lamps were self-leveling.\n\nIn 1967, having abandoned the ambitious ''Projet F'' begun by Bertoni and taken over by Opron, Citro\u00ebn initiated a competition for a new mid-range model that pitted Opron and the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes against [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/> Both teams submitted designs for front wheel drive 3- and 5-door cars powered by flat-four engines. Opron's proposal carried the day, and his ''Project G'' eventually became the [[Citro\u00ebn GS|GS]] released in 1970.<ref name=\"ean-designers\"/><ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> Some have claimed that Opron based the GS' shape on the Pininfarina Austin 1800 Aerodinamica Berline of 1967.<ref name=\"cb-bmc1800\"/> Others assert that, while it may have been influenced by the Italo-English concept car, Opron's design was an independent work, and point out that Citro\u00ebn has never acknowledged any link.<ref name=\"colebook\"/>{{rp|322\u2013324}}<ref name=\"cv-bmc-cx\"/><ref name=\"landcrab-pinin\"/> Giugiaro's rejected design was taken up by Alfa Romeo and developed into the [[Alfasud]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Citro\u00ebn opened a new Centre d'\u00c9tudes at [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay|V\u00e9lizy]], France. Opron oversaw the arrangements for the move, which was completed progressively over several years.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron refreshed the [[Citro\u00ebn Ami|Ami 6]] to create the Ami 8 of 1969.<ref name=\"om-ami8\"/><ref name=\"cn-projectm\"/> He also led the team that developed the [[Citro\u00ebn M35]], a two-door fastback based on the Ami 8 chassis that was powered by a single rotor [[Comotor]] engine.<ref name=\"colebook\"/> Production ran from 1969\u20131971, and although 500 M35s were planned to be built, the total number is believed to be just more than half that.\n\nThe first completely new model of the Opron era, and the car he is most closely associated with, was the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]]. Assigned the development name ''Projet S'', the original goal was to produce a racing car suitable for Le Mans. Through the influence of Opron and [[Pierre Bercot]], Citro\u00ebn's managing director, it evolved from a racing car into a premium model in the old Grand Routier tradition.<ref name=\"hagerty-sm\"/>\n\nThe SM team, which included Jean Giert, built a full-scale model in the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes workshops on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, making the SM the last model developed in this location before the last of the style department moved to their new location in V\u00e9lizy.<ref name=\"dsa-smretro\"/>\n\nA design for a possible GS-based coup\u00e9 progressed to the full-scale model stage.<ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> The car was to be built by [[Ligier]] when their contract to assemble the SM expired in 1974\u201375 but did not go into production.\n\nThe project that was Opron's personal favorite was also his last design for Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/><ref name=\"cn-projetl\"/> Initially called ''Projet L'', the result was the [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], which debuted in 1974 as the successor to the DS.\n\nWhen Citro\u00ebn declared bankruptcy in 1974, the French Government stepped in and arranged a merger of Citro\u00ebn with [[Peugeot]]. Opron left shortly after this.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\n===Renault===\nIn 1975 Opron started work at Renault after reportedly being the target of an [[executive search]] by them.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> For his new employers he led the redesign of the [[Alpine A310]], a project that stylist [[Peter Stevens]] was also involved in.<ref name=\"bat-alpine\"/> The original 4-cylinder A310 was modified to accommodate the [[V6 PRV engine]], and to address some aerodynamic deficiencies of the original shape.\n\nOpron developed a design for an ultra-compact city car called the V\u00e9hicule Bas de Gamme (VBG), or Entry Level Vehicle.<ref name=\"lignes-7691\"/> He was also involved in the Vesta II concept car of 1987, along with designer [[Gaston Juchet]].<ref name=\"jpb-juchet\"/>\n\nOpron's designs at Renault included the [[Renault Fuego]] sports coup\u00e9 of 1980, as well as the [[Renault 9 and 11]], with the 9 sedan released in 1981 and the 11 hatchback in 1983.<ref name=\"hemmings-fuego\"/><ref name=\"bonhams\"/> Opron worked with [[American Motors|AMC]]'s [[Dick Teague]] to adapt the 9 and 11 models to the American market, where they were sold as the Alliance and Encore respectively.<ref name=\"om-amc-renault\"/>\n\nOpron's tenure at Renault was marked by extensive collaborations with other well-known designers and carrosserie.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"rc-juchet\"/> [[Marcello Gandini]] influenced the shape of the [[Renault 25|25]] of 1983, and produced the shape for the Super Cinq in 1984.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> <ref name=\"lignes-14522\"/> An association with Giugiaro and Italdesign resulted in the Renault Gabbiano of 1983, and later the [[Renault 21]] of 1986 and [[Renault 19]] of 1988.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> \n\nIn May 1977 Opron sent a letter to director Fran\u00e7ois Zanotti, director of Renault\u2019s commercial division, with a proposal for a new line of commercial trucks, and included two sketches by designer Guy Greffier. Zanotti approved further development, and Greffier refined his original sketches. As the project progressed, Opron invited Gandini to join the design effort. The end result was the Renault AE Magnum truck line released in 1990, when it also won \"European Truck of the Year\".<ref name=\"lam-win2019\"/>\n\nOpron wanted to establish a centre of advanced styling in the United States.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"lam-spr2018\"/> He spent time in the States working to that end, but it did not materialise. When he returned to Europe he arrived to changes in the leadership of Renault.\n\nOpron left Renault in 1985.\n\n===Fiat===\nAfter Renault Opron moved to Centro Stile at [[Fiat]], where he was put in charge of advanced studies.\n\nHe is credited with creating the earliest sketches for a design project called the ES 30, for ''Experimental Sportscar 3.0 litres''. Opron's early concept, which won out against a competing proposal from Giugiaro, was fully developed by [[Antonio Castellana]].<ref name=\"petrol-sz\"/><ref name=\"dkbook\"/><ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> The prototype was completed in just nineteen months \u2014 quickly enough to appear at the 1989 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. This highly controversial design went into limited production as the [[Alfa Romeo SZ]] coup\u00e9 and the later RZ convertible, where the \"Z\" refers to coachbuilder [[Zagato]]. The model was also given the nickname \"Il Mostro\" (the monster) for its unusual appearance.\n\nIn 1992 Opron left Fiat at sixty years of age, having reached mandatory retirement age.<ref name=\"drive-my\"/>\n\n===Independent consultant===\nFrom 1991 to 2000 he operated his own independent design consultancy in [[Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson]] in south Paris ([[Essonne]]).\n\nOne of Opron's clients was Ligier, who had become a manufacturer of \"voitures sans permis\" or \"voiturettes\", a class of microcar in France that may be driven without an operator's license. For Ligier Opron produced the original Du\u00e9, which debuted at the 1998 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"cf-due\"/><ref name=\"dkbook\"/> The Ligier Dragonfly shown at the 2000 [[Geneva Motor Show]] was also an Opron design.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\nOpron also consulted for [[Piaggio]].<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\n==Design gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Simca Fulgur 1958 (3593990695).jpg|[[Simca#Fulgur|Simca Fulgur]] (1958)\n|File:Citroen DS 23 Pallas.jpg| Citro\u00ebn DS (1967) \"Nouveau Visage\"\n|File:Citroen Ami 8 February 1973 mfd 1972 602cc.jpg| Citro\u00ebn Ami 8 (1969)\n|File:Citroen SM (14521154082).jpg| [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] (1970) 1972 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]].\n|File:50 ans de la GS.jpg| Citro\u00ebn GS<ref name=\"independent-gs\"/> (1970) 1971 European Car of the Year.\n|File:Citroen CX Sum08.jpg| Citro\u00ebn CX<ref name=\"cpc-show\"/> (1974) 1975 [[European Car of the Year]].\n|File:1980 Renault Alpine A310 V6 - 14404217287.jpg| [[Renault Alpine A310]] V6 (1976)\n|File:Renault Fuego France.jpg | [[Renault Fuego]] (1980)\n|File:Renault 9 Cambridge.jpg|[[Renault 9]]<ref name=\"rfo-opron\"/> (1981) 1982 European Car of the Year.\n|File:Renault 11 (46325126544).jpg| [[Renault 11]]<ref name=\"9et11-hist\"/> (1983)\n|File:Renault25.jpg| [[Renault 25]]<ref name=\"cpc-r25\"/> (1984)\n|File:1990 Alfa Romeo SZ 3.0 Front.jpg| [[Alfa Romeo SZ]]<ref name=\"rt-oct2017\"/> (1989)\n|}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"caspersbook\">{{cite book |last=Caspers |first=Markus |date=26 September 2016 |title=Designing Motion: Automotive Designers 1890 to 1990 |url= |location= |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |isbn=978-3035609820 |page=149<!--|page=127 --> |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dear-mag\">{{cite web |last=Maak |first=Niklas |url=https://www.dear-magazin.de/stories/Autopilot-49_-Vive-la-Berline_17515119.html |title=Autopilot #49: Vive la Berline |website=www.dear-magazin.de }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\">{{cite magazine |last=Guenzel |first=Peter |date=28 October 2017 |title=Robert Opron |url=https://www.pressreader.com/france/octane-france/20171028/283021169927764 |magazine=Octane |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"leroux-bio\">{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |url=http://leroux.andre.free.fr/carrossieropron.htm |title=Robert Opron |website=leroux.andre.free.fr }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"clubzeitung\">{{cite magazine |last=B\u00f6ttcher |first=Gerrit |title=Robert Opron \u2014 zum Anlass seines 75 zigsten Geburtstages |trans-title=Robert Opron \u2014 on the occasion of his 75th birthday |url=https://www.citroensmclub.de/files/SM_Clubzeitung_Nr_76.pdf |magazine=Citro\u00ebn-Clubzeitung |location= |publisher=Citro\u00ebn-SM-Club Deutschland e.

In a parliamentary system, the [[head of state]] is usually a person distinct from the [[head of government]]. This is in contrast to a [[presidential system]], where the head of state often is also the head of government and, most importantly, the executive does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature.\n\nCountries with parliamentary democracies may be [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], where a [[monarch]] is the head of state while the head of government is almost always a [[member of parliament]] (such as Thailand, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, and Japan), or [[parliamentary republic]]s, where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature (such as Ireland, Germany, India, and Italy). In a few parliamentary republics, such as Botswana, South Africa, and Suriname, among [[List of countries by system of government#Mixed republican systems|some others]], the head of government is also head of state, but is elected by and is answerable to parliament. In [[bicameral legislature|bicameral]] parliaments, the head of government is generally, though not always, a member of the lower house.\n\nParliamentarianism is the dominant [[form of government]] in Europe, with 32 of its [[List of European countries|50 sovereign states]] being parliamentarian. It is also common in the [[Caribbean]], being the form of government of 10 of its 13 island states, and in Oceania. Elsewhere in the world, parliamentary countries are less common, but they are distributed through all continents, most often in former colonies of the [[British Empire]] that subscribe to a particular brand of parliamentarianism known as the [[Westminster system} \n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of Parliamentarism}}\n\nSince ancient times, when societies were tribal, there were councils or a headman whose decisions were assessed by village elders. Eventually, these councils have slowly evolved into the modern parliamentary system.\n\nThe first [[parliament]]s date back to Europe in the Middle Ages: specifically in 1188 Alfonso IX, King of Leon (Spain) convened the three states in the [[Cortes of Le\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-decreta-of-leon-of-1188-the-oldest-documentary-manifestation-of-the-european-parliamentary-system/|title=The Decreta of Le\u00f3n of 1188 - The oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system|publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World|date=2013|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref><ref>John Keane: ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London 2009, 169-176.</ref> An early example of parliamentary government developed in today's Netherlands and Belgium during the [[Dutch revolt]] (1581), when the sovereign, legislative and executive powers were taken over by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] from the monarch, [[King Philip II of Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The modern concept of parliamentary government emerged in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Kingdom of Great Britain between 1707\u20131800]] and its contemporary, the [[Age of Liberty|Parliamentary System in Sweden between 1721\u20131772]].\n\nIn England, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] is remembered as one of the fathers of [[representative government]] for convening two famous parliaments.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jobson|first1=Adrian|title=The First English Revolution: Simon de Montfort, Henry III and the Barons' War|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-84725-226-5|pages=173\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gHWamp-TLoC&pg=PA174#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Simon de Montfort: The turning point for democracy that gets overlooked|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30849472|accessdate=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC| postscript = none|date=19 January 2015}}; {{cite news|title=The January Parliament and how it defined Britain|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11355822/The-January-Parliament-and-how-it-defined-Britain.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 January 2015}}</ref> [[Oxford Parliament (1258)|The first]], in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|ordinary citizens from the towns]].<ref name=\"dnb\">{{cite DNB |last=Norgate |first=Kate |authorlink=Kate Norgate |wstitle=Montfort, Simon of (1208?-1265)|volume=38 }}</ref> Later, in the 17th century, the [[Parliament of England]] pioneered some of the ideas and systems of [[Liberal democracy#Origins|liberal democracy]] culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]] and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kopstein|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Lichbach|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Hanson|editor3-first=Stephen E.|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1139991384|pages=37\u20139|edition=4, revised|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L2jwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote=Britain pioneered the system of liberal democracy that has now spread in one form or another to most of the world's countries}}</ref><ref name=\"refIIP\">{{cite web|title=Constitutionalism: America & Beyond|url=http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|publisher=Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP), U.S. Department of State|accessdate=30 October 2014|quote=The earliest, and perhaps greatest, victory for liberalism was achieved in England. The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the monarch, in theory, chaired cabinet and chose ministers. In practice, King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]'s inability to speak English led the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister, literally the ''[[Prime minister|prime]]'' or first minister, [[Robert Walpole]]. The gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament's role in controlling government, and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government. By the 19th century, the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance, with its choice ''invariably'' deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Institution of Prime Minister|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom: History of Government Blog|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=1 January 2012|author=Dr Andrew Blick and Professor George Jones \u2014 No 10 guest historian series, Prime Ministers and No. 10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Byrum E.|title=Office of the Prime Minister|date=2015|origyear=1955|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400878260|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ez7WCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Historical Development of the Office of Prime Minister}}</ref>\n\nOther countries gradually adopted what came to be called the [[Westminster Model]] of government, with an executive answerable to parliament, and exercising, in the name of the head of state, powers nominally vested in the head of state. Hence the use of phrases like ''Her Majesty's government'' or ''His Excellency's government''. Such a system became particularly prevalent in older British dominions, many of which had their constitutions enacted by the British parliament; such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the [[Irish Free State]] and the [[Union of South Africa]]. Some of these parliaments were reformed from, or were initially developed as distinct from their original British model: the [[Australian Senate]], for instance, has since its inception more closely reflected the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] than the British [[House of Lords]]; whereas since 1950 there is no upper house in New Zealand.\n\n[[Democracy]] and [[parliamentarism|parliamentarianism]] became increasingly prevalent in Europe in the years after [[World War I]], partially imposed by the democratic victors,{{how|date=November 2019}} the United States, Great Britain and France, on the defeated countries and their successors, notably [[Weimar Germany|Germany's Weimar Republic]] and the new Austrian Republic. Nineteenth-century [[urbanisation]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[modernism]] had already fuelled the political left's struggle for democracy and parliamentarianism for a long time. In the radicalised times at the end of World War I, democratic reforms were often seen as a means to counter popular revolutionary currents.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n{{Further|Parliamentary procedure}}\nA parliamentary system may be either [[bicameralism|bicameral]], with two [[chambers of parliament]] (or houses) or [[unicameralism|unicameral]], with just one parliamentary chamber. A bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected [[lower house]] with the power to determine the executive government, and an [[upper house]] which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house.\n\nScholars of democracy such as [[Arend Lijphart]] distinguish two types of parliamentary democracies: the Westminster and Consensus systems.<ref>{{cite book| last=Lijphart |first=Arend |year=1999 |title=Patterns of democracy |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Houses.of.parliament.overall.arp.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]], United Kingdom.

Some parliaments in this model are elected using a [[plurality voting system]] ([[first past the post]]), such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and India, while others use some form of [[proportional representation]], such as Ireland and New Zealand. The [[Australian House of Representatives]] is elected using [[instant-runoff voting]], while the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected using proportional representation through [[single transferable vote]]. Regardless of which system is used, the voting systems tend to allow the voter to vote for a named candidate rather than a [[closed list]].\n* The Western European parliamentary model (e.g. Spain, Germany) tends to have a more consensual debating system and usually has semi-circular debating chambers. Consensus systems have more of a tendency to use [[proportional representation]] with [[open party list]]s than the Westminster Model legislatures. The committees of these Parliaments tend to be more important than the [[plenary chamber]]. Some Western European countries' parliaments (e.g. in the [[Parliament of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Luxembourg]] and [[Parliament of Sweden|Sweden]]) implement the principle of [[dualism (politics)|dualism]] as a form of separation of powers. In countries using this system, Members of Parliament have to resign their place in Parliament upon being appointed (or elected) minister. Ministers in those countries usually actively participate in parliamentary debates, but are not entitled to vote.\n\nImplementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament, rather than just the absence of its disapproval. Some countries such as India also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature, though in other countries this only exists as a convention.\n* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament'''. While in practice most prime ministers under the [[Westminster system]] (including Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom) are the leaders of the largest party in parliament, technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the monarch, the governor-general, or the president. No parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government, but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a [[motion of no confidence]], the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament, and thus has little or no influence in the decision.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time.''' Examples: Italy, Thailand.\n* '''The head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister'''. For example, in Greece, if no party has a majority, the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an ''exploratory mandate'' to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days. If this is not possible, then the leader of the party with the second highest seat number is given the ''exploratory mandate''. If this fails, then the leader of the third largest party is given it and so on.\n* '''The head of state ''nominates'' a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment.''' Example: Spain, where the King sends a proposal to the [[Congress of Deputies]] for approval. Also, Germany where under the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] (constitution) the [[Bundestag]] votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president. In these cases,{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state.\n* '''Parliament ''nominates'' a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister.''' Example: Japan, where the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] appoints the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] on the nomination of the [[National Diet]]. Also, Ireland where the [[President of Ireland]] appoints the [[Taoiseach]] on the nomination of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].\n* '''A public officeholder (other than the head of state or their representative) ''nominates'' a candidate, who, if approved by parliament, is appointed as prime minister.''' Example: Under the Swedish [[Instrument of Government (1974)]], the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the Speaker of Parliament and the parliament itself. The speaker nominates a candidate, who is then elected to prime minister (''statsminister'') by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no (i.e. they can be elected even if more members of parliament vote ''No'' than ''Yes).''\n* '''Direct election by popular vote.''' Example: Israel, 1996\u20132001, where the prime minister was elected in a general election, with no regard to political affiliation, and whose procedure can also be described as of a [[semi-parliamentary system]].<ref name=\"Pouvoirs\">{{cite magazine |last=Duverger |first=Maurice |author-link=Maurice Duverger |date=September 1996 |title=Les monarchies r\u00e9publicaines |trans-title=The crowned republics |url=http://www.revue-pouvoirs.fr/IMG/pdf/78Pouvoirs_p107-120_monarchies_republicaines.pdf |language=French |magazine=[[Pouvoirs, revue fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9tudes constitutionnelles et politiques]] |location=Paris |publisher=\u00c9ditions du Seuil |issn= 0152-0768 |isbn=2-02-030123-7 |issue=78 |pages=107\u2013120 |access-date=10 September 2016 |quote= }}</ref><ref name=\"Forms\">{{cite book |last1=Frosini |first1=Justin Orlando |year=2008 |editor-last=Ferrari |editor-first=Giuseppe Franco |title=Forms of State and Forms of Government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFBPlYjuJYsC&printsec=frontcover |location= |publisher=Giuffr\u00e8 Editore |pages=54\u201355 |isbn=9788814143885 |access-date=13 November 2016 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote= }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there are variations as to what conditions exist (if any) for the government to have the right to dissolve the parliament:\n* In some countries, such as Denmark, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, the prime minister has the ''de facto'' power to call an election, at will. This was also the case in the United Kingdom until the passage of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].\n* In Israel, parliament may vote in order to call an election or pass a vote of no confidence against the government.\n* Other countries only permit an election to be called in the event of a [[vote of no confidence]] against the government, a supermajority vote in favour of an early election or prolonged deadlock in parliament. These requirements can still be circumvented. For example, in Germany in 2005, [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] deliberately allowed his government to lose a confidence motion, in order to call an early election.\n* In Sweden, the government may call a snap election at will, but the newly elected [[Riksdag]] is only elected to fill out the previous Riksdag's term. The last time this option was used was in [[1958 Swedish general election|1958]].\n* Norway is unique among parliamentary systems in that the [[Storting]] always serves the whole of its four-year term.\n* Since 2011 in the United Kingdom, the [[House of Commons]] may be dissolved early only by a vote of two-thirds of its members, or if a vote of non-confidence passes and no alternative government is formed in the next fourteen days.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06111|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|first=Richard|last=Kelly|date=27 April 2017|via=researchbriefings.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe parliamentary system can be contrasted with a [[presidential system]] which operates under a stricter separation of powers, whereby the executive does not form part of\u2014nor is appointed by\u2014the parliamentary or legislative body. In such a system, parliaments or congresses do not select or dismiss heads of governments, and governments cannot request an early dissolution as may be the case for parliaments. There also exists the [[semi-presidential system]] that draws on both presidential systems and parliamentary systems by combining a powerful president with an executive responsible to parliament: for example, the [[French Fifth Republic]].\n\nParliamentarianism may also apply to [[Regional government|regional]] and [[local government]]s. An example is the city of [[Oslo]], which has an executive council (Byr\u00e5d) as a part of the parliamentary system.\n\n===Anti-defection law===\nA few parliamentary democratic nations such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. have enacted a law which prohibits floor crossing or switching the party after election process.

The centralised government allows for more transparency as to where decisions originate from, this directly contrasts with the United States' system with former Treasury Secretary [[C. Douglas Dillon]] saying \"the president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with government in Washington\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1|title=Constitutional reform and effective government|last=Sundquist|first=James L.|date=1992|publisher=Washington, D.C. : Brookings Institution|others=Internet Archive}}</ref> Furthermore, ministers of the U.K. cabinet are subject to weekly Question Periods in which their actions/policies are scrutinised, no such regular check on the government exists in the U.S. system.\n\n=== Distribution of power ===\nParliamentary government has attractive features for nations that are [[Ethnicity|ethnically]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|racially]], or [[Ideology|ideologically]] divided. In a presidential system, all executive power is vested in one person, the president, whereas power is more divided in a parliamentary system with its collegial executive. In the 1989 Lebanese [[Taif Agreement]], in order to give [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslims]] greater political power, Lebanon moved from a [[semi-presidential system]] with a powerful president to a system more structurally similar to classical parliamentary government. Iraq similarly disdained a presidential system out of fears that such a system would be tantamount to [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] domination of the large [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority. Afghanistan's minorities refused to go along with a presidency as strong as the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] desired.\n\nIt can also be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government, as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions, as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament. Parliamentary systems are less likely to allow celebrity-based politics to fully dominate a society, unlike what often happens in presidential systems, where name-recall and popularity can catapult a celebrity, actor, or popular politician to the presidency despite such candidate's lack of competence and experience.\n\nSome scholars like [[Juan Linz]], [[Frederick Charles Riggs|Fred Riggs]], [[Bruce Ackerman]], and [[Robert Dahl]] have found that parliamentary government is less prone to authoritarian collapse. These scholars point out that since [[World War II]], two-thirds of [[Third World]] <nowiki/> countries establishing parliamentary governments successfully made the transition to democracy. By contrast, no Third World presidential system successfully made the transition to democracy without experiencing [[Coup|coups]] and other constitutional breakdowns. A 2001 [[World Bank]] study found that parliamentary systems are associated with less corruption, which is supported by a separate study that arrived at the same conclusions.\n\n=== Calling of elections ===\nIn his 1867 book ''[[The English Constitution]]'', [[Walter Bagehot]] praised parliamentary governments for producing serious debates, for allowing for a change in power without an election, and for allowing elections at any time. Bagehot considered the four-year election rule of the United States to be unnatural, as it can potentially allow a president who has disappointed the public with a dismal performance in the second year of his term to continue on until the end of his four-year term. Under a parliamentary system, a prime minister that has lost support in the middle of his term can be easily replaced by his own peers.\n\nAlthough Bagehot praised parliamentary governments for allowing an election to take place at any time, the lack of a definite election calendar can be abused. Previously under some systems, such as the British, a ruling party could schedule elections when it felt that it was likely to retain power, and so avoid elections at times of unpopularity. (Election timing in the UK, however, is now partly fixed under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].) Thus, by a shrewd timing of elections, in a parliamentary system, a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system. This problem can be alleviated somewhat by setting fixed dates for parliamentary elections, as is the case in several of Australia's state parliaments. In other systems, such as the Dutch and the Belgian, the ruling party or coalition has some flexibility in determining the election date. Conversely, flexibility in the timing of parliamentary elections can avoid periods of legislative gridlock that can occur in a fixed period presidential system. In any case, voters ultimately have the power to choose whether to vote for the ruling party or someone else.\n\n== Disadvantages and criticisms ==\nCritics generally claim these basic disadvantages for parliamentary systems:\n\n* '''Legislative flip-flopping'''\n* '''Party fragmentation''' \n\n=== Legislative flip-flopping ===\nThe ability for strong parliamentary governments to 'push' legislation through with the ease of fused power systems such as in the United Kingdom, whilst positive in allowing rapid adaptation when necessary e.g. the nationalisation of services during the world wars, does have its drawbacks. The flip-flopping of legislation back and forth as the majority in parliament changed between the Conservatives and Labour over the period 1940-1980, contesting over the nationalisation and privatisation of the British Steel Industry resulted in major instability for the British steel sector.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=R.

Kent Weaver's book ''Are Parliamentary Systems Better?'', he writes that an advantage of presidential systems is their ability to allow and accommodate more diverse viewpoints.

In a parliamentary system, the [[head of state]] is usually a person distinct from the [[head of government]]. This is in contrast to a [[presidential system]], where the head of state often is also the head of government and, most importantly, the executive does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature.\n\nCountries with parliamentary democracies may be [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], where a [[monarch]] is the head of state while the head of government is almost always a [[member of parliament]] (such as Thailand, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, and Japan), or [[parliamentary republic]]s, where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature (such as Ireland, Germany, India, and Italy). In a few parliamentary republics, such as Botswana, South Africa, and Suriname, among [[List of countries by system of government#Mixed republican systems|some others]], the head of government is also head of state, but is elected by and is answerable to parliament. In [[bicameral legislature|bicameral]] parliaments, the head of government is generally, though not always, a member of the lower house.\n\nParliamentarianism is the dominant [[form of government]] in Europe, with 32 of its [[List of European countries|50 sovereign states]] being parliamentarian. It is also common in the [[Caribbean]], being the form of government of 10 of its 13 island states, and in Oceania. Elsewhere in the world, parliamentary countries are less common, but they are distributed through all continents, most often in former colonies of the [[British Empire]] that subscribe to a particular brand of parliamentarianism known as the [[Westminster system]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of Parliamentarism}}\n\nSince ancient times, when societies were tribal, there were councils or a headman whose decisions were assessed by village elders.

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the monarch, in theory, chaired cabinet and chose ministers. In practice, King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]'s inability to speak English led the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister, literally the ''[[Prime minister|prime]]'' or first minister, [[Robert Walpole]]. The gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament's role in controlling government, and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government. By the 19th century, the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance, with its choice ''invariably'' deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Institution of Prime Minister|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom: History of Government Blog|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=1 January 2012|author=Dr Andrew Blick and Professor George Jones \u2014 No 10 guest historian series, Prime Ministers and No. 10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Byrum E.|title=Office of the Prime Minister|date=2015|origyear=1955|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400878260|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ez7WCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Historical Development of the Office of Prime Minister}}</ref>\n\nOther countries gradually adopted what came to be called the [[Westminster Model]] of government, with an executive answerable to parliament, and exercising, in the name of the head of state, powers nominally vested in the head of state. Hence the use of phrases like ''Her Majesty's government'' or ''His Excellency's government''. Such a system became particularly prevalent in older British dominions, many of which had their constitutions enacted by the British parliament; such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the [[Irish Free State]] and the [[Union of South Africa]]. Some of these parliaments were reformed from, or were initially developed as distinct from their original British model: the [[Australian Senate]], for instance, has since its inception more closely reflected the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] than the British [[House of Lords]]; whereas since 1950 there is no upper house in New Zealand.\n\n[[Democracy]] and [[parliamentarism|parliamentarianism]] became increasingly prevalent in Europe in the years after [[World War I]], partially imposed by the democratic victors,{{how|date=November 2019}} the United States, Great Britain and France, on the defeated countries and their successors, notably [[Weimar Germany|Germany's Weimar Republic]] and the new Austrian Republic. Nineteenth-century [[urbanisation]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[modernism]] had already fuelled the political left's struggle for democracy and parliamentarianism for a long time. In the radicalised times at the end of World War I, democratic reforms were often seen as a means to counter popular revolutionary currents.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n{{Further|Parliamentary procedure}}\nA parliamentary system may be either [[bicameralism|bicameral]], with two [[chambers of parliament]] (or houses) or [[unicameralism|unicameral]], with just one parliamentary chamber. A bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected [[lower house]] with the power to determine the executive government, and an [[upper house]] which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house.\n\nScholars of democracy such as [[Arend Lijphart]] distinguish two types of parliamentary democracies: the Westminster and Consensus systems.<ref>{{cite book| last=Lijphart |first=Arend |year=1999 |title=Patterns of democracy |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Houses.of.parliament.overall.arp.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]], United Kingdom.

Some parliaments in this model are elected using a [[plurality voting system]] ([[first past the post]]), such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and India, while others use some form of [[proportional representation]], such as Ireland and New Zealand. The [[Australian House of Representatives]] is elected using [[instant-runoff voting]], while the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected using proportional representation through [[single transferable vote]]. Regardless of which system is used, the voting systems tend to allow the voter to vote for a named candidate rather than a [[closed list]].\n* The Western European parliamentary model (e.g. Spain, Germany) tends to have a more consensual debating system and usually has semi-circular debating chambers. Consensus systems have more of a tendency to use [[proportional representation]] with [[open party list]]s than the Westminster Model legislatures. The committees of these Parliaments tend to be more important than the [[plenary chamber]]. Some Western European countries' parliaments (e.g. in the [[Parliament of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Luxembourg]] and [[Parliament of Sweden|Sweden]]) implement the principle of [[dualism (politics)|dualism]] as a form of separation of powers. In countries using this system, Members of Parliament have to resign their place in Parliament upon being appointed (or elected) minister. Ministers in those countries usually actively participate in parliamentary debates, but are not entitled to vote.\n\nImplementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament, rather than just the absence of its disapproval. Some countries such as India also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature, though in other countries this only exists as a convention.\n* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament'''. While in practice most prime ministers under the [[Westminster system]] (including Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom) are the leaders of the largest party in parliament, technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the monarch, the governor-general, or the president. No parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government, but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a [[motion of no confidence]], the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament, and thus has little or no influence in the decision.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time.''' Examples: Italy, Thailand.\n* '''The head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister'''. For example, in Greece, if no party has a majority, the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an ''exploratory mandate'' to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days. If this is not possible, then the leader of the party with the second highest seat number is given the ''exploratory mandate''. If this fails, then the leader of the third largest party is given it and so on.\n* '''The head of state ''nominates'' a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment.''' Example: Spain, where the King sends a proposal to the [[Congress of Deputies]] for approval. Also, Germany where under the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] (constitution) the [[Bundestag]] votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president. In these cases,{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state.\n* '''Parliament ''nominates'' a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister.''' Example: Japan, where the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] appoints the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] on the nomination of the [[National Diet]]. Also, Ireland where the [[President of Ireland]] appoints the [[Taoiseach]] on the nomination of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].\n* '''A public officeholder (other than the head of state or their representative) ''nominates'' a candidate, who, if approved by parliament, is appointed as prime minister.''' Example: Under the Swedish [[Instrument of Government (1974)]], the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the Speaker of Parliament and the parliament itself. The speaker nominates a candidate, who is then elected to prime minister (''statsminister'') by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no (i.e. they can be elected even if more members of parliament vote ''No'' than ''Yes).''\n* '''Direct election by popular vote.''' Example: Israel, 1996\u20132001, where the prime minister was elected in a general election, with no regard to political affiliation, and whose procedure can also be described as of a [[semi-parliamentary system]].<ref name=\"Pouvoirs\">{{cite magazine |last=Duverger |first=Maurice |author-link=Maurice Duverger |date=September 1996 |title=Les monarchies r\u00e9publicaines |trans-title=The crowned republics |url=http://www.revue-pouvoirs.fr/IMG/pdf/78Pouvoirs_p107-120_monarchies_republicaines.pdf |language=French |magazine=[[Pouvoirs, revue fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9tudes constitutionnelles et politiques]] |location=Paris |publisher=\u00c9ditions du Seuil |issn= 0152-0768 |isbn=2-02-030123-7 |issue=78 |pages=107\u2013120 |access-date=10 September 2016 |quote= }}</ref><ref name=\"Forms\">{{cite book |last1=Frosini |first1=Justin Orlando |year=2008 |editor-last=Ferrari |editor-first=Giuseppe Franco |title=Forms of State and Forms of Government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFBPlYjuJYsC&printsec=frontcover |location= |publisher=Giuffr\u00e8 Editore |pages=54\u201355 |isbn=9788814143885 |access-date=13 November 2016 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote= }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there are variations as to what conditions exist (if any) for the government to have the right to dissolve the parliament:\n* In some countries, such as Denmark, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, the prime minister has the ''de facto'' power to call an election, at will. This was also the case in the United Kingdom until the passage of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].\n* In Israel, parliament may vote in order to call an election or pass a vote of no confidence against the government.\n* Other countries only permit an election to be called in the event of a [[vote of no confidence]] against the government, a supermajority vote in favour of an early election or prolonged deadlock in parliament. These requirements can still be circumvented. For example, in Germany in 2005, [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] deliberately allowed his government to lose a confidence motion, in order to call an early election.\n* In Sweden, the government may call a snap election at will, but the newly elected [[Riksdag]] is only elected to fill out the previous Riksdag's term. The last time this option was used was in [[1958 Swedish general election|1958]].\n* Norway is unique among parliamentary systems in that the [[Storting]] always serves the whole of its four-year term.\n* Since 2011 in the United Kingdom, the [[House of Commons]] may be dissolved early only by a vote of two-thirds of its members, or if a vote of non-confidence passes and no alternative government is formed in the next fourteen days.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06111|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|first=Richard|last=Kelly|date=27 April 2017|via=researchbriefings.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe parliamentary system can be contrasted with a [[presidential system]] which operates under a stricter separation of powers, whereby the executive does not form part of\u2014nor is appointed by\u2014the parliamentary or legislative body. In such a system, parliaments or congresses do not select or dismiss heads of governments, and governments cannot request an early dissolution as may be the case for parliaments. There also exists the [[semi-presidential system]] that draws on both presidential systems and parliamentary systems by combining a powerful president with an executive responsible to parliament: for example, the [[French Fifth Republic]].\n\nParliamentarianism may also apply to [[Regional government|regional]] and [[local government]]s. An example is the city of [[Oslo]], which has an executive council (Byr\u00e5d) as a part of the parliamentary system.\n\n===Anti-defection law===\nA few parliamentary democratic nations such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. have enacted a law which prohibits floor crossing or switching the party after election process. With this law, the elected representative have to lose their seat in the Parliament House, if they defy the direction of the party in any voting. <ref>http://prsindia.org/uploads/media/Note%20on%20Anti-Defection.pdf</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legalservicesindia.com/article/1937/Anti-defection-law-the-challenges.html|title=Anti-defection law the challenges|website=www.legalservicesindia.com}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kartik-khanna-and-dhvani-shah.pdf|title=ANTI-DEFECTION LAW: A DEATH KNELL FOR PARLIAMENTARY DISSENT?|journal=NUJS Law Review|date=Mar 2012|access-date=15 May 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528062743/http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kartik-khanna-and-dhvani-shah.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK Parliament, a member is free to cross over to the other side, without being daunted by any disqualification law.

The centralised government allows for more transparency as to where decisions originate from, this directly contrasts with the United States' system with former Treasury Secretary [[C. Douglas Dillon]] saying \"the president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with government in Washington\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1|title=Constitutional reform and effective government|last=Sundquist|first=James L.|date=1992|publisher=Washington, D.C. : Brookings Institution|others=Internet Archive}}</ref> Furthermore, ministers of the U.K. cabinet are subject to weekly Question Periods in which their actions/policies are scrutinised, no such regular check on the government exists in the U.S. system.\n\n=== Distribution of power ===\nParliamentary government has attractive features for nations that are [[Ethnicity|ethnically]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|racially]], or [[Ideology|ideologically]] divided. In a presidential system, all executive power is vested in one person, the president, whereas power is more divided in a parliamentary system with its collegial executive. In the 1989 Lebanese [[Taif Agreement]], in order to give [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslims]] greater political power, Lebanon moved from a [[semi-presidential system]] with a powerful president to a system more structurally similar to classical parliamentary government. Iraq similarly disdained a presidential system out of fears that such a system would be tantamount to [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] domination of the large [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority. Afghanistan's minorities refused to go along with a presidency as strong as the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] desired.\n\nIt can also be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government, as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions, as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament. Parliamentary systems are less likely to allow celebrity-based politics to fully dominate a society, unlike what often happens in presidential systems, where name-recall and popularity can catapult a celebrity, actor, or popular politician to the presidency despite such candidate's lack of competence and experience.\n\nSome scholars like [[Juan Linz]], [[Frederick Charles Riggs|Fred Riggs]], [[Bruce Ackerman]], and [[Robert Dahl]] have found that parliamentary government is less prone to authoritarian collapse. These scholars point out that since [[World War II]], two-thirds of [[Third World]] <nowiki/> countries establishing parliamentary governments successfully made the transition to democracy. By contrast, no Third World presidential system successfully made the transition to democracy without experiencing [[Coup|coups]] and other constitutional breakdowns. A 2001 [[World Bank]] study found that parliamentary systems are associated with less corruption, which is supported by a separate study that arrived at the same conclusions.\n\n=== Calling of elections ===\nIn his 1867 book ''[[The English Constitution]]'', [[Walter Bagehot]] praised parliamentary governments for producing serious debates, for allowing for a change in power without an election, and for allowing elections at any time. Bagehot considered the four-year election rule of the United States to be unnatural, as it can potentially allow a president who has disappointed the public with a dismal performance in the second year of his term to continue on until the end of his four-year term. Under a parliamentary system, a prime minister that has lost support in the middle of his term can be easily replaced by his own peers.\n\nAlthough Bagehot praised parliamentary governments for allowing an election to take place at any time, the lack of a definite election calendar can be abused. Previously under some systems, such as the British, a ruling party could schedule elections when it felt that it was likely to retain power, and so avoid elections at times of unpopularity. (Election timing in the UK, however, is now partly fixed under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].) Thus, by a shrewd timing of elections, in a parliamentary system, a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system. This problem can be alleviated somewhat by setting fixed dates for parliamentary elections, as is the case in several of Australia's state parliaments. In other systems, such as the Dutch and the Belgian, the ruling party or coalition has some flexibility in determining the election date. Conversely, flexibility in the timing of parliamentary elections can avoid periods of legislative gridlock that can occur in a fixed period presidential system. In any case, voters ultimately have the power to choose whether to vote for the ruling party or someone else.\n\n== Disadvantages and criticisms ==\nCritics generally claim these basic disadvantages for parliamentary systems:\n\n* '''Legislative flip-flopping'''\n* '''Party fragmentation''' \n\n=== Legislative flip-flopping ===\nThe ability for strong parliamentary governments to 'push' legislation through with the ease of fused power systems such as in the United Kingdom, whilst positive in allowing rapid adaptation when necessary e.g. the nationalisation of services during the world wars, does have its drawbacks. The flip-flopping of legislation back and forth as the majority in parliament changed between the Conservatives and Labour over the period 1940-1980, contesting over the nationalisation and privatisation of the British Steel Industry resulted in major instability for the British steel sector.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=R.

Kent Weaver's book ''Are Parliamentary Systems Better?'', he writes that an advantage of presidential systems is their ability to allow and accommodate more diverse viewpoints. He states that because \"legislators are not compelled to vote against their constituents on matters of local concern, parties can serve as organizational and roll-call cuing vehicles without forcing out dissidents.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=R.

The movie was primarily filmed in [[Dallas]], Texas, and was released in US theaters on October 13, 2000. The film's music was composed by [[United States|American]] [[composer]] and [[Composer|conductor]] [[Cliff Eidelman]]{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} and [[alternative country]] singer [[Lyle Lovett]], who released [[Dr. T & The Women (album)|an album of his score]] in September 2000.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Sullivan Travis (aka \"Dr. T.\") ([[Richard Gere]]) is a wealthy Dallas [[gynecology|gynecologist]] for some of the wealthiest women in Texas who finds his life beginning to fall apart starting when his wife, Kate ([[Farrah Fawcett]]), suffers a rare type of infantalizing syndrome of wealthy women, receding into a childlike state and, after she disrobes in a shopping mall fountain is committed to the state mental hospital.  When Dr. T visits  Kate, she rebuffs his kisses as improper and he sees her pre-teen psychic age cannot be brought back to adulthood by his affection. Dr. T's eldest daughter, Dee Dee ([[Kate Hudson]]), is planning to go through with her approaching wedding despite the secret that she is romantically involved with Marilyn ([[Liv Tyler]]), the maid of honor. Dr. T's youngest daughter, Connie ([[Tara Reid]]), is a spunky conspiracy theorist who has her own agenda including sharing with her father how she discovered Dee Dee and Marilyn are lovers.\n\nWhile Marilyn is on his examining table for the first time, she surmises her condition is caused by the stress of being the maid of honor for her friend Dee Dee. Dr. T  realizes she is Dee Dee's lover and becomes embarrassed mid-examination asking Carolyn, Dr. T's loyal secretary ([[Shelley Long]]), to finish.\n\nCarolyn has romantic feelings for him, which are not mutual: in a farcical scene at the workday end, she locks the office door and gives him a shoulder-massage from behind his chair, secretly disrobing while emphasizing his need for a loving wife. Refreshed but unaware of her intentions, he goes to the coat closet, turns and finds she has vanished. From under the desk, she says he never empties his trash baskets. Approaching the desk he glimpses her state of dress and quickly leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. T's alcoholic sister-in-law, Peggy ([[Laura Dern]]), meddles in every situation she stumbles into. She is currently divorced and has moved into his house with her three young daughters.\n\nAt his golf club, Bree ([[Helen Hunt]]), a golf pro, gets accidentally soaked by the automatic sprinklers and he offers a towel and his dry golf cart and they decide to play the round together.  Accepting his offer for dinner, she says she knows a better place than his suggested restaurant, next  they're taking grocery bags into her condo. She moves quickly and gracefully turning on the stereo music by Lyle Lovett, the grill on the balcony, putting steak on, going upstairs, into one room, then walking nude across the balcony to the shower. After dinner, she takes a bottle of wine upstairs, briefly hesitating he follows her and they become lovers.  She provides friendship and comfort in his difficult office and personal life.\n\nAs Dee Dee's wedding begins the skies are darkening and thunder increasing. As the procession is blown by increasing wind, Dee Dee bypasses her groom, embraces and kisses Marylyn and the skies open up sending all the guests for shelter.  Inspired, Dr. T drives his open top convertible to Bree's house where he asks her to marry and run away with him. He offers to fulfill her every need and she asks why she would need that (this is what caused Kate's syndrome according to her psychologist). She says she has made other plans. Dr. T. asks if she is with Harlan, one of his golfing/hunting buddies, She replies: \u201cI\u2019m not with anyone.\u201d Distraught, Dr. T. drives off into the storm and into a tornado as it crosses his path and is lifted into the air, tumbles in debris; the scene fades to the morning after.  The camera view pans to reveal distant mountains surrounding a vast desert flat land.  His nearby car is found by three young Spanish speaking children. A little girl in a white dress with a veil sees the doctor badge on the front grill of the car Exclaiming \u201cDr!\u201d.

The ''[[Quake II]]'' manual says it stands for \"Big, Uh, Freakin' Gun\". This euphemistic label implies the more profane name of the BFG.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://doomwiki.org/wiki/BFG9000|title=BFG9000|accessdate=March 29, 2016|website=Doom Wiki}}</ref> Another version of the name used in the ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' motion picture is \"Bio Force Gun\". The versions found in the ''Doom'' games are called \"BFG 9000\" and those in ''Quake'' \"BFG 10K\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Doom''===\nThe first appearance of the weapon is the press beta release of ''Doom''. In that version, the BFG 9000 released a cloud of 80 small plasma balls (randomly green or red) per shot.\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' described the BFG 9000 in the first commercial ''Doom'' game as \"the Ultimate Weapon\".<ref name=\"walker199403\">{{Cite magazine |last=Walker |first=Bryan |date=March 1994 |title=Hell's Bells And Whistles |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=116 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=38-39}}</ref> It is a large energy weapon that fires giant balls of green [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The most powerful weapon in the game, it causes major damage to most types of enemies and can clear an entire room of foes in one use. A direct hit from it is often an instant kill. The player is unaffected by the splash damage, which makes it possible to use the BFG 9000 safely in close quarters, unlike some of the other powerful weapons. In the first ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', the weapon can only be picked up in the third and fourth episodes. The BFG 9000 also appears virtually unchanged in ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', ''[[Final Doom]]'', ''[[Doom 64]]'', and ''[[Doom RPG]]''.\n\nThe BFG's internal game mechanics are two-fold: the actual projectile deals a huge amount of damage, but after that, a large dose of damage is dealt in a cone facing away from the player who fired the shot; this increases the weapon's devastating area-of-effect. One peculiar quirk about the internal workings of the game code is that it remembers the direction the player fired the shot in, but not the position, meaning that the player is allowed to move far away even into an entirely different room, and still deal damage to whoever is in that room depending on the timing of the projectile's impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/bfgfaq/|title=The BFG Faqs|date=August 15, 1999|accessdate=July 17, 2016|author=Tony Fabris}}</ref>\n\n===Other versions===\nIn ''[[Doom 3]]'', the BFG 9000 is a charged weapon: holding down the trigger causes the weapon to accumulate energy before release, resulting in a more powerful shot. Overcharging the BFG too much will cause it to overheat and explode, killing the player instantly.\n\n''[[Quake II]]'' and ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' pay homage to the BFG 9000 with a pair of weapons both called the BFG10K. The ''Quake II'' version fires a slow plasma glob that fires rays at any enemies in range and [[Line of sight (gaming)|line-of-sight]]. The ''Quake III Arena'' version of the BFG fire a series of fast plasma orbs, and acts quite like the Rocket Launcher ([[rocket jumping]] can also be done with the BFG10K). BFG10K from ''Quake III'' also appears in ''[[OpenArena]]'' (different look, but same behavior) and ''[[Quake Live]]'' (with slightly modified characteristics). ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'' also pays homage to the BFG 9000 with a weapon known as the \"Authority Pulse Cannon\", which fires \"BFG Rounds\".\n\nIn the [[Doom (film)|''Doom'' movie]], the \"bio force gun\" fires a bright blue projectile which appears to burst on impact and spray a [[causticity|caustic]] substance over its target and the surrounding area.\n\nThe BFG makes a return in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]], but unlike in its first two appearances, it follows the mechanics of its ''Quake II'' rendition, firing a projectile that shoots beams at enemies. The game itself doesn't resolve the acronym \"BFG\" either in-game or in its codex entries, although one challenge in the game's final campaign level involving the BFG is called \"Big [REDACTED] Gun\" as a nod to the original vulgar name.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjoRosqiOV8|title=Doom: A Sneak Peek at the FINAL Level|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref>  In that game's pinball adaptation, it is called the \"Big Fancy Gun\", and is the most powerful weapon that the Doom Slayer can obtain<ref>{{cite video game|title=''Bethesda Pinball'' |developer=[[Zen Studios]]|date=December 6, 2016|platform= [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]|level=DOOM Pinball Table - Table Guide, Page 9: Lock 'n Load|quote=You're gonna want to find better weapons to deal with the demons and this mode is all about finding those Big Fancy Guns.}}</ref>; collecting it will grant the player an extra ball. It also makes a return in 2020's ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', where it's functionally identical to the 2016 version; it is introduced as the main component of the BFG 10000, which appears as a massive interplanetary cannon mounted on Mars's moon, Phobos, used by the [[Doomguy|Doom Slayer]] to shoot a hole into the surface of Mars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vgr.com/the-bfg-10000-of-doom-eternal-is-massive/|title=The BFG 10000 Of DOOM Eternal Is Massive|work=[[VGR (website)|VGR]]|date=August 14, 2018|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe BFG also makes an appearance in Avalanche Studios' [[Rage 2]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[UGO.com]] ranked the BFG 9000 at number two on their list of top video game weapons of all time, stating \"it was marvelous and complex, and we should not hesitate to put this weapon down in history as one of the best.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100317144049/http://www.ugo.com/games/best-video-game-weapons?page=5 Top 50 Video Game Weapons of All Time].

One peculiar quirk about the internal workings of the game code is that it remembers the direction the player fired the shot in, but not the position, meaning that the player is allowed to move far away even into an entirely different room, and still deal damage to whoever is in that room depending on the timing of the projectile's impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/bfgfaq/|title=The BFG Faqs|date=August 15, 1999|accessdate=July 17, 2016|author=Tony Fabris}}</ref>\n\n===Other versions===\nIn ''[[Doom 3]]'', the BFG 9000 is a charged weapon: holding down the trigger causes the weapon to accumulate energy before release, resulting in a more powerful shot. Overcharging the BFG too much will cause it to overheat and explode, killing the player instantly.\n\n''[[Quake II]]'' and ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' pay homage to the BFG 9000 with a pair of weapons both called the BFG10K. The ''Quake II'' version fires a slow plasma glob that fires rays at any enemies in range and [[Line of sight (gaming)|line-of-sight]]. The ''Quake III Arena'' version of the BFG fire a series of fast plasma orbs, and acts quite like the Rocket Launcher ([[rocket jumping]] can also be done with the BFG10K). BFG10K from ''Quake III'' also appears in ''[[OpenArena]]'' (different look, but same behavior) and ''[[Quake Live]]'' (with slightly modified characteristics). ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'' also pays homage to the BFG 9000 with a weapon known as the \"Authority Pulse Cannon\", which fires \"BFG Rounds\".\n\nIn the [[Doom (film)|''Doom'' movie]], the \"bio force gun\" fires a bright blue projectile which appears to burst on impact and spray a [[causticity|caustic]] substance over its target and the surrounding area.\n\nThe BFG makes a return in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]], but unlike in its first two appearances, it follows the mechanics of its ''Quake II'' rendition, firing a projectile that shoots beams at enemies. The game itself doesn't resolve the acronym \"BFG\" either in-game or in its codex entries, although one challenge in the game's final campaign level involving the BFG is called \"Big [REDACTED] Gun\" as a nod to the original vulgar name.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjoRosqiOV8|title=Doom: A Sneak Peek at the FINAL Level|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref>  In that game's pinball adaptation, it is called the \"Big Fancy Gun\", and is the most powerful weapon that the Doom Slayer can obtain<ref>{{cite video game|title=''Bethesda Pinball'' |developer=[[Zen Studios]]|date=December 6, 2016|platform= [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]|level=DOOM Pinball Table - Table Guide, Page 9: Lock 'n Load|quote=You're gonna want to find better weapons to deal with the demons and this mode is all about finding those Big Fancy Guns.}}</ref>; collecting it will grant the player an extra ball. It also makes a return in 2020's ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', where it's functionally identical to the 2016 version; it is introduced as the main component of the BFG 10000, which appears as a massive interplanetary cannon mounted on Mars's moon, Phobos, used by the Doom Slayer to shoot a hole into the surface of Mars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vgr.com/the-bfg-10000-of-doom-eternal-is-massive/|title=The BFG 10000 Of DOOM Eternal Is Massive|work=[[VGR (website)|VGR]]|date=August 14, 2018|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe BFG also makes an appearance in Avalanche Studios' [[Rage 2]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[UGO.com]] ranked the BFG 9000 at number two on their list of top video game weapons of all time, stating \"it was marvelous and complex, and we should not hesitate to put this weapon down in history as one of the best.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100317144049/http://www.ugo.com/games/best-video-game-weapons?page=5 Top 50 Video Game Weapons of All Time].
