The Chaonians ruled Epirus at an earlier time, and afterwards the Thesprotians and Molossians controlled the region.

This is where the canine breed [[Molossus (dog)|Molossoid]], native to Greece, received its name. [[Virgil]] tells us that in  [[ancient Greece]] the heavier Molossian dogs were often used by the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for hunting (''canis venaticus'') and to watch over the house and livestock (''canis pastoralis''). \"Never, with them on guard,\" says Virgil, \"need you fear for your stalls a midnight thief, or onslaught of wolves, or [[Iberians|Iberian]] brigands at your back.\"\n\n[[Strabo]] records that the Thesprotians, Molossians and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] referred to old men as ''pelioi'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03af) and old women as ''peliai'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03af) (<[[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*pel-'', \"grey\").

The Chaonians ruled Epirus at an earlier time, and afterwards the Thesprotians and Molossians controlled the region. The Thesprotians, the Chaonians, and the Molossians were the three principal clusters of Greek tribes that had emerged from Epirus and were the most powerful among all other tribes.<ref name=\"Pyrrhus\"/>\n\nThe Molossians were also renowned for their vicious hounds, which were used by shepherds to guard their flocks. This is where the canine breed [[Molossus (dog)|Molossoid]], native to Greece, received its name. [[Virgil]] tells us that in  [[ancient Greece]] the heavier Molossian dogs were often used by the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for hunting (''canis venaticus'') and to watch over the house and livestock (''canis pastoralis''). \"Never, with them on guard,\" says Virgil, \"need you fear for your stalls a midnight thief, or onslaught of wolves, or [[Iberians|Iberian]] brigands at your back.\"\n\n[[Strabo]] records that the Thesprotians, Molossians and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] referred to old men as ''pelioi'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03af) and old women as ''peliai'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03af) (<[[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*pel-'', \"grey\").

It typically has ten strings in five [[course (music)|courses]] of two strings each, but many other variations exist.\n\nThe charango was primarily played in traditional [[Andean music]], but is more and more frequently being used by other Latin American musicians. A charango player is called a ''charanguista''.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Cuna del charango.jpg|thumb|A sign in [[Potosi, Bolivia]], in the style of a charango with the words 'Cuna del Charango' (Birthplace of the Charango).]]\n[[Image:210 Museu de la M\u00fasica, el Bosc, charango.jpg|A traditional charango made of ''armadillo'', today superseded by wooden charangos, in [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]|thumb]]\n\nWhen the Spanish [[conquistador]]s came to South America, they brought the [[vihuela]] (an ancestor of the classical guitar) with them. It is not clear whether the charango is a direct descendant of a particular Spanish stringed instrument; it may have evolved from the vihuela, [[bandurria]] ([[mandolin]]), or the [[lute]]. [[Ernesto Cavour]], Bolivian charanguista, composer, and consulting music historian for many museums around the world,<ref>[[:es:Ernesto Cavour]]{{Circular reference|date=April 2019}}</ref> has noted characteristics of the charango in various vihuelas and guitars of the 16th century, and maintains the charango is the direct descendant of the vihuela.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |last=Cavour |first=Ernesto A. |title=Historia del charango |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |archive-date=23 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are many stories of how the charango came to be made with its distinctive diminutive soundbox of armadillo. One story says that the native musicians liked the sound the vihuela made, but lacked the technology to shape the wood in that manner. Another story says that the Spaniards prohibited natives from practicing their ancestral music, and that the charango was a successful attempt to make a lute that could be easily hidden under a garment such as a [[poncho]].<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Creating Our Own: Folklore, Performance, and Identity in Cuzco, Peru|author=Mendoza, Z.S.|date=2008|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822341529|url=https://archive.org/details/creatingourownfo00zoil|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/creatingourownfo00zoil/page/97 97]|access-date=2014-10-16}}</ref>\n\nThere is no clear evidence that points to a specific location or moment in time for the birth of the charango but there are a number of theories being debated. One of those is that it is believed the charango came into its present form in the early 18th century in the city of [[Potos\u00ed]] in the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]] part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (in what is present-day [[Bolivia]]), probably from [[Amerindian]] contact with [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish settlers]].  Cavour presents evidence from Bolivian murals and sculptures as early as 1744, in, for example, the Church of San Lorenzo of the city of Potos (Potos\u00ed), the facade of which depicts two mermaids playing what he believes to be charangos.<ref>[http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html  ''Op cit''., Cavour, Ernesto ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |date=May 23, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAnother two theories that are being researched are that the Charango originally came to Potos\u00ed from the Ayacucho region in colonial Peru as a result of migration within the Quechua populations. This suggests that the charango originated in the territory of what is now Peru via cultural exchange and then spread to the rest of the Andean area. This theory has not been proven either.<ref>[http://www.jornada.com.pe/cultural/6683-ayacucho-cuna-del-charango]</ref>\n\nBecause the modern states of Peru and Bolivia had not yet been established at the time, it is difficult to trace the charango's origin to a specific country, and the issue remains highly debated among nationalists from both countries.\n\nOne Bolivian musician has posited a third theory which is that the Charango was created as a variant of the timple canario from the Canary islands. More research however is required{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nThe first published historic information on the charango may be that gathered by Vega, going back to 1814, when a cleric from Tupiza documented that \"the Indians used with much enthusiasm the guitarrillos mui fuis... around here in the Andes of Bolivia they called them Charangos\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3hvsAAAAMAAJ&q=charango+guitarrillos+mui+fuis&dq=charango+guitarrillos+mui+fuis|title=Historia musical de Bolivia|publisher=|access-date=6 May 2015|author1=Gainza|first1=Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz|year=1988}}</ref>  Turino mentions that he found carved sirens representing playing charangos in some Colonial churches in the highlands of Bolivia.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=World Music: Latin & North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific|author1=Broughton, S.|author2=Ellingham, M.|author3=Trillo, R.|date=1999|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781858286365|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoworl00simo|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoworl00simo/page/278 278]|access-date=2014-10-16}}</ref>  One of the churches to which Turino refers may well be that mentioned by Cavour; construction on the San Lorenzo edifice began in 1547 and wasn't completed until 1744.<ref>[http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html  ''Op cit'', Cavour, Ernesto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |date=May 23, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Eduardo Carrasco]] of [[Quilapay\u00fan]], in the first week after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat]], the military organized a meeting with folk musicians where it was explained that the traditional instruments charango and [[quena]] were now banned.<ref name=Morris>Morris, Nancy. 1986.

One source suggests that the instrument took its name from its players, who were called ''charangeros'', meaning \"someone of questionable character and low morals\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Candaleria |first=Cordelia |title=Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture, Volume I |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Westport |year=2004 |page=427}}</ref> Another traces the term to the alteration of a Spanish term, ''charanga'', which could refer to either a type of military music played on wind instruments, or an out-of-tune orchestra.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Machpherson |editor-first=A. |title=Webster's Etymological Dictionary |publisher=Ulan Press |location=Rochester |year=2012}}</ref> Charanguista Alfredo Coca, offers yet a third theory:  asserting that \"charango\" comes from a Spanish corruption of the Quechua word \u201cChajwaku\u201d, which means joy, noisy, boisterous, referring directly to the sound of the charango.  As support for this he points to the common practice of the Conquistadors appropriating local terminology.\n\nCharanguista [[Ernesto Cavour]] disagrees, and tends to support the second origin, maintaining that the word \u201ccharango\u201d comes from a mispronunciation of the Spanish word \u201ccharanga\u201d, meaning \"brass band\" (a reasonable corollary to 'military music played on wind instruments').<ref>[http://www.cocha-banner.org/issues/2012/may/long/ Long Live the Charango!]</ref>\n\nOne of the most complete contemporary statements on the origin of the term \"charango\" appears in the introduction to Duran and Pedrotti's, ''Charango Method'', ostensibly the first complete, bilingual charango method to be published:\n\n:\"Charango\" in an Ibero-American colonial term that refers to a series of Spanish-American cultural concepts related to \"noise\" and rustically constructed objects.  The term \"charanga\", for example, was often used to refer to a small instrumental band.  \"Charanguero\", meanwhile, denoted something rough or rustic.  In his book ''El charango, su vida, costumbres y desaventuras'', Ernesto Cavour has collected a large amount of information regarding the etymology of the word \"charango\".  As this author related:\n:::\"In the rural areas of Andean Bolivia, the instruemnt is not only known by the name \"charango\", but by many others as well, including:  mediana, guitarrilla, thalachi, quirqui, p'alta, khonkhota, aiquileno, guitarron, anzaldeno, etc. ...\"\n:An Uruguan publication from 1823 uses the term \"changango\" as a synonym for the Argentine \"charango\", and claims the same word was used during the eighteenth century to refer to old and poorly constructed guitars:\n:::\"...In Argentina they speak of the Charango, a guitar with five doubled strings and a body made from the shell of an Armadillo.  Nevertheless, the small Spanish-American guitar has been known by the name changango for more than one hundred years.  In a footnote to his correspondence with [[Paulino Lucero]] regarding the [[Great War]], Hilario Ascasubi explains this situation with indisputable clarity:  \"Changango: an old, poorly made guitar\".\n:::(Excerpt from the newspaper \"El Domador\", Montecivideo, 19 March 1823).\n:Julio Mendivil engages in a similarly detailed discussion of this issue in his article ''La construccion de la historia:  el charango en la memoria colectiva mestiza ayacuchana'', Musicology Institut/University of Colonia.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Duran |first=Horatio |last2=Pedrotti |first2=Italo |title=Charango Method |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |location=Pacific, MO |year=2010}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Parts of the Charango 1.jpg|thumbnail|283px|Designation of the parts of the charango]]\nTraditionally a charango was made with a dried [[armadillo]] shell for the back and wood for the soundbox top, neck etc. While still common, this is no longer the norm: rather they are now typically made of wood, with the bowled back merely imitating the shape of the armadillo shell. Unlike most wooden lutes, the body and neck are typically made of a single block of wood, carved into shape. The charango's ten strings require quite a large headstock, often approaching or even exceeding the size of its diminutive sound box. Aside from these visual distinctions, it resembles something between a bowl-backed mandolin and a small [[ukulele]].\n\nThe overall length of a typical charango is about 66&nbsp;cm, with a string scale length of about 37&nbsp;cm. The number of frets ranges from five to eighteen. The most common form of the instrument has ten strings of nylon, gut, or (less commonly) metal.  (Variant forms of the charango may have anywhere from four to fifteen strings, in various combinations of single, double, or triple [[course (music)|courses]].)  The body generally has a narrowed ''waist'', reminiscent of the guitar family, and not the pear-shape of the lute.  There are many minor variations in the shape of the body and soundboard (top), and many different kinds of wood are used, although, like guitars, the preferred [[tone wood]]s for the top come from the cedar or spruce families. Old instruments had friction-style tuning pegs (similar to those used on violins), but today a classical guitar style peghead with geared \"machine\" tuners is the norm, though these are occasionally positioned perpendicular to the headstock.  Most instruments include some degree of ornamentation, which may range from simple purfling inlays around the perimeter of the top, to elaborately carved headstocks, and whole scenes engraved, carved, or burned into the back of the body.  Strap buttons are sometimes added, as are position marker dots on the fingerboard.\n\nVariations may include a separate glued-on neck, a two-piece top plate of contrasting woods, old-style friction tuning pegs in [[palisander]] or [[ebony]], guitar-style box construction, or even a hollowed-out neck.  The size, shape, and number of soundholes is highly variable and may be a single round or oval hole, dual crescents, or even multiple holes of varying arrangement.  Another variant is a neck with two holes bored 3/4 of the way through, parallel to the fretboard and close to the headstock (an innovation said to color the instrument's tone).{{Dubious|date=March 2015}}{{Citation needed|reason=Source of the information concerning these holes? Have seen and played dozens of charangos, but never any with holes bored in the neck.|date=March 2015}}\n\nMore recently solid-body electric and hollow-body acoustic-electric charangos have become available. The solid-body instruments are built very much as miniature electric guitars, whereas the acoustic-electrics are usually a standard acoustic charango with the addition of a [[contact microphone]] or [[piezoelectric]] [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] to run the output of the instrument through an amplifier.\n\nIn his book ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', Che Guevara described a charango he saw near [[Temuco]], Chile, in 1952. It was \"made with three or four wires some two meters in length stretched tightly across tins fixed to a board. The musician uses a kind of metal knuckle duster with which he plucks the wires producing a sound like a toy guitar.\"<ref>The Motorcycle Diaries: Notes on a Latin American Journey. by Ernesto Che Guevara. Ocean Press. 2003. {{ISBN|1-876175-70-2}}</ref>\n\n==Tuning==\nThe basic charango has five pairs (or courses) of strings, typically tuned GCEAE. This tuning, disregarding octaves, is similar to the typical C-tuning of the [[ukulele]] or the Venezuelan [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]], with the addition of a second E-course. Unlike most other stringed instruments, all ten strings are tuned inside one octave. The five courses are pitched as follows (from 5th to 1st course): G4 G4 - C5 C5 - E5 E4 - A4 A4 -E5 E5. Some ''charanguistas'' use \"octave\" strings on other pairs in addition to the middle course. Note that the lowest pitch is the \"E\" string in the middle (3rd) course, preceded by the higher pitched \"g\" (5th) course and \"c\" (4th) course, and followed by still higher pitched \"a\" (2nd) course and \"e\" (1st) courses. This tuning pattern is known as a [[Reentrant tuning|re-entrant]] pattern because the pitches of the strings do not rise steadily from one string or course to the next, but progress from high to low and then back to high pitch again.\n\n[[Image:Charango player.jpg|right|260px|thumb|A charango player.]]\n\nThe ramifications of the charango tuning are that there is a very narrow tonal range in most chords, often with many pitch duplications, which produces a surprisingly powerful sound from the small instrument. Seventh and ninth chords shimmer more than on a guitar due to the close harmonies. In terms of melody playing, the ''charanguista'' can create a harp-like sound with close intervals ringing out (i.e., like a piano with the sustain pedal engaged). With the close pitch spacing across strings (intervals like 2nds), a simple alternating finger-style pattern in the right hand can produce very rapid chromatic and diatonic runs with only minimal movement of the left hand on the fingerboard.  This makes the charango an extremely agile melodic instrument, especially when compared to instruments traditionally played with a [[Plectrum|flat pick]].\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, tunings for the charango may vary, but the \"standardized\" tunings most commonly used (for the 10-stringed, five-course version) are:\n[[Image:Charango tuning v2.svg|thumb|Charango tuning (Am7)]]\n[[File:Charango - cuerdas al aire.ogg|thumb|Notes of charango.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Em7 is achieved by tuning down by a [[perfect fourth]].\n\n==Types==\nThere are metal string, nylon/gut string, and mixed-string charangos. Some metal-stringed versions have all strings at the same gauge. There are also solid-body electric charangos.\n\nThere are many types of charango. In many cases the variant is named for the town or region in which it originated, or in which it is most frequently seen, ''e.g.'', the ''Charango Ayquile\u00f1o'' of Ayquile, Bolivia. The number of strings on these variant instruments ranges from four to 20, and courses may be single, double, triple, or quadruple strung. (The standard charango has 10 strings in five courses of two strings each.)<ref>''Asociaci\u00f3n Internacional del Charango'' (Spanish)|{{cite web|url=http://www.aicharango.org/portal/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202039/http://www.aicharango.org/portal/index.php |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref>\n\nSome types of charango are:\n[[Image:Walaycho.jpg|175px|thumb|Walaycho]]\n\n[[Image:Chillador.

Despite the short scale, the headstock must still accommodate ten tuners, which increases the total length of the instrument by nearly a third&nbsp;\u2014 ca. 56&nbsp;cm is typical.

About 75&nbsp;cm long by 22&nbsp;cm wide with a 42\u201351&nbsp;cm scale.  Tunings vary, with the most common being a ''fourth lower'' than the charango (Argentine tuning) or a ''fifth lower'' (Bolivian tuning).  It is occasionally tuned an octave lower that the charango, but such lower pitches are more usually reserved for the ronroco.<ref>Rosa, Jose; ''The history of music from Cuba, the Caribbean, South America and the United States''; Contemporary Latin Music Educators; Southwest Ranches, Florida:  2008.  p.68</ref>\n* '''[[Ronroco]]''' (also ''ronrroco''): a still larger relative, essentially a baritone or bass charango, about 80&nbsp;cm long with a 46\u201350&nbsp;cm scale.

As with the ''charang\u00f3n'' tunings vary, and depending on region and use the ronroco may be tuned a ''fourth lower'' than the charango (Argentine tuning); a ''fifth lower'' (Bolivia; Chile); or an octave lower (\"Bolivian tuning\").  The octave lower tuning is better acoustically supported by the larger body of the ronroco, and is more common on this instrument than on the charang\u00f3n.  The strings of the third (center) course are tuned an octave apart; strings in the other courses are usually tuned in unisons, though occasionally the fourth or fifth courses (or both) may be tuned in octaves.

It typically has ten strings in five [[course (music)|courses]] of two strings each, but many other variations exist.\n\nThe charango was primarily played in traditional [[Andean music]], but is more and more frequently being used by other Latin American musicians. A charango player is called a ''charanguista''.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Cuna del charango.jpg|thumb|A sign in [[Potosi, Bolivia]], in the style of a charango with the words 'Cuna del Charango' (Birthplace of the Charango).]]\n[[Image:210 Museu de la M\u00fasica, el Bosc, charango.jpg|A traditional charango made of ''armadillo'', today superseded by wooden charangos, in [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]|thumb]]\n\nWhen the Spanish [[conquistador]]s came to South America, they brought the [[vihuela]] (an ancestor of the classical guitar) with them. It is not clear whether the charango is a direct descendant of a particular Spanish stringed instrument; it may have evolved from the vihuela, [[bandurria]] ([[mandolin]]), or the [[lute]]. [[Ernesto Cavour]], Bolivian charanguista, composer, and consulting music historian for many museums around the world,<ref>[[:es:Ernesto Cavour]]{{Circular reference|date=April 2019}}</ref> has noted characteristics of the charango in various vihuelas and guitars of the 16th century, and maintains the charango is the direct descendant of the vihuela.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |last=Cavour |first=Ernesto A. |title=Historia del charango |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |archive-date=23 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are many stories of how the charango came to be made with its distinctive diminutive soundbox of armadillo. One story says that the native musicians liked the sound the vihuela made, but lacked the technology to shape the wood in that manner. Another story says that the Spaniards prohibited natives from practicing their ancestral music, and that the charango was a successful attempt to make a lute that could be easily hidden under a garment such as a [[poncho]].<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Creating Our Own: Folklore, Performance, and Identity in Cuzco, Peru|author=Mendoza, Z.S.|date=2008|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822341529|url=https://archive.org/details/creatingourownfo00zoil|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/creatingourownfo00zoil/page/97 97]|access-date=2014-10-16}}</ref>\n\nThere is no clear evidence that points to a specific location or moment in time for the birth of the charango but there are a number of theories being debated. One of those is that it is believed the charango came into its present form in the early 18th century in the city of [[Potos\u00ed]] in the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]] part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (in what is present-day [[Bolivia]]), probably from [[Amerindian]] contact with [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish settlers]].  Cavour presents evidence from Bolivian murals and sculptures as early as 1744, in, for example, the Church of San Lorenzo of the city of Potos (Potos\u00ed), the facade of which depicts two mermaids playing what he believes to be charangos.<ref>[http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html  ''Op cit''., Cavour, Ernesto ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |date=May 23, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAnother two theories that are being researched are that the Charango originally came to Potos\u00ed from the Ayacucho region in colonial Peru as a result of migration within the Quechua populations. This suggests that the charango originated in the territory of what is now Peru via cultural exchange and then spread to the rest of the Andean area. This theory has not been proven either.<ref>[http://www.jornada.com.pe/cultural/6683-ayacucho-cuna-del-charango]</ref>\n\nBecause the modern states of Peru and Bolivia had not yet been established at the time, it is difficult to trace the charango's origin to a specific country, and the issue remains highly debated among nationalists from both countries.\n\nOne Bolivian musician has posited a third theory which is that the Charango was created as a variant of the timple canario from the Canary islands. More research however is required{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nThe first published historic information on the charango may be that gathered by Vega, going back to 1814, when a cleric from Tupiza documented that \"the Indians used with much enthusiasm the guitarrillos mui fuis... around here in the Andes of Bolivia they called them Charangos\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3hvsAAAAMAAJ&q=charango+guitarrillos+mui+fuis&dq=charango+guitarrillos+mui+fuis|title=Historia musical de Bolivia|publisher=|access-date=6 May 2015|author1=Gainza|first1=Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz|year=1988}}</ref>  Turino mentions that he found carved sirens representing playing charangos in some Colonial churches in the highlands of Bolivia.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=World Music: Latin & North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific|author1=Broughton, S.|author2=Ellingham, M.|author3=Trillo, R.|date=1999|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781858286365|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoworl00simo|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoworl00simo/page/278 278]|access-date=2014-10-16}}</ref>  One of the churches to which Turino refers may well be that mentioned by Cavour; construction on the San Lorenzo edifice began in 1547 and wasn't completed until 1744.<ref>[http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html  ''Op cit'', Cavour, Ernesto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |date=May 23, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Eduardo Carrasco]] of [[Quilapay\u00fan]], in the first week after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat]], the military organized a meeting with folk musicians where it was explained that the traditional instruments charango and [[quena]] were now banned.<ref name=Morris>Morris, Nancy. 1986.

One source suggests that the instrument took its name from its players, who were called ''charangeros'', meaning \"someone of questionable character and low morals\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Candaleria |first=Cordelia |title=Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture, Volume I |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Westport |year=2004 |page=427}}</ref> Another traces the term to the alteration of a Spanish term, ''charanga'', which could refer to either a type of military music played on wind instruments, or an out-of-tune orchestra.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Machpherson |editor-first=A. |title=Webster's Etymological Dictionary |publisher=Ulan Press |location=Rochester |year=2012}}</ref> Charanguista Alfredo Coca, offers yet a third theory:  asserting that \"charango\" comes from a Spanish corruption of the Quechua word \u201cChajwaku\u201d, which means joy, noisy, boisterous, referring directly to the sound of the charango.  As support for this he points to the common practice of the Conquistadors appropriating local terminology.\n\nCharanguista [[Ernesto Cavour]] disagrees, and tends to support the second origin, maintaining that the word \u201ccharango\u201d comes from a mispronunciation of the Spanish word \u201ccharanga\u201d, meaning \"brass band\" (a reasonable corollary to 'military music played on wind instruments').<ref>[http://www.cocha-banner.org/issues/2012/may/long/ Long Live the Charango!]</ref>\n\nOne of the most complete contemporary statements on the origin of the term \"charango\" appears in the introduction to Duran and Pedrotti's, ''Charango Method'', ostensibly the first complete, bilingual charango method to be published:\n\n:\"Charango\" in an Ibero-American colonial term that refers to a series of Spanish-American cultural concepts related to \"noise\" and rustically constructed objects.  The term \"charanga\", for example, was often used to refer to a small instrumental band.  \"Charanguero\", meanwhile, denoted something rough or rustic.  In his book ''El charango, su vida, costumbres y desaventuras'', Ernesto Cavour has collected a large amount of information regarding the etymology of the word \"charango\".  As this author related:\n:::\"In the rural areas of Andean Bolivia, the instruemnt is not only known by the name \"charango\", but by many others as well, including:  mediana, guitarrilla, thalachi, quirqui, p'alta, khonkhota, aiquileno, guitarron, anzaldeno, etc. ...\"\n:An Uruguan publication from 1823 uses the term \"changango\" as a synonym for the Argentine \"charango\", and claims the same word was used during the eighteenth century to refer to old and poorly constructed guitars:\n:::\"...In Argentina they speak of the Charango, a guitar with five doubled strings and a body made from the shell of an Armadillo.  Nevertheless, the small Spanish-American guitar has been known by the name changango for more than one hundred years.  In a footnote to his correspondence with [[Paulino Lucero]] regarding the [[Great War]], Hilario Ascasubi explains this situation with indisputable clarity:  \"Changango: an old, poorly made guitar\".\n:::(Excerpt from the newspaper \"El Domador\", Montecivideo, 19 March 1823).\n:Julio Mendivil engages in a similarly detailed discussion of this issue in his article ''La construccion de la historia:  el charango en la memoria colectiva mestiza ayacuchana'', Musicology Institut/University of Colonia.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Duran |first=Horatio |last2=Pedrotti |first2=Italo |title=Charango Method |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |location=Pacific, MO |year=2010}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Parts of the Charango 1.jpg|thumbnail|283px|Designation of the parts of the charango]]\nTraditionally a charango was made with a dried [[armadillo]] shell for the back and wood for the soundbox top, neck etc. While still common, this is no longer the norm: rather they are now typically made of wood, with the bowled back merely imitating the shape of the armadillo shell. Unlike most wooden lutes, the body and neck are typically made of a single block of wood, carved into shape. The charango's ten strings require quite a large headstock, often approaching or even exceeding the size of its diminutive sound box. Aside from these visual distinctions, it resembles something between a bowl-backed mandolin and a small [[ukulele]].\n\nThe overall length of a typical charango is about 66&nbsp;cm, with a string scale length of about 37&nbsp;cm. The number of frets ranges from five to eighteen. The most common form of the instrument has ten strings of nylon, gut, or (less commonly) metal.  (Variant forms of the charango may have anywhere from four to fifteen strings, in various combinations of single, double, or triple [[course (music)|courses]].)  The body generally has a narrowed ''waist'', reminiscent of the guitar family, and not the pear-shape of the lute.  There are many minor variations in the shape of the body and soundboard (top), and many different kinds of wood are used, although, like guitars, the preferred [[tone wood]]s for the top come from the cedar or spruce families. Old instruments had friction-style tuning pegs (similar to those used on violins), but today a classical guitar style peghead with geared \"machine\" tuners is the norm, though these are occasionally positioned perpendicular to the headstock.  Most instruments include some degree of ornamentation, which may range from simple purfling inlays around the perimeter of the top, to elaborately carved headstocks, and whole scenes engraved, carved, or burned into the back of the body.  Strap buttons are sometimes added, as are position marker dots on the fingerboard.\n\nVariations may include a separate glued-on neck, a two-piece top plate of contrasting woods, old-style friction tuning pegs in [[palisander]] or [[ebony]], guitar-style box construction, or even a hollowed-out neck.  The size, shape, and number of soundholes is highly variable and may be a single round or oval hole, dual crescents, or even multiple holes of varying arrangement.  Another variant is a neck with two holes bored 3/4 of the way through, parallel to the fretboard and close to the headstock (an innovation said to color the instrument's tone).{{Dubious|date=March 2015}}{{Citation needed|reason=Source of the information concerning these holes? Have seen and played dozens of charangos, but never any with holes bored in the neck.|date=March 2015}}\n\nMore recently solid-body electric and hollow-body acoustic-electric charangos have become available. The solid-body instruments are built very much as miniature electric guitars, whereas the acoustic-electrics are usually a standard acoustic charango with the addition of a [[contact microphone]] or [[piezoelectric]] [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] to run the output of the instrument through an amplifier.\n\nIn his book ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', Che Guevara described a charango he saw near [[Temuco]], Chile, in 1952. It was \"made with three or four wires some two meters in length stretched tightly across tins fixed to a board. The musician uses a kind of metal knuckle duster with which he plucks the wires producing a sound like a toy guitar.\"<ref>The Motorcycle Diaries: Notes on a Latin American Journey. by Ernesto Che Guevara. Ocean Press. 2003. {{ISBN|1-876175-70-2}}</ref>\n\n==Tuning==\nThe basic charango has five pairs (or courses) of strings, typically tuned GCEAE. This tuning, disregarding octaves, is similar to the typical C-tuning of the [[ukulele]] or the Venezuelan [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]], with the addition of a second E-course. Unlike most other stringed instruments, all ten strings are tuned inside one octave. The five courses are pitched as follows (from 5th to 1st course): G4 G4 - C5 C5 - E5 E4 - A4 A4 -E5 E5. Some ''charanguistas'' use \"octave\" strings on other pairs in addition to the middle course. Note that the lowest pitch is the \"E\" string in the middle (3rd) course, preceded by the higher pitched \"g\" (5th) course and \"c\" (4th) course, and followed by still higher pitched \"a\" (2nd) course and \"e\" (1st) courses. This tuning pattern is known as a [[Reentrant tuning|re-entrant]] pattern because the pitches of the strings do not rise steadily from one string or course to the next, but progress from high to low and then back to high pitch again.\n\n[[Image:Charango player.jpg|right|260px|thumb|A charango player.]]\n\nThe ramifications of the charango tuning are that there is a very narrow tonal range in most chords, often with many pitch duplications, which produces a surprisingly powerful sound from the small instrument. Seventh and ninth chords shimmer more than on a guitar due to the close harmonies. In terms of melody playing, the ''charanguista'' can create a harp-like sound with close intervals ringing out (i.e., like a piano with the sustain pedal engaged). With the close pitch spacing across strings (intervals like 2nds), a simple alternating finger-style pattern in the right hand can produce very rapid chromatic and diatonic runs with only minimal movement of the left hand on the fingerboard.  This makes the charango an extremely agile melodic instrument, especially when compared to instruments traditionally played with a [[Plectrum|flat pick]].\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, tunings for the charango may vary, but the \"standardized\" tunings most commonly used (for the 10-stringed, five-course version) are:\n[[Image:Charango tuning v2.svg|thumb|Charango tuning (Am7)]]\n[[File:Charango - cuerdas al aire.ogg|thumb|Notes of charango.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Em7 is achieved by tuning down by a [[perfect fourth]].\n\n==Types==\nThere are metal string, nylon/gut string, and mixed-string charangos. Some metal-stringed versions have all strings at the same gauge. There are also solid-body electric charangos.\n\nThere are many types of charango. In many cases the variant is named for the town or region in which it originated, or in which it is most frequently seen, ''e.g.'', the ''Charango Ayquile\u00f1o'' of Ayquile, Bolivia. The number of strings on these variant instruments ranges from four to 20, and courses may be single, double, triple, or quadruple strung. (The standard charango has 10 strings in five courses of two strings each.)<ref>''Asociaci\u00f3n Internacional del Charango'' (Spanish)|{{cite web|url=http://www.aicharango.org/portal/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202039/http://www.aicharango.org/portal/index.php |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref>\n\nSome types of charango are:\n[[Image:Walaycho.jpg|175px|thumb|Walaycho]]\n\n[[Image:Chillador.

MDMB 825.JPG|100px|thumb|A 12-string chillador]]\n* '''[[Walaycho]]''' (also ''hualaycho'', ''maulincho'', or '' kalampiador''):  a smaller relative, with a scale typically around 30&nbsp;cm long.  It has ten strings, which may be of metal, nylon, or nylon fishing line, arranged in five courses of two strings each. Despite the short scale, the headstock must still accommodate ten tuners, which increases the total length of the instrument by nearly a third&nbsp;\u2014 ca. 56&nbsp;cm is typical. Usually tuned a ''fifth higher'' (sometimes a fourth higher) than the charango, strings in the third (center) course may be either in unison or in octaves.\n* '''[[charangon|Charang\u00f3n]]''':  (also ''charangone'') a larger relative, in effect, a tenor charango.  About 75&nbsp;cm long by 22&nbsp;cm wide with a 42\u201351&nbsp;cm scale.  Tunings vary, with the most common being a ''fourth lower'' than the charango (Argentine tuning) or a ''fifth lower'' (Bolivian tuning).  It is occasionally tuned an octave lower that the charango, but such lower pitches are more usually reserved for the ronroco.<ref>Rosa, Jose; ''The history of music from Cuba, the Caribbean, South America and the United States''; Contemporary Latin Music Educators; Southwest Ranches, Florida:  2008.  p.68</ref>\n* '''[[Ronroco]]''' (also ''ronrroco''): a still larger relative, essentially a baritone or bass charango, about 80&nbsp;cm long with a 46\u201350&nbsp;cm scale. It was invented by [[Los Kjarkas|Gonzalo Hermosa]],  of the group [[Los Kjarkas]] from Cochabamba, Bolivia, in the 1980s. Ten nylon strings are arranged in five double courses. As with the ''charang\u00f3n'' tunings vary, and depending on region and use the ronroco may be tuned a ''fourth lower'' than the charango (Argentine tuning); a ''fifth lower'' (Bolivia; Chile); or an octave lower (\"Bolivian tuning\").  The octave lower tuning is better acoustically supported by the larger body of the ronroco, and is more common on this instrument than on the charang\u00f3n.  The strings of the third (center) course are tuned an octave apart; strings in the other courses are usually tuned in unisons, though occasionally the fourth or fifth courses (or both) may be tuned in octaves.  When courses four and five are doubled at the ''lower'' octave the ronroco is essentially no longer in reentrant tuning.<ref>[http://www.guitar-learning.com/node/208 A Guitarist's Choice To Play The Ronroco (baritone charango)]</ref>\n* '''[[Chillador]]''': The name chillador can refer either to two related types of charango.

In the oldest version, inscribed in the Sumerian city of [[Nippur]] c.1600 BCE, the hero is King [[Ziusudra]]. This is known as the Sumerian Flood Story and probably derives from an earlier version. The Ziusudra version tells how he builds a boat and rescues life when the gods decide to destroy it. This remains the basic plot for several subsequent flood-stories and heroes, including Noah. Ziusudra's Sumerian name means \"He of long life\". In Babylonian versions his name is [[Atrahasis]], but the meaning is the same. In the Atrahasis version, the flood is a river flood.<ref name=\"Cline\">{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |year=2007 |title=From Eden to Exile: Unraveling Mysteries of the Bible |publisher=National Geographic |isbn=978-1-4262-0084-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJW-zhffwk4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=From+Eden+to+Exile:+Unraveling+Mysteries+of+the+Bible#v=onepage&q=From%20Eden%20to%20Exile%3A%20Unraveling%20Mysteries%20of%20the%20Bible&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nThe version closest to the biblical story of Noah, as well as its most likely source, is that of [[Utnapishtim]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=40}} The most complete text of Utnapishtim's story is a clay tablet dating from the 7th century BCE, but fragments of the story have been found from as far back as the 19th century BCE.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=40}} The last known version of the Mesopotamian flood story was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE by a Babylonian priest named [[Berossus]]. From the fragments that survive, it seems little changed from the versions of two thousand years before.{{sfn|Finkel|2014|p=89-101}}\n\nThe parallels between Noah's Ark and the arks of Babylonian flood-heroes Atrahasis and Utnapishtim have often been noted. Atrahasis' ark was circular, resembling an enormous [[quffa]], and had one or two decks. Utnapishtim's ark was a [[cube]] and had six decks with seven compartments on each, each divided into nine subcompartments (for 63 subcompartments per deck and 378 total). Noah's Ark was rectangular and had three decks. There is believed to be a linear progression from circular to cubic or square to rectangular. The most striking similarity is the near-identical deck areas of the three arks: 14,400 cubits<sup>2</sup>, 14,400 cubits<sup>2</sup>, and 15,000 cubits<sup>2</sup> for Atrahasis', Utnapishtim's, and Noah's ark, respectively (a difference of 4%). This has led professor Finkel to conclude that \"the iconic story of the Flood, Noah, and the Ark as we know it today certainly originated in the landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.\"{{sfn|Finkel|2014|loc=chpt.14}}\n\nLinguistic parallels between Noah's ark and the ark of the Babylonian flood-hero Atrahasis have also been noted. The word used for \"pitch\" (sealing tar or resin) in Genesis is not the normal Hebrew word, but is closely related to the word used in the Babylonian story.{{sfn|McKeown|2008|p=55}} Likewise, the Hebrew word for \"ark\" (''tevah'') is nearly identical to the Babylonian word for an oblong boat (''\u1e6dubb\u00fb''), especially given that \"v\" and \"b\" are the same letter in Hebrew: [[bet (letter)|bet]] (\u05d1).{{sfn|Finkel|2014|loc=chpt.14}}\n\nHowever, the causes for God/gods having sent the flood differ. In the Hebrew myth the flood comes as God's judgment on a wicked humanity. In the Babylonian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the reasons are not given and the flood appears to be the result of the caprice of the gods.<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G., and Bruce M.

In order to protect Noah and his family, God placed lions and other ferocious animals to guard them from the wicked who tried to stop them from entering the ark. According to one [[Midrash]], it was God, or the [[angel]]s, who gathered the animals to the ark, together with their food. As there had been no need to distinguish between clean and unclean animals before this time, the clean animals made themselves known by kneeling before Noah as they entered the ark. A differing opinion said that the ark itself distinguished clean animals from unclean, admitting seven pairs each of the former and one pair each of the latter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAccording to Sanhedrin 108b, Noah was engaged both day and night in feeding and caring for the animals, and did not sleep for the entire year aboard the ark.<ref>Avigdor Nebenzahl, ''Tiku Bachodesh Shofer: Thoughts for [[Rosh Hashanah]]'', Feldheim Publishers, 1997, p. 208.</ref> The animals were the best of their species, and so behaved with utmost goodness.

(The word for the [[Ark of the Covenant]] is quite different). The ark is built to save Noah, his family, and representatives of all animals from a divinely-sent flood intended to wipe out all life, and in both cases the ''teva'' has a connection with salvation from waters.

In the oldest version, inscribed in the Sumerian city of [[Nippur]] c.1600 BCE, the hero is King [[Ziusudra]]. This is known as the Sumerian Flood Story and probably derives from an earlier version. The Ziusudra version tells how he builds a boat and rescues life when the gods decide to destroy it. This remains the basic plot for several subsequent flood-stories and heroes, including Noah. Ziusudra's Sumerian name means \"He of long life\". In Babylonian versions his name is [[Atrahasis]], but the meaning is the same. In the Atrahasis version, the flood is a river flood.<ref name=\"Cline\">{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |year=2007 |title=From Eden to Exile: Unraveling Mysteries of the Bible |publisher=National Geographic |isbn=978-1-4262-0084-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJW-zhffwk4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=From+Eden+to+Exile:+Unraveling+Mysteries+of+the+Bible#v=onepage&q=From%20Eden%20to%20Exile%3A%20Unraveling%20Mysteries%20of%20the%20Bible&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nThe version closest to the biblical story of Noah, as well as its most likely source, is that of [[Utnapishtim]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=40}} The most complete text of Utnapishtim's story is a clay tablet dating from the 7th century BCE, but fragments of the story have been found from as far back as the 19th century BCE.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=40}} The last known version of the Mesopotamian flood story was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE by a Babylonian priest named [[Berossus]]. From the fragments that survive, it seems little changed from the versions of two thousand years before.{{sfn|Finkel|2014|p=89-101}}\n\nThe parallels between Noah's Ark and the arks of Babylonian flood-heroes Atrahasis and Utnapishtim have often been noted. Atrahasis' ark was circular, resembling an enormous [[quffa]], and had one or two decks. Utnapishtim's ark was a [[cube]] and had six decks with seven compartments on each, each divided into nine subcompartments (for 63 subcompartments per deck and 378 total). Noah's Ark was rectangular and had three decks. There is believed to be a linear progression from circular to cubic or square to rectangular. The most striking similarity is the near-identical deck areas of the three arks: 14,400 cubits<sup>2</sup>, 14,400 cubits<sup>2</sup>, and 15,000 cubits<sup>2</sup> for Atrahasis', Utnapishtim's, and Noah's ark, respectively (a difference of 4%). This has led professor Finkel to conclude that \"the iconic story of the Flood, Noah, and the Ark as we know it today certainly originated in the landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.\"{{sfn|Finkel|2014|loc=chpt.14}}\n\nLinguistic parallels between Noah's ark and the ark of the Babylonian flood-hero Atrahasis have also been noted. The word used for \"pitch\" (sealing tar or resin) in Genesis is not the normal Hebrew word, but is closely related to the word used in the Babylonian story.{{sfn|McKeown|2008|p=55}} Likewise, the Hebrew word for \"ark\" (''tevah'') is nearly identical to the Babylonian word for an oblong boat (''\u1e6dubb\u00fb''), especially given that \"v\" and \"b\" are the same letter in Hebrew: [[bet (letter)|bet]] (\u05d1).{{sfn|Finkel|2014|loc=chpt.14}}\n\nHowever, the causes for God/gods having sent the flood differ. In the Hebrew myth the flood comes as God's judgment on a wicked humanity. In the Babylonian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the reasons are not given and the flood appears to be the result of the caprice of the gods.<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G., and Bruce M.

In order to protect Noah and his family, God placed lions and other ferocious animals to guard them from the wicked who tried to stop them from entering the ark. According to one [[Midrash]], it was God, or the [[angel]]s, who gathered the animals to the ark, together with their food. As there had been no need to distinguish between clean and unclean animals before this time, the clean animals made themselves known by kneeling before Noah as they entered the ark. A differing opinion said that the ark itself distinguished clean animals from unclean, admitting seven pairs each of the former and one pair each of the latter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAccording to Sanhedrin 108b, Noah was engaged both day and night in feeding and caring for the animals, and did not sleep for the entire year aboard the ark.<ref>Avigdor Nebenzahl, ''Tiku Bachodesh Shofer: Thoughts for [[Rosh Hashanah]]'', Feldheim Publishers, 1997, p. 208.</ref> The animals were the best of their species, and so behaved with utmost goodness. They abstained from procreation, so that the number of creatures that disembarked was exactly equal to the number that embarked. The raven created problems, refusing to leave the ark when Noah sent it forth and accusing the patriarch of wishing to destroy its race, but as the commentators pointed out, God wished to save the raven, for its descendants were destined to feed the prophet [[Elijah]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAccording to one tradition, refuse was stored on the lowest of the ark's three decks, humans and clean beasts on the second, and the unclean animals and birds on the top; a differing interpretation described the refuse as being stored on the utmost deck, from where it was shoveled into the sea through a trapdoor.

Hippolytus furthermore stated that the ark floated to and fro in the four directions on the waters, making the sign of the cross, before eventually landing on Mount Kardu \"in the east, in the land of the sons of Raban, and the Orientals call it Mount Godash; the [[Armenians]] call it Ararat\".<ref name=\"Knight, K 2007\">{{cite web |author = Hippolytus |title = Fragments from the Scriptural Commentaries of Hippolytus |url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0502.htm |publisher = New Advent |accessdate = 27 June 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070417130437/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0502.htm |archive-date = 17 April 2007 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all}}</ref> On a more practical plane, Hippolytus explained that the lowest of the three decks was for wild beasts, the middle for birds and domestic animals, and the top level for humans. He says that male animals were separated from the females by sharp stakes so that there would be no breeding on board.<ref name=\"Knight, K 2007\"/>\n\nThe early [[Church Father]] and theologian [[Origen]] (c. 182\u2013251), in response to a critic who doubted that the ark could contain all the animals in the world, argued that Moses, the traditional author of the book of Genesis, had been brought up in [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and would therefore have used the larger Egyptian cubit. He also fixed the shape of the ark as a truncated [[pyramid]], square at its base, and tapering to a square peak one cubit on a side; it was not until the 12th century that it came to be thought of as a rectangular box with a sloping roof.{{sfn|Cohn|1996|p=38}}\n\nEarly Christian artists depicted Noah standing in a small box on the waves, symbolizing God saving the Christian Church in its turbulent early years. St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354\u2013430), in his work ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', demonstrated that the dimensions of the ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which according to Christian doctrine is the body of Christ and in turn the body of the Church.<ref name=\"Schaff, P 1890\">{{cite book |last=St. Augustin |editor-last=Schaff |editor-first=Philip |title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers |trans-title=St. Augustin's City of God and Christian Doctrine |series=1 |volume=2 |origyear=c. 400 |year=1890 |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Company |chapter=Chapter 26:That the Ark Which Noah Was Ordered to Make Figures In Every Respect Christ and the Church |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XV.26.html |ref=harv }}</ref> St. [[Jerome]] (c. 347\u2013420) identified the raven, which was sent forth and did not return, as the \"foul bird of wickedness\" expelled by [[baptism]];<ref>{{cite book |last=Jerome |editor=Schaff, P |title=Niocene and Post-Niocene Fathers: The Principal Works of St. Jerome |series=2 |volume=6 |origyear=c. 347\u2013420 |year=1892 |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Company |chapter=Letter LXIX.

Three missing planks, symbolizing three prophets, were brought from [[Egypt]] by Og, son of Anak, the only one of the [[giant (mythology)|giant]]s permitted to survive the Flood. The body of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] was carried in the middle to divide the men from the women. Surah 11:41 says: \"And he said, 'Ride ye in it; in the Name of Allah it moves and stays!'\"; this was taken to mean that Noah said, \"In the Name of Allah!\" when he wished the ark to move, and the same when he wished it to stand still.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe medieval scholar [[Al-Masudi|Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn Masudi]] (died 956) wrote that Allah commanded the Earth to absorb the water, and certain portions which were slow in obeying received [[seawater|salt water]] in punishment and so became [[desert|dry and arid]]. The water which was not absorbed formed the seas, so that the waters of the flood still exist. Masudi says that the ark began its voyage at [[Kufa]] in central [[Iraq]] and sailed to [[Mecca]], circling the [[Kaaba]] before finally traveling to [[Mount Judi]], which surah 11:44 states was its final resting place. This mountain is identified by tradition with a hill near the town of [[Jazirat ibn Umar]] on the east bank of the [[Tigris]] in the province of [[Mosul]] in northern Iraq, and Masudi says that the spot could be seen in his time.<ref name=\"JE Noah\">{{cite book|editor-last=McCurdy|editor-first=J.

At the same time, however, a new class of scholarship arose, one which, while never questioning the literal truth of the ark story, began to speculate on the practical workings of Noah's vessel from within a purely naturalistic framework. In the 15th century, Alfonso Tostada gave a detailed account of the logistics of the ark, down to arrangements for the disposal of dung and the circulation of fresh air. The 16th-century [[geometry|geometer]] Johannes Buteo calculated the ship's internal dimensions, allowing room for Noah's grinding mills and smokeless ovens, a model widely adopted by other commentators.<ref name=Cohn>{{harvnb|Cohn|1996|p=}}</ref>\n\n===Searches for Noah's Ark===\n{{Main|Searches for Noah's Ark}}\nSearches for Noah's Ark have been made from at least the time of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] (c.275\u2013339&nbsp;CE) to the present day.
