The first is that the word \"Soddy\" is an anglicization of ''Tsati'', a shorter form of the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee word]] \u13a0\u13c2 \u13ab\u13cc\u13d8 \u13f1 (''Ani-Kusati-yi''), referring to the [[Muskogean]] [[Coushatta|Koasati]] people who lived there in the 18th century prior to [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Cherokee migration]] to the area after 1776. The second theory is that Soddy was named for William Sodder, who ran a trading post in the city. Others claim that Soddy's name is a reference to Soddy Creek, which is believed to have originated from the Cherokee word ''Sauta'', which is derived from ''Echota''. Soddy was a very small town until the Soddy Coal Company began mining in 1867.\n\nDaisy is rumored to have taken its name from Daisy Parks, the daughter of Thomas Parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=58986|title=Profile for Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> Thomas Parks was Vice-President of the Tabler-Cleudup Coal & Coke Company, and founded the [[Daisy Coal Company]] in April 1881.<ref>http://www.hctgs.org/communities/soddy_daisy.htm</ref>\n\nThe two cities incorporated in April 1969 along a {{convert|9|mi|adj=on}} stretch of U.S. 27.<ref>http://soddy-daisy.org/about</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSoddy-Daisy is located in north-central Hamilton County at {{coord|35|15|31|N|85|10|37|W|type:city}} (35.258538, -85.176996).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Its southwestern end is bordered by the city of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].

In 1838, the tavern served as a way station for 1,900 [[Cherokee]]s who were on the [[Trail of Tears]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Poe's Tavern served as a hospital for both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2011/jun/25/poes-tavern-re-creation-anchor-new-2-acre-park-sod/52712/|title = Poe's Tavern re-creation to anchor new 2-acre park in Soddy-Daisy|date = June 25, 2011|accessdate = September 30, 2015|website = Timesfreepress.com|publisher = |last = Cooper|first = Clint}}</ref> Though the original Poe's Tavern was torn down in 1911, the city of Soddy Daisy has reconstructed a replica of the building a block away from the original site.<ref>http://soddy-daisy.org/?s=poe%27s</ref>\n\nThere are two popular stories about how the city of Soddy got its name. The first is that the word \"Soddy\" is an anglicization of ''Tsati'', a shorter form of the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee word]] \u13a0\u13c2 \u13ab\u13cc\u13d8 \u13f1 (''Ani-Kusati-yi''), referring to the [[Muskogean]] [[Coushatta|Koasati]] people who lived there in the 18th century prior to [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Cherokee migration]] to the area after 1776. The second theory is that Soddy was named for William Sodder, who ran a trading post in the city. Others claim that Soddy's name is a reference to Soddy Creek, which is believed to have originated from the Cherokee word ''Sauta'', which is derived from ''Echota''. Soddy was a very small town until the Soddy Coal Company began mining in 1867.\n\nDaisy is rumored to have taken its name from Daisy Parks, the daughter of Thomas Parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=58986|title=Profile for Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> Thomas Parks was Vice-President of the Tabler-Cleudup Coal & Coke Company, and founded the [[Daisy Coal Company]] in April 1881.<ref>http://www.hctgs.org/communities/soddy_daisy.htm</ref>\n\nThe two cities incorporated in April 1969 along a {{convert|9|mi|adj=on}} stretch of U.S. 27.<ref>http://soddy-daisy.org/about</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSoddy-Daisy is located in north-central Hamilton County at {{coord|35|15|31|N|85|10|37|W|type:city}} (35.258538, -85.176996).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Its southwestern end is bordered by the city of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].

Endemic to [[Southwest Australia|southwest]] [[Western Australia]], it belongs to [[Banksia subg. Isostylis|''Banksia'' subg. ''Isostylis'']], a sub-genus of three closely related ''[[Banksia]]'' species with [[inflorescence]]s or flower clusters that are dome-shaped heads rather than characteristic ''Banksia'' flower spikes. A shrub or small tree up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} high, it has prickly foliage and pink and cream flowers. The common name ''Matchstick Banksia'' arises from the blooms in late bud, the individual buds of which resemble matchsticks. The species is [[pollination|pollinated]] by [[honeyeater]]s (Meliphagidae).\n\nAlthough ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' was first collected before 1880, it was not until 1981 that Australian botanist [[Alex George]] formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This ''Banksia'' is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As ''Banksia cuneata'' is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency\u2014fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. ''Banksia cuneata'' is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 25.JPG|thumb|left|Habit as a {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} high shrub|alt=a large spreading shrub in an area of low vegetation less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} high on a sunny day]]\n''Banksia cuneata'' grows as a shrub or small tree up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} high, without a [[lignotuber]]. It has one or more main trunks with smooth grey bark, and many branches. Young stems are covered in coarse hairs, but these are lost as the stems age. The leaves are wedge-shaped with serrated edges, having from one to five teeth along each side. They range from {{convert|1|to|4|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.5|to|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, on a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] of 2 to 3&nbsp;mm.

They comprise 55 to 65 individual flowers, enclosed at the base by a whorl of short [[involucral bract]]s. As with most other [[Proteaceae]], each flower consists of a [[petal|perianth]] comprising four united [[tepal]]s, and a single [[gynoecium|pistil]], the [[style (botany)|style]] of which is initially enclosed within the limb of the perianth, but breaks free at [[anthesis]].

Prior to anthesis, the long thin perianth topped by a prominent limb resembles a [[match]]stick, which explains one common name for this species. At first, the perianth is mostly cream, being pink only near its base; it later becomes pink throughout. The style is initially cream, but turns red; the [[pollen-presenter|pollen presenter]] is green.<ref name=\"George 1999\"/>\n\nOld flowers soon fall from the flower heads (often called cones at this stage), revealing a woody base which may have up to five [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]]s embedded in it. These are a mottled grey colour, smooth, felted with short fine hairs, and measure from {{convert|1|to|1.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|1.7|to|2.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} along the seam, and {{convert|0.9|to|1.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} across the seam.

''Isostylis'' by its brighter flowers and duller leaves.<ref name=\"George 1999\"/> It further differs from ''[[Banksia ilicifolia|B.&nbsp;ilicifolia]]'' in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes.<ref name=\"George 1981\"/> The leaves, flowers and fruit of ''[[Banksia oligantha|B.&nbsp;oligantha]]'' are smaller still,<ref name=\"George 1999\"/> and its foliage is not as prickly as that of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata''.<ref name=\"BSG\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Discovery and naming===\n[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 23.JPG|thumb|right|The \"matchstick\" appearance in late bud gives rise to the common name.|alt=closeup of bloom in late bud; the individual yellow-tipped pink flowers resembling matchsticks]]\nThe earliest known specimen collection of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' was made by [[Julia Wells]] some time before 1880.

Populations in relatively intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are both more [[inbreeding|inbred]] on average, and more variable. This has been attributed to a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more [[genetic structure]] and thus more [[Effective selfing model|effective selfing]]. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an [[understory|understorey]], and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less [[natural selection|selection]] against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.<ref name=\"Coates 1992\"/><ref name=\"Coates 2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Coates | first1 = David J. | last2 = Sampson | first2 = Jane F. | last3 = Yates | first3 = Colin J. | year = 2007 | title = Plant mating systems and assessing population persistence in fragmented landscapes | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 55 | pages = 239\u2013249 | doi = 10.1071/BT06142 | issue = 3}}</ref>\n\nNo seed is set when pollinators are [[pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]], indicating that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These are very high numbers for ''Banksia'', indicating that there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant\u2014typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone\u2014often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a ''Banksia'' species.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/>\n\n''Banksia cuneata'' lacks a [[lignotuber]], so plants are killed by bushfire. However, this species is strongly [[serotiny|serotinous]]: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an [[canopy seed bank|aerial seed bank]] in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a [[resin]] that seals the follicles shut, preventing [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]]; the heat of a bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and [[seed separator]], but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> The juvenile period for ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population and there will be no seed from which it might recover.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full [[fecundity]]. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.<ref name=\"Burgman 1993\"/>\n[[File:Banksia cuneata infructescence.jpg|thumb|right|Woody follicle|alt=an oval grey woody pod covered in short fine white hairs, at the end of a branch, with small shoots growing up around it]]\n''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' is very unusual in apparently suffering no seed loss due to [[seed predation|granivory]]. In nearly all other species, burrowing [[insect]] [[larva]]e eat a large proportion of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to ''B.&nbsp;cuneata''. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a ''Banksia'' species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and [[senescence]] sets in.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\">{{cite journal | last = Lamont | first = Byron B. | year = 1991 | title = Seed bank and population dynamics of ''Banksia cuneata'': The role of time, fire and moisture | journal = Botanical Gazette | volume = 152 |issue = 1 | pages = 114\u201322 | doi = 10.1086/337870 | jstor = 2995498 | last2 = Connell | first2 = Stephen W. | last3 = Bergl | first3 = Stephen M.}}</ref><ref name=\"Burgman 1992\">{{cite journal | last1 = Burgman | first1 = Mark | last2 = Lamont | first2 = Byron | year = 1992 | title = A stochastic model for the viability of ''Banksia cuneata'' populations: environmental, demographic and genetic effects | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 719\u2013727 | doi = 10.2307/2404481 | publisher = Journal of Applied Ecology, Vol. 29, No. 3 | jstor = 2404481}}</ref>\n\nThe high seed maturation and viability rates are offset, however, by an extremely low seedling survival rate. This is almost solely due to moisture stress. In one study, an estimated 17,100 viable seeds were released following an experimental fire. Fewer than 5% of them germinated, and only eleven plants survived the first summer drought. The last plants to die were in depressions, in shaded areas or amongst leaf litter; and the eleven survivors were all on road shoulders, where they benefited from road [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and a {{convert|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick [[mulch]] of [[pisolite|pisolitic]] [[laterite]]. The inevitable conclusion is that seedling survival is primarily determined by water availability.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/>\n\n==Conservation==\n''Banksia cuneata'' was declared [[endangered species|critically endangered]] after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants.

Endemic to [[Southwest Australia|southwest]] [[Western Australia]], it belongs to [[Banksia subg. Isostylis|''Banksia'' subg. ''Isostylis'']], a sub-genus of three closely related ''[[Banksia]]'' species with [[inflorescence]]s or flower clusters that are dome-shaped heads rather than characteristic ''Banksia'' flower spikes. A shrub or small tree up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} high, it has prickly foliage and pink and cream flowers. The common name ''Matchstick Banksia'' arises from the blooms in late bud, the individual buds of which resemble matchsticks. The species is [[pollination|pollinated]] by [[honeyeater]]s (Meliphagidae).\n\nAlthough ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' was first collected before 1880, it was not until 1981 that Australian botanist [[Alex George]] formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This ''Banksia'' is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As ''Banksia cuneata'' is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency\u2014fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. ''Banksia cuneata'' is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 25.JPG|thumb|left|Habit as a {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} high shrub|alt=a large spreading shrub in an area of low vegetation less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} high on a sunny day]]\n''Banksia cuneata'' grows as a shrub or small tree up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} high, without a [[lignotuber]]. It has one or more main trunks with smooth grey bark, and many branches. Young stems are covered in coarse hairs, but these are lost as the stems age. The leaves are wedge-shaped with serrated edges, having from one to five teeth along each side. They range from {{convert|1|to|4|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.5|to|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, on a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] of 2 to 3&nbsp;mm. The upper surface is dull green; as with the stems, both leaf surfaces are covered in coarse hairs when young, but these are soon lost.<ref name=\"George 1999\">{{cite encyclopedia| last = George | first = Alex S. | authorlink = Alex George | year = 1999 | title = ''Banksia'' | editor-last = Wilson | editor-first = Annette | encyclopedia = [[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]] | volume = 17B | pages = 175\u2013251 | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study | isbn = 978-0-643-06454-6}}</ref>\n\nFlowers occur in dome-shaped heads from three to four cm (1.2\u20131.6&nbsp;in) in diameter, growing at the ends of branches. They comprise 55 to 65 individual flowers, enclosed at the base by a whorl of short [[involucral bract]]s. As with most other [[Proteaceae]], each flower consists of a [[petal|perianth]] comprising four united [[tepal]]s, and a single [[gynoecium|pistil]], the [[style (botany)|style]] of which is initially enclosed within the limb of the perianth, but breaks free at [[anthesis]]. In ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'', the perianth is about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a limb of about {{convert|0.4|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Prior to anthesis, the long thin perianth topped by a prominent limb resembles a [[match]]stick, which explains one common name for this species. At first, the perianth is mostly cream, being pink only near its base; it later becomes pink throughout. The style is initially cream, but turns red; the [[pollen-presenter|pollen presenter]] is green.<ref name=\"George 1999\"/>\n\nOld flowers soon fall from the flower heads (often called cones at this stage), revealing a woody base which may have up to five [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]]s embedded in it. These are a mottled grey colour, smooth, felted with short fine hairs, and measure from {{convert|1|to|1.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|1.7|to|2.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} along the seam, and {{convert|0.9|to|1.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} across the seam. Each follicle contains up to two seeds; these are roughly triangular in shape, with a large papery wing.<ref name=\"George 1999\"/>\n\n''Banksia cuneata'' is most easily distinguished from the other two species in ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Isostylis'' by its brighter flowers and duller leaves.<ref name=\"George 1999\"/> It further differs from ''[[Banksia ilicifolia|B.&nbsp;ilicifolia]]'' in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes.<ref name=\"George 1981\"/> The leaves, flowers and fruit of ''[[Banksia oligantha|B.&nbsp;oligantha]]'' are smaller still,<ref name=\"George 1999\"/> and its foliage is not as prickly as that of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata''.<ref name=\"BSG\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Discovery and naming===\n[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 23.JPG|thumb|right|The \"matchstick\" appearance in late bud gives rise to the common name.|alt=closeup of bloom in late bud; the individual yellow-tipped pink flowers resembling matchsticks]]\nThe earliest known specimen collection of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' was made by [[Julia Wells]] some time before 1880.

Further complicating the situation is the southernmost population of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'', which has both genetic and [[phenetics|phenetic]] affinities with ''B.&nbsp;oligantha'' located to the southeast. The origin of this population is unknown. It might have arisen through [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation, or it may be a transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, [[biogeography|biogeographical]] factors suggest that ''B.&nbsp;ilicifolia'' would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the [[High Rainfall Zone]] where [[relict]]ual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the [[Transitional Rainfall Zone]], where more recently evolved species are most common.<ref name=\"Broadhurst 2004\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Broadhurst | first1 = Linda M. | last2 = Coates | first2 = David J. | year = 2004 | title = Genetic divergence among and diversity within two rare ''Banksia'' species and their common close relative in the subgenus ''Isostylis'' R.Br.

Populations in relatively intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are both more [[inbreeding|inbred]] on average, and more variable. This has been attributed to a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more [[genetic structure]] and thus more [[Effective selfing model|effective selfing]]. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an [[understory|understorey]], and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less [[natural selection|selection]] against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.<ref name=\"Coates 1992\"/><ref name=\"Coates 2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Coates | first1 = David J. | last2 = Sampson | first2 = Jane F. | last3 = Yates | first3 = Colin J. | year = 2007 | title = Plant mating systems and assessing population persistence in fragmented landscapes | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 55 | pages = 239\u2013249 | doi = 10.1071/BT06142 | issue = 3}}</ref>\n\nNo seed is set when pollinators are [[pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]], indicating that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These are very high numbers for ''Banksia'', indicating that there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant\u2014typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone\u2014often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a ''Banksia'' species.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/>\n\n''Banksia cuneata'' lacks a [[lignotuber]], so plants are killed by bushfire. However, this species is strongly [[serotiny|serotinous]]: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an [[canopy seed bank|aerial seed bank]] in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a [[resin]] that seals the follicles shut, preventing [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]]; the heat of a bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and [[seed separator]], but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> The juvenile period for ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population and there will be no seed from which it might recover.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full [[fecundity]]. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.<ref name=\"Burgman 1993\"/>\n[[File:Banksia cuneata infructescence.jpg|thumb|right|Woody follicle|alt=an oval grey woody pod covered in short fine white hairs, at the end of a branch, with small shoots growing up around it]]\n''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' is very unusual in apparently suffering no seed loss due to [[seed predation|granivory]]. In nearly all other species, burrowing [[insect]] [[larva]]e eat a large proportion of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to ''B.&nbsp;cuneata''. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a ''Banksia'' species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and [[senescence]] sets in.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/> Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\">{{cite journal | last = Lamont | first = Byron B. | year = 1991 | title = Seed bank and population dynamics of ''Banksia cuneata'': The role of time, fire and moisture | journal = Botanical Gazette | volume = 152 |issue = 1 | pages = 114\u201322 | doi = 10.1086/337870 | jstor = 2995498 | last2 = Connell | first2 = Stephen W. | last3 = Bergl | first3 = Stephen M.}}</ref><ref name=\"Burgman 1992\">{{cite journal | last1 = Burgman | first1 = Mark | last2 = Lamont | first2 = Byron | year = 1992 | title = A stochastic model for the viability of ''Banksia cuneata'' populations: environmental, demographic and genetic effects | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 719\u2013727 | doi = 10.2307/2404481 | publisher = Journal of Applied Ecology, Vol. 29, No. 3 | jstor = 2404481}}</ref>\n\nThe high seed maturation and viability rates are offset, however, by an extremely low seedling survival rate. This is almost solely due to moisture stress. In one study, an estimated 17,100 viable seeds were released following an experimental fire. Fewer than 5% of them germinated, and only eleven plants survived the first summer drought. The last plants to die were in depressions, in shaded areas or amongst leaf litter; and the eleven survivors were all on road shoulders, where they benefited from road [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and a {{convert|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick [[mulch]] of [[pisolite|pisolitic]] [[laterite]]. The inevitable conclusion is that seedling survival is primarily determined by water availability.<ref name=\"Lamont 1991\"/>\n\n==Conservation==\n''Banksia cuneata'' was declared [[endangered species|critically endangered]] after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants.

In the meantime, the population of the central part of Taiwan has increased by 1.14 million, and that of the southern part of Taiwan has increased by 0.86 million. The growth tendency is focused on Taipei, and falls off with increasing distance.

In the following decades, KMT invested most of the resources taken from the mainland as well as collected taxes in public infrastructure, education institutes, scientific research centers, government institutions, high value-added industrial zones for Taipei and its satellite cities and suburbs in addition to KMT's north\u2013south bias policy. At this point, northern Taiwan started to grow rapidly at a speed never seen before. The government expenditure lavished on Taipei was in sharp contrast to that allocated to southern Taiwan. The gap between the two sides in all kinds of infrastructures has widened significantly since then. Besides, KMT's economic policy of establishing industries of [[commerce|commercial activity]], [[trade]], new generation high-value-added technology industries together in northern Taiwan while arranging southern Taiwan to develop [[light industry]], [[heavy industry]], and labor-intensive industry amplified the north\u2013south divide, and southern Taiwan encountered difficulties when Taiwan had no choice to transform its economic structure towards higher-value-added industries in order to compensate the rising unemployment rate caused by the tide of globalization that forces those labor-intensive and low value-added industries to move to low wage countries like China and Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"wen\"/>\n\nConsequently, during the time KMT has been in power, the number of registered companies in the North continued to rise, ripen and strengthen.

The implication is KMT's counterpart DPP no longer holds copyright on speaking up for southern Taiwanese and closing the gap between northern and southern Taiwan.<ref name=\"Chunatimes 2019\">{{cite web | author=\u6797\u5b8f\u8070 \u3001 \u5f35\u4ea6\u60e0 \u3001 \u5ed6\u7d20\u6167 \u3001\u5609\u7fa9\u3001 \u694a\u99a8 | title=\u97d3\u570b\u745c\u6c11\u96c4\u50be\u807d\u5ea7\u8ac7 \u5f37\u8abf\u91cd\u8996\u5357\u53f0\u7063 - \u653f\u6cbb | website=\u4e2d\u6642\u96fb\u5b50\u5831 | date=2019-10-21 | url=https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20191021004140-260407?chdtv | language=zh | access-date=2019-11-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024013223/https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20191021004140-260407?chdtv | archive-date=2019-10-24 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"\u66fe\u539f\u4fe1 2019\">{{cite web | author=\u66fe\u539f\u4fe1 | title=\u6d2a\u79c0\u67f1\u7acb\u8db3\u53f0\u5357 \u9760\u570b\u6703\u7d93\u9a57\u62fc\u52dd\u9078 | website=\u806f\u5408\u65b0\u805e\u7db2 | date=2019-11-02 | url=https://udn.com/news/story/7548/4140309 | language=zh | access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref><ref name=\"\u5468\u5b97\u798e 2019\">{{cite web | author=\u5468\u5b97\u798e | title=\u6d2a\u79c0\u67f1\u665a\u9593\u53c3\u52a0\u8001\u4eba\u6703\u6176\u751f \u5168\u7a0b\u53f0\u8a9e\u5531\u8001\u6b4c\u9109\u89aa\u558a\u8b9a | website=\u806f\u5408\u65b0\u805e\u7db2 | date=2019-10-05 | url=https://udn.com/news/story/7548/4088266 | language=zh | access-date=2019-11-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015001443/https://udn.com/news/story/7548/4088266 | archive-date=2019-10-15 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"\u8b1d\u9032\u76db2019\">{{cite web | author=\u8b1d\u9032\u76db | title=\u6d2a\u79c0\u67f1\uff1a\u9ee8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u8981\u6211\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u6703\u653e\u68c4\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8 | website=\u806f\u5408\u65b0\u805e\u7db2 | date=2019-10-28 | url=https://udn.com/news/story/7548/4129915 | language=zh | access-date=2019-11-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030211829/https://udn.com/news/story/7548/4129915 | archive-date=2019-10-30 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Opinion polling for the 2020 Taiwan general election}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Ethnic divisions between islanders and mainlanders==\n{{see also|Demographics of Taiwan}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |class = <!-- Advanced users only.

Nonetheless, ''Taiwan-centered awareness'' has been labeled politically. If our minds agree to such sentimental values manipulated by the politicians, consumption and customer's behavior would shift to that side. Consequently, people in Taiwan begin passing up the opportunity to engage in relatively advanced customer behavior. Southern Taiwan is indeed intentionally conserving things that are gone obsolescent...... The professed \"local-ism\" is supposed to move forward as the time elapses. In the present climate, the mind of Taiwanese society begins to wander and be missing in a childish age. If this kind of tendency continues, I think ''metropolitan areas'' in northern Taiwan will swiftly be enclosed by ''backward hamlets''. {{noteTag|name=|1=The coverage was published when DPP's [[Chen Shui-Bian]], an islander, was re-elected as President to remain in the Office as his second presidency.

Owing to the Kuomintang's long-standing bias, especially over the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]] period, the gap between the north and the south in terms of [[social economic]] development has gradually widened. Critics say that [[Northern Taiwan]] to which mainlanders fleeing after the defeat of the KMT on the Mainland had mainly relocated had a disproportionate share of economic investment, especially since the Pro-Independence movement was less common in the North than in the South. The KMT was alleged to have concentrated investment in technological fields in its base in Northern Taiwan, especially the Hsinchu and the Greater Taipei Metropolis area while investment in the South of Taiwan was mainly in industry. As industry relocated to Mainland China over the past decades leading to slower growth in Southern Taiwan, there has been a brain drain of younger college educated Taiwanese from the South to the North where higher paying service and technology industries are located.<ref>{{cite

In the following decades, KMT invested most of the resources taken from the mainland as well as collected taxes in public infrastructure, education institutes, scientific research centers, government institutions, high value-added industrial zones for Taipei and its satellite cities and suburbs in addition to KMT's North-South bias policy. At this point, northern Taiwan started to grow rapidly at a speed never seen before. The government expenditure lavished on Taipei was in sharp contrast to that allocated to southern Taiwan.

Nonetheless, ''Taiwan-centered awareness'' has been labeled politically. If our minds agree to such sentimental values manipulated by the politicians, consumption and customer's behavior would shift to that side. Consequently, people in Taiwan begin passing up the opportunity to engage in relatively advanced customer behavior. Southern Taiwan is indeed intentionally conserving things that are gone obsolescent...... The professed \"local-ism\" is supposed to move forward as the time elapses. In the present climate, the mind of Taiwanese society begins to wander and be missing in a childish age. If this kind of tendency continues, I think ''metropolitan areas'' in northern Taiwan will swiftly be enclosed by ''backward hamlets''. {{noteTag|name=|1=The coverage was published when DPP's [[Chen Shui-Bian]], an islander, was re-elected as President to remain in the Office as his second presidency.

Owing to the Kuomintang's long-standing bias, especially over the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]] period, the gap between the north and the south in terms of [[social economic]] development has gradually widened. Critics say that [[Northern Taiwan]] to which mainlanders fleeing after the defeat of the KMT on the Mainland had mainly relocated had a disproportionate share of economic investment, especially since the Pro-Independence movement was less common in the North than in the South. The KMT was alleged to have concentrated investment in technological fields in its base in Northern Taiwan, especially the Hsinchu and the Greater Taipei Metropolis area while investment in the South of Taiwan was mainly in industry. As industry relocated to Mainland China over the past decades leading to slower growth in Southern Taiwan, there has been a brain drain of younger college educated Taiwanese from the South to the North where higher paying service and technology industries are located.<ref>{{cite
