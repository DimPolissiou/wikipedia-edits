{"title_page": "Private limited company", "text_new": "{{Companies law}}\n\nA '''private limited company''' is a [[type of business entity]] in [[Privately held company|\"private\" ownership]] used in many jurisdictions, in contrast to [[Public company|\"public\" ownership]], with some differences from country to country. Private limited companies have a limited number of employees which normally is 50. Examples include ''[[limited liability company|LLC]]'' in the [[US]], ''[[private company limited by shares]]'' in the [[UK]], ''[[GmbH]]'' in [[Germany]] or ''[[spole\u010dnost s ru\u010den\u00edm omezen\u00fdm]]'' in the [[Czech Republic]].The benefit of having a private limited company is that there is limited liabilities and depending on each one\u2019s point of view this next point could either be a benefit or a disadvantage. Shares can only be sold to shareholders in the business that means that it can be difficult to liquidate them. \n\n{{horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n== Abbreviations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law N\u00b0 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:\n* They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).\n* They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.\n* Their equity is divided into \"cuotas\" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.\n* They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.\n* Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.\n* In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.\n\nChilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called ''Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada'' (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. aggregation.\n\n==Colombia==\nColombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The ''Ltda.'' abbreviation is also used in Colombia.<ref>C\u00f3digo de Comercio de Colombia, just like S.A..</ref>\n\n==Croatia==\nIn Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed ''dru\u0161tvo s ograni\u010denom odgovorno\u0161\u0107u'' (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated ''d.o.o.''.

Company law, p.3| date=18 December 2006| publisher=ec.europa.eu}}</ref>\n\n==Czech Republic==\nCzech legislation contemplates LLCs as ''[[spole\u010dnost s ru\u010den\u00edm omezen\u00fdm]]'' (''s.r.o.'' or ''spol. s r.o.''). An ''s.r.o.'' is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (''jednatel'', mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.\n\n==Denmark==\nThe Danish form of the LLC is the ''[[kommanditselskab]]'' (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the ''komplementar'' which is fully liable, and the ''kommanditist'' which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income \"passes through\" the company directly to the shareholders.\n\n==Dominican Republic==\nDominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as ''Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada'', also known by their abbreviation ''S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.\n\n==Estonia==\nThe Estonian version of private limited company (limited liability company) is called ''osa\u00fching'' (O\u00dc). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name.\nAn O\u00dc is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is \u20ac2,500.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commercial Code (\u00a7 9, \u00a7 135-136) |url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/Riigikogu/act/501042019010/consolide |accessdate= 12 October 2019 |publisher=Riigi Teataja}}</ref>\n\n==Finland==\nAlthough not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhti\u00f6) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. Since the 1st of july 2019, there is no minimum capital required by law.\n\n==Germany==\nBecause of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]]'' (GmbH) because it has aspects of a [[corporation]]; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of ''[[Kommanditgesellschaft]]'' (KG), which is the German equivalent of a [[limited partnership]]. Based on the literal translation of the word \"company\", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is [[GmbH & Co KG]], a nested  [[Kommanditgesellschaft]] (KG) where a [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]] (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner.

The closest company form is the ''handelsbolag'' (lit.: \"trade company\"). The Swedish AB (''aktiebolag''; lit.: \"share company\"), like the ''handelsbolag'', is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, ''privat aktiebolag'', is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. The AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase \"off-the-shelf\" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created ''aktiebolag'' can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.<ref>Swedish Companies Registration Office about Aktiebolag {{cite web|url=http://bolagsverket.se/foretag/aktiebolag/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818193651/https://www.bolagsverket.se/foretag/aktiebolag/ |archivedate=18 August 2010 }}</ref> Creation of public limited liability companies, or ''publikt aktiebolag'', which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bolagsverket.se/foretag/aktiebolag/starta_aktiebolag/privat_eller_publikt/publika_aktiebolag/ |title=Publika aktiebolag - Bolagsverket |publisher=Bolagsverket.se |accessdate=2012-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215215559/http://www.bolagsverket.se/foretag/aktiebolag/starta_aktiebolag/privat_eller_publikt/publika_aktiebolag/ |archivedate=15 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Switzerland==\nThe Swiss [[Code of Obligations]]<ref>official German text: http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/220/index3.html, official French text: http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/220/index3.html, official Italian text: http://www.admin.ch/ch/i/rs/220/index3.html</ref> provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:\n\nSwiss Limited Liability Company:<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, articles 772ss</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Unofficial translation of term pursuant to: Swiss Code of Obligations, Volume II, Company Law, Articles 552 \u2013 964, English Translation of the Official Text, Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, Zurich 1992</ref> The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the [[Swiss Confederation]] are as follows: In German ''Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung'' (abbreviation: ''GmbH''), in French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e'' (abbreviation: ''S.\u00e0 r.l.'' or ''SARL'') and in Italian ''Societ\u00e0 a Garanzia Limitata'' (abbreviation: ''SaGL''). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 722 paragraph 1</ref> the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 802</ref> a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 811</ref> and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the members\u2019 right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 808 paragraph 4</ref> The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 790</ref> and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.\n\nSwiss Corporation<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, articles 620ss</ref> (in English common law context usually translated as '' [[company limited by shares]]''): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German ''Aktiengesellschaft'' (abbreviation: ''AG''), in French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme'' (abbreviation: ''SA'') and in Italian ''Societ\u00e0 Anonima'' (abbreviation: ''SA''). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 716a</ref> Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 622 paragraph 1</ref> and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.\n\n==Tajikistan==\nIn Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as \"\u04b6\u0430\u043c\u044a\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u044a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u04b3\u0434\u0443\u0434\", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as \"\u04b6\u0414\u041c\u041c\".\n\n==Turkey==\nMinimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. \u015eti. (Which means ''[[:tr:Limited \u015firket|Limited \u015eirketi]].)''\n\n==Ukraine==\nThis type of entity has existed in [[Ukraine]] since the 1990s.

[[Authorised capital|Authorized capital]] of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]] (less than 0,04 US [[Cent (currency)|cents]]). There is no state fee for LLC formation.\n\nBy Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of company\u2019s income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/legal-support-of-dividend-payment/|title=Dividend payment in Ukraine|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.\n\nTaxation.

In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company\u2019s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baijumasoodu.com/articles/details/37|title=legal forms of business|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC.\nLLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.\n\n<ref>trinitygroup.eu</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nThe new form of [[limited liability partnership]] (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including [[VAT]]. Otherwise, all companies, including [[limited company|limited companies]] and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to [[United Kingdom corporation tax]] if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.\n\n==United States==\nA limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by [[State law (United States)|state statutes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98277,00.html |title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH (\"Company with limited liability\"), a type of business organization in [[Germany]], and by the {{lang|es|limitada}}, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.<ref name=\"LLC Reporter\" />\n\nIn the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in [[Wyoming]] in 1977 as special interest<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titles/Title17/T17CH29.htm|title=State of Wyoming Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> legislation for an oil company.<ref>Keatinge et al.,\"The Limited Liability Company: A Study of the Emerging Entity,\" 47 Business Lawyer 375, 383-384 (Feb. 1992) (citing Act of 4 March 1977, ch. 155, 1977 Wyo.Sess.Laws 512).</ref> In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.<ref>Priv.

Uniform Law Commission.</ref>\n\nA potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of [[civil procedure in the United States|federal civil procedure]]; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of [[diversity jurisdiction]] in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware]] for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.\n\n[[AOL]] was set up as an LLC during its ownership by [[Time Warner]] from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for [[BMW]]'s American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. [[Chrysler]] has been an LLC since restructuring during the [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010|auto industry bailout of 2009]], owned by [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.]].\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid]]'', a Belgian (bvba) and Dutch (bv) private limited company\n* ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e]]'', LLCs in French speaking countries\n* [[Incorporation (business)]]\n* [[Limited Liability Partnership]] (LLP)\n* [[List of company registers]]\n* [[Types of business entity]]\n* [[Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Legal entities]]\n[[Category:Types of business entity]]\n", "text_old": "{{Companies law}}\n\nA '''private limited company''' is a [[type of business entity]] in [[Privately held company|\"private\" ownership]] used in many jurisdictions, in contrast to [[Public company|\"public\" ownership]], with some differences from country to country.

Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law N\u00b0 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:\n* They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).\n* They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.\n* Their equity is divided into \"cuotas\" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.\n* They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.\n* Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.\n* In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.\n\nChilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called ''Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada'' (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. aggregation.\n\n==Colombia==\nColombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The ''Ltda.'' abbreviation is also used in Colombia.<ref>C\u00f3digo de Comercio de Colombia, just like S.A..</ref>\n\n==Croatia==\nIn Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed ''dru\u0161tvo s ograni\u010denom odgovorno\u0161\u0107u'' (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated ''d.o.o.''.

An ''s.r.o.'' is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (''jednatel'', mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.\n\n==Denmark==\nThe Danish form of the LLC is the ''[[kommanditselskab]]'' (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the ''komplementar'' which is fully liable, and the ''kommanditist'' which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income \"passes through\" the company directly to the shareholders.\n\n==Dominican Republic==\nDominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as ''Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada'', also known by their abbreviation ''S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.\n\n==Estonia==\nThe Estonian version of private limited company (limited liability company) is called ''osa\u00fching'' (O\u00dc).

An Oy is taxed as a corporation.

On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]]'' (GmbH) because it has aspects of a [[corporation]]; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of ''[[Kommanditgesellschaft]]'' (KG), which is the German equivalent of a [[limited partnership]]. Based on the literal translation of the word \"company\", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is [[GmbH & Co KG]], a nested  [[Kommanditgesellschaft]] (KG) where a [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]] (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner.

One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: \"Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood\" translates as \"Sherkat \u0634\u0631\u06a9\u062a  Company\" + \"Mahdood \u0645\u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f  Limited\" + \"Masooliyat \u0645\u0633\u0626\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u062a  Liability\".\n\n==Italy==\nThe [[:it:Codice civile italiano|Italian Civil Code]], approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:\n* ''Societ\u00e0 per azioni'' (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is \u20ac50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscoetasse.com/approfondimenti/11929-la-spa-si-costituisce-con-capitale-minimo-di-50-000.html|title=La S.p.A. si costituisce con capitale minimo di 50.000 \u20ac - FISCOeTASSE.com|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange.

Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.\n\nCompanies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.\n\n==Japan==\nJapan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, [[godo kaisha]] (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.\n\n== Latvia ==\nLimited liability company in Latvia is referred to as ''sabiedr\u012bba ar ierobe\u017eotu atbild\u012bbu'' (SIA).

The minimum capital required by law in a private company, ''privat aktiebolag'', is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. The AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year.

A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 716a</ref> Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 622 paragraph 1</ref> and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.\n\n==Tajikistan==\nIn Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as \"\u04b6\u0430\u043c\u044a\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u044a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u04b3\u0434\u0443\u0434\", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as \"\u04b6\u0414\u041c\u041c\".\n\n==Turkey==\nMinimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. \u015eti. (Which means ''[[:tr:Limited \u015firket|Limited \u015eirketi]].)''\n\n==Ukraine==\nThis type of entity has existed in [[Ukraine]] since the 1990s.

[[Authorised capital|Authorized capital]] of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]] (less than 0,04 US [[Cent (currency)|cents]]). There is no state fee for LLC formation.\n\nBy Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of company\u2019s income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/legal-support-of-dividend-payment/|title=Dividend payment in Ukraine|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.\n\nTaxation. ''LLC can be registered:''\n\n\u2014 as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without [[VAT]] (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;\n\n\u2014 fixed tax rate (in transliteration \"yediniy podatok\" or \"[[:uk:\u0421\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f, \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0443 \u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0441\u0443\u0431'\u0454\u043a\u0442\u0456\u0432 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0454\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456|sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia]]\") is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) [[VAT]] registration.\n\n==United Arab Emirates==\n\nA Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. \nUnder the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company\u2019s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baijumasoodu.com/articles/details/37|title=legal forms of business|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC.\nLLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.\n\n<ref>trinitygroup.eu</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nThe new form of [[limited liability partnership]] (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including [[VAT]]. Otherwise, all companies, including [[limited company|limited companies]] and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to [[United Kingdom corporation tax]] if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.\n\n==United States==\nA limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by [[State law (United States)|state statutes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98277,00.html |title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH (\"Company with limited liability\"), a type of business organization in [[Germany]], and by the {{lang|es|limitada}}, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.<ref name=\"LLC Reporter\" />\n\nIn the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in [[Wyoming]] in 1977 as special interest<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titles/Title17/T17CH29.htm|title=State of Wyoming Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> legislation for an oil company.<ref>Keatinge et al.,\"The Limited Liability Company: A Study of the Emerging Entity,\" 47 Business Lawyer 375, 383-384 (Feb. 1992) (citing Act of 4 March 1977, ch. 155, 1977 Wyo.Sess.Laws 512).</ref> In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.<ref>Priv.

Uniform Law Commission.</ref>\n\nA potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of [[civil procedure in the United States|federal civil procedure]]; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of [[diversity jurisdiction]] in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware]] for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.\n\n[[AOL]] was set up as an LLC during its ownership by [[Time Warner]] from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for [[BMW]]'s American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. [[Chrysler]] has been an LLC since restructuring during the [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010|auto industry bailout of 2009]], owned by [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.]].\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid]]'', a Belgian (bvba) and Dutch (bv) private limited company\n* ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e]]'', LLCs in French speaking countries\n* [[Incorporation (business)]]\n* [[Limited Liability Partnership]] (LLP)\n* [[List of company registers]]\n* [[Types of business entity]]\n* [[Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Legal entities]]\n[[Category:Types of business entity]]\n", "name_user": "Rajataki", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJapan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_limited_company"}

{"title_page": "Irish orthography", "text_new": "{{Short description|Irish language spelling conventions}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2011}}\n{{IPA-ga notice}}\n'''Irish orthography''' has evolved over many centuries, since [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] was first written down in the [[Latin alphabet]] in about the 8th century AD. Prior to that, [[Primitive Irish language|Primitive Irish]] was written in [[Ogham]]. Irish [[orthography]] is mainly based on [[etymology|etymological]] considerations, although a [[spelling reform]] in the mid-20th century simplified the relationship between [[spelling]] and pronunciation somewhat.\n\nThere are three dialects of spoken [[Irish language|Irish]]: [[Ulster Irish|Ulster]] (now predominantly in [[County Donegal]]), [[Connacht Irish|Connacht]] (Counties [[County Mayo|Mayo]] and [[County Galway|Galway]]), and [[Munster Irish|Munster]] (Counties [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Cork|Cork]], and [[County Waterford|Waterford]]). Some spelling conventions are common to all three dialects, while others vary from dialect to dialect. In addition, individual words may have in a given dialect pronunciations that are not reflected by their spelling (the pronunciation in this article reflects Connacht Irish pronunciation; other accents may differ, but are occasionally included).\n\n==Alphabet==\n[[File:Irish script.gif|thumb|right|330px| A sample of traditional [[Gaelic type]].]]\n[[File:Gaelic alphabet.jpg|thumb|Uncial alphabet carved on the [[National Archives of Ireland]] building in [[Dublin]], with each type of diacritic (''s\u00edneadh fada'' and ''ponc s\u00e9imhithe'') as well as the [[Tironian notes|Tironian ''et'']].]] \nThe alphabet now used for writing the Irish language consists of the following letters of the [[Latin script]], whether written in [[Roman type|Roman hand]] or [[Gaelic type|Gaelic hand]]:\n\n: '''a \u00e1 b c d e \u00e9 f g h i \u00ed l m n o \u00f3 p r s t u \u00fa''';\n\nThe [[apex (diacritic)|apex]] over the vowels is ignored for purposes of alphabetization. Modern loanwords also make use of '''j k q v w x y z'''. Of these, '''v''' is the most common. It occurs in a small number of words of native origin in the language such as {{wikt-lang|ga|v\u00e1carnach}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|v\u00e1c}} and {{wikt-lang|ga|vr\u00e1c}}, all of which are onomatopoeic. It also occurs in a number of alternative colloquial forms such as {{lang|ga|v\u00edog}} instead of {{wikt-lang|ga|b\u00edog}} and {{lang|ga|v\u00eds}} instead of {{wikt-lang|ga|b\u00eds}} as cited in {{lang|ga|Niall \u00d3 D\u00f3naill|italic=no}}'s {{lang|ga|Focl\u00f3ir Gaeilge\u2013B\u00e9arla|italic=yes}} (''Irish\u2013English Dictionary''). It is also the only non-traditional letter used to write foreign names and words adapted to the Irish language (for example, [[Switzerland]], or {{lang|la|Helvetia}}, is [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] as {{lang|ga|An Eilv\u00e9is}}; [[Azerbaijan]], in contrast, is written {{lang|ga|An Asarbaise\u00e1in}} rather than *{{lang|ga|An Azarbaij\u00e1in}}). The letters '''j''', '''q''', '''w''', '''x''', '''y''' and '''z''' are used primarily in scientific terminology or direct, unaltered borrowings from English and other languages, although the phoneme {{IPA|/z/}} does exist naturally in at least one dialect, that of [[West Muskerry]], County Cork, as the [[eclipsis]] of '''s'''. '''k''' is the only letter not to be listed by {{lang|ga|\u00d3 D\u00f3naill|italic=no}}. '''h''', when not  prefixed to an initial vowel as an [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]] in certain grammatical functions (or when not used as an indicator of [[lenition]] when Roman type is used), occurs primarily in loanwords as an initial consonant. The letters' names are spelt out thus:\n\n: '''{{lang|ga|\u00e1 b\u00e9 c\u00e9 d\u00e9 \u00e9 eif g\u00e9 h\u00e9is \u00ed eil eim ein \u00f3 p\u00e9 ear eas t\u00e9 \u00fa}}'''\n: along with '''{{lang|ga|j\u00e9 c\u00e1 c\u00fa v\u00e9 wae eacs y\u00e9 zae}}'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=hRiKYbE3cIIC&pg=PA1&dq=d%C3%A9,+%C3%A9,+eif+h%C3%A9is+%C3%AD+eil+eim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVy97IwOXkAhUZTRUIHWNmD6kQ6AEIKjAA|title=Graim\u00e9ar Gaeilge na mBr\u00e1ithre Cr\u00edosta\u00ed|date=22 September 1999|publisher=An G\u00fam|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nTree names were once popularly used to [[acrophony|name the letters]]. Tradition taught that they all derived from the names of [[Ogham]] letters, though it is now known that only some of the earliest Ogham letters were named after trees.\n\n: {{wikt-lang|ga|ailm}} ([[pine]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|beith}} ([[birch]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|coll}} ([[hazel]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|dair}} ([[oak]]), {{wikt-lang|sga|edad}}/{{lang|ga|[[eadhadh]]}} ([[populus|poplar]]), {{wikt-lang|sga|fern}}/{{wikt-lang|ga|fearn}} ([[alder]]), {{lang|ga|gath}}/{{wikt-lang|ga|gort}} ([[ivy]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|uath}} ([[crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]]), {{lang|ga|idad}}/{{lang|ga|[[iodhadh]]}} ([[taxus|yew]]), {{lang|ga|luis}} ([[rowan]]), {{lang|ga|muin}} ([[vine]]), {{lang|ga|nin}}/{{lang|ga|nion}} ([[fraxinus|ash]]), {{lang|ga|onn}} ([[gorse]]), {{lang|ga|peith}} ([[alnus viridis|dwarf alder]]), {{lang|ga|ruis}} ([[sambucus|elder]]), {{lang|ga|sail}} ([[willow]]), {{lang|ga|tinne}}/{{lang|ga|teithne}} ([[holly]]), {{lang|ga|\u00far}} ([[calluna|heather]])\n\n===Irish scripts and typefaces===\nPrior to the middle of the 20th century, Irish was usually written using [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]]. This typeface, together with Roman type equivalents and letter name pronunciations along with the additional [[irish initial mutations|lenited]] letters, is shown below.\n\nUse of Gaelic type is today almost entirely restricted to decorative and/or self-consciously traditional contexts. The dot above the [[lenition|lenited]] letter is usually replaced by a following ''h'' in the standard Roman alphabet [for example, {{lang|ga|\u010b}} in Gaelic type becomes '''ch''' in Roman type]. The only other use of ''h'' in Irish is for vowel-initial words after certain [[clitic|proclitics]] (e.g. {{lang|ga|go '''h'''\u00c9irinn}}, \"to Ireland\") and for words of foreign derivation such as {{lang|ga|hata}} \"hat\".\n\nAlthough the Gaelic script remained common until the mid-20th century, efforts to introduce Roman characters began much earlier. [[Theobald Stapleton]]'s 1639 catechism was printed in a Roman type alphabet, and also introduced simplified spellings such as {{wikt-lang|ga|su\u00ed}} for {{wikt-lang|ga|suidhe}} and {{wikt-lang|ga|uaf\u00e1s}} for {{wikt-lang|ga|uathbh\u00e1s}}, though these did not become standard for another 300 years.\n\n[[File:Uncial alphabet.png]]\n\n==Consonants==\nThe consonant letters generally correspond to the consonant phonemes as shown in this table. See [[Irish phonology]] for an explanation of the symbols used and [[Irish initial mutations]] for an explanation of eclipsis. In most cases, consonants are \"broad\" ([[velarization|velarised]]) when the nearest vowel letter is one of '''a, o, u''' and \"slender\" ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]]) when the nearest vowel letter is one of '''e, i'''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Letter(s)\n!

This rule states that the vowels on either side of any consonant must be both slender (''e'' or ''i'') or both broad (''a'', ''o'' or ''u''), to unambiguously determine the consonant's own broad vs. slender pronunciation.  \nAn apparent exception is the combination ''ae'', which is followed by a ''broad'' consonant despite the ''e''.\n\nIn spite of the complex chart below, pronunciation of vowels in Irish is mostly predictable from a few simple rules.\n\n* {{lang|ga|Fada}} vowels (''\u00e1'', ''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa'') are always pronounced.\n* Vowels on either side of a {{lang|ga|fada}} (except for other ''fada'' vowels) most often do not spell any [[phoneme]] (there are several exceptions).  Their presence is almost always necessary to simply satisfy the \"{{lang|ga|caol le caol agus leathan le leathan}}\" rule.  These letters are not entirely silent, however. The {{lang|ga|fada}} vowel and the adjacent consonant require the tongue body to be in different positions, and these letters capture the transient sound produced while it is moving from one position to the other.\n* Between a consonant and a broad vowel, ''e'' and ''i'' are usually non-phonemic in the same way.  This applies to:\n** The ''e'' in {{wikt-lang|ga|fear}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|bean}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|leabhar}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|seomra}}\n** The ''i'' in {{wikt-lang|ga|cailin}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|uncail}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|abhainn}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|aimsir}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|bainne}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|cois}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|fliuch}}\n** '''But''' the ''o'' in {{wikt-lang|ga|troim}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|roimh}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|fios}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|iolar}}, not the ''i''\n* The short vowels ''io'', ''oi'' and ''ui'' have multiple pronunciations that depend on adjacent consonants.\n\nThe following series of charts indicates how written vowels are ''generally'' pronounced.

Thus the letters ''\u1e03 \u010b \u1e0b \u1e1f \u0121 \u1e41 \u1e57 \u1e61 \u1e6b'' are equivalent to ''bh ch dh fh gh mh ph sh th''. In [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] orthography, the dot was used only for ''\u1e1f \u1e9b (\u1e61)'', while the following ''h'' was used for ''ch ph th''; lenition of other letters was not indicated. Later the two systems spread to the entire set of lenitable consonants and competed with each other. Eventually the standard practice was to use the dot when writing in Gaelic script and the following ''h'' when writing in Roman letters.\n\nAs with most European languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[German language|German]], Irish diacritics must be preserved in uppercase forms. If diacritics are unavailable (for example, on a computer using [[ASCII]]), there is no generally accepted standard for replacing it (unlike some languages like [[German language|German]], where the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] is replaced by a following ''e'' and ''[[\u00df]]'' is replaced by ''ss''), and so it is generally just omitted entirely or replaced with an apostrophe (especially in names, for example Dara O'Briain rather than [[Dara \u00d3 Briain]]).\n\nLower-case ''i'' has no [[tittle]] in Gaelic script, and [[road signs in the Republic of Ireland]], which use a typeface based on [[Transport (typeface)|Transport]], also use a dotless lowercase ''i'' (as well as a [[Latin alpha]] glyph for ''a''). However, as printed and electronic material like books, newspapers and web pages use Roman hand almost invariably, the tittle is generally shown but it is not a diacritic and has no significance. (In Irish, the [[grapheme|graphemic]] distinction between [[dotted and dotless I|dotted i and dotless \u0131]] does not arise, i.e. they are not different letters as they are in, for example, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]).\n\nAccording to Alexei Kondratiev,{{citation needed |date=April 2018 }} the dotless ''i'' was developed by monks in the manuscripts to denote the modification of the letter following it. In the word {{lang|ga|go deimhin}} for example, the first ''i'' would be dotless, softening the ''m'', and the second dotted ''i'' would be a normal vowel. The dotting of every occurrence of ''i'' in Irish became a convention, as did the letter ''h'', when the language became more usually typed than handwritten, and the limitations of the machine to accommodate a scribe's flicks and notations imposed standardization. This meant that \"letters\" that were more intended to modify other letters (''h'' and dotless ''i'') became equal letters. In this process formally notation letters became emboldened and distracting to non-initiates. Moves in signage to replace instances of ''h'' with dots, and possibly also replace dotless ''i'' with an under-dot, for example, would clarify spelling and make words less cluttered with notation letters and easier to read. Removing notation letters (''h'' and dotless ''i'') would also constitute a spelling reform without having to change the essential spellings. The dots or diacritics would take the place of distracting notational letters as was once common in manuscripts and handwriting prior to keyboards.\n\n==Punctuation==\n[[File:Pay and Display sign with Tironian et for Irish agus.jpg|thumb|''\u00cdoc \u204a Taispe\u00e1in'' (\"[[pay and display|pay & display]]\") sign in Dublin with the [[Tironian et|Tironian ''et'']] for ''agus'' (\"and\").]]\nIn general, [[punctuation]] marks are used in Irish much as they are in English. One punctuation mark worth noting is the [[Tironian et|Tironian ''et'']] \u204a which is generally used to abbreviate the word {{lang|ga|agus}} \"and\", much as the [[ampersand]] is generally used to abbreviate the word ''and'' in English.\n\nThe [[hyphen]] ({{lang-ga|fleisc\u00edn}}) is used in Irish after the letters ''t'' and ''n'' when these are attached to a vowel-initial word through the rules of the [[Irish initial mutations|initial mutations]], as in {{lang|ga|an t-ar\u00e1n}} \"the bread\", {{lang|ga|a n-in\u00edon}} \"their daughter\". However, the hyphen is not used when the vowel is capitalised, as in {{lang|ga|an tAlbanach}} \"the Scotsman\", {{lang|ga|\u00c1r nAthair}} \"Our Father\". No hyphen is used with the ''h'' that is attached to a vowel-initial word: {{lang|ga|a hin\u00edon}} \"her daughter\".\n\nThe hyphen is also used in [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] words under certain circumstances:\n*between two vowels, e.g. {{lang|ga|m\u00ed-\u00e1dh}} \"misfortune\"\n*between two similar consonants, e.g. {{lang|ga|droch-chaint}} \"bad language\", {{lang|ga|grod-d\u00edol}} \"prompt payment\"\n*in a three-part compound, e.g. {{lang|ga|buan-chomhchoiste}} \"permanent joint committee\"\n*after the prefixes {{lang|ga|do-}}, {{lang|ga|fo-}}, {{lang|ga|so-}} before a word beginning with {{lang|ga|bha}}, {{lang|ga|bhla}}, {{lang|ga|bhra}}, {{lang|ga|dha}}, {{lang|ga|gha}}, {{lang|ga|ghla}}, {{lang|ga|ghra}}, {{lang|ga|mha}}, for example: {{lang|ga|do-bhlasta}} \"bad tasting\", {{lang|ga|fo-ghlac}} \"subsume\", {{lang|ga|so-mharfacht}} \"mortality\"\n*in capitalised titles, e.g. {{lang|ga|An Pr\u00edomh-Bhreitheamh}} \"the Chief Justice\"\n*after {{lang|ga|an-}} \"very\" and {{lang|ga|dea-}} \"good\", e.g. {{lang|ga|an-mh\u00f3r}} \"very big\", {{lang|ga|dea-mh\u00e9in}} \"goodwill\"\n\nThe [[apostrophe]] ({{lang-ga|uaschama}}) is used to indicate an omitted vowel in the following cases:\n*the prepositions {{lang|ga|de}} \"from\" and {{lang|ga|do}} \"to\" both become {{lang|ga|d\u2019}} before a vowel (or ''fh'' + vowel, since ''fh'' is silent), as in {{lang|ga|Thit s\u00ed d'each}} \"She fell from a horse\" and {{lang|ga|Tabhair d'fhear an t\u00ed \u00e9}} \"Give it to the landlord\"\n*the possessive pronouns {{lang|ga|mo}} \"my\" and {{lang|ga|do}} \"your (singular)\" become {{lang|ga|m\u2019}} and {{lang|ga|d\u2019}} before a vowel or ''fh'' + vowel, as in {{lang|ga|m'\u00f3ige}} \"my youth\", {{lang|ga|d'fhiacail}} \"your tooth\"\n*the preverbal [[grammatical particle|particle]] {{lang|ga|do}} becomes {{lang|ga|d\u2019}} before a vowel or ''fh'' + vowel, as in {{lang|ga|d'ardaigh m\u00e9}} \"I raised\", {{lang|ga|d'fhanfadh s\u00e9}} \"he would wait\"\n*the copular particle {{lang|ga|ba}} becomes {{lang|ga|b\u2019}} before a vowel or ''fh'' + vowel, as in {{lang|ga|B'ait liom \u00e9 sin}} \"I found that odd\" and {{lang|ga|b'fh\u00e9idir}} \"maybe\". However, {{lang|ga|ba}} retains its vowel before the pronouns {{lang|ga|\u00e9}}, {{lang|ga|\u00ed}}, {{lang|ga|iad}}, as in {{lang|ga|Ba iad na ginear\u00e1il a choinnigh an chumhacht}} \"It was the generals who kept the power\"\n\n==Capitalisation==\n[[File:ALLCAPS OIFIG NA bPASANNA.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bilingual sign]] in Ireland.

Prior to that, [[Primitive Irish language|Primitive Irish]] was written in [[Ogham]]. Irish [[orthography]] is mainly based on [[etymology|etymological]] considerations, although a [[spelling reform]] in the mid-20th century simplified the relationship between [[spelling]] and pronunciation somewhat.\n\nThere are three dialects of spoken [[Irish language|Irish]]: [[Ulster Irish|Ulster]] (now predominantly in [[County Donegal]]), [[Connacht Irish|Connacht]] (Counties [[County Mayo|Mayo]] and [[County Galway|Galway]]), and [[Munster Irish|Munster]] (Counties [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Cork|Cork]], and [[County Waterford|Waterford]]). Some spelling conventions are common to all three dialects, while others vary from dialect to dialect. In addition, individual words may have in a given dialect pronunciations that are not reflected by their spelling (the pronunciation in this article reflects Connacht Irish pronunciation; other accents may differ, but are occasionally included).\n\n==Alphabet==\n[[File:Irish script.gif|thumb|right|330px| A sample of traditional [[Gaelic type]].]]\n[[File:Gaelic alphabet.jpg|thumb|Uncial alphabet carved on the [[National Archives of Ireland]] building in [[Dublin]], with each type of diacritic (''s\u00edneadh fada'' and ''ponc s\u00e9imhithe'') as well as the [[Tironian notes|Tironian ''et'']].]] \nThe alphabet now used for writing the Irish language consists of the following letters of the [[Latin script]], whether written in [[Roman type|Roman hand]] or [[Gaelic type|Gaelic hand]]:\n\n: '''a \u00e1 b c d e \u00e9 f g h i \u00ed l m n o \u00f3 p r s t u \u00fa''';\n\nThe [[apex (diacritic)|apex]] over the vowels is ignored for purposes of alphabetization. Modern loanwords also make use of '''j k q v w x y z'''. Of these, '''v''' is the most common. It occurs in a small number of words of native origin in the language such as {{wikt-lang|ga|v\u00e1carnach}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|v\u00e1c}} and {{wikt-lang|ga|vr\u00e1c}}, all of which are onomatopoeic. It also occurs in a number of alternative colloquial forms such as {{lang|ga|v\u00edog}} instead of {{wikt-lang|ga|b\u00edog}} and {{lang|ga|v\u00eds}} instead of {{wikt-lang|ga|b\u00eds}} as cited in {{lang|ga|Niall \u00d3 D\u00f3naill|italic=no}}'s {{lang|ga|Focl\u00f3ir Gaeilge\u2013B\u00e9arla|italic=yes}} (''Irish\u2013English Dictionary''). It is also the only non-traditional letter used to write foreign names and words adapted to the Irish language (for example, [[Switzerland]], or {{lang|la|Helvetia}}, is [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] as {{lang|ga|An Eilv\u00e9is}}; [[Azerbaijan]], in contrast, is written {{lang|ga|An Asarbaise\u00e1in}} rather than *{{lang|ga|An Azarbaij\u00e1in}}). The letters '''j''', '''q''', '''w''', '''x''', '''y''' and '''z''' are used primarily in scientific terminology or direct, unaltered borrowings from English and other languages, although the phoneme {{IPA|/z/}} does exist naturally in at least one dialect, that of [[West Muskerry]], County Cork, as the [[eclipsis]] of '''s'''. '''k''' is the only letter not to be listed by {{lang|ga|\u00d3 D\u00f3naill|italic=no}}. '''h''', when not  prefixed to an initial vowel as an [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]] in certain grammatical functions (or when not used as an indicator of [[lenition]] when Roman type is used), occurs primarily in loanwords as an initial consonant. The letters' names are spelt out thus:\n\n: '''{{lang|ga|\u00e1 b\u00e9 c\u00e9 d\u00e9 \u00e9 eif g\u00e9 h\u00e9is \u00ed eil eim ein \u00f3 p\u00e9 ear eas t\u00e9 \u00fa}}'''\n: along with '''{{lang|ga|j\u00e9 c\u00e1 c\u00fa v\u00e9 wae eacs y\u00e9 zae}}'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=hRiKYbE3cIIC&pg=PA1&dq=d%C3%A9,+%C3%A9,+eif+h%C3%A9is+%C3%AD+eil+eim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVy97IwOXkAhUZTRUIHWNmD6kQ6AEIKjAA|title=Graim\u00e9ar Gaeilge na mBr\u00e1ithre Cr\u00edosta\u00ed|date=22 September 1999|publisher=An G\u00fam|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nTree names were once popularly used to [[acrophony|name the letters]]. Tradition taught that they all derived from the names of [[Ogham]] letters, though it is now known that only some of the earliest Ogham letters were named after trees.\n\n: {{wikt-lang|ga|ailm}} ([[pine]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|beith}} ([[birch]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|coll}} ([[hazel]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|dair}} ([[oak]]), {{wikt-lang|sga|edad}}/{{lang|ga|[[eadhadh]]}} ([[populus|poplar]]), {{wikt-lang|sga|fern}}/{{wikt-lang|ga|fearn}} ([[alder]]), {{lang|ga|gath}}/{{wikt-lang|ga|gort}} ([[ivy]]), {{wikt-lang|ga|uath}} ([[crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]]), {{lang|ga|idad}}/{{lang|ga|[[iodhadh]]}} ([[taxus|yew]]), {{lang|ga|luis}} ([[rowan]]), {{lang|ga|muin}} ([[vine]]), {{lang|ga|nin}}/{{lang|ga|nion}} ([[fraxinus|ash]]), {{lang|ga|onn}} ([[gorse]]), {{lang|ga|peith}} ([[alnus viridis|dwarf alder]]), {{lang|ga|ruis}} ([[sambucus|elder]]), {{lang|ga|sail}} ([[willow]]), {{lang|ga|tinne}}/{{lang|ga|teithne}} ([[holly]]), {{lang|ga|\u00far}} ([[calluna|heather]])\n\n===Irish scripts and typefaces===\nPrior to the middle of the 20th century, Irish was usually written using [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]]. This typeface, together with Roman type equivalents and letter name pronunciations along with the additional [[irish initial mutations|lenited]] letters, is shown below.\n\nUse of Gaelic type is today almost entirely restricted to decorative and/or self-consciously traditional contexts. The dot above the [[lenition|lenited]] letter is usually replaced by a following ''h'' in the standard Roman alphabet [for example, {{lang|ga|\u010b}} in Gaelic type becomes '''ch''' in Roman type]. The only other use of ''h'' in Irish is for vowel-initial words after certain [[clitic|proclitics]] (e.g. {{lang|ga|go '''h'''\u00c9irinn}}, \"to Ireland\") and for words of foreign derivation such as {{lang|ga|hata}} \"hat\".\n\nAlthough the Gaelic script remained common until the mid-20th century, efforts to introduce Roman characters began much earlier. [[Theobald Stapleton]]'s 1639 catechism was printed in a Roman type alphabet, and also introduced simplified spellings such as {{wikt-lang|ga|su\u00ed}} for {{wikt-lang|ga|suidhe}} and {{wikt-lang|ga|uaf\u00e1s}} for {{wikt-lang|ga|uathbh\u00e1s}}, though these did not become standard for another 300 years.\n\n[[File:Uncial alphabet.png]]\n\n==Consonants==\nThe consonant letters generally correspond to the consonant phonemes as shown in this table. See [[Irish phonology]] for an explanation of the symbols used and [[Irish initial mutations]] for an explanation of eclipsis. In most cases, consonants are \"broad\" ([[velarization|velarised]]) when the nearest vowel letter is one of '''a, o, u''' and \"slender\" ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]]) when the nearest vowel letter is one of '''e, i'''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Letter(s)\n!

This rule states that the vowels on either side of any consonant must be both slender (''e'' or ''i'') or both broad (''a'', ''o'' or ''u''), to unambiguously determine the consonant's own broad vs. slender pronunciation.  \nAn apparent exception is the combination ''ae'', which is followed by a ''broad'' consonant despite the ''e''.\n\nIn spite of the complex chart below, pronunciation of vowels in Irish is mostly predictable from a few simple rules.\n\n* {{lang|ga|Fada}} vowels (''\u00e1'', ''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa'') are always pronounced.\n* Vowels on either side of a {{lang|ga|fada}} (except for other ''fada'' vowels) most often do not spell any [[phoneme]] (there are several exceptions).  Their presence is almost always necessary to simply satisfy the \"{{lang|ga|caol le caol agus leathan le leathan}}\" rule.  These letters are not entirely silent, however. The {{lang|ga|fada}} vowel and the adjacent consonant require the tongue body to be in different positions, and these letters capture the transient sound produced while it is moving from one position to the other.\n* Between a consonant and a broad vowel, ''e'' and ''i'' are usually non-phonemic in the same way.  This applies to:\n** The ''e'' in {{wikt-lang|ga|fear}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|bean}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|leabhar}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|seomra}}\n** The ''i'' in {{wikt-lang|ga|cailin}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|uncail}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|abhainn}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|aimsir}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|bainne}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|cois}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|fliuch}}\n** '''But''' the ''o'' in {{wikt-lang|ga|troim}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|roimh}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|fios}}, {{wikt-lang|ga|iolar}}, not the ''i''\n* The short vowels ''io'', ''oi'' and ''ui'' have multiple pronunciations that depend on adjacent consonants.\n\nThe following series of charts indicates how written vowels are ''generally'' pronounced.  Each dialect has certain divergences from this general scheme, and may also pronounce some words in a way that does not agree with standard orthography.\n\n===Simple vowels===\n\nUnstressed vowels are generally reduced to [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Letter(s)\n!

Thus the letters ''\u1e03 \u010b \u1e0b \u1e1f \u0121 \u1e41 \u1e57 \u1e61 \u1e6b'' are equivalent to ''bh ch dh fh gh mh ph sh th''. In [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] orthography, the dot was used only for ''\u1e1f \u1e61'', while the following ''h'' was used for ''ch ph th''; lenition of other letters was not indicated. Later the two systems spread to the entire set of lenitable consonants and competed with each other. Eventually the standard practice was to use the dot when writing in Gaelic script and the following ''h'' when writing in Roman letters.\n\nAs with most European languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[German language|German]], Irish diacritics must be preserved in uppercase forms. If diacritics are unavailable (for example, on a computer using [[ASCII]]), there is no generally accepted standard for replacing it (unlike some languages like [[German language|German]], where the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] is replaced by a following ''e'' and ''[[\u00df]]'' is replaced by ''ss''), and so it is generally just omitted entirely or replaced with an apostrophe (especially in names, for example Dara O'Briain rather than [[Dara \u00d3 Briain]]).\n\nLower-case ''i'' has no [[tittle]] in Gaelic script, and [[road signs in the Republic of Ireland]], which use a typeface based on [[Transport (typeface)|Transport]], also use a dotless lowercase ''i'' (as well as a [[Latin alpha]] glyph for ''a''). However, as printed and electronic material like books, newspapers and web pages use Roman hand almost invariably, the tittle is generally shown but it is not a diacritic and has no significance. (In Irish, the [[grapheme|graphemic]] distinction between [[dotted and dotless I|dotted i and dotless \u0131]] does not arise, i.e. they are not different letters as they are in, for example, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]).\n\nAccording to Alexei Kondratiev,{{citation needed |date=April 2018 }} the dotless ''i'' was developed by monks in the manuscripts to denote the modification of the letter following it. In the word {{lang|ga|go deimhin}} for example, the first ''i'' would be dotless, softening the ''m'', and the second dotted ''i'' would be a normal vowel. The dotting of every occurrence of ''i'' in Irish became a convention, as did the letter ''h'', when the language became more usually typed than handwritten, and the limitations of the machine to accommodate a scribe's flicks and notations imposed standardization. This meant that \"letters\" that were more intended to modify other letters (''h'' and dotless ''i'') became equal letters. In this process formally notation letters became emboldened and distracting to non-initiates. Moves in signage to replace instances of ''h'' with dots, and possibly also replace dotless ''i'' with an under-dot, for example, would clarify spelling and make words less cluttered with notation letters and easier to read. Removing notation letters (''h'' and dotless ''i'') would also constitute a spelling reform without having to change the essential spellings. The dots or diacritics would take the place of distracting notational letters as was once common in manuscripts and handwriting prior to keyboards.\n\n==Punctuation==\n[[File:Pay and Display sign with Tironian et for Irish agus.jpg|thumb|''\u00cdoc \u204a Taispe\u00e1in'' (\"[[pay and display|pay & display]]\") sign in Dublin with the [[Tironian et|Tironian ''et'']] for ''agus'' (\"and\").]]\nIn general, [[punctuation]] marks are used in Irish much as they are in English. One punctuation mark worth noting is the [[Tironian et|Tironian ''et'']] \u204a which is generally used to abbreviate the word {{lang|ga|agus}} \"and\", much as the [[ampersand]] is generally used to abbreviate the word ''and'' in English.\n\nThe [[hyphen]] ({{lang-ga|fleisc\u00edn}}) is used in Irish after the letters ''t'' and ''n'' when these are attached to a vowel-initial word through the rules of the [[Irish initial mutations|initial mutations]], as in {{lang|ga|an t-ar\u00e1n}} \"the bread\", {{lang|ga|a n-in\u00edon}} \"their daughter\". However, the hyphen is not used when the vowel is capitalised, as in {{lang|ga|an tAlbanach}} \"the Scotsman\", {{lang|ga|\u00c1r nAthair}} \"Our Father\". No hyphen is used with the ''h'' that is attached to a vowel-initial word: {{lang|ga|a hin\u00edon}} \"her daughter\".\n\nThe hyphen is also used in [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] words under certain circumstances:\n*between two vowels, e.g. {{lang|ga|m\u00ed-\u00e1dh}} \"misfortune\"\n*between two similar consonants, e.g. {{lang|ga|droch-chaint}} \"bad language\", {{lang|ga|grod-d\u00edol}} \"prompt payment\"\n*in a three-part compound, e.g. {{lang|ga|buan-chomhchoiste}} \"permanent joint committee\"\n*after the prefixes {{lang|ga|do-}}, {{lang|ga|fo-}}, {{lang|ga|so-}} before a word beginning with {{lang|ga|bha}}, {{lang|ga|bhla}}, {{lang|ga|bhra}}, {{lang|ga|dha}}, {{lang|ga|gha}}, {{lang|ga|ghla}}, {{lang|ga|ghra}}, {{lang|ga|mha}}, for example: {{lang|ga|do-bhlasta}} \"bad tasting\", {{lang|ga|fo-ghlac}} \"subsume\", {{lang|ga|so-mharfacht}} \"mortality\"\n*in capitalised titles, e.g. {{lang|ga|An Pr\u00edomh-Bhreitheamh}} \"the Chief Justice\"\n*after {{lang|ga|an-}} \"very\" and {{lang|ga|dea-}} \"good\", e.g. {{lang|ga|an-mh\u00f3r}} \"very big\", {{lang|ga|dea-mh\u00e9in}} \"goodwill\"\n\nThe [[apostrophe]] ({{lang-ga|uaschama}}) is used to indicate an omitted vowel in the following cases:\n*the prepositions {{lang|ga|de}} \"from\" and {{lang|ga|do}} \"to\" both become {{lang|ga|d\u2019}} before a vowel (or ''fh'' + vowel, since ''fh'' is silent), as in {{lang|ga|Thit s\u00ed d'each}} \"She fell from a horse\" and {{lang|ga|Tabhair d'fhear an t\u00ed \u00e9}} \"Give it to the landlord\"\n*the possessive pronouns {{lang|ga|mo}} \"my\" and {{lang|ga|do}} \"your (singular)\" become {{lang|ga|m\u2019}} and {{lang|ga|d\u2019}} before a vowel or ''fh'' + vowel, as in {{lang|ga|m'\u00f3ige}} \"my youth\", {{lang|ga|d'fhiacail}} \"your tooth\"\n*the preverbal [[grammatical particle|particle]] {{lang|ga|do}} becomes {{lang|ga|d\u2019}} before a vowel or ''fh'' + vowel, as in {{lang|ga|d'ardaigh m\u00e9}} \"I raised\", {{lang|ga|d'fhanfadh s\u00e9}} \"he would wait\"\n*the copular particle {{lang|ga|ba}} becomes {{lang|ga|b\u2019}} before a vowel or ''fh'' + vowel, as in {{lang|ga|B'ait liom \u00e9 sin}} \"I found that odd\" and {{lang|ga|b'fh\u00e9idir}} \"maybe\". However, {{lang|ga|ba}} retains its vowel before the pronouns {{lang|ga|\u00e9}}, {{lang|ga|\u00ed}}, {{lang|ga|iad}}, as in {{lang|ga|Ba iad na ginear\u00e1il a choinnigh an chumhacht}} \"It was the generals who kept the power\"\n\n==Capitalisation==\n[[File:ALLCAPS OIFIG NA bPASANNA.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bilingual sign]] in Ireland. The [[eclipsis]] of ''P'' to ''bP'' uses lowercase in an otherwise [[all caps|all-caps]] text]]\n[[Capitalisation]] rules are similar to English.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of Genoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm.

At that time the [[Western Hemisphere]] in general was unknown to most Europeans, although it had been discovered between the years 800 and 1000 by the [[vikings]]. Following the discovery of the islands by Columbus, the area was quickly colonized by several Western cultures (initially [[Spain#Imperial Spain|Spain]], then later [[England#Early Modern|England]], the [[History of the Netherlands#The Dutch in the Americas|Dutch Republic]], [[French colonial empire#The Americas|France]], [[Couronian colonization of the Americas|Courland]] and [[Danish colonization of the Americas#West Indies|Denmark]]).

The Caribbean Sea is separated from the ocean by several [[island arc]]s of various ages. The youngest stretches from the [[Lesser Antilles]] to the [[Virgin Islands]] to the north east of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] off the coast of [[Venezuela]]. This arc was formed by the collision of the [[South American Plate]] with the [[Caribbean Plate]] and includes active and extinct [[volcanoes]] such as [[Mount Pelee]], [[the Quill (volcano)]] on [[Sint Eustatius]] in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] and [[Morne Trois Pitons]] on [[Dominica]]. The larger islands in the northern part of the sea [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Puerto Rico]] lie on an older island arc.\n[[File:Caribbean Sea Gulf of Mexico shaded relief bathymetry land map.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Terrain cartography|shaded relief]] map of the Caribbean Sea and [[Gulf of Mexico]] area.<ref name=\"GLOBE\" /><ref name=\"ETOPO1\" />]]\n\nThe geological age of the Caribbean Sea is estimated to be between 160 and 180&nbsp;million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the [[supercontinent]] called [[Pangea]] in the [[Mesozoic Era]].<ref>Iturralde-Vinent, Manuel (2004), The first inhabitants of the Caribbean , Cuban Science Network . URL accessed on 28/07/2007</ref> It is assumed the proto-caribbean basin existed in the [[Devonian]] period. In the early [[Carboniferous]] movement of [[Gondwana]] to the north and its convergence with the [[Euramerica]] basin decreased in size. The next stage of the Caribbean Sea's formation began in the [[Triassic]]. Powerful [[rifting]] led to the formation of narrow troughs, stretching from modern [[Newfoundland]] to the west coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] which formed [[siliciclastic]] [[sedimentary rock]]s. In the early [[Jurassic]] due to powerful [[marine transgression]], water broke into the present area of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] creating a vast shallow pool. The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the [[Middle Jurassic]] [[rifting]]. The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and contributed to the destruction of [[Pangaea]] at the end of the late [[Jurassic]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today. In the early [[Paleogene]] due to [[Marine regression]] the Caribbean became separated from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by the land of [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The Caribbean remained like this for most of the [[Cenozoic]] until the [[Holocene]] when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Caribbean's floor is composed of sub-oceanic [[sediments]] of [[deep red clay]] in the deep basins and troughs. On continental slopes and ridges [[calcareous]] [[silt]]s are found. [[Clay minerals]] likely having been deposited by the mainland river [[Orinoco]] and the [[Magdalena River]]. Deposits on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico have a thickness of about {{cvt|1|km}}. Upper sedimentary layers relate to the period from the [[Mesozoic]] to the [[Cenozoic]] (250&nbsp;million years ago to present) and the lower layers from the [[Paleozoic]] to the [[Mesozoic]].\n[[File:Caribbean plate tectonics-en.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Caribbean plate tectonics]]\n\nThe Caribbean sea floor is divided into five [[Oceanic basin|basins]] separated from each other by underwater ridges and mountain ranges. Atlantic Ocean water enters the Caribbean through the ''Anegada Passage'' lying between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Virgin Islands]] and the ''Windward Passage'' located between [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba links the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with the Caribbean. The deepest points of the sea lie in [[Cayman Trough]] with depths reaching approximately {{cvt|7686|m|-1}}. Despite this, the Caribbean Sea is considered a relatively shallow sea in comparison to other bodies of water.\nThe pressure of the [[South American Plate]] to the east of the Caribbean causes the region of the [[Lesser Antilles]] to have high volcanic activity. There was a very serious eruption of [[Mount Pel\u00e9e]] in 1902 which caused many casualties.\n\nThe Caribbean sea floor is also home to two [[oceanic trench]]es: the [[Cayman Trench]] and [[Puerto Rico Trench]], which put the area at a high risk of [[earthquake]]s. Underwater earthquakes pose a threat of generating [[tsunami]]s which could have a devastating effect on the Caribbean islands.

The [[salinity]] of seawater is about 3.6% and its [[density]] is {{cvt|1023.5|-|1024.0|kg/m3|lb/cuft}}. The surface water colour is blue-green to green.\n\nThe Caribbean's depth in its wider basins and deep water temperatures are similar to those of the Atlantic. Atlantic deep water is thought to spill into the Caribbean and contribute to the general deep water of its sea.<ref>Pernetta, John. (2004). Guide to the Oceans.

Coral reefs support some of the most diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time, microscopic plants called [[zooxanthellae]], which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off. These plants provide food for the corals, and give them their color. The result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called [[coral bleaching]], and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef. Over 42% of corals are completely bleached and 95% are experiencing some type of whitening.<ref>[http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/03/mesoamerican-coral-reef-on-the-way-to-becoming-a-marine-desert/] Inter Press Service News Agency \u2013 Mesoamerican Coral Reef on the way to becoming a Marine Desert</ref> Historically the Caribbean is thought to contain 14% of the world's coral reefs.<ref>Elder, Danny and Pernetta, John.

The principal ocean current is the [[North Equatorial Current]], which enters the region from the tropical [[Atlantic]]. The climate of the area is [[tropical]], varying from [[tropical rainforest]] in some areas to [[tropical savanna]] in others. There are also some locations that are [[arid]] climates with considerable drought in some years.\n\nRainfall varies with elevation, size and water currents (cool upwelling keep the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] arid). Warm, moist [[trade winds]] blow consistently from the east, creating both rain forest and semi arid climates across the region. The tropical rainforest climates include lowland areas near the Caribbean Sea from [[Costa Rica]] north to [[Belize]], as well as the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], while the more seasonal dry tropical savanna climates are found in [[Cuba]], northern [[Venezuela]], and southern [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico]]. Arid climates are found along the extreme southern coast of Venezuela out to the islands including [[Aruba]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]], as well as the northern tip of Yucat\u00e1n<ref>Silverstein, Alvin (1998) Weather And Climate (Science Concepts); page 17. 21st Century. {{ISBN|0-7613-3223-5}}</ref> \n\n[[Tropical cyclones]] are a threat to the nations that rim the Caribbean Sea. While landfalls are infrequent, the resulting loss of life and property damage makes them significant hazard to life in the Caribbean. Tropical cyclones that impact the Caribbean often develop off the West coast of [[Africa]] and make their way west across the Atlantic Ocean toward the Caribbean, while other storms develop in the Caribbean itself. The Caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from June through November, with the majority of hurricanes occurring during August and September. On average around 9 tropical storms form each year, with 5 reaching hurricane strength. According to the [[National Hurricane Center]] 385 hurricanes occurred in the Caribbean between 1494 and 1900.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nThe region has a high level of [[biodiversity]] and many species are [[endemic]] to the Caribbean.\n\n===Vegetation===\nThe vegetation of the region is mostly [[tropical]] but differences in [[topography]], soil and climatic conditions increase [[species diversity]]. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are [[endemic]]. For example, guaiac wood (''[[Guaiacum officinale]]''), the flower of which is the national flower of [[Jamaica]] and the Bayahibe rose (''[[Pereskia quisqueyana]]'') which is the national flower of the [[Dominican Republic]] and the [[ceiba]] which is the national tree of both [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guatemala]]. The [[mahogany]] is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and [[Belize]]. The caimito (''[[Chrysophyllum cainito]]'') grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are [[coconut palms]] and in [[lagoons]] and [[estuaries]] are found thick areas of [[Avicennia germinans|black mangrove]] and red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'').\n\nIn shallow water [[flora]] and [[fauna]] is concentrated around [[coral reefs]] where there is little variation in water temperature, purity and salinity. Leeward side of [[lagoons]] provide areas of growth for [[sea grass]]es. Turtle grass (''[[Thalassia testudinum]]'') is common in the Caribbean as is manatee grass (''[[Syringodium filiforme]]'') which can grow together as well as in fields of single species at depths up to {{cvt|20|m}}. Another type shoal grass (''[[Halodule wrightii]]'') grows on sand and mud surfaces at depths of up to {{cvt|5|m}}. In [[brackish water]] of harbours and estuaries at depths less than {{cvt|2.5|m}} widgeongrass (''[[Ruppia maritima]]'') grows. Representatives of three species belonging to the genus ''[[Halophila]]'', (''[[Halophila baillonii]]'', ''[[Halophila engelmannii]]'' and ''[[Halophila decipiens]]'') are found at depths of up to {{cvt|30|m}} except for ''Halophila engelmani'' which does not grow below {{cvt|5|m}} and is confined to the [[Bahamas]], [[Florida]], the [[Greater Antilles]] and the western part of the Caribbean.

At that time the [[Western Hemisphere]] in general was unknown to most Europeans, although it had been discovered between the years 800 and 1000 by the [[vikings]]. Following the discovery of the islands by Columbus, the area was quickly colonized by several Western cultures (initially [[Spain#Imperial Spain|Spain]], then later [[England#Early Modern|England]], the [[History of the Netherlands#The Dutch in the Americas|Dutch Republic]], [[French colonial empire#The Americas|France]], [[Couronian colonization of the Americas|Courland]] and [[Danish colonization of the Americas#West Indies|Denmark]]). Following the colonization of the Caribbean islands, the Caribbean Sea became a busy area for European-based marine trading and transports, and this commerce eventually attracted [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]] such as [[Samuel Bellamy]] and [[Blackbeard]].\n\n{{As of | 2015}} the area is home to 22 island [[territories]] and borders 12 continental [[countries]].\n\n==Extent==\nThe [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Caribbean Sea as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n::''On the North.''

The Caribbean Sea is separated from the ocean by several [[island arc]]s of various ages. The youngest stretches from the [[Lesser Antilles]] to the [[Virgin Islands]] to the north east of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] off the coast of [[Venezuela]]. This arc was formed by the collision of the [[South American Plate]] with the [[Caribbean Plate]] and includes active and extinct [[volcanoes]] such as [[Mount Pelee]], [[the Quill (volcano)]] on [[Sint Eustatius]] in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] and [[Morne Trois Pitons]] on [[Dominica]]. The larger islands in the northern part of the sea [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Puerto Rico]] lie on an older island arc.\n[[File:Caribbean Sea Gulf of Mexico shaded relief bathymetry land map.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Terrain cartography|shaded relief]] map of the Caribbean Sea and [[Gulf of Mexico]] area.<ref name=\"GLOBE\" /><ref name=\"ETOPO1\" />]]\n\nThe geological age of the Caribbean Sea is estimated to be between 160 and 180&nbsp;million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the [[supercontinent]] called [[Pangea]] in the [[Mesozoic Era]].<ref>Iturralde-Vinent, Manuel (2004), The first inhabitants of the Caribbean , Cuban Science Network . URL accessed on 28/07/2007</ref> It is assumed the proto-caribbean basin existed in the [[Devonian]] period. In the early [[Carboniferous]] movement of [[Gondwana]] to the north and its convergence with the [[Euramerica]] basin decreased in size. The next stage of the Caribbean Sea's formation began in the [[Triassic]]. Powerful [[rifting]] led to the formation of narrow troughs, stretching from modern [[Newfoundland]] to the west coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] which formed [[siliciclastic]] [[sedimentary rock]]s. In the early [[Jurassic]] due to powerful [[marine transgression]], water broke into the present area of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] creating a vast shallow pool. The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the [[Middle Jurassic]] [[rifting]]. The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and contributed to the destruction of [[Pangaea]] at the end of the late [[Jurassic]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today. In the early [[Paleogene]] due to [[Marine regression]] the Caribbean became separated from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by the land of [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The Caribbean remained like this for most of the [[Cenozoic]] until the [[Holocene]] when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Caribbean's floor is composed of sub-oceanic [[sediments]] of [[deep red clay]] in the deep basins and troughs. On continental slopes and ridges [[calcareous]] [[silt]]s are found. [[Clay minerals]] likely having been deposited by the mainland river [[Orinoco]] and the [[Magdalena River]]. Deposits on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico have a thickness of about {{cvt|1|km}}. Upper sedimentary layers relate to the period from the [[Mesozoic]] to the [[Cenozoic]] (250&nbsp;million years ago to present) and the lower layers from the [[Paleozoic]] to the [[Mesozoic]].\n[[File:Caribbean plate tectonics-en.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Caribbean plate tectonics]]\n\nThe Caribbean sea floor is divided into five [[Oceanic basin|basins]] separated from each other by underwater ridges and mountain ranges. Atlantic Ocean water enters the Caribbean through the ''Anegada Passage'' lying between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Virgin Islands]] and the ''Windward Passage'' located between [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba links the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with the Caribbean. The deepest points of the sea lie in [[Cayman Trough]] with depths reaching approximately {{cvt|7686|m|-1}}. Despite this, the Caribbean Sea is considered a relatively shallow sea in comparison to other bodies of water.\nThe pressure of the [[South American Plate]] to the east of the Caribbean causes the region of the [[Lesser Antilles]] to have high volcanic activity. There was a very serious eruption of [[Mount Pel\u00e9e]] in 1902 which caused many casualties.\n\nThe Caribbean sea floor is also home to two [[oceanic trench]]es: the [[Cayman Trench]] and [[Puerto Rico Trench]], which put the area at a high risk of [[earthquake]]s. Underwater earthquakes pose a threat of generating [[tsunami]]s which could have a devastating effect on the Caribbean islands. Scientific data reveals that over the last 500 years the area has seen a dozen earthquakes above 7.5 magnitude.<ref>{{cite web | last = Dawicki | first = Shelley | url = http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=3964 | title = Tsunamis in the Caribbean?

Over the past fifty years the Caribbean has gone through three stages: cooling until 1974; a cold phase with peaks during 1974\u20131976 and 1984\u20131986 then; a warming phase with an increase in temperature of {{cvt|0.6|C-change}} per year.

Coral reefs support some of the most diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time, microscopic plants called [[zooxanthellae]], which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off. These plants provide food for the corals, and give them their color. The result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called [[coral bleaching]], and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef. Over 42% of corals are completely bleached and 95% are experiencing some type of whitening.<ref>[http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/03/mesoamerican-coral-reef-on-the-way-to-becoming-a-marine-desert/] Inter Press Service News Agency \u2013 Mesoamerican Coral Reef on the way to becoming a Marine Desert</ref> Historically the Caribbean is thought to contain 14% of the world's coral reefs.<ref>Elder, Danny and Pernetta, John.

The principal ocean current is the [[North Equatorial Current]], which enters the region from the tropical [[Atlantic]]. The climate of the area is [[tropical]], varying from [[tropical rainforest]] in some areas to [[tropical savanna]] in others. There are also some locations that are [[arid]] climates with considerable drought in some years.\n\nRainfall varies with elevation, size and water currents (cool upwelling keep the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] arid). Warm, moist [[trade winds]] blow consistently from the east, creating both rain forest and semi arid climates across the region. The tropical rainforest climates include lowland areas near the Caribbean Sea from [[Costa Rica]] north to [[Belize]], as well as the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], while the more seasonal dry tropical savanna climates are found in [[Cuba]], northern [[Venezuela]], and southern [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico]].

While landfalls are infrequent, the resulting loss of life and property damage makes them significant hazard to life in the Caribbean. Tropical cyclones that impact the Caribbean often develop off the West coast of [[Africa]] and make their way west across the Atlantic Ocean toward the Caribbean, while other storms develop in the Caribbean itself. The Caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from June through November, with the majority of hurricanes occurring during August and September. On average around 9 tropical storms form each year, with 5 reaching hurricane strength. According to the [[National Hurricane Center]] 385 hurricanes occurred in the Caribbean between 1494 and 1900.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nThe region has a high level of [[biodiversity]] and many species are [[endemic]] to the Caribbean.\n\n===Vegetation===\nThe vegetation of the region is mostly [[tropical]] but differences in [[topography]], soil and climatic conditions increase [[species diversity]]. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are [[endemic]]. For example, guaiac wood (''[[Guaiacum officinale]]''), the flower of which is the national flower of [[Jamaica]] and the Bayahibe rose (''[[Pereskia quisqueyana]]'') which is the national flower of the [[Dominican Republic]] and the [[ceiba]] which is the national tree of both [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guatemala]]. The [[mahogany]] is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and [[Belize]]. The caimito (''[[Chrysophyllum cainito]]'') grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are [[coconut palms]] and in [[lagoons]] and [[estuaries]] are found thick areas of [[Avicennia germinans|black mangrove]] and red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'').\n\nIn shallow water [[flora]] and [[fauna]] is concentrated around [[coral reefs]] where there is little variation in water temperature, purity and salinity. Leeward side of [[lagoons]] provide areas of growth for [[sea grass]]es. Turtle grass (''[[Thalassia testudinum]]'') is common in the Caribbean as is manatee grass (''[[Syringodium filiforme]]'') which can grow together as well as in fields of single species at depths up to {{cvt|20|m}}. Another type shoal grass (''[[Halodule wrightii]]'') grows on sand and mud surfaces at depths of up to {{cvt|5|m}}.

By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

Ms. Trivia was Grant's guest at a Halloween Festival dinner held at Lauritano's Restaurant in [[The Bronx]], where a young Ms. Trivia, not long out of her teens, revealed herself for the first time to a startled radio audience, many who had expected and assumed, based upon her articulation and intonation, that she would be an elderly, prudish woman. Instead, a statuesque and fashionable Ms. Trivia, wearing an elaborate Victorian costume, was the surprise guest seated next to Grant at the dais table along with several political figures from New York.

It would later be revealed, on what was Agar's final show a few hours later, that he would be starting effective immediately, as Grant took over the final segments of the show. His first full show on ABC since 1996 was on August 23. The story of Grant's return, as reported by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', had been discovered only a couple of hours before Grant's official announcement.\n\nGrant's stint lasted less than a year and a half, until his regular nightly show was pulled by [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in late November 2008 as part of a programming shuffle stemming from the debut of [[Curtis Sliwa]]'s national show, and later Mark Levin's show expanding to three hours, leaving no room for Grant.<ref name=\"nydn112508\">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/11/25/2008-11-25_veteran_radio_host_bob_grant_booted_from.html | title=Veteran radio host Bob Grant booted from nightly show on WABC | author=David Hinckley | publisher=[[New York Daily News]] | date=November 25, 2008}}</ref>  Grant did his most recent AM radio work as guest host filling in for Michael Savage on January 21, 2009, Mark Levin on March 23, 2009, and Sean Hannity on July 31, 2009.<ref name=\"nydn112508\" />\n\nDuring the week of July 6, 2009 Grant began hosting an [[Internet radio]] show titled ''Straight Ahead!'' which originally ran Monday through Friday from 8 to 9&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] on [[UBATV.com]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubatv.com | title=UBATV.com}}</ref> As a [[webcast]], the show differed from Grant's radio shows, in that the viewer watched Grant as he did his broadcast. The first two months of ''Straight Ahead!'' were from inside Grant's home, and were run with technical assistance from independent filmmaker Ryan O'Leary.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} New York radio personalities [[Richard Bey]] and [[Jay Diamond]] were also brought on board to broadcast their own one-hour shows. Grant mentioned that he did not get paid to do the UBATV show, but believes that Internet broadcasting is the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_internet.cfm |title=Bob Grant to Be Heard On UBA-TV |publisher=Bobgrantonline.com |date=July 9, 2009 |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120080701/http://bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_internet.cfm# |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_exit.cfm |title=Exit, Laughing |publisher=Bobgrantonline.com |date=July 30, 2009 |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026044505/http://bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_exit.cfm# |archive-date=2010-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in September 2009, Grant reduced ''Straight Ahead!'' from five days a week down to two (Mondays and Wednesdays from 10 to 11 a.m Eastern time). Grant also moved the show from his home to a professional studio. Due to a low number of callers to the show, Grant usually interviewed only guests for the hour. On January 13, 2010, Grant did his last UBATV show. Grant's last UBATV show and his last WOR show both fell on the date of January 13.\n\nOn September 13, 2009, Grant returned to WABC for a third stint at the station, doing a weekly Sunday talk show from noon to 2&nbsp;p.m. Grant's return to [[AM broadcasting]] allowed him to continue interacting with his fan base through greater listenership and participation than his previous internet radio show provided. At the close of his first show, he expressly thanked the management of the station for \"inviting him back\" and said he looked forward to continuing this joint venture every week for the foreseeable future. Grant issued a statement in October 2012 that his October 7 broadcast would be his last, but then rescinded that message after the show, labeling it a \"mistake\" and an attempt to grab attention. He then took off a short time for medical work, and when he returned to the air, it was for a shortened 1&nbsp;p.m. to 2&nbsp;p.m. Sunday show. Grant's show continued in its one-hour weekly format until July 28, 2013 when he permanently retired due to declining health.\n\nGrant also prepared weekly columns for his website, BobGrantOnline.com. The site was originally sponsored by [[Newsmax|NewsMax]]. The editorials ended February 19, 2013, again due to health issues.\n\n== Characteristics of Grant's radio shows ==\n\n=== Socio-political views ===\nGrant was widely considered a political conservative. In later life, he commented that \"I certainly had many beliefs you'd call conservative, but on some social issues, like abortion or gay marriage, I was more what you'd call libertarian.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=David Hinckley |title=Bob Grant, legendary New York talk radio pioneer, dead at 84 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/radio-icon-bob-grant-dead-84-article-1.1564561#ixzz2pLipuUuU |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the [[Progressivism|progressive]] media watchdog [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] accused Grant of racism and homophobia. As evidence, they highlighted his repeated use of the word \"savages\" when referring to African-Americans and statements such as \"minorities are the Big Apple's majority, you don't need the papers to tell you that, walk around and you know it.

This was a frequent debate topic between Grant and his callers over the past few years. During the fall election of 2010, Grant criticized candidates, such as [[Christine O'Donnell]], [[Rand Paul]], and [[Sharron Angle]]. Grant endorsed [[Charlie Crist]] over [[Marco Rubio]] on a July 10, 2010 broadcast for the Florida senate primary. On a May 8, 2011 broadcast, Grant informed his audience that he supported the moderate [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]] for the Republican nomination for president, although he would later go on to support [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/2011/grantmitt.cfm |title=The Two Worst Verdicts in History |publisher=Bobgrantonline.com |date=2011-11-21 |access-date=2012-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523063606/http://bobgrantonline.com/archive/2011/grantmitt.cfm# |archive-date=2013-05-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Fill-in hosts ===\nGrant was in favor of engaging hosts substituting for him while he was away on vacation to maintain his ratings.

Pyne would often end each broadcast with \"Straight Ahead\" which is something Grant picked up, leading many to believe that Grant was the first host to frequently use that line.\n\nOver the years, national radio talk personality [[Howard Stern]] has made differing remarks on his admiration for Grant as an early influence. Upon Stern's arrival in New York, he cited Grant as an influence,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2005-12/msg00347.html |title=Grant vs. Stern: animosity or respect? |publisher=Merit.edu |access-date=2010-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614121530/http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2005-12/msg00347.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 }}</ref> but as Stern's stardom rose, Grant became the subject of occasional ridicule on Stern's show. During Stern's prime, he denied being influenced by Grant or having respect for him.<ref name=\"koam.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.koam.com/haven/howard_interv.html |title=Here He Is |publisher=Koam.com |date= |access-date=2010-07-29}}</ref> Stern also criticized Grant for changing his act to appease management.<ref name=\"koam.com\" /> Grant told Paul D. Colford, author of the 1996 Stern biography, ''[[Howard Stern: King of All Media]]'', about being approached at a public appearance by Ben Stern, Howard's father, with a teenage Howard in tow. Father introduced son to Grant and told him of Howard's desire to go into radio. \"I looked at this big, gawky kid and I said to him, 'Just be yourself,'\" Grant recalled. Stern has denied Grant's version of the story.<ref name=\"koam.com\" /> Soon after Grant's firing from WABC, and before his first WOR show, Grant appeared as a call-in guest on Stern's radio show. In more recent years, Stern has praised Grant's legacy. In 2006, Stern called in to Grant's final WOR broadcast and lauded him on the air. On his January 6, 2014 [[Sirius/XM]] broadcast, while discussing Grant's death and career for the first half-hour of his show, Stern said, \"I consider him to be the best broadcaster I've ever heard.\"  Stern said, \"Bob was just this really well-informed conservative, who would often become liberal on social issues, but he had such a flair&nbsp;... he was such a broadcaster&nbsp;... he could hold your attention for hours,\" before concluding, \"Goodbye, Bob, you are the greatest broadcaster that has ever lived\".<ref>Howard Stern Show, Sirius Radio, January 6, 2014 broadcast</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/08/25/2010-08-25_stern_gives_ranking_bums_rush.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Howard Stern reacts to being ranked No. 2 by Talkers: 'There was no Rush Limbaugh til I came along' | first=David | last=Hinckley | date=August 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1137387600 |title=Some secrets are out \u2013 The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=January 16, 2006 |access-date=2010-07-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Glenn Beck]] now uses the catchphrase \"Get off my phone!\" as a spinoff of Grant's earlier call-in talk show style, as do [[Tom Scharpling]] and Mark Levin; similarly, Sean Hannity often uses Grant's phrase \"Straight ahead.\"  Rush Limbaugh early on acknowledged that Bob Grant paved the way for his success nationwide.\n\nIn 2002, industry magazine ''[[Talkers Magazine|Talkers]]'' ranked Grant as the 16th greatest radio talk show host of all time.<ref name=\"talkers2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.talkers.com/greatest/|publisher=talkers.com|title=Talkers Magazine Online|access-date=2017-03-06}}</ref>\n\nOn March 28, 2007 Bob Grant was nominated for induction into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"museum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/rhofsection.php|publisher=museum.tv|title= 2008 RHOF Inductees |access-date=2017-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Radio & Records]] had planned to issue a Lifetime Achievement Award to Grant during its annual convention in March 2008; however, the nomination was revoked in January 2008 for \"past comments by him that contradict our values and the respect we have for all members of our community.\"<ref>Rowland, Kara.

Ms. Trivia was Grant's guest at a Halloween Festival dinner held at Lauritano's Restaurant in [[The Bronx]], where a young Ms. Trivia, not long out of her teens, revealed herself for the first time to a startled radio audience, many who had expected and assumed, based upon her articulation and intonation, that she would be an elderly, prudish woman. Instead, a statuesque and fashionable Ms. Trivia, wearing an elaborate Victorian costume, was the surprise guest seated next to Grant at the dais table along with several political figures from New York. The following day the majority of calls to the show were for the purpose of obtaining information about the mysterious Mm. Trivia, with Grant in his typical manner finally in exasperation hanging up on the callers, shouting, \"THIS IS NOT Mm. TRIVIA'S SHOW!\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Mm.

On September 15, 1991, a roast honoring Grant for twenty one years of radio in New York City was held in West Orange, New Jersey.

Grant's age began to show while broadcasting at WOR. He was less engaging with the callers, and not as energetic during his broadcasts. For a time, the Bob Grant show went into national syndication, but has been a local only show since 2001. Grant and his WABC replacement [[Sean Hannity]] would sometimes throw jabs at each other. Hannity defeated Grant in the ratings from 2001 to 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wjr.com/article.asp?id=145389 |title=News/Talk 760 WJR |publisher=Wjr.com |access-date=2012-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010121835/http://www.wjr.com/article.asp?id=145389 |archivedate=2012-10-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bco44op7ArEC&pg=PA266 |title=Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism \u2013 Sean Hannity \u2013 Google Books |date= 2004-02-17|access-date=2012-11-09|isbn=978-0-06-073565-4 |last1=Hannity |first1=Sean }}</ref>\n\nGrant's WOR run ended on January 13, 2006. Grant's ratings were not to blame for his departure, according to the ''[[New York Post]]'', which mentioned that the decision was reached because the station's other shows had niche audiences to garner more advertising dollars.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} On January 16, 2006, shortly after Grant's last WOR show, Grant appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show and TV program ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'', where his former competitor paid tribute to him. Having left his options open for \"an offer he cannot refuse,\" Grant returned to WOR in February 2006, doing one minute \"Straight Ahead\" commentaries which aired twice daily after news broadcasts until September 2006. On September 8, 2006 Grant again appeared on Hannity's show to provide a post-retirement update, which led to premature rumors that Grant was returning to WABC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4482665-1.html |title=No Discussion At WABC About Rehiring Bob Grant &#124; Media & Telecommunications > Information Services from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date= |access-date=2010-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/14121/hannity-hints-grant-may-return-to-wabc-ny?ref=search |title=Hannity Hints Grant May Return To WABC/NY |publisher=AllAccess.com |date=September 11, 2006 |access-date=2010-07-29}}</ref> Grant then made various isolated radio appearances. He appeared as a guest host on WFNY (now [[WNYL (FM)|WNYL]]) on December 7, 2006, and was interviewed by attorney Anthony Macri for Macri's WOR show on February 24, 2007.\n\n=== Possible foray into politics ===\nIn 2000 Grant briefly considered running for United States Senate from New Jersey as an Independent. He went as far as creating a Draft Bob Grant Committee, but ultimately decided against entering the race. He also considered running for Mayor of New York City in the 1970s.\n\n=== Post-Retirement: Return to WABC and Internet broadcasting ===\nHis guest appearances became more frequent beginning in July 2007. On July 6, 2007, he guest hosted for [[John R. Gambling]], and appeared on [[Mark Levin]]'s show (which is networked from WABC) on July 10. Grant, guest hosted for Jerry Agar on July 9, 10, 11 and re-appeared as a fill-in host again for John Gambling on August 20 and 21. Then, on August 22, while appearing on Hannity's show, he announced that he was returning as a regular host to WABC, in the 8\u201310&nbsp;p.m. slot that at the time was filled by Agar. It would later be revealed, on what was Agar's final show a few hours later, that he would be starting effective immediately, as Grant took over the final segments of the show. His first full show on ABC since 1996 was on August 23. The story of Grant's return, as reported by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', had been discovered only a couple of hours before Grant's official announcement.\n\nGrant's stint lasted less than a year and a half, until his regular nightly show was pulled by [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in late November 2008 as part of a programming shuffle stemming from the debut of [[Curtis Sliwa]]'s national show, and later Mark Levin's show expanding to three hours, leaving no room for Grant.<ref name=\"nydn112508\">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/11/25/2008-11-25_veteran_radio_host_bob_grant_booted_from.html | title=Veteran radio host Bob Grant booted from nightly show on WABC | author=David Hinckley | publisher=[[New York Daily News]] | date=November 25, 2008}}</ref>  Grant did his most recent AM radio work as guest host filling in for Michael Savage on January 21, 2009, Mark Levin on March 23, 2009, and Sean Hannity on July 31, 2009.<ref name=\"nydn112508\" />\n\nDuring the week of July 6, 2009 Grant began hosting an [[Internet radio]] show titled ''Straight Ahead!'' which originally ran Monday through Friday from 8 to 9&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] on [[UBATV.com]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubatv.com | title=UBATV.com}}</ref> As a [[webcast]], the show differed from Grant's radio shows, in that the viewer watched Grant as he did his broadcast. The first two months of ''Straight Ahead!'' were from inside Grant's home, and were run with technical assistance from independent filmmaker Ryan O'Leary.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} New York radio personalities [[Richard Bey]] and [[Jay Diamond]] were also brought on board to broadcast their own one-hour shows. Grant mentioned that he did not get paid to do the UBATV show, but believes that Internet broadcasting is the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_internet.cfm |title=Bob Grant to Be Heard On UBA-TV |publisher=Bobgrantonline.com |date=July 9, 2009 |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120080701/http://bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_internet.cfm# |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_exit.cfm |title=Exit, Laughing |publisher=Bobgrantonline.com |date=July 30, 2009 |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026044505/http://bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_exit.cfm# |archive-date=2010-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in September 2009, Grant reduced ''Straight Ahead!'' from five days a week down to two (Mondays and Wednesdays from 10 to 11 a.m Eastern time). Grant also moved the show from his home to a professional studio. Due to a low number of callers to the show, Grant usually interviewed only guests for the hour. On January 13, 2010, Grant did his last UBATV show. Grant's last UBATV show and his last WOR show both fell on the date of January 13.\n\nOn September 13, 2009, Grant returned to WABC for a third stint at the station, doing a weekly Sunday talk show from noon to 2&nbsp;p.m. Grant's return to [[AM broadcasting]] allowed him to continue interacting with his fan base through greater listenership and participation than his previous internet radio show provided. At the close of his first show, he expressly thanked the management of the station for \"inviting him back\" and said he looked forward to continuing this joint venture every week for the foreseeable future. Grant issued a statement in October 2012 that his October 7 broadcast would be his last, but then rescinded that message after the show, labeling it a \"mistake\" and an attempt to grab attention. He then took off a short time for medical work, and when he returned to the air, it was for a shortened 1&nbsp;p.m. to 2&nbsp;p.m. Sunday show. Grant's show continued in its one-hour weekly format until July 28, 2013 when he permanently retired due to declining health.\n\nGrant also prepared weekly columns for his website, BobGrantOnline.com. The site was originally sponsored by [[Newsmax|NewsMax]]. The editorials ended February 19, 2013, again due to health issues.\n\n== Characteristics of Grant's radio shows ==\n\n=== Socio-political views ===\nGrant was widely considered a political conservative. In later life, he commented that \"I certainly had many beliefs you'd call conservative, but on some social issues, like abortion or gay marriage, I was more what you'd call libertarian.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=David Hinckley |title=Bob Grant, legendary New York talk radio pioneer, dead at 84 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/radio-icon-bob-grant-dead-84-article-1.1564561#ixzz2pLipuUuU |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the [[Progressivism|progressive]] media watchdog [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] accused Grant of racism and homophobia.

This was a frequent debate topic between Grant and his callers over the past few years. During the fall election of 2010, Grant criticized candidates, such as [[Christine O'Donnell]], [[Rand Paul]], and [[Sharron Angle]]. Grant endorsed [[Charlie Crist]] over [[Marco Rubio]] on a July 10, 2010 broadcast for the Florida senate primary. On a May 8, 2011 broadcast, Grant informed his audience that he supported the moderate [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]] for the Republican nomination for president, although he would later go on to support [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/2011/grantmitt.cfm |title=The Two Worst Verdicts in History |publisher=Bobgrantonline.com |date=2011-11-21 |access-date=2012-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523063606/http://bobgrantonline.com/archive/2011/grantmitt.cfm# |archive-date=2013-05-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Fill-in hosts ===\nGrant was in favor of engaging hosts substituting for him while he was away on vacation to maintain his ratings.

Pyne would often end each broadcast with \"Straight Ahead\" which is something Grant picked up, leading many to believe that Grant was the first host to frequently use that line.\n\nOver the years, national radio talk personality [[Howard Stern]] has made differing remarks on his admiration for Grant as an early influence. Upon Stern's arrival in New York, he cited Grant as an influence,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2005-12/msg00347.html |title=Grant vs. Stern: animosity or respect? |publisher=Merit.edu |access-date=2010-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614121530/http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2005-12/msg00347.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 }}</ref> but as Stern's stardom rose, Grant became the subject of occasional ridicule on Stern's show.

Colford, author of the 1996 Stern biography, ''[[Howard Stern: King of All Media]]'', about being approached at a public appearance by Ben Stern, Howard's father, with a teenage Howard in tow. Father introduced son to Grant and told him of Howard's desire to go into radio. \"I looked at this big, gawky kid and I said to him, 'Just be yourself,'\" Grant recalled.
