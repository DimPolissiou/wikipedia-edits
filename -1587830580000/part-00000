More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.\n\n[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.<ref>International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]</ref> During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.<ref>Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative</ref>\n\nNarrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]-play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]] and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]] and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[wikt:Sequence|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art|conceptual]].\n\nNarrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]] and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]] and [[historical fiction]]) and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and songs]], and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games or live or recorded performances). Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in the genre of [[noir fiction]]. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also \"[[Narrative#Aesthetics approach|Aesthetics approach]]\" below).\n\n== Overview ==\nA narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, \"narrative\" means \"characterized by or relating to storytelling\":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of [[narratology]] have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn Pakistan, archaeological evidences of presence of stories, are found at [[Indus valley civilization]] site [[Lothal]]. On one large vessel, the artist depicts birds with fish in their beaks, resting in a tree, while a fox-like animal stands below. This scene bears resemblance to the story of [[The Fox and the Crow]] in the [[Panchatantra]].

We are inveterate storytellers.\"<ref>Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198</ref> Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human|title=Humanities tell our stories of what it means to be human|date=2012-09-06|website=ASU Now: Access, Excellence, Impact|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322195804/https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human|archive-date=2019-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nStories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].\n\n[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different\n[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.\n\nIn ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.<ref>Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}</ref> This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:\n* What is ''text?''\n* What is its role ([[culture]])?\n* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?\n* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?\n\n== Literary theory ==\nIn literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.\n\nBut [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to \"author\") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium\u2014a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium\u2014a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70\u201376|doi=10.2307/1345003|jstor=1345003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3303802e5eed2cb51a302456fefc29541b7400a3}}</ref>\n\nOther critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116|isbn=9780190201098}}</ref> Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.\n\n==Types of narrators and their modes==\nA writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[G\u00e9rard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.\n\nMost narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).\n\n=== Multiple narrators ===\n{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}\nA writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.\n\nIn Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.<ref>Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.</ref>\n\nThe use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|journal=Marvels & Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229\u2013245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}</ref> Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.\n\nHaring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar]].<blockquote>\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" said the smith. \"I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it.\" The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of \"The Envier and the Envied\" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Aesthetics approach==\nNarrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, \"arguably the most important single component of the novel\" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, \"the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers\" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which \"addresses\" and \"interacts with\" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, \"arguing\" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Psychological approach ==\n{{see also|Narrative therapy|Narrative psychology}}\nWithin [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.<ref>Hevern, V.

In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].<ref name=Sulik />\n\nPersonality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.<ref>Hirsh, J. B., & Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.</ref> In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:\n* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;\n* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (that is, few negative comments about health/body);\n* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;\n* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;\n* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness\n\n==Social sciences approaches==\nHuman beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.\n\nSociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009) and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.\n\n===Inquiry approach===\nIn order to avoid \"hardened stories,\" or \"narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes\" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures.\"<ref name=\"conlea\">Conle, C.

Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207\u2013213.</ref> Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, that is, by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.\n\n===Mathematical sociology approach===\nIn mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as \"and\" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.<ref name=\"abell1987\">Abell.

(2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.</ref>\n\nNarratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:\n* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;\n* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;\n* A finite set of actions A;\n* A mapping of P onto A;\n\nThe structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form \"action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''\".\n\nNarratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.\n\n;Bayesian narratives\nDeveloped by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: \"action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context\". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form \"I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''\" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] \"if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''\" are notable items of evidence.<ref name=\"abell2009\" /><ref name=\"abell2011\">Abell, P.

Frazer contends that there are three primary categories of mythology (now more broadly considered categories of folklore): [[Myth]]s, [[legend]]s, and folktales, and that by definition, each genre pulls its narrative from a different ontological source, and therefore have different implications within a civilization. Frazer states:\n\n\"If these definitions be accepted, we may say that myth has its source in reason, legend in memory, and folk-tale in imagination; and that the three riper products of the human mind which correspond to these its crude creations are science, history, and romance.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=W.

It explains some natural phenomenon whose causes are not obvious, or some ritual practice whose origin has been forgotten.\" Bacon views myths as narratives that serve a practical societal function of providing a satisfactory explanation for many of humanity's greatest questions. Questions that address topics such as astronomical events, historical circumstances, environmental phenomena, and a range of human experiences including love, anger, greed, and isolation.\n# '''[[Legend]] --''' Bacon aptly describes as such, \"Legend, on the other hand, is true tradition founded on the fortunes of real people or on adventures at real places. Agamemnon, Lycurgus, Coriolanus, King Arthur, Saladin, are real people whose fame and the legends which spread it have become world-wide.\" Legends are mythical figures whose accomplishments and accolades live beyond their own mortality and transcend to the realm of myth by way of verbal communication through the ages. Like myth, they are rooted in the past, but unlike the [[sacred]] ephemeral space in which myths occur, legends are often individuals of human flesh that lived here on earth long ago, and are believed as fact. In [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]], the tale of [[Davy Crockett|Davy Crocket]] or debatably [[Paul Bunyan]] can be considered legends\u2014as they were real people who lived in our world, but through the years of regional folktales\u2014have assumed a mythological quality.\n# '''[[Folklore#Genres: the lore of folklore|Folktale]] --''' Bacon classifies folktale as such, '''\"'''Folk-tale, however, calls for no belief, being wholly the product of the imagination. In far distant ages some inventive story-teller was pleased to pass an idle hour \"with stories told of many-a-feat.\" What Bacon's definition assumes is that folktales do not possess the same underlying factualness that myths and legends tend to have. Folktales still hold a considerable cultural value, they are simply not regarded as true within a civilization. Bacon says, like myths, folktales are imagined and created by someone at some point, but differ in that folktales' primary purpose is to entertain; and that like legends, folktales may possess some element of truth in their original conception, but lack any form of credibility found in legends.\n\n=== Structure ===\nIn the absence of a known author or original narrator, myth narratives are oftentimes referred to as '''[[prose]] narratives'''. Prose narratives tend to be relatively linear regarding the time period they occur in, and are traditionally marked by its natural flow of speech as opposed to the [[Rhythm|rhythmic structure]] found in various forms of [[literature]] such as [[poetry]] and [[Haiku]]s. The structure of prose narratives allows it to be easily understood by many\u2014as the narrative generally starts at the beginning of the story, and ends when the [[protagonist]] has resolved the conflict. These kinds of narratives are generally accepted as true within society, and are told from a place of great reverence and sacredness. Myths are believed to occur in a remote past\u2014one that is before the creation or establishment of the civilization they derive from, and are intended to provide an account for things such as our origins, natural phenomenon, as well as our own human nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bascom|first=William|date=January 1965|title=The Forms of Folklore: Prose Narratives|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|language=en|volume=78|issue=307|pages=3\u201320|doi=10.2307/538099|issn=0021-8715|jstor=538099}}</ref> Thematically, myths seek to provide information about ourselves, and many are viewed as among some of the oldest forms of prose narratives, which grants traditional myths their fascinating and life defining characteristics that continue to be communicated today.\n\nAnother theory regarding the purpose and function of mythological narratives derives from 20th Century [[Philology|philologist]] [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] and his formative theory of the \"'''trifunctionalism'''\" found in [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] mythologies.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Lindahl|first=Carl|last2=Dumezil|first2=Georges|last3=Haugen|first3=Einar|date=April 1980|title=Gods of the Ancient Northmen|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|language=en|volume=93|issue=368|pages=224|doi=10.2307/541032|issn=0021-8715|jstor=541032}}</ref> Dum\u00e8zil refers only to the myths found in Indo-European societies, but the primary assertion made by his theory is that Indo European life was structured around the notion of three distinct and necessary societal functions, and as a result, the various gods and goddesses in Indo European mythology assumed these functions as well. The three functions were organized by cultural significance\u2014with the first function being the most grand and sacred. For Dum\u00e8zil, these functions were so vital, they manifested themselves in every aspect of life and were at the center of everyday life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThese \"functions\", as Dum\u00e8zil puts it, were an array of [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] knowledge and wisdom that was reflected by the mythology. The first function being [[sovereignty]]\u2014and was divided into two additional categories: magical and juridical. As each function in Dum\u00e8zil's theory corresponded to a designated social class in the human realm; the first function was the highest, and was reserved for the status of kings and other royalty. In an interview with Alain Benoist, Dum\u00e8zil described magical sovereignty as such,<blockquote>\"[Magical Sovereignty] consists of the mysterious administration, the 'magic' of the universe, the general ordering of the cosmos. This is a 'disquieting' aspect, terrifying from certain perspectives. The other aspect is more reassuring, more oriented to the human world. It is the 'juridical' part of the sovereign function.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottfried|first=Paul|date=1993-12-21|title=Alain de Benoist's Anti-Americanism|journal=Telos|language=en|volume=1993|issue=98\u201399|pages=127\u2013133|doi=10.3817/0393099127|issn=1940-459X}}</ref></blockquote>This implies that gods of the first function are responsible for the overall structure and order of the universe, and those gods who possess juridical sovereignty are more closely connected to the realm of humans and are responsible for the concept of justice and order. Dum\u00e8zil uses the pantheon of Norse [[Norse mythology|gods]] as examples of these functions in his 1981 essay\u2014he finds that the Norse gods [[Odin]] and [[T\u00fdr|Tyr]] reflect the different brands of sovereignty. Odin is the author of the cosmos, and possessor of infinite esoteric knowledge\u2014going so far as to sacrifice his eye for the accumulation of more knowledge. While Tyr\u2014seen as the \"just god\"\u2014is more concerned with upholding justice, as illustrated by the epic myth of Tyr losing his hand in exchange for the monster [[Fenrir]] to cease his terrorization of the gods. What this tells us is that through these myths, concepts of universal wisdom and justice were able to be communicated to the Nordic people in the form of a mythological narrative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alf|date=April 1990|title=Mitra-Varuna: An Essay on Two Indo-European Representations of Sovereignty. Georges Dum\u00e9zil , Derek Coltman|journal=The Journal of Religion|volume=70|issue=2|pages=295\u2013296|doi=10.1086/488388|issn=0022-4189}}</ref>\n\nThe second function as described by Dum\u00e8zil is that of the proverbial [[hero]], or [[champion]]. These myths functioned to convey the themes of heroism, strength, and bravery and were most often represented in both the human world and the mythological world by valiant warriors. While the gods of the second function were still revered in society, they did not possess the same infinite knowledge found in the first category. A Norse god that would fall under the second function would be [[Thor]]\u2014god of thunder. Thor possessed great strength, and was often first into battle, as ordered by his father Odin. This second function reflects Indo-European cultures' high regard for the warrior class, and explains the belief in an afterlife that rewards a valiant death on the battlefield; for the Norse mythology, this is represented by [[Valhalla]].\n\nLastly, Dum\u00e8zil's third function is composed of gods that reflect the nature and values of the most common people in Indo-European life. These gods often presided over the realms of healing, prosperity, fertility, wealth, luxury, and youth\u2014any kind of function that was easily related to by the common peasant farmer in a society. Just as a farmer would live and sustain themselves off their land, the gods of the third function were responsible for the prosperity of their crops, and were also in charge of other forms of everyday life that would never be observed by the status of kings and warriors, such as mischievousness and promiscuity. An example found in Norse mythology could be seen through the god [[Freyr]]\u2014a god who was closely connected to acts of debauchery and overindulging.\n\nDum\u00e8zil viewed his theory of trifunctionalism as distinct from other mythological theories because of the way the narratives of Indo-European mythology permeated into every aspect of life within these societies, to the point that the societal view of death shifted away from our primal perception that tells us to fear death, and instead death became seen as the penultimate act of heroism\u2014by solidifying your position in the hall of the gods when you pass from this realm to the next. More interestingly, however, Dum\u00e8zil proposed that his theory stood at the foundation of the modern understanding of the Christian [[Trinity]], citing that the three key deities of Odin, Thor, and Freyr were often depicted together in a trio\u2014seen by many as an overarching representation of what would be known today as \"divinity\".<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n==In cultural storytelling==\nA narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future | title=Native storytellers connect the past and the future : Native Daughters}}</ref> Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.<ref>Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.</ref>\n\nFor example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.<ref>Basso, 1984. \"Stalking with Stories\". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.</ref>\n\nIndigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life.\nAlthough storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.<ref name=\"Hodge\">Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., & Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.</ref> Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.<ref name=\"Hodge\" /> In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.<ref name=\"McDonald\">MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., D\u00e9gh, L., & [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn</ref> For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.<ref name=\"McDonald\" />\n\nNarratives are considered by the Canadian M\u00e9tis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.<ref name=\"Iseke\">Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.\nSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council.</ref> For example, the M\u00e9tis community share the \"Humorous Horse Story\" to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.<ref name=\"Iseke\"/> [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.<ref>Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology & Education Quarterly, 38: 278\u2013296.</ref> Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.<ref name=\"Iseke\"/>\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.<ref name=\"Hodge\" /> Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.<ref name=\"Hodge\" />\n\n==Historiography==\nIn [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, \"More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.\"<ref>Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History,\" ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3\u201324, quote on 13</ref>\n\nSome philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.\n\nHistorians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser, \"The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History,\" ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133\u201349; Eric H. Monkkonen, \"The Dangers of Synthesis,\" ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146\u201357.</ref>\n\n== Storytelling rights ==\nStorytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including\u2014but not limited to\u2014firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: \u201cthe important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521328463|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520|url=https://archive.org/details/storytellingrigh00shum}}</ref>\n\nThe ethics of retelling other people's stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story's purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling\u2014and retelling\u2014can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.\n\n[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of personal experience narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.\n\n==Other specific applications==\n* [[Narrative environment]] is a contested term <ref>The Art of Narrative [http://www.urgentessaywriting.com/blog/become-a-master-of-a-narrative-essay-topics-examples-tips Mastering the Narrative Essay Style of Writing]</ref> that has been used for techniques of architectural or exhibition design in which 'stories are told in space' and also for the [[Virtuality|virtual]] environments in which computer games are played and which are invented by the computer game authors.\n* [[Narrative film]] usually uses images and sounds on film (or, more recently, on analogue or digital [[video]] media) to convey a story. Narrative film is usually thought of in terms of [[fiction]] but it may also assemble stories from filmed reality, as in some [[documentary film]], but narrative film may also use [[animation]].\n* [[Narrative history]] is a genre of factual historical writing that uses [[chronology]] as its framework (as opposed to a thematic treatment of a historical subject).\n* [[Narrative poetry]] is poetry that tells a story.\n* [[Metanarrative]], sometimes also known as master- or grand narrative, is a higher-level cultural narrative [[Model (abstract)|schema]] which orders and explains knowledge and experience you've had in life. Similar to metanarrative are masterplots or  \u201crecurrent skeletal stories, belonging to cultures and individuals that play a powerful role in questions of identity, values, and the understanding of life.\u201d<ref>H.

Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative</ref>\n\nNarrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]-play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]] and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]] and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[wikt:Sequence|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art|conceptual]].\n\nNarrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]] and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]] and [[historical fiction]]) and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and songs]], and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games or live or recorded performances). Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in the genre of [[noir fiction]]. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also \"[[Narrative#Aesthetics approach|Aesthetics approach]]\" below).\n\n== Overview ==\nA narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, \"narrative\" means \"characterized by or relating to storytelling\":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of [[narratology]] have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn Pakistan, archaeological evidences of presence of stories, are found at [[Indus valley civilization]] site [[Lothal]]. On one large vessel, the artist depicts birds with fish in their beaks, resting in a tree, while a fox-like animal stands below. This scene bears resemblance to the story of [[The Fox and the Crow]] in the [[Panchatantra]]. On a miniature jar, the story of [[the thirsty crow]] and deer is depicted \u2013 of how the deer could not drink from the narrow-mouth of the jar, while the crow succeeded by dropping stones in the jar. The features of the animals are clear and graceful.<ref>S. R. Rao (1985). Lothal. Archaeological Survey of India. p. 46.</ref><ref>Amalananda Ghosh\nE.J. Brill, (1990). An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology: Subjects. pp- 83</ref>\n\n==Human nature==\n[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, \"Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers.\"<ref>Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198</ref> Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human|title=Humanities tell our stories of what it means to be human|date=2012-09-06|website=ASU Now: Access, Excellence, Impact|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322195804/https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human|archive-date=2019-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nStories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].\n\n[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different\n[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.\n\nIn ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.<ref>Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}</ref> This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:\n* What is ''text?''\n* What is its role ([[culture]])?\n* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?\n* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?\n\n== Literary theory ==\nIn literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.\n\nBut [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to \"author\") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium\u2014a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium\u2014a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70\u201376|doi=10.2307/1345003|jstor=1345003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3303802e5eed2cb51a302456fefc29541b7400a3}}</ref>\n\nOther critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116|isbn=9780190201098}}</ref> Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.\n\n==Types of narrators and their modes==\nA writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[G\u00e9rard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.\n\nMost narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).\n\n=== Multiple narrators ===\n{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}\nA writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.\n\nIn Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.<ref>Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.</ref>\n\nThe use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|journal=Marvels & Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229\u2013245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}</ref> Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.\n\nHaring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar]].<blockquote>\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" said the smith. \"I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it.\" The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of \"The Envier and the Envied\" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Aesthetics approach==\nNarrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, \"arguably the most important single component of the novel\" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, \"the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers\" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which \"addresses\" and \"interacts with\" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, \"arguing\" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Psychological approach ==\n{{see also|Narrative therapy|Narrative psychology}}\nWithin [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.<ref>Hevern, V.

In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].<ref name=Sulik />\n\nPersonality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.<ref>Hirsh, J. B., & Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.</ref> In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:\n* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;\n* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (that is, few negative comments about health/body);\n* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;\n* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;\n* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness\n\n==Social sciences approaches==\nHuman beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.\n\nSociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009) and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.\n\n===Inquiry approach===\nIn order to avoid \"hardened stories,\" or \"narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes\" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures.\"<ref name=\"conlea\">Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49\u201362.</ref><ref name=\"bell\">Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207\u2013213.</ref> Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, that is, by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.\n\n===Mathematical sociology approach===\nIn mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as \"and\" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.<ref name=\"abell1987\">Abell.

(2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.</ref>\n\nNarratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:\n* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;\n* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;\n* A finite set of actions A;\n* A mapping of P onto A;\n\nThe structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form \"action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''\".\n\nNarratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.\n\n;Bayesian narratives\nDeveloped by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: \"action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context\". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form \"I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''\" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] \"if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''\" are notable items of evidence.<ref name=\"abell2009\" /><ref name=\"abell2011\">Abell, P.

Instead, film narratives utilize visual and auditory devices in substitution for a narrative subject; these devices include [[cinematography]], [[Film editing|editing]], [[sound design]] (both [[Diegetic music|diegetic]] and non-diegetic sound), as well as the arrangement and decisions on how and where the subjects are located onscreen\u2014known as [[Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne|''mise-en-sc\u00e8ne.'']] These cinematic devices, among others, contribute to the unique blend of visual and auditory storytelling that culminates to what Jose Landa refers to as a \"visual narrative instance\".<ref>{{Citation|last=LANDA|first=JOS\u00c9 \u00c1NGEL GARC\u00cdA|chapter=Overhearing Narrative|publisher=DE GRUYTER|isbn=9783110922646|doi=10.1515/9783110922646.191|title=The Dynamics of Narrative Form|year=2004}}</ref> And unlike narratives found in other performance arts such as plays and musicals, film narratives are not bound to a specific place and time, and are not limited by scene [[wikt:Transition|transitions]] in plays, which are restricted by set design and allotted time.\n\n== In mythology ==\nThe nature or existence of a formative narrative in many of the world's [[myth]]s, [[Folklore#Genres: the lore of folklore|folktales]], and [[legend]]s has been a topic of debate for many modern scholars; but the most common consensus among academics is that throughout most cultures, traditional mythologies and folklore tales are constructed and retold with a specific narrative purpose that serves to offer a society an understandable explanation of natural phenomenon\u2014oftentimes absent of a verifiable [[author]]. These explanatory tales manifest themselves in various forms and serve different societal functions, including; life lessons individuals to learn from (for example, the Ancient Greek tale of [[Icarus]] refusing to listen to his elders and flying too close to the sun), explain forces of nature or other natural phenomenon (for example, the [[flood myth]] that spans cultures all over the world),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Stuart|date=July 2006|title=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology2006261David Leeming.

Frazer contends that there are three primary categories of mythology (now more broadly considered categories of folklore): [[Myth]]s, [[legend]]s, and folktales, and that by definition, each genre pulls its narrative from a different ontological source, and therefore have different implications within a civilization. Frazer states:\n\n\"If these definitions be accepted, we may say that myth has its source in reason, legend in memory, and folk-tale in imagination; and that the three riper products of the human mind which correspond to these its crude creations are science, history, and romance.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=W.

It explains some natural phenomenon whose causes are not obvious, or some ritual practice whose origin has been forgotten.\" Bacon views myths as narratives that serve a practical societal function of providing a satisfactory explanation for many of humanity's greatest questions. Questions that address topics such as astronomical events, historical circumstances, environmental phenomena, and a range of human experiences including love, anger, greed, and isolation.\n# '''[[Legend]] --''' Bacon aptly describes as such, \"Legend, on the other hand, is true tradition founded on the fortunes of real people or on adventures at real places. Agamemnon, Lycurgus, Coriolanus, King Arthur, Saladin, are real people whose fame and the legends which spread it have become world-wide.\" Legends are mythical figures whose accomplishments and accolades live beyond their own mortality and transcend to the realm of myth by way of verbal communication through the ages. Like myth, they are rooted in the past, but unlike the [[sacred]] ephemeral space in which myths occur, legends are often individuals of human flesh that lived here on earth long ago, and are believed as fact. In [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]], the tale of [[Davy Crockett|Davy Crocket]] or debatably [[Paul Bunyan]] can be considered legends\u2014as they were real people who lived in our world, but through the years of regional folktales\u2014have assumed a mythological quality.\n# '''[[Folklore#Genres: the lore of folklore|Folktale]] --''' Bacon classifies folktale as such, '''\"'''Folk-tale, however, calls for no belief, being wholly the product of the imagination. In far distant ages some inventive story-teller was pleased to pass an idle hour \"with stories told of many-a-feat.\" What Bacon's definition assumes is that folktales do not possess the same underlying factualness that myths and legends tend to have. Folktales still hold a considerable cultural value, they are simply not regarded as true within a civilization. Bacon says, like myths, folktales are imagined and created by someone at some point, but differ in that folktales' primary purpose is to entertain; and that like legends, folktales may possess some element of truth in their original conception, but lack any form of credibility found in legends.\n\n=== Structure ===\nIn the absence of a known author or original narrator, myth narratives are oftentimes referred to as '''[[prose]] narratives'''. Prose narratives tend to be relatively linear regarding the time period they occur in, and are traditionally marked by its natural flow of speech as opposed to the [[Rhythm|rhythmic structure]] found in various forms of [[literature]] such as [[poetry]] and [[Haiku]]s. The structure of prose narratives allows it to be easily understood by many\u2014as the narrative generally starts at the beginning of the story, and ends when the [[protagonist]] has resolved the conflict. These kinds of narratives are generally accepted as true within society, and are told from a place of great reverence and sacredness. Myths are believed to occur in a remote past\u2014one that is before the creation or establishment of the civilization they derive from, and are intended to provide an account for things such as our origins, natural phenomenon, as well as our own human nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bascom|first=William|date=January 1965|title=The Forms of Folklore: Prose Narratives|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|language=en|volume=78|issue=307|pages=3\u201320|doi=10.2307/538099|issn=0021-8715|jstor=538099}}</ref> Thematically, myths seek to provide information about ourselves, and many are viewed as among some of the oldest forms of prose narratives, which grants traditional myths their fascinating and life defining characteristics that continue to be communicated today.\n\nAnother theory regarding the purpose and function of mythological narratives derives from 20th Century [[Philology|philologist]] [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] and his formative theory of the \"'''trifunctionalism'''\" found in [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] mythologies.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Lindahl|first=Carl|last2=Dumezil|first2=Georges|last3=Haugen|first3=Einar|date=April 1980|title=Gods of the Ancient Northmen|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|language=en|volume=93|issue=368|pages=224|doi=10.2307/541032|issn=0021-8715|jstor=541032}}</ref> Dum\u00e8zil refers only to the myths found in Indo-European societies, but the primary assertion made by his theory is that Indo European life was structured around the notion of three distinct and necessary societal functions, and as a result, the various gods and goddesses in Indo European mythology assumed these functions as well. The three functions were organized by cultural significance\u2014with the first function being the most grand and sacred. For Dum\u00e8zil, these functions were so vital, they manifested themselves in every aspect of life and were at the center of everyday life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThese \"functions\", as Dum\u00e8zil puts it, were an array of [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] knowledge and wisdom that was reflected by the mythology. The first function being [[sovereignty]]\u2014and was divided into two additional categories: magical and juridical. As each function in Dum\u00e8zil's theory corresponded to a designated social class in the human realm; the first function was the highest, and was reserved for the status of kings and other royalty. In an interview with Alain Benoist, Dum\u00e8zil described magical sovereignty as such,<blockquote>\"[Magical Sovereignty] consists of the mysterious administration, the 'magic' of the universe, the general ordering of the cosmos. This is a 'disquieting' aspect, terrifying from certain perspectives. The other aspect is more reassuring, more oriented to the human world. It is the 'juridical' part of the sovereign function.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottfried|first=Paul|date=1993-12-21|title=Alain de Benoist's Anti-Americanism|journal=Telos|language=en|volume=1993|issue=98\u201399|pages=127\u2013133|doi=10.3817/0393099127|issn=1940-459X}}</ref></blockquote>This implies that gods of the first function are responsible for the overall structure and order of the universe, and those gods who possess juridical sovereignty are more closely connected to the realm of humans and are responsible for the concept of justice and order. Dum\u00e8zil uses the pantheon of Norse [[Norse mythology|gods]] as examples of these functions in his 1981 essay\u2014he finds that the Norse gods [[Odin]] and [[T\u00fdr|Tyr]] reflect the different brands of sovereignty. Odin is the author of the cosmos, and possessor of infinite esoteric knowledge\u2014going so far as to sacrifice his eye for the accumulation of more knowledge. While Tyr\u2014seen as the \"just god\"\u2014is more concerned with upholding justice, as illustrated by the epic myth of Tyr losing his hand in exchange for the monster [[Fenrir]] to cease his terrorization of the gods. What this tells us is that through these myths, concepts of universal wisdom and justice were able to be communicated to the Nordic people in the form of a mythological narrative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alf|date=April 1990|title=Mitra-Varuna: An Essay on Two Indo-European Representations of Sovereignty. Georges Dum\u00e9zil , Derek Coltman|journal=The Journal of Religion|volume=70|issue=2|pages=295\u2013296|doi=10.1086/488388|issn=0022-4189}}</ref>\n\nThe second function as described by Dum\u00e8zil is that of the proverbial [[hero]], or [[champion]]. These myths functioned to convey the themes of heroism, strength, and bravery and were most often represented in both the human world and the mythological world by valiant warriors. While the gods of the second function were still revered in society, they did not possess the same infinite knowledge found in the first category. A Norse god that would fall under the second function would be [[Thor]]\u2014god of thunder. Thor possessed great strength, and was often first into battle, as ordered by his father Odin. This second function reflects Indo-European cultures' high regard for the warrior class, and explains the belief in an afterlife that rewards a valiant death on the battlefield; for the Norse mythology, this is represented by [[Valhalla]].\n\nLastly, Dum\u00e8zil's third function is composed of gods that reflect the nature and values of the most common people in Indo-European life. These gods often presided over the realms of healing, prosperity, fertility, wealth, luxury, and youth\u2014any kind of function that was easily related to by the common peasant farmer in a society. Just as a farmer would live and sustain themselves off their land, the gods of the third function were responsible for the prosperity of their crops, and were also in charge of other forms of everyday life that would never be observed by the status of kings and warriors, such as mischievousness and promiscuity. An example found in Norse mythology could be seen through the god [[Freyr]]\u2014a god who was closely connected to acts of debauchery and overindulging.\n\nDum\u00e8zil viewed his theory of trifunctionalism as distinct from other mythological theories because of the way the narratives of Indo-European mythology permeated into every aspect of life within these societies, to the point that the societal view of death shifted away from our primal perception that tells us to fear death, and instead death became seen as the penultimate act of heroism\u2014by solidifying your position in the hall of the gods when you pass from this realm to the next. More interestingly, however, Dum\u00e8zil proposed that his theory stood at the foundation of the modern understanding of the Christian [[Trinity]], citing that the three key deities of Odin, Thor, and Freyr were often depicted together in a trio\u2014seen by many as an overarching representation of what would be known today as \"divinity\".<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n==In cultural storytelling==\nA narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future | title=Native storytellers connect the past and the future : Native Daughters}}</ref> Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.<ref>Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.</ref>\n\nFor example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.<ref>Basso, 1984. \"Stalking with Stories\". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.</ref>\n\nIndigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life.\nAlthough storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.<ref name=\"Hodge\">Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., & Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.

(1998).

J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology & Education Quarterly, 38: 278\u2013296.</ref> Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.<ref name=\"Iseke\"/>\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.<ref name=\"Hodge\" /> Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.<ref name=\"Hodge\" />\n\n==Historiography==\nIn [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, \"More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.\"<ref>Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History,\" ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3\u201324, quote on 13</ref>\n\nSome philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.\n\nHistorians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser, \"The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History,\" ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133\u201349; Eric H. Monkkonen, \"The Dangers of Synthesis,\" ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146\u201357.</ref>\n\n== Storytelling rights ==\nStorytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including\u2014but not limited to\u2014firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: \u201cthe important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521328463|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520|url=https://archive.org/details/storytellingrigh00shum}}</ref>\n\nThe ethics of retelling other people's stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story's purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling\u2014and retelling\u2014can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.\n\n[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of personal experience narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.\n\n==Other specific applications==\n* [[Narrative environment]] is a contested term <ref>The Art of Narrative [http://www.urgentessaywriting.com/blog/become-a-master-of-a-narrative-essay-topics-examples-tips Mastering the Narrative Essay Style of Writing]</ref> that has been used for techniques of architectural or exhibition design in which 'stories are told in space' and also for the [[Virtuality|virtual]] environments in which computer games are played and which are invented by the computer game authors.\n* [[Narrative film]] usually uses images and sounds on film (or, more recently, on analogue or digital [[video]] media) to convey a story. Narrative film is usually thought of in terms of [[fiction]] but it may also assemble stories from filmed reality, as in some [[documentary film]], but narrative film may also use [[animation]].\n* [[Narrative history]] is a genre of factual historical writing that uses [[chronology]] as its framework (as opposed to a thematic treatment of a historical subject).\n* [[Narrative poetry]] is poetry that tells a story.\n* [[Metanarrative]], sometimes also known as master- or grand narrative, is a higher-level cultural narrative [[Model (abstract)|schema]] which orders and explains knowledge and experience you've had in life. Similar to metanarrative are masterplots or  \u201crecurrent skeletal stories, belonging to cultures and individuals that play a powerful role in questions of identity, values, and the understanding of life.\u201d<ref>H.

It performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in [[big O notation|O]](log n) [[amortized analysis|amortized]] time. For many sequences of non-random operations, splay trees perform better than other search trees, even when the specific pattern of the sequence is unknown.  The splay tree was invented by [[Daniel Sleator]] and [[Robert Tarjan]] in 1985.<ref name=\"SleatorTarjan\">{{harvnb|Sleator|Tarjan|1985}}.</ref>\n\nAll normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one basic operation, called ''splaying''. Splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree.  One way to do this with the basic search operation is to first perform a standard binary tree search for the element in question, and then use [[tree rotation]]s in a specific fashion to bring the element to the top. Alternatively, a top-down algorithm can combine the search and the tree reorganization into a single phase.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\nGood performance for a splay tree depends on the fact that it is self-optimizing, in that frequently accessed nodes will move nearer to the root where they can be accessed more quickly. The worst-case height\u2014though unlikely\u2014is O(n), with the average being O(log ''n'').\nHaving frequently-used nodes near the root is an advantage for many practical applications (also see [[Locality of reference]]), and is particularly useful for implementing [[cache (computing)|cache]]s and [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] algorithms.\n\nAdvantages include:\n* Comparable performance: Average-case performance is as efficient as other trees.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|Tamassia|Goldwasser|2014}}.</ref>\n* Small memory footprint: Splay trees do not need to store any bookkeeping data.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n\nThe most significant disadvantage of splay trees is that the height of a splay tree can be linear.  For example, this will be the case after accessing all ''n'' elements in non-decreasing order.  Since the height of a tree corresponds to the worst-case access time, this means that the actual cost of an operation can be high. However the [[amortized]] access cost of this worst case is logarithmic, O(log ''n'').  Also, the expected access cost can be reduced to O(log ''n'') by using a randomized variant.<ref>{{harvnb|Albers|Karpinski|2002}}.</ref>\n\nThe representation of splay trees can change even when they are accessed in a 'read-only' manner (i.e. by ''find'' operations).  This complicates the use of such splay trees in a multi-threaded environment.  Specifically, extra management is needed if multiple threads are allowed to perform ''find'' operations concurrently. This also makes them unsuitable for general use in purely functional programming, although even there they can be used in limited ways to implement priority queues.\n\n== Operations ==\n\n=== Splaying ===\nWhen a node ''x'' is accessed, a splay operation is performed on ''x'' to move it to the root. To perform a splay operation we carry out a sequence of ''splay steps'', each of which moves ''x'' closer to the root. By performing a splay operation on the node of interest after every access, the recently accessed nodes are kept near the root and the tree remains roughly balanced, so that we achieve the desired amortized time bounds.\n\nEach particular step depends on three factors:\n* Whether ''x'' is the left or right child of its parent node, ''p'',\n* whether ''p'' is the root or not, and if not\n* whether ''p'' is the left or right child of ''its'' parent, ''g'' (the ''grandparent'' of x).\n\nIt is important to remember to set ''gg'' (the ''great-grandparent'' of x) to now point to x after any splay operation. If ''gg'' is null, then x obviously is now the root and must be updated as such.\n\nThere are three types of splay steps, each of which has two symmetric variants: left- and right-handed. For the sake of brevity, only one of these two is shown for each type. (In the following diagrams, circles indicate nodes of interest and triangles indicate single nodes or sub-trees.)  The three types of splay steps are:\n\n'''Zig step:''' this step is done when ''p'' is the root. The tree is rotated on the edge between ''x'' and ''p''.  Zig steps exist to deal with the parity issue and will be done only as the last step in a splay operation and only when ''x'' has odd depth at the beginning of the operation.\n\n[[File:splay tree zig.svg|center]]\n\n'''Zig-zig step:''' this step is done when ''p'' is not the root and ''x'' and ''p'' are either both right children or are both left children. The picture below shows the case where ''x'' and ''p'' are both left children. The tree is rotated on the edge joining ''p'' with ''its'' parent ''g'', then rotated on the edge joining ''x'' with ''p''. Note that zig-zig steps are the only thing that differentiate splay trees from the ''rotate to root'' method introduced by Allen and Munro<ref name=\"AllenMunro\">{{harvnb|Allen|Munro|1978}}.</ref> prior to the introduction of splay trees.\n\n[[Image:Zigzig.gif|center]]\n\n'''Zig-zag step:''' this step is done when ''p'' is not the root and ''x'' is a right child and ''p'' is a left child or vice versa. The tree is rotated on the edge between ''p'' and x, and then rotated on the resulting edge between ''x'' and g.\n\n[[Image:Zigzag.gif|center]]\n\n=== Join ===\nGiven two trees S and T such that all elements of S are smaller than the elements of T, the following steps can be used to join them to a single tree:\n* Splay the largest item in S. Now this item is in the root of S and has a null right child. \n* Set the right child of the new root to T.\n\n=== Split ===\nGiven a tree and an element ''x'', return two new trees: one containing all elements less than or equal to ''x'' and the other containing all elements greater than ''x''. This can be done in the following way:\n* Splay ''x''. Now it is in the root so the tree to its left contains all elements smaller than ''x'' and the tree to its right contains all element larger than ''x''. \n* Split the right subtree from the rest of the tree.\n\n=== Insertion ===\nTo insert a value ''x'' into a splay tree:\n* Insert ''x'' as with a normal [[binary search tree]].\n* when an item is inserted, a splay is performed.\n* As a result, the newly inserted node ''x'' becomes the root of the tree.\n\nAlternatively:\n* Use the split operation to split the tree at the value of ''x'' to two sub-trees: S and T.\n* Create a new tree in which ''x'' is the root, S is its left sub-tree and T its right sub-tree.\n\n=== Deletion ===\nTo delete a node ''x'', use the same method as with a binary search tree:\n\n* If ''x'' has two children:\n** Swap its value with that of either the rightmost node of its left sub tree (its in-order predecessor) or the leftmost node of its right subtree (its in-order successor).\n** Remove that node instead.\n\nIn this way, deletion is reduced to the problem of removing a node with 0 or 1 children. Unlike a binary search tree, in a splay tree after deletion, we splay the parent of the removed node to the top of the tree.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n* The node to be deleted is first splayed, i.e. brought to the root of the tree and then deleted.  leaves the tree with two sub trees. \n* The two sub-trees are then joined using a \"join\" operation.\n\n== Implementation and variants ==\nSplaying, as mentioned above, is performed during a second, bottom-up pass over the access path of a node. It is possible to record the access path during the first pass for use during the second, but that requires extra space during the access operation.  Another alternative is to keep a parent pointer in every node, which avoids the need for extra space during access operations but may reduce overall time efficiency because of the need to update those pointers.<ref name=\"SleatorTarjan\" />\n\nAnother method which can be used is based on the argument that we can restructure the tree on our way down the access path instead of making a second pass. This top-down splaying routine uses three sets of nodes - left tree, right tree and middle tree. The first two contain all items of original tree known to be less than or greater than current item respectively. The middle tree consists of the sub-tree rooted at the current node. These three sets are updated down the access path while keeping the splay operations in check. Another method, semisplaying, modifies the zig-zig case to reduce the amount of restructuring done in all operations.<ref name=\"SleatorTarjan\" /><ref name=\"Lucas\" />\n\nBelow there is an implementation of splay trees in C++, which uses pointers to represent each node on the tree. This implementation is based on bottom-up splaying version and uses the second method of deletion on a splay tree.  Also, unlike the above definition, this C++ version does ''not'' splay the tree on finds - it only splays on insertions and deletions, and the find operation, therefore, has linear time complexity.\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <functional>\n\n#ifndef SPLAY_TREE\n#define SPLAY_TREE\n\ntemplate<typename T, typename Comp = std::less<T>>\nclass splay_tree {\nprivate:\n  Comp comp;\n  unsigned long p_size;\n  \n  struct node {\n    node *left, *right;\n    node *parent;\n    T key;\n    node(const T& init = T()) : left(nullptr), right(nullptr), parent(nullptr), key(init) { }\n    ~node() {\n\n    }\n  } *root;\n  \n  void left_rotate(node *x) {\n    node *y = x->right;\n    if (y) {\n      x->right = y->left;\n      if (y->left) y->left->parent = x;\n      y->parent = x->parent;\n    }\n    \n    if (!x->parent) root = y;\n    else if (x == x->parent->left) x->parent->left = y;\n    else x->parent->right = y;\n    if (y) y->left = x;\n    x->parent = y;\n  }\n  \n  void right_rotate(node *x) {\n    node *y = x->left;\n    if (y) {\n      x->left = y->right;\n      if (y->right) y->right->parent = x;\n      y->parent = x->parent;\n    }\n    if (!x->parent) root = y;\n    else if (x == x->parent->left) x->parent->left = y;\n    else x->parent->right = y;\n    if (y) y->right = x;\n    x->parent = y;\n  }\n  \n  void splay(node *x) {\n    while (x->parent) {\n      if (!x->parent->parent) {\n        if (x->parent->left == x) right_rotate(x->parent);\n        else left_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else if (x->parent->left == x && x->parent->parent->left == x->parent) {\n        right_rotate(x->parent->parent);\n        right_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else if (x->parent->right == x && x->parent->parent->right == x->parent) {\n        left_rotate(x->parent->parent);\n        left_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else if (x->parent->left == x && x->parent->parent->right == x->parent) {\n        right_rotate(x->parent);\n        left_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else {\n        left_rotate(x->parent);\n        right_rotate(x->parent);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  void replace(node *u, node *v) {\n    if (!u->parent) root = v;\n    else if (u == u->parent->left) u->parent->left = v;\n    else u->parent->right = v;\n    if (v) v->parent = u->parent;\n  }\n  \n  node* subtree_minimum(node *u) {\n    while (u->left) u = u->left;\n    return u;\n  }\n  \n  node* subtree_maximum(node *u) {\n    while (u->right) u = u->right;\n    return u;\n  }\npublic:\n  splay_tree() : root(nullptr), p_size(0) { }\n  \n  void insert(const T &key) {\n    node *z = root;\n    node *p = nullptr;\n    \n    while (z) {\n      p = z;\n      if (comp(z->key, key)) z = z->right;\n      else z = z->left;\n    }\n    \n    z = new node(key);\n    z->parent = p;\n    \n    if (!p) root = z;\n    else if (comp(p->key, z->key)) p->right = z;\n    else p->left = z;\n    \n    splay(z);\n    p_size++;\n  }\n  \n  node* find(const T &key) {\n    node *z = root;\n    while (z) {\n      if (comp(z->key, key)) z = z->right;\n      else if (comp(key, z->key)) z = z->left;\n      else return z;\n    }\n    return nullptr;\n  }\n        \n  void erase(const T &key) {\n    node *z = find(key);\n    if (!z) return;\n    \n    splay(z);\n    \n    if (!z->left) replace(z, z->right);\n    else if (!z->right) replace(z, z->left);\n    else {\n      node *y = subtree_minimum(z->right);\n      if (y->parent != z) {\n        replace(y, y->right);\n        y->right = z->right;\n        y->right->parent = y;\n      }\n      replace(z, y);\n      y->left = z->left;\n      y->left->parent = y;\n    }\n    \n    delete z;\n    p_size--;\n  }\n\n/* //the alternative implementation\n    void erase(const T &key) {\n        node *z = find(key);\n        if (!z) return;\n        \n        splay(z);\n        \n        node *s = z->left;\n        node *t = z->right;\n        delete z;\n        \n        node *sMax = NULL;\n        if (s) {\n            s->parent = NULL;\n            sMax = subtree_maximum(s);\n            splay(sMax);\n            root = sMax;\n        }\n        if (t) {\n            if (s)\n                sMax->right = t;\n            else\n                root = t;\n            t->parent = sMax;\n        }\n        \n        p_size--;\n    }\n*/\n  \n  const T& minimum() { return subtree_minimum(root)->key; }\n  const T& maximum() { return subtree_maximum(root)->key; }\n  \n  bool empty() const { return root == nullptr; }\n  unsigned long size() const { return p_size; }\n};\n\n#endif // SPLAY_TREE\n</source>\n\n== Analysis ==\nA simple [[amortized analysis]] of static splay trees can be carried out using the [[potential method]].

It performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in [[big O notation|O]](log n) [[amortized analysis|amortized]] time. For many sequences of non-random operations, splay trees perform better than other search trees, even when the specific pattern of the sequence is unknown.  The splay tree was invented by [[Daniel Sleator]] and [[Robert Tarjan]] in 1985.<ref name=\"SleatorTarjan\">{{harvnb|Sleator|Tarjan|1985}}.</ref>\n\nAll normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one basic operation, called ''splaying''. Splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree.  One way to do this with the basic search operation is to first perform a standard binary tree search for the element in question, and then use [[tree rotation]]s in a specific fashion to bring the element to the top. Alternatively, a top-down algorithm can combine the search and the tree reorganization into a single phase.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\nGood performance for a splay tree depends on the fact that it is self-optimizing, in that frequently accessed nodes will move nearer to the root where they can be accessed more quickly. The worst-case height\u2014though unlikely\u2014is O(n), with the average being O(log ''n'').\nHaving frequently-used nodes near the root is an advantage for many practical applications (also see [[Locality of reference]]), and is particularly useful for implementing [[cache (computing)|cache]]s and [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] algorithms.\n\nAdvantages include:\n* Comparable performance: Average-case performance is as efficient as other trees.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|Tamassia|Goldwasser|2014}}.</ref>\n* Small memory footprint: Splay trees do not need to store any bookkeeping data.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n\nThe most significant disadvantage of splay trees is that the height of a splay tree can be linear.  For example, this will be the case after accessing all ''n'' elements in non-decreasing order.  Since the height of a tree corresponds to the worst-case access time, this means that the actual cost of an operation can be high. However the [[amortized]] access cost of this worst case is logarithmic, O(log ''n'').  Also, the expected access cost can be reduced to O(log ''n'') by using a randomized variant.<ref>{{harvnb|Albers|Karpinski|2002}}.</ref>\n\nThe representation of splay trees can change even when they are accessed in a 'read-only' manner (i.e. by ''find'' operations).  This complicates the use of such splay trees in a multi-threaded environment.  Specifically, extra management is needed if multiple threads are allowed to perform ''find'' operations concurrently. This also makes them unsuitable for general use in purely functional programming, although even there they can be used in limited ways to implement priority queues.\n\n== Operations ==\n\n=== Splaying ===\nWhen a node ''x'' is accessed, a splay operation is performed on ''x'' to move it to the root. To perform a splay operation we carry out a sequence of ''splay steps'', each of which moves ''x'' closer to the root. By performing a splay operation on the node of interest after every access, the recently accessed nodes are kept near the root and the tree remains roughly balanced, so that we achieve the desired amortized time bounds.\n\nEach particular step depends on three factors:\n* Whether ''x'' is the left or right child of its parent node, ''p'',\n* whether ''p'' is the root or not, and if not\n* whether ''p'' is the left or right child of ''its'' parent, ''g'' (the ''grandparent'' of x).\n\nIt is important to remember to set ''gg'' (the ''great-grandparent'' of x) to now point to x after any splay operation. If ''gg'' is null, then x obviously is now the root and must be updated as such.\n\nThere are three types of splay steps, each of which has two symmetric variants: left- and right-handed. For the sake of brevity, only one of these two is shown for each type. These three types are:\n\n'''Zig step:''' this step is done when ''p'' is the root. The tree is rotated on the edge between ''x'' and ''p''.  Zig steps exist to deal with the parity issue and will be done only as the last step in a splay operation and only when ''x'' has odd depth at the beginning of the operation.\n\n[[File:splay tree zig.svg|center]]\n\n'''Zig-zig step:''' this step is done when ''p'' is not the root and ''x'' and ''p'' are either both right children or are both left children. The picture below shows the case where ''x'' and ''p'' are both left children. The tree is rotated on the edge joining ''p'' with ''its'' parent ''g'', then rotated on the edge joining ''x'' with ''p''. Note that zig-zig steps are the only thing that differentiate splay trees from the ''rotate to root'' method introduced by Allen and Munro<ref name=\"AllenMunro\">{{harvnb|Allen|Munro|1978}}.</ref> prior to the introduction of splay trees.\n\n[[Image:Zigzig.gif|center]]\n\n'''Zig-zag step:''' this step is done when ''p'' is not the root and ''x'' is a right child and ''p'' is a left child or vice versa. The tree is rotated on the edge between ''p'' and x, and then rotated on the resulting edge between ''x'' and g.\n\n[[Image:Zigzag.gif|center]]\n\n=== Join ===\nGiven two trees S and T such that all elements of S are smaller than the elements of T, the following steps can be used to join them to a single tree:\n* Splay the largest item in S. Now this item is in the root of S and has a null right child. \n* Set the right child of the new root to T.\n\n=== Split ===\nGiven a tree and an element ''x'', return two new trees: one containing all elements less than or equal to ''x'' and the other containing all elements greater than ''x''. This can be done in the following way:\n* Splay ''x''. Now it is in the root so the tree to its left contains all elements smaller than ''x'' and the tree to its right contains all element larger than ''x''. \n* Split the right subtree from the rest of the tree.\n\n=== Insertion ===\nTo insert a value ''x'' into a splay tree:\n* Insert ''x'' as with a normal [[binary search tree]].\n* when an item is inserted, a splay is performed.\n* As a result, the newly inserted node ''x'' becomes the root of the tree.\n\nAlternatively:\n* Use the split operation to split the tree at the value of ''x'' to two sub-trees: S and T.\n* Create a new tree in which ''x'' is the root, S is its left sub-tree and T its right sub-tree.\n\n=== Deletion ===\nTo delete a node ''x'', use the same method as with a binary search tree:\n\n* If ''x'' has two children:\n** Swap its value with that of either the rightmost node of its left sub tree (its in-order predecessor) or the leftmost node of its right subtree (its in-order successor).\n** Remove that node instead.\n\nIn this way, deletion is reduced to the problem of removing a node with 0 or 1 children. Unlike a binary search tree, in a splay tree after deletion, we splay the parent of the removed node to the top of the tree.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n* The node to be deleted is first splayed, i.e. brought to the root of the tree and then deleted.  leaves the tree with two sub trees. \n* The two sub-trees are then joined using a \"join\" operation.\n\n== Implementation and variants ==\nSplaying, as mentioned above, is performed during a second, bottom-up pass over the access path of a node. It is possible to record the access path during the first pass for use during the second, but that requires extra space during the access operation.  Another alternative is to keep a parent pointer in every node, which avoids the need for extra space during access operations but may reduce overall time efficiency because of the need to update those pointers.<ref name=\"SleatorTarjan\" />\n\nAnother method which can be used is based on the argument that we can restructure the tree on our way down the access path instead of making a second pass. This top-down splaying routine uses three sets of nodes - left tree, right tree and middle tree. The first two contain all items of original tree known to be less than or greater than current item respectively. The middle tree consists of the sub-tree rooted at the current node. These three sets are updated down the access path while keeping the splay operations in check. Another method, semisplaying, modifies the zig-zig case to reduce the amount of restructuring done in all operations.<ref name=\"SleatorTarjan\" /><ref name=\"Lucas\" />\n\nBelow there is an implementation of splay trees in C++, which uses pointers to represent each node on the tree. This implementation is based on bottom-up splaying version and uses the second method of deletion on a splay tree.  Also, unlike the above definition, this C++ version does ''not'' splay the tree on finds - it only splays on insertions and deletions, and the find operation, therefore, has linear time complexity.\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <functional>\n\n#ifndef SPLAY_TREE\n#define SPLAY_TREE\n\ntemplate<typename T, typename Comp = std::less<T>>\nclass splay_tree {\nprivate:\n  Comp comp;\n  unsigned long p_size;\n  \n  struct node {\n    node *left, *right;\n    node *parent;\n    T key;\n    node(const T& init = T()) : left(nullptr), right(nullptr), parent(nullptr), key(init) { }\n    ~node() {\n\n    }\n  } *root;\n  \n  void left_rotate(node *x) {\n    node *y = x->right;\n    if (y) {\n      x->right = y->left;\n      if (y->left) y->left->parent = x;\n      y->parent = x->parent;\n    }\n    \n    if (!x->parent) root = y;\n    else if (x == x->parent->left) x->parent->left = y;\n    else x->parent->right = y;\n    if (y) y->left = x;\n    x->parent = y;\n  }\n  \n  void right_rotate(node *x) {\n    node *y = x->left;\n    if (y) {\n      x->left = y->right;\n      if (y->right) y->right->parent = x;\n      y->parent = x->parent;\n    }\n    if (!x->parent) root = y;\n    else if (x == x->parent->left) x->parent->left = y;\n    else x->parent->right = y;\n    if (y) y->right = x;\n    x->parent = y;\n  }\n  \n  void splay(node *x) {\n    while (x->parent) {\n      if (!x->parent->parent) {\n        if (x->parent->left == x) right_rotate(x->parent);\n        else left_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else if (x->parent->left == x && x->parent->parent->left == x->parent) {\n        right_rotate(x->parent->parent);\n        right_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else if (x->parent->right == x && x->parent->parent->right == x->parent) {\n        left_rotate(x->parent->parent);\n        left_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else if (x->parent->left == x && x->parent->parent->right == x->parent) {\n        right_rotate(x->parent);\n        left_rotate(x->parent);\n      } else {\n        left_rotate(x->parent);\n        right_rotate(x->parent);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  void replace(node *u, node *v) {\n    if (!u->parent) root = v;\n    else if (u == u->parent->left) u->parent->left = v;\n    else u->parent->right = v;\n    if (v) v->parent = u->parent;\n  }\n  \n  node* subtree_minimum(node *u) {\n    while (u->left) u = u->left;\n    return u;\n  }\n  \n  node* subtree_maximum(node *u) {\n    while (u->right) u = u->right;\n    return u;\n  }\npublic:\n  splay_tree() : root(nullptr), p_size(0) { }\n  \n  void insert(const T &key) {\n    node *z = root;\n    node *p = nullptr;\n    \n    while (z) {\n      p = z;\n      if (comp(z->key, key)) z = z->right;\n      else z = z->left;\n    }\n    \n    z = new node(key);\n    z->parent = p;\n    \n    if (!p) root = z;\n    else if (comp(p->key, z->key)) p->right = z;\n    else p->left = z;\n    \n    splay(z);\n    p_size++;\n  }\n  \n  node* find(const T &key) {\n    node *z = root;\n    while (z) {\n      if (comp(z->key, key)) z = z->right;\n      else if (comp(key, z->key)) z = z->left;\n      else return z;\n    }\n    return nullptr;\n  }\n        \n  void erase(const T &key) {\n    node *z = find(key);\n    if (!z) return;\n    \n    splay(z);\n    \n    if (!z->left) replace(z, z->right);\n    else if (!z->right) replace(z, z->left);\n    else {\n      node *y = subtree_minimum(z->right);\n      if (y->parent != z) {\n        replace(y, y->right);\n        y->right = z->right;\n        y->right->parent = y;\n      }\n      replace(z, y);\n      y->left = z->left;\n      y->left->parent = y;\n    }\n    \n    delete z;\n    p_size--;\n  }\n\n/* //the alternative implementation\n    void erase(const T &key) {\n        node *z = find(key);\n        if (!z) return;\n        \n        splay(z);\n        \n        node *s = z->left;\n        node *t = z->right;\n        delete z;\n        \n        node *sMax = NULL;\n        if (s) {\n            s->parent = NULL;\n            sMax = subtree_maximum(s);\n            splay(sMax);\n            root = sMax;\n        }\n        if (t) {\n            if (s)\n                sMax->right = t;\n            else\n                root = t;\n            t->parent = sMax;\n        }\n        \n        p_size--;\n    }\n*/\n  \n  const T& minimum() { return subtree_minimum(root)->key; }\n  const T& maximum() { return subtree_maximum(root)->key; }\n  \n  bool empty() const { return root == nullptr; }\n  unsigned long size() const { return p_size; }\n};\n\n#endif // SPLAY_TREE\n</source>\n\n== Analysis ==\nA simple [[amortized analysis]] of static splay trees can be carried out using the [[potential method]].

The Zig operation adds an amortized cost of 1, but there's at most one such operation.\n\nSo now we know that the total ''amortized'' time for a sequence of ''m'' operations is:\n:<math>T_\\mathrm{amortized}(m) = O(m \\log n)</math>\n\nTo go from the amortized time to the actual time, we must add the decrease in potential from the initial state before any operation is done (\u03a6<sub>''i''</sub>) to the final state after all operations are completed (\u03a6<sub>''f''</sub>).\n\n:<math>\\Phi_i - \\Phi_f = \\sum_x{\\mathrm{rank}_i(x) - \\mathrm{rank}_f(x)} = O(n \\log n)</math>\n\nwhere the last inequality comes from the fact that for every node ''x'', the minimum rank is 0 and the maximum rank is log(''n'').\n\nNow we can finally bound the actual time:\n\n:<math>T_\\mathrm{actual}(m) = O(m \\log n + n \\log n)</math>\n\n=== Weighted analysis ===\nThe above analysis can be generalized in the following way.\n* Assign to each node ''r'' a weight ''w''(''r'').\n* Define size(''r'') = the sum of weights of nodes in the sub-tree rooted at node ''r'' (including ''r'').\n* Define rank(''r'') and \u03a6 exactly as above.\n\nThe same analysis applies and the amortized cost of a splaying operation is again:\n:<math>\\mathrm{rank}(root)-\\mathrm{rank}(x) = O(\\log{W}- \\log{w(x)}) = O\\left(\\log{\\frac{W}{w(x)}}\\right)</math>\nwhere ''W'' is the sum of all weights.\n\nThe decrease from the initial to the final potential is bounded by:\n:<math>\\Phi_i - \\Phi_f \\leq \\sum_{x\\in tree}{\\log{\\frac{W}{w(x)}}}</math>\nsince the maximum size of any single node is ''W'' and the minimum is ''w(x)''.\n\nHence the actual time is bounded by:\n:<math>O\\left(\\sum_{x \\in sequence}{\\log{\\frac{W}{w(x)}}} + \\sum_{x \\in tree}{\\log{\\frac{W}{w(x)}}}\\right)</math>\n\n== Performance theorems ==\n\nThere are several theorems and conjectures regarding the worst-case runtime for performing a sequence ''S'' of ''m'' accesses in a splay tree containing ''n'' elements.\n\n{{Math theorem|Balance Theorem|The cost of performing the sequence ''S'' is <math>O\\left[m \\log n + n\\log n\\right]</math>.\n  {{Math proof|Take a constant weight, e.g. {{tmath|1=w(x)=1}} for every node ''x''.

Further versions were also released for the [[Game.com]] and [[R-Zone]]. It features a similar basic gameplay system and the same story as ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'', but adds characters and stages restored from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''. New additions to the game included the \"Aggressor\" bar, and a new finishing move called [[Brutality (Mortal Kombat)|Brutality]], a long combination of attacks that ends with the opponent exploding. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{further|Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3}}\n[[File:Mkt fight.png|thumb|left|[[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|MK]]'' battles the ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' version of [[Johnny Cage]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat II|MK II]]'''s armory stage. The [[Head-up display (video gaming)|HUD]] is the same as from ''[[Mortal Kombat 3|MK3]]''/''UMK3'', while the Aggressor bar is exclusive to ''MKT''.\n]]\n\n''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' introduces the Aggressor bar, which fills as the combatants fight (twice as much if the opponent is blocking). Once the bar is filled, it grants the character fast movement and greater attack damage for a short period of time.\n\nMany characters gained additional special moves. Some were simple edits of existing moves (such as Stryker throwing two grenades instead of one), while others were unused animations never implemented in their intended previous games. These special moves included ''MK'' [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]'s Knife Spin move, ''MKII'' [[Kung Lao]]'s Air Torpedo, [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]]'s Spinning Punch move, [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s Lightning that shoots from behind the opponent, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]]'s Blade Spin move. Additionally, [[Shao Kahn]] gained a throw and grab-and-punch move, and [[Motaro]] gained a proper throw move. [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]'s famous \"Spine Rip\" Fatality reappears in the game but is completely censored, as the screen blacks out with only the \"Fatality\" text visible. This was due to avoid having to re-animate the fatality for this game.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Trilogy'' adds the \"Brutality\" finishing move, which requires the player to perform an 11-button combo in order to rapidly beat on their opponent until they explode (Brutalities had been previously featured in the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] ports of ''UMK3''). All of the arenas that featured a [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Stage Fatality|Stage Fatality]] are featured in this game, except for the one in the Pit II, for similar reasons to the \"Spine Rip\" Fatality.\n\nAll of the battle arenas that were featured in ''MKII'', ''MK3'', and ''UMK3'' are available in ''MKT'', but only four backgrounds from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' are featured (Courtyard, Goro's Lair, the Pit, and the Pit Bottom). The [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Sega Saturn]] versions lack The Hidden Portal and Noob's Dorfen stages from ''MK3'', while the [[Nintendo 64]] version lacks Kahn's Arena and the Bank from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'', respectively. {{clear left}}\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:Mkt select.png|thumb|left|Character select screen from the CD versions of the game]]\n\nAlong with the ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' roster, ''Trilogy'' adds [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] exactly as they appeared in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', with added running animations especially created for ''MK Trilogy''. [[Johnny Cage]] was also added to the roster, this time portrayed by Chris Alexander (replacing [[Daniel Pesina]], who was legally at odds with Midway). He kept his moves from ''MKII'' except for the Split Punch, which was excluded since none of the characters from ''MK3''/''UMK3'' had graphics for getting hit in the groin. [[Boss (video gaming)|Bosses]] [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat character)|Kintaro]], [[Motaro]] and [[Shao Kahn]] are also [[Player character|playable]] characters from the start (except for the Nintendo 64 version, where only Motaro and Shao Kahn are included and must be unlocked via a cheat menu).<ref name=EGM90>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: Special Comparison Feature |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|pages=158-161}}</ref> The PC, PlayStation and Saturn versions also contain alternate versions of [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]], [[Kung Lao]], [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] and Raiden as they appeared in the first two titles. Contrarily to ''MKII'' Raiden and Baraka, these versions of the characters did not get proper running animations and just feature a sped-up version of their walk animation when they try to run.\n\nTwo new [[secret character (video games)|secret characters]] appear as well, depending on the version of the game. Most versions have [[Chameleon (Mortal Kombat)|Chameleon]], a semi-transparent ninja who rapidly switches between all the other male ninjas (Classic Sub-Zero, Scorpion, [[Noob Saibot]], Human [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]], [[Rain (Mortal Kombat)|Rain]], [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]], and [[Ermac]]) during combat. This character is playable by performing a special button combination. The Nintendo 64 version replaced him with a female character named Khameleon, who switches between the female ninjas instead (Kitana, Mileena, and Jade). {{clear left}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=When {{sic|we going}} to release ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3|Ultimate MK3]]'' on consoles, it seemed odd to release it on the [[PlayStation (console)|Playstation]] without doing something \"special\" for it. Since the PS1 had so much space (CD drive) we decided to include the ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|MK1]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat II|MK2]]'' assets and call it ''MK Trilogy''. Actually we were busy working on the arcade games and our San Diego team was doing the ports and ''MK Trilogy''. It sold HUGE !!<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/noobde/status/304303449464520704 |title=Twitter / noobde: When we going to release Ultimate |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/noobde/status/304304234592100352 |title=Twitter / noobde: Since the PS1 had so much space |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/noobde/status/304306767372890112 |title=Twitter / noobde: Actually we were busy working |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>|source=\u2014[[Ed Boon]]|}}\n\nActors [[Ho Sung Pak]] ([[Liu Kang]]), Philip Ahn ([[Shang Tsung]]), [[Elizabeth Malecki]] ([[Sonya Blade]]), [[Katalin Zamiar]] ([[Kitana]]/[[Mileena]]/[[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]]) and [[Daniel Pesina|Dan Pesina]] ([[Johnny Cage]] and [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]/[[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]/[[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]]/[[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]]) all left Midway prior to the production of the game due to [[royalty payment|royalty]] disputes, and so their respective roles were played by new actors. Initially publisher Williams Entertainment stated that Johnny Cage would not be included in the game at all due to the dispute with Pesina.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Williams Prepares for a New Era! |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |pages=52-55}}</ref> Carlos Pesina's original sprites were used for Raiden's gameplay, but Sal Divita's image was used for his versus screen picture.\n\nMost of the background music tracks from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'' remained intact, especially for the [[CD-ROM]] versions of the game. In all versions of the game, many of the tracks do not match their respective arenas when compared to their original arcade counterparts. In all versions of ''MKT'', none of the music from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' game is used. All of the CD-ROM games read the background music directly from the CD, providing high-quality CD sound, but all of the music loops are used when \"Finish Him/Her\" appears. All of the music taken from ''MK3'' on the CD-ROM ''MKT'' games is noticeably slowed down in both speed and pitch. When these particular songs were converted to ''MKT''' Red Book [[CD-DA]] quality, they were downsampled without resampling them to maintain the original tempo and pitch in the PC, PlayStation, and Saturn versions.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== PlayStation ===\nThis version was developed by [[Avalanche Software]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996 |page=41}}</ref> There are at least three public revisions of this game for the PlayStation; the final version is the North American Greatest Hits and European Platinum edition. With each revision, aspects of the gameplay were refined, producing gameplay closer to that of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' for the arcade. Many of the infinite combos and bugs found in the game only existed in earlier revisions.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=MKT Bugs Fixed |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997 |page=118|quote=Midway has since - without much fanfare - put out a newer version of MKT for the PS, apparently sans glitches.}}</ref> Shang Tsung never appears anywhere within the \"Choose Your Destiny\" towers, probably because of the loading delays when morphing in the PlayStation version (there are options to completely turn off morphs and letting the system load two additional characters into memory when playing as Shang Tsung, eliminating the long loading delays when morphing in ''MK3''); the only time the CPU ever controls Tsung is during the attract mode. \n\nAfter beating the PlayStation version of the game, the final message in the credits says \"''[[Mortal Kombat 4|MK4]]'' coming in 1997\". The PlayStation version of the game exhibits a number of bugs when played on a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 game console, which causes the game to become unplayable.\n\n=== Nintendo 64 ===\nThe [[Nintendo 64]] port is based on the Windows PC and PlayStation versions of ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and the Sega Saturn version of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3''. This edition includes 3-on-3 simultaneous battles as an exclusive feature.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: All the Kombat You'll Ever Need |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996|pages=246-7}}</ref> In this version, like in the arcade, the player begins the game with four credits, but after playing a two-player match, the player earns an extra credit, while in the CD-ROM versions anyone can play for free. Free Play must be unlocked on the N64 version, which also has a more cohesive \"Supreme Demonstration\" feature (which shows every Fatality, Babality, Friendship, Animality, and Brutality for every character) than the PS or Saturn versions (as the latter versions needed to load the Fatalities and thus cannot show every one in the allotted time). This version only uses music from ''MK3'' and it is played through the system's internal synth, resulting in considerably lower quality than the CD versions. However, all ending tunes and music loops used during the \"Finish Him/Her\" sequences are intact, unlike in the CD-ROM versions.\n\nDue to cartridge limitations, only 30 characters are included, instead of the 37 featured in the other console versions. The N64 port lacks Goro and Kintaro; the classic versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano, and Raiden; as well as the unmasked Sub-Zero (however, the masked Sub-Zero can perform both Sub-Zeros' special moves).<ref name=EGM90/> Chameleon is replaced with the secret character Khameleon, a grey female ninja that randomly switches between Kitana, Mileena and Jade.<ref name=EGM90/> The N64 version of the game, like ''MK3'' and ''UMK3'', provides the player with an \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\" screen after a single-player game is over, where a 6-digit code can be entered to unlock Human Smoke and Khameleon for normal play.\n\nThe N64 game also includes a new stage, the Star Bridge, made of the Pit II's background with a star-filled sky. Some older backgrounds are also enhanced with extra graphics and added animation. For example, the Pit I features two different sky backgrounds (a pitch-black, star-filled sky in the N64 version, and the same sky background as the Pit II in the CD-ROM versions); Kahn's Kave has animated clouds and a glowing floor added to it; and the Lost Bridge has [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Hornbuckle]] and [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Blaze]] appear at random in the background. In the N64 version, the Graveyard stage has more names on the gravestones near the front: besides those of the original Midway design team for ''MK3'', names of the team at Williams Entertainment were added, and the date of death on the stones was changed to the creators' birthdates.\n\nIn this version, there are two secret menus, because not all the playable characters are unlocked from the start. Motaro and Shao Kahn can each perform a Fatality exclusive to this port. They also have an aggressor meter, unlike in other versions.<ref name=EGM90/> In the Subway's stage fatality, new animations were added for the characters. [[Nightwolf]] has a very different Friendship move exclusive to this version, which he pulls out 3 hatchets and begins to juggle, as opposed to turning into Raiden since this character became playable in this game (although in the other versions, Nightwolf retains his original ''MK3'' Friendship move). In addition, many frames of animation were cut from each character.<ref name=EGM90/>\n\n=== Sega Saturn ===\nThe [[Sega Saturn]] version, converted by Point of View and released almost a year after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, is a straight conversion of the PlayStation version without any substantial changes in content. Due to hardware differences and inadequate code adapting, the porting process from the PlayStation had some technical changes, which included the replacement of almost all transparency effects with mesh patterns and the loss of certain voice samples, like most fighters' running yells and some alternative phrases used by characters like Raiden and Scorpion in their attacks.\n\n=== PC ===\nThe PC version is a direct port of the PlayStation version, developed by Point of View and released almost at the same time as the Sega Saturn port. This port is identical to the PlayStation version, lacking the extra load times and providing some minor cosmetic differences in the game introduction. There were at least two public revisions of this game for the PC, and the final version (indicated by the word \"final\" next to the version number in the about dialog box) has gameplay identical to the Greatest Hits release on PlayStation.\n\n=== Game.com ===\nThe game was a launch release for the [[Game.com]] handheld console. The game includes a multiplayer mode, accessible only with the compete.com game link cable (to link two Game.com consoles together). Only 13 characters (Cyrax, Ermac, Jade, Mileena, Sektor, Kitana, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Raiden, Reptile and Shao Kahn) and 10 Kombat Zones remain in this version (screenshots of early releases showed a different assortment of characters). In addition, each character only has two special moves and four finishing moves: one Fatality, Babality, Friendship, and Brutality. In this version, each finishing move has the same command for every character.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = PS: 67%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/ps/197997-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for PlayStation |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />N64: 52%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197996-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for Nintendo 64 |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n| EGM = N64: 8.125/10<ref name=EGM89>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: MK Trilogy |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 1996 |page=85}}</ref>\n| GI = SSAT: 8.75/10<ref name=GISat>{{cite magazine|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971021120233/http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archivedate=October 21, 1997|date=August 1997 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref>\n| GSpot = N64: 5.8/10<ref name=GS64>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Gerstmann|authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review/1900-2544832/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=December 4, 1996 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}</ref><br />PS: 8.6/10<ref>{{cite web |first=Hugh|last=Sterbakov|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2548427/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />SSAT: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2533994/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1997-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| IGN = N64: 4.1/10<ref name=\"IGN64r\">{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Peer|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/21/mortal-kombat-trilogy-2|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=17 January 2018|date=November 20, 1996}}</ref><br />PS: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1996/12/20/mortal-kombat-trilogy |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=December 19, 1996 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Digital Press''\n| rev1Score = N64: 8/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Paprocki|first=Matt|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.digitpress.com/reviews/mktilogy_n64.htm|website=Digital Press|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=October 24, 2005}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''Super Power''\n| rev2Score = N64: 91%<ref name=\"SP\"/>\n| rev3 = ''Player One''\n| rev3Score = N64: 70<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Player+One/playerone_numero078/Player+One+n%25B078+(Septembre+1997)+-+Page+069.jpg|title=Player One 078|website=download.abandonware.org}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''SuperGamePower''\n| rev4Score = SSAT: 5/5<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SuperGamePower_Ano_03_No._042_1997-09_Nova_Cultural_BR_pt|title=SuperGamePower - Ano 03 No. 042 (1997-09)(Nova Cultural)(BR)(pt)|date=1 September 1997|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><br />N64: 4.8/5<ref name=\"MKTSGP\"/>\n| rev5 = ''CD Consoles''\n| rev5Score = PS: {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=101&num=7224&album=oui|title=CD Consoles 101|website=www.abandonware-magazines.org}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev6Score = SSAT: 88%<ref name=SSM22>{{cite magazine|last=Yeo |first=Matt |title=Review: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=26|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=December 1997|pages=68-71}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game's critical reception has varied considerably, depending on the platform and publication.

He complained that the game suffers from some slowdown and muted music, but concluded it \"delivers with all the fighters, secrets, and carnage that made the series the phenomenon it is today.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Nintendo 64 ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=99 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1996|pages=106-7}}</ref> [[Jeff Gerstmann]] of [[GameSpot]] contradicted Major Mike, saying that the music is normal for a non-CD game and it is the sound effects (which Major Mike described as \"arcade-perfect\") that sound muffled. And while he complimented the Nintendo 64 version's large selection of play modes, he said it is conspicuously missing frames of animation from the arcade games, and that the characters left out of this version are \"favorites\".<ref name=GS64/> Peer Schneider of [[IGN]] contended that ''all'' of the audio aspects sound muffled. He said the Nintendo 64 version is a faithful conversion of the arcade games, though he compared it unfavorably to the PlayStation version. However, he held that the arcade games themselves are too aged to merit an appearance on the Nintendo 64, referring to them as five years old (in actuality, ''Mortal Kombat 3'' was barely a year old at the time, and even the oldest in the series was four years old).<ref name=\"IGN64r\"/> ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' was said to be a \"particularly horrible game\" among the Nintendo 64 library by ''[[Forbes]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Noer |title=Blood on the Snow |url=https://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |date=1997-09-19 |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=2010-03-13 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123081745/http://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |archivedate=2013-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but was honored in [[Nintendo Power Awards]] '96, coming second in the category \"Best Tournament Fighting Game\".<ref>''[[Nintendo Power]]'' #96 (May 1997)</ref>\n\nReviewing the PlayStation version, Major Mike criticized the overly difficult opponent AI and the unbalanced nature of the playable boss characters, and said the music tracks \"sound like a [[45 record]] played at 33 [[RPM]].\" He nonetheless concluded it to be \"a must for any fighting gamer's library\", due to the responsive controls and large amount of content.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=PlayStation ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=100|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1997 |page=84}}</ref> Though ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' never reviewed the PlayStation version of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'', they ran a four-page feature comparing it to the Nintendo 64 version. Shawn Smith picked the Nintendo 64 version as the one to buy, saying that the major bugs in the PlayStation version outweigh the Nintendo 64 version's various shortcomings. The other three members of the review team all voted for the PlayStation version, particularly citing the additional characters and the lower price ($49.99 as compared to $69.99 for the Nintendo 64 version).<ref name=EGM90/> They later named both versions runner-up for Fighting Game of the Year, behind ''[[Tekken 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\nThe Saturn version arrived nearly a year (over a year in some countries) after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions and received comparatively little attention. ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' said the long wait for the conversion was baffling, since the game's 2D visuals fall within the Saturn's specialty and no new content had been created for the Saturn version, and damaging, since superior 2D Saturn fighters had since come out and home versions of ''Mortal Kombat 4'' were on the horizon, making ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' both graphically and stylistically outdated.<ref name=SSM22/> ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', ''[[Game Informer]]'', and ''GamePro'' all concluded it to be a must-have for ''Mortal Kombat'' fans due to its comprehensive content and features, but advised non-fans to look to other fighting games on the Saturn, and described it as virtually identical to the PlayStation version.<ref name=GISat/><ref name=SSM22/><ref>{{cite magazine |author=Art Angel |title=Saturn ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=108 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=September 1997|page=98}}</ref>\n\nReleased at a time when the Nintendo 64's popularity was burgeoning and there were few competing games for the system, the Nintendo 64 version of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' saw impressive sales figures.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Who Won the Videogame Wars of 1996? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=16-19}}</ref> According to a later IGN retrospective, ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' \"offered something no fan could ignore: It brought every character from the series into the fold, along with most of the levels, making for one massive game that had enough to please everyone.

Further versions were also released for the [[Game.com]] and [[R-Zone]]. It features a similar basic gameplay system and the same story as ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'', but adds characters and stages restored from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''. New additions to the game included the \"Aggressor\" bar, and a new finishing move called [[Brutality (Mortal Kombat)|Brutality]], a long combination of attacks that ends with the opponent exploding. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{further|Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3}}\n[[File:Mkt fight.png|thumb|left|[[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|MK]]'' battles the ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' version of [[Johnny Cage]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat II|MK II]]'''s armory stage. The [[Head-up display (video gaming)|HUD]] is the same as from ''[[Mortal Kombat 3|MK3]]''/''UMK3'', while the Aggressor bar is exclusive to ''MKT''.\n]]\n\n''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' introduces the Aggressor bar, which fills as the combatants fight (twice as much if the opponent is blocking). Once the bar is filled, it grants the character fast movement and greater attack damage for a short period of time.\n\nMany characters gained additional special moves. Some were simple edits of existing moves (such as Stryker throwing two grenades instead of one), while others were unused animations never implemented in their intended previous games. These special moves included ''MK'' [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]'s Knife Spin move, ''MKII'' [[Kung Lao]]'s Air Torpedo, [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]]'s Spinning Punch move, [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s Lightning that shoots from behind the opponent, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]]'s Blade Spin move. Additionally, [[Shao Kahn]] gained a throw and grab-and-punch move, and [[Motaro]] gained a proper throw move. [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]'s famous \"Spine Rip\" Fatality reappears in the game but is completely censored, as the screen blacks out with only the \"Fatality\" text visible. This was due to avoid having to re-animate the fatality for this game.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Trilogy'' adds the \"Brutality\" finishing move, which requires the player to perform an 11-button combo in order to rapidly beat on their opponent until they explode. (Brutalities have been previously featured in the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] ports of ''UMK3''.) All of the arenas that featured a [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Stage Fatality|Stage Fatality]] are featured in this game, except the Pit II.\n\nAll of the battle arenas that were featured in ''MKII'', ''MK3'', and ''UMK3'' are available in ''MKT'', but only four backgrounds from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' were featured (Courtyard, Goro's Lair, the Pit, and the Pit Bottom). The [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Sega Saturn]] versions lack The Hidden Portal and Noob's Dorfen stages from ''MK3'', while the [[Nintendo 64]] version lacks Kahn's Arena and the Bank from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'', respectively. {{clear left}}\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:Mkt select.png|thumb|left|Character select screen from the CD versions of the game]]\n\nAlong with the ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' roster, ''Trilogy'' adds [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] exactly as they appeared in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', with added running animations especially created for ''MK Trilogy''. [[Johnny Cage]] was also added to the roster, this time portrayed by Chris Alexander (replacing [[Daniel Pesina]], who was legally at odds with Midway). He kept his moves from ''MKII'' except for the Split Punch, which was excluded since none of the characters from ''MK3''/''UMK3'' had graphics for getting hit in the groin. [[Boss (video gaming)|Bosses]] [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat character)|Kintaro]], [[Motaro]] and [[Shao Kahn]] are also [[Player character|playable]] characters from the start (except for the Nintendo 64 version, where only Motaro and Shao Kahn are included and must be unlocked via a cheat menu).<ref name=EGM90>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: Special Comparison Feature |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|pages=158-161}}</ref> The PC, PlayStation and Saturn versions also contain alternate versions of [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]], [[Kung Lao]], [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] and Raiden as they appeared in the first two titles. Contrarily to ''MKII'' Raiden and Baraka, these versions of the characters did not get proper running animations and just feature a sped-up version of their walk animation when they try to run.\n\nTwo new [[secret character (video games)|secret characters]] appear as well, depending on the version of the game. Most versions have [[Chameleon (Mortal Kombat)|Chameleon]], a semi-transparent ninja who rapidly switches between all the other male ninjas (Classic Sub-Zero, Scorpion, [[Noob Saibot]], Human [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]], [[Rain (Mortal Kombat)|Rain]], [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]], and [[Ermac]]) during combat. This character is playable by performing a special button combination. The Nintendo 64 version replaced him with a female character named Khameleon, who switches between the female ninjas instead (Kitana, Mileena, and Jade). {{clear left}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=When {{sic|we going}} to release ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3|Ultimate MK3]]'' on consoles, it seemed odd to release it on the [[PlayStation (console)|Playstation]] without doing something \"special\" for it. Since the PS1 had so much space (CD drive) we decided to include the ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|MK1]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat II|MK2]]'' assets and call it ''MK Trilogy''. Actually we were busy working on the arcade games and our San Diego team was doing the ports and ''MK Trilogy''.

Initially publisher Williams Entertainment stated that Johnny Cage would not be included in the game at all due to the dispute with Pesina.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Williams Prepares for a New Era! |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |pages=52-55}}</ref> Carlos Pesina's original sprites were used for Raiden's gameplay, but Sal Divita's image was used for his versus screen picture.\n\nMost of the background music tracks from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'' remained intact, especially for the [[CD-ROM]] versions of the game. In all versions of the game, many of the tracks do not match their respective arenas when compared to their original arcade counterparts. In all versions of ''MKT'', none of the music from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' game is used. All of the CD-ROM games read the background music directly from the CD, providing high-quality CD sound, but all of the music loops are used when \"Finish Him/Her\" appears. All of the music taken from ''MK3'' on the CD-ROM ''MKT'' games is noticeably slowed down in both speed and pitch. When these particular songs were converted to ''MKT''' Red Book [[CD-DA]] quality, they were downsampled without resampling them to maintain the original tempo and pitch in the PC, PlayStation, and Saturn versions.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== PlayStation ===\nThis version was developed by [[Avalanche Software]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996 |page=41}}</ref> There are at least three public revisions of this game for the PlayStation; the final version is the North American Greatest Hits and European Platinum edition. With each revision, aspects of the gameplay were refined, producing gameplay closer to that of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' for the arcade. Many of the infinite combos and bugs found in the game only existed in earlier revisions.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=MKT Bugs Fixed |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997 |page=118|quote=Midway has since - without much fanfare - put out a newer version of MKT for the PS, apparently sans glitches.}}</ref> Shang Tsung never appears anywhere within the \"Choose Your Destiny\" towers, probably because of the loading delays when morphing in the PlayStation version (there are options to completely turn off morphs and letting the system load two additional characters into memory when playing as Shang Tsung, eliminating the long loading delays when morphing in ''MK3''); the only time the CPU ever controls Tsung is during the attract mode. \n\nAfter beating the PlayStation version of the game, the final message in the credits says \"''[[Mortal Kombat 4|MK4]]'' coming in 1997\". The PlayStation version of the game exhibits a number of bugs when played on a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 game console, which causes the game to become unplayable.\n\n=== Nintendo 64 ===\nThe [[Nintendo 64]] port is based on the Windows PC and PlayStation versions of ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and the Sega Saturn version of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3''. This edition includes 3-on-3 simultaneous battles as an exclusive feature.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: All the Kombat You'll Ever Need |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996|pages=246-7}}</ref> In this version, like in the arcade, the player begins the game with four credits, but after playing a two-player match, the player earns an extra credit, while in the CD-ROM versions anyone can play for free. Free Play must be unlocked on the N64 version, which also has a more cohesive \"Supreme Demonstration\" feature (which shows every Fatality, Babality, Friendship, Animality, and Brutality for every character) than the PS or Saturn versions (as the latter versions needed to load the Fatalities and thus cannot show every one in the allotted time). This version only uses music from ''MK3'' and it is played through the system's internal synth, resulting in considerably lower quality than the CD versions. However, all ending tunes and music loops used during the \"Finish Him/Her\" sequences are intact, unlike in the CD-ROM versions.\n\nDue to cartridge limitations, only 30 characters are included, instead of the 37 featured in the other console versions. The N64 port lacks Goro and Kintaro; the classic versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano, and Raiden; as well as the unmasked Sub-Zero (however, the masked Sub-Zero can perform both Sub-Zeros' special moves).<ref name=EGM90/> Chameleon is replaced with the secret character Khameleon, a grey female ninja that randomly switches between Kitana, Mileena and Jade.<ref name=EGM90/> The N64 version of the game, like ''MK3'' and ''UMK3'', provides the player with an \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\" screen after a single-player game is over, where a 6-digit code can be entered to unlock Human Smoke and Khameleon for normal play.\n\nThe N64 game also includes a new stage, the Star Bridge, made of the Pit II's background with a star-filled sky. Some older backgrounds are also enhanced with extra graphics and added animation. For example, the Pit I features two different sky backgrounds (a pitch-black, star-filled sky in the N64 version, and the same sky background as the Pit II in the CD-ROM versions); Kahn's Kave has animated clouds and a glowing floor added to it; and the Lost Bridge has [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Hornbuckle]] and [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Blaze]] appear at random in the background. In the N64 version, the Graveyard stage has more names on the gravestones near the front: besides those of the original Midway design team for ''MK3'', names of the team at Williams Entertainment were added, and the date of death on the stones was changed to the creators' birthdates.\n\nIn this version, there are two secret menus, because not all the playable characters are unlocked from the start. Motaro and Shao Kahn can each perform a Fatality exclusive to this port. They also have an aggressor meter, unlike in other versions.<ref name=EGM90/> In the Subway's stage fatality, new animations were added for the characters. [[Nightwolf]] has a very different Friendship move exclusive to this version, which he pulls out 3 hatchets and begins to juggle, as opposed to turning into Raiden since this character became playable in this game (although in the other versions, Nightwolf retains his original ''MK3'' Friendship move). In addition, many frames of animation were cut from each character.<ref name=EGM90/>\n\n=== Sega Saturn ===\nThe [[Sega Saturn]] version, converted by Point of View and released almost a year after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, is a straight conversion of the PlayStation version without any substantial changes in content. Due to hardware differences and inadequate code adapting, the porting process from the PlayStation had some technical changes, which included the replacement of almost all transparency effects with mesh patterns and the loss of certain voice samples, like most fighters' running yells and some alternative phrases used by characters like Raiden and Scorpion in their attacks.\n\n=== PC ===\nThe PC version is a direct port of the PlayStation version, developed by Point of View and released almost at the same time as the Sega Saturn port. This port is identical to the PlayStation version, lacking the extra load times and providing some minor cosmetic differences in the game introduction. There were at least two public revisions of this game for the PC, and the final version (indicated by the word \"final\" next to the version number in the about dialog box) has gameplay identical to the Greatest Hits release on PlayStation.\n\n=== Game.com ===\nThe game was a launch release for the [[Game.com]] handheld console. The game includes a multiplayer mode, accessible only with the compete.com game link cable (to link two Game.com consoles together). Only 13 characters (Cyrax, Ermac, Jade, Mileena, Sektor, Kitana, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Raiden, Reptile and Shao Kahn) and 10 Kombat Zones remain in this version (screenshots of early releases showed a different assortment of characters). In addition, each character only has two special moves and four finishing moves: one Fatality, Babality, Friendship, and Brutality. In this version, each finishing move has the same command for every character.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = PS: 67%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/ps/197997-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for PlayStation |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />N64: 52%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197996-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for Nintendo 64 |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n| EGM = N64: 8.125/10<ref name=EGM89>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: MK Trilogy |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 1996 |page=85}}</ref>\n| GI = SSAT: 8.75/10<ref name=GISat>{{cite magazine|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971021120233/http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archivedate=October 21, 1997|date=August 1997 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref>\n| GSpot = N64: 5.8/10<ref name=GS64>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Gerstmann|authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review/1900-2544832/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=December 4, 1996 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}</ref><br />PS: 8.6/10<ref>{{cite web |first=Hugh|last=Sterbakov|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2548427/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />SSAT: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2533994/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1997-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| IGN = N64: 4.1/10<ref name=\"IGN64r\">{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Peer|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/21/mortal-kombat-trilogy-2|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=17 January 2018|date=November 20, 1996}}</ref><br />PS: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1996/12/20/mortal-kombat-trilogy |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=December 19, 1996 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Digital Press''\n| rev1Score = N64: 8/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Paprocki|first=Matt|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.digitpress.com/reviews/mktilogy_n64.htm|website=Digital Press|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=October 24, 2005}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''Super Power''\n| rev2Score = N64: 91%<ref name=\"SP\"/>\n| rev3 = ''Player One''\n| rev3Score = N64: 70<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Player+One/playerone_numero078/Player+One+n%25B078+(Septembre+1997)+-+Page+069.jpg|title=Player One 078|website=download.abandonware.org}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''SuperGamePower''\n| rev4Score = SSAT: 5/5<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SuperGamePower_Ano_03_No._042_1997-09_Nova_Cultural_BR_pt|title=SuperGamePower - Ano 03 No. 042 (1997-09)(Nova Cultural)(BR)(pt)|date=1 September 1997|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><br />N64: 4.8/5<ref name=\"MKTSGP\"/>\n| rev5 = ''CD Consoles''\n| rev5Score = PS: {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=101&num=7224&album=oui|title=CD Consoles 101|website=www.abandonware-magazines.org}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev6Score = SSAT: 88%<ref name=SSM22>{{cite magazine|last=Yeo |first=Matt |title=Review: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=26|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=December 1997|pages=68-71}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game's critical reception has varied considerably, depending on the platform and publication.

He said the Nintendo 64 version is a faithful conversion of the arcade games, though he compared it unfavorably to the PlayStation version. However, he held that the arcade games themselves are too aged to merit an appearance on the Nintendo 64, referring to them as five years old (in actuality, ''Mortal Kombat 3'' was barely a year old at the time, and even the oldest in the series was four years old).<ref name=\"IGN64r\"/> ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' was said to be a \"particularly horrible game\" among the Nintendo 64 library by ''[[Forbes]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Noer |title=Blood on the Snow |url=https://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |date=1997-09-19 |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=2010-03-13 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123081745/http://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |archivedate=2013-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but was honored in [[Nintendo Power Awards]] '96, coming second in the category \"Best Tournament Fighting Game\".<ref>''[[Nintendo Power]]'' #96 (May 1997)</ref>\n\nReviewing the PlayStation version, Major Mike criticized the overly difficult opponent AI and the unbalanced nature of the playable boss characters, and said the music tracks \"sound like a [[45 record]] played at 33 [[RPM]].\" He nonetheless concluded it to be \"a must for any fighting gamer's library\", due to the responsive controls and large amount of content.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=PlayStation ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=100|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1997 |page=84}}</ref> Though ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' never reviewed the PlayStation version of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'', they ran a four-page feature comparing it to the Nintendo 64 version.
