The larger crystals are called [[phenocryst]]s. In its non-geologic, traditional use, the term ''porphyry'' refers to the purple-red form of this stone, valued for its appearance.\n\nThe term ''porphyry'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u0254\u0279|f|\u026a|\u0279|i:}} is from [[Ancient Greek]] (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 ''porphyra'') and means \"[[purple]]\".  Purple was the color of royalty, and the \"imperial porphyry\" was a deep purple igneous rock with large crystals of [[plagioclase]]. Some authors claimed the rock  was the hardest known in antiquity.<ref name=Oxf>\"PORPHYRY\" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 1701. {{ISBN|0195046528}}</ref> \"Imperial\" grade porphyry was thus prized for monuments and building projects in [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and later. Porphyry typically has hardness 7 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} corresponding to steel and quartz. \n\nSubsequently, the name was given to any [[igneous rocks]] with large crystals. The adjective ''[[porphyritic]]'' now refers to a certain [[rock microstructure|texture]] of igneous rock regardless of its chemical and mineralogical composition. Its chief characteristic is a large difference in size between the tiny matrix crystals and the much larger phenocrysts. Porphyries may be [[aphanite]]s or [[phanerite]]s, that is, the groundmass may have invisibly small crystals as in [[basalt]], or crystals easily distinguishable with the eye, as in [[granite]].  Most types of igneous rocks display some degree of porphyritic texture.\n\n== Formation ==\nPorphyry deposits are formed when a column of rising [[magma]] is cooled in two stages. In the first stage, the magma is cooled slowly deep in the crust, creating the large crystal grains with a diameter of 2&nbsp; mm or more. In the second and final stage, the magma is cooled rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a [[volcano]], creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye.\n\n=== Porphyry copper ===\n{{main article|Porphyry copper}}\n[[File:USGS PorphyryCu.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram of zonation in a porphyry copper deposit]]\nThe term porphyry is also used for a mineral deposit called a \"copper porphyry\".  The different stages of cooling that create porphyritic textures in intrusive and [[hypabyssal]] porphyritic rocks also lead to a separation of dissolved metals into distinct zones. \n\nThis process, which occurs primarily when fluids are driven off the cooling magma, is one of the main reasons for the existence in the world of rich, localized metal ore deposits such as those of [[gold]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[zinc]], [[rhenium]] and [[tungsten]]. This enrichment occurs in the porphyry itself, or in other related igneous rocks or surrounding country rocks, especially [[carbonate rock]] (in a process similar to [[skarn]]s). Collectively, these type of deposits are known as \"[[porphyry copper deposit]]s\".<ref>Dietrich, R. and Skinner, B., 1979, Rocks and Rock Minerals, pg. 125.</ref>\n\n=== Rhomb porphyry ===\n'''Rhomb porphyry''' is a [[volcanic rock]] with gray-white large [[porphyritic]] [[rhombus]]-shaped [[phenocrysts]] embedded in a very fine-grained red-brown [[matrix (geology)|matrix]].  The composition of rhomb porphyry places it in the [[trachyte]]\u2013[[latite]] classification of the [[QAPF diagram]].\n\nRhomb porphyry [[lava]]s are only known from three [[rift]] areas: the [[East African Rift]] (including [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]), [[Mount Erebus]] near the [[Ross Sea]] in [[Antarctica]], and the [[Oslo graben]] in [[Norway]].

As if it were not enough that porphyry was explicitly for imperial use, the stone's rarity set the emperors apart from their subjects as their superiors. The comparative vividness of porphyry to other stones underscored that these figures were not regular citizens, but many levels above, even gods, and worthy of the respect they expected. Porphyry made the emperors unapproachable in terms of power and nature, belonging to another world, the world of the mighty gods, present for a short time on earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Medieval Art-Oxford history of art|last=Nees|first=Lawrence|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780192842435|location=|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nPorphyry also stood in for the physical purple robes Roman emperors wore to show status, because of its purple coloring. Similar to porphyry, purple fabric was extremely difficult to make, as what we now call [[Tyrian purple]] required the use of rare [[Bolinus brandaris|snails]] to make the dye.<ref>Schultz, Colin. \"In Ancient Rome, Purple Dye Was Made from Snails.\" Smithsonian magazine.

As if it were not enough that porphyry was explicitly for imperial use, the stone's rarity set the emperors apart from their subjects as their superiors. The comparative vividness of porphyry to other stones underscored that these figures were not regular citizens, but many levels above, even gods, and worthy of the respect they expected. Porphyry made the emperors unapproachable in terms of power and nature, belonging to another world, the world of the mighty gods, present for a short time on earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Medieval Art-Oxford history of art|last=Nees|first=Lawrence|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780192842435|location=|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nPorphyry also stood in for the physical purple robes Roman emperors wore to show status, because of its purple coloring. Similar to porphyry, purple fabric was extremely difficult to make, as what we now call [[Tyrian purple]] required the use of rare [[Bolinus brandaris|snails]] to make the dye.<ref>Schultz, Colin. \"In Ancient Rome, Purple Dye Was Made from Snails.\" Smithsonian magazine.

These include two well-preserved ones in [[Rome]], now conserved at the [[Vatican Museums]] and known as the [[Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina]]; and nine others long held in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Constantinople]], described by [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in the ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' (mid-10th century CE) who specified them to be respectively of [[Constantine the Great]], [[Constantius II]], [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], [[Theodosius I]], [[Arcadius]], [[Aelia Eudoxia]], [[Theodosius II]], and [[Marcian]].

Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.<ref>Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008.

Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: [[net metering]] and double metering.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their [[renewable energy]], sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Any material that has used toxic or [[carcinogenic]] chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as [[formaldehyde]] in glues used in [[woodworking]]), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise [[indoor air quality]] or [[water conservation]], and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or [[recyclable packaging]], locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.<ref>[http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/greenbuilding/Materials/ Green Building Materials: Sustainable Building.] CalRecycle.

Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.<ref name=\"Hamilton, Andy 2009\"/> Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\"/>  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.<ref name=\"Hamilton, Andy 2009\"/> \u201cSuperwindows,\u201d mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.<ref>Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins.

[[Green roofs]] or \u201cliving roofs\u201d are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical \u201cfootprint\u201d that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building's presence.<ref>Cutlip, Jamie.

Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer [[green energy]], for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment].

Web. 28 October 2010.</ref> In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility's effort in producing sustainable energy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2009. Print.</ref> Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).\n\nWhen generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.<ref>Galbraith, Kate.

Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power].

At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/><ref name=\"Jeffery, Yvonne 2008\">Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.</ref>\n\n[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).<ref>[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.</ref>\n\nOther methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).\n\n[[Wind power]] is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20\u2019 or 6m with 10\u2018 or 3m diameter blades for an individual household's needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&nbsp;mi/hr (14&nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30\u2019 (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nFor those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n[[Geothermal energy]] production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth's surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth's surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).<ref name=\"Jeffery, Yvonne 2008\"/> Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth's surface, making its production cost-effective.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\n[[Biomass power]] is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/><ref>Brown, Lester Russell.

Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the [[greenhouse effect]]. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\n==Food==\nGlobally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income<sup><ref name=\"Ivanova\"/></sup>.\n\n===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===\n\n[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today's mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.<ref>Brown, Lester R.

Norton, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===\n\n[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].<ref>Heinberg, Richard.

''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.</ref>\n\n===Local and seasonal foods===\n\nA more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/> Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\">Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.</ref> Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\">Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.</ref> Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious.

New York: MIT Press, 2005.</ref> [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.<ref name=\"Todd, J 1994\">Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.</ref>  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.<ref>Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.</ref> Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/>\n\n===Reducing meat consumption===\n\n[[Industrial meat production]] also involves high [[environmental cost]]s such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and [[resource depletion|depletion]] of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\"/> Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing [[meat consumption]], perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\"/>\n\n===Organic farming===\n\nPurchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as \"an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.\" Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].<ref>[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008.

[[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]\nIn addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[Residential garden|home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.<ref>Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.</ref> With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.<ref>Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.</ref> In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.<ref>Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia\u2019s Garden''.

Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.<ref>Ciperthwaite, Wm.

Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]].

Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].

Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth's total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\">Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.</ref> Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.\n\n===Indoor home appliances===\n\nHousing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America's freshwater withdrawals.<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\"/>  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\"/> This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.\n\n====Toilets====\n\n[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor [[water use]] in the United States in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program.

Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.</ref>\nA home's toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.\n\nIn installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.<ref>[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref> It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.<ref>[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].\n\nAdditionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.\n\n====Showers====\n\nOn average, [[shower]]s were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature. [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).\n\n====Dishwashers and sinks====\n\nOn average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.\n\nIn addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, \"A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.\n\nOn average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a \"low flow\" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n====Washing machines====\n\nOn average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.\n\n===Outdoor water use===\n\nThere are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.\n\n====Conserving water====\n\nIn planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area. [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 \u2013 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.\n\nAfter planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]]. When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 \u2013 50% less water than conventional methods.<ref>Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: \"Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation,\" Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.</ref> Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.<ref>[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].\n\nIn caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.\n\n====Sequestering water====\n\nA common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity. A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:\n\nCollection area (square feet) \u00d7 Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year\n\nCubic Feet/Year \u00d7 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year\n\nNote, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010</ref>\n\n[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\">[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water].

In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.<ref name=\"HawkenPaul\" /> Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.\n\nThere are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies\u00ae|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010</ref>\n\nBy reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.\n\n[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.

Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.<ref>Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.</ref> Sometimes, they are [[off-the-grid]] homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.\n\nIf not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a [[power plant]] that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: [[net metering]] and double metering.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their [[renewable energy]], sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.<ref name=\"Hamilton, Andy 2009\"/> Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\"/>  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.<ref name=\"Hamilton, Andy 2009\"/> \u201cSuperwindows,\u201d mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.<ref>Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins.

[[Green roofs]] or \u201cliving roofs\u201d are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical \u201cfootprint\u201d that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building's presence.<ref>Cutlip, Jamie.

Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer [[green energy]], for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment].

This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility's effort in producing sustainable energy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton.

In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.<ref>Galbraith, Kate.

Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power].

The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.</ref> The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a [[direct current]] and has to be converted to [[alternating current]] before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/><ref name=\"Jeffery, Yvonne 2008\">Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.</ref>\n\n[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).<ref>[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.</ref>\n\nOther methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).\n\n[[Wind power]] is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20\u2019 or 6m with 10\u2018 or 3m diameter blades for an individual household's needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&nbsp;mi/hr (14&nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30\u2019 (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nFor those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n[[Geothermal energy]] production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth's surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth's surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).<ref name=\"Jeffery, Yvonne 2008\"/> Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth's surface, making its production cost-effective.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\n[[Biomass power]] is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/><ref>Brown, Lester Russell.

Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the [[greenhouse effect]]. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\n==Food==\nGlobally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income<sup><ref name=\"Ivanova\"/></sup>.\n\n===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===\n\n[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today's mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.<ref>Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. W.W. Norton, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===\n\n[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].<ref>Heinberg, Richard. ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World''.

''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.</ref>\n\n===Local and seasonal foods===\n\nA more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/> Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\">Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.</ref> Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\">Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.</ref> Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.<ref>Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.</ref> [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.<ref name=\"Todd, J 1994\">Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.</ref>  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.<ref>Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.</ref> Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/>\n\n===Reducing meat consumption===\n\n[[Industrial meat production]] also involves high [[environmental cost]]s such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and [[resource depletion|depletion]] of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\"/> Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing [[meat consumption]], perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\"/>\n\n===Organic farming===\n\nPurchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as \"an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.\" Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].<ref>[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008. Web. Retrieved on: 18 November 2010.</ref> Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See [[organic certification]] for more information.\n\n===Urban gardening===\n[[File:Ganjiaxiang - edible landscaping - P1070640.JPG|thumb|\"Edible landscaping\": a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park. [[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]\nIn addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[Residential garden|home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.<ref>Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.</ref> With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.<ref>Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.</ref> In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.<ref>Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia\u2019s Garden''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2000.</ref> Aesthetically pleasing [[edible landscaping]] plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc.<ref name=\"Todd, J 1994\"/> With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: [[composting]], [[biological pest control]], [[crop rotation]], [[mulching]], [[drip irrigation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[permaculture]].<ref>Warde, Jon, ed. ''The Backyard Builder: Over 150 Projects for Your Garden, Home and Yard''. New York:  Random House, 1994.</ref> For more information on sustainable farming systems, see [[sustainable agriculture]].\n\n===Food preservation and storage===\n\nPreserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.<ref>Ciperthwaite, Wm.

Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]]. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car [[mobilization]] and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.<ref name=\"Brown, Lester R. 2009\">Brown, Lester R.

Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city [[infrastructure]] and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.<ref name=\"Brown, Lester R. 2009\" />  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.\n\n==Water==\n{{Contradicts other|date=December 2013|1=Water efficiency}}\n{{main|Water efficiency}}\nA major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, [[water]]. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth's total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\">Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.</ref> Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.\n\n===Indoor home appliances===\n\nHousing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America's freshwater withdrawals.<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\"/>  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\"/> This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.\n\n====Toilets====\n\n[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program.

Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.</ref>\nA home's toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.\n\nIn installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.<ref>[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group.

A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.<ref>[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].\n\nAdditionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.\n\n====Showers====\n\nOn average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature. [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).\n\n====Dishwashers and sinks====\n\nOn average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.\n\nIn addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, \"A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.\n\nOn average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a \"low flow\" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n====Washing machines====\n\nOn average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.\n\n===Outdoor water use===\n\nThere are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.\n\n====Conserving water====\n\nIn planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area. [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 \u2013 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.\n\nAfter planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]]. When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 \u2013 50% less water than conventional methods.<ref>Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: \"Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation,\" Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.</ref> Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.<ref>[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].\n\nIn caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.\n\n====Sequestering water====\n\nA common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity. A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:\n\nCollection area (square feet) \u00d7 Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year\n\nCubic Feet/Year \u00d7 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year\n\nNote, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010</ref>\n\n[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\">[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water]. Green Building Supply. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\"/>  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\"/>\n\n==Waste==\n\nAs populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] of [[carbon dioxide]], leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and [[methane emissions]].  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.<ref name=\"HawkenPaul\" /> Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.\n\nThere are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies\u00ae|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010</ref>\n\nBy reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.\n\n[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes \u2013 Resource Conservation \u2013 Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010</ref>  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.<ref>[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management. Presidio Graduate School. Web. 10 November 2010</ref> By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Environment|Earth sciences|Ecology|Renewable Energy|Energy}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Circles of Sustainability]]\n* [[Citizen science#Plastics and pollution|Citizen Science]], cleanup projects that people can take part in.\n*[[Cradle-to-cradle design]]\n*[[Circular economy]]\n*[[Climate-friendly gardening]]\n*[[Downshifting (lifestyle)|Downshifting]]\n*[[Eco-communalism]]\n*[[Ecodesign]]\n*[[Ecological economics]]\n*[[Ethical consumerism]]\n*[[Foodscaping]]\n*[[Frugality]]\n*[[Simple living]]\n*[[Sustainability]]\n*[[Sustainable architecture]]\n*[[Sustainable design]]\n*[[Sustainable development]]\n*[[Sustainable event management]]\n*[[Sustainable landscaping]]\n*[[Sustainable House Day]] (in Australia)\n*[[Permaculture]]\n*[[The Venus Project]]\n*[[Transition Towns]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://inherit.eu/ INHERIT Project], a [[Horizon 2020]] Project to identify ways of living, moving and consuming that protect the environment and promote health and health equity.\n<!-- This is not a section to advertise a website, product, event or forum related to sustainable living.

The tournament is played annually at the [[ASB Tennis Centre]], in [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]]. It is part of the [[ATP World Tour 250 series]] of the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) World Tour. The tournament is held annually in January a week before the first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament of the season, the [[Australian Open]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1920 when the Auckland Lawn Tennis Association (now Tennis Auckland) was looking for a permanent base, the only available site was a tip in Stanley Street. Undeterred, the local clubs raised the-then enormous sum of 1,800 pounds to prepare the site and build new [[tennis court|court]]s. For the next 30 years the [[ASB Bank]] Tennis Centre in Stanley Street was home to hard-fought local tennis matches. In 1956 Auckland hosted its first permanent international [[tournament]], the 'Auckland Championship'. The tournament was a joint men's and women's event until 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our tennis open|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/sport/our-tennis-open/|publisher=[[New Zealand Listener]]|author=Joseph Romanos|date=8 January 2005 |website=NOTED.co.nz}}</ref> \n\nFrom 1969, the first edition in the open era of tennis, until 1995 the tournament was known under its sponsored name 'Benson and Hedges Open'. From 1998 until 2015 it was named the 'Heineken Open'.<ref name=\"nzherald\">{{cite web|title=Tennis: Net profits the name of the game|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=585146|website=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=5 January 2002}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s the shuttle bus fare from town to Stanley Street was sixpence. Admission was five shillings for the first three days and 7/6 for finals and semifinals \u2013 a whole tournament for the equivalent of $4. By the 1970s, 25 cents got you all-day parking next door at [[Carlaw Park]]. The tournament was played on outdoor [[grass court]]s from its inaugural edition in 1956 until 1977, switching to hard courts in 1978. Between 1979 and 1989 it was a tournament of the [[Grand Prix tennis circuit]].\n\nAfter being separated for 34 years, the WTA and ATP merged the event in 2016 and both tournaments are now known collectively as the ASB Classic. [[Heineken]] will still be a sponsor but will have a diminished role in anticipation of new tennis regulations restricting alcohol sponsorship.<ref name=\"merge\">{{cite web | website=Tennisnews.com |

[[tennis]] tournament in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The tournament is played annually at the [[ASB Tennis Centre]], in [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]]. It is part of the [[ATP World Tour 250 series]] of the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) World Tour. The tournament is held annually in January a week before the first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament of the season, the [[Australian Open]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1920 when the Auckland Lawn Tennis Association (now Tennis Auckland) was looking for a permanent base, the only available site was a tip in Stanley Street. Undeterred, the local clubs raised the-then enormous sum of 1,800 pounds to prepare the site and build new [[tennis court|court]]s. For the next 30 years the [[ASB Bank]] Tennis Centre in Stanley Street was home to hard-fought local tennis matches. In 1956 Auckland hosted its first permanent international [[tournament]], the 'Auckland Championship'. The tournament was a joint men's and women's event until 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our tennis open|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/sport/our-tennis-open/|publisher=[[New Zealand Listener]]|author=Joseph Romanos|date=8 January 2005 |website=NOTED.co.nz}}</ref> \n\nFrom 1969, the first edition in the open era of tennis, until 1995 the tournament was known under its sponsored name 'Benson and Hedges Open'. From 1998 until 2015 it was named the 'Heineken Open'.<ref name=\"nzherald\">{{cite web|title=Tennis: Net profits the name of the game|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=585146|website=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=5 January 2002}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s the shuttle bus fare from town to Stanley Street was sixpence. Admission was five shillings for the first three days and 7/6 for finals and semifinals \u2013 a whole tournament for the equivalent of $4. By the 1970s, 25 cents got you all-day parking next door at [[Carlaw Park]]. The tournament was played on outdoor [[grass court]]s from its inaugural edition in 1956 until 1977, switching to hard courts in 1978. Between 1979 and 1989 it was a tournament of the [[Grand Prix tennis circuit]].\n\nAfter being separated for 34 years, the WTA and ATP merged the event in 2016 and both tournaments are now known collectively as the ASB Classic. [[Heineken]] will still be a sponsor but will have a diminished role in anticipation of new tennis regulations restricting alcohol sponsorship.<ref name=\"merge\">{{cite web | website=Tennisnews.com |

In 2009, the series was renamed to the [[ATP World Tour 250 series]] status, which the Stuttgart Open has retained ever since.\n\nHeld since 1916 in [[Stuttgart]], Germany, the Stuttgart Open was played on clay up to and including 2014. Starting in 2015, the tournament is played on grass. Along with the move to [[grass court]]s, the tournament  is now staged in the week after the French Open finishes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stuttgart to make switch to grass courts in

'''Stuttgart Open'''{{efn|name=eurocard open|Not to be confused with the [[Eurocard Open]]. The Stuttgart Open has always been played outdoors, while the Eurocard Open was a tournament that was played indoors in Stuttgart from 1988\u20132001, with the exception of 1995 when it was played in [[Essen]]. The Eurocard Open was also the eighth [[ATP Masters Series|Super 9]] event on the [[ATP Tour]] from 1995\u20132001.}} (currently sponsored by Mercedes Benz and called the MercedesCup) is an [[ATP World Tour 250 series]] [[tennis]] [[tournament]] on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP Tour]]. Between 1970 and 1989, the Stuttgart Open was a [[Grand Prix tennis circuit]] event. From 1990 to 1999, the Stuttgart Open was an [[ATP Championship Series]] tournament. The Championship Series name was changed to [[ATP International Series Gold]] in 2000, and the Stuttgart Open was a part of this series from 2000\u20132001 and 2003\u20132008. In 2002, the Stuttgart Open was briefly demoted for one year to [[ATP International Series]] status. In 2009, the series was renamed to the [[ATP World Tour 250 series]] status, which the Stuttgart Open has retained ever since.\n\nHeld since 1916 in [[Stuttgart]], Germany, the Stuttgart Open was played on clay up to and including 2014. Starting in 2015, the tournament is played on grass. Along with the move to [[grass court]]s, the tournament  is now staged in the week after the French Open finishes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stuttgart to make switch to grass courts in

Massacre of the [[Jews of Poland]], [[Belarus]], and today's Ukraine occurred throughout the rebellion, which lasted for many years and during the [[Russo-Polish War]] (1654-1667) and the small northern war with the [[Swedish Empire]] that ignited them. Nevertheless, the sudden destruction of many communities from the beginning of April\u2013May 1648 (Iyar 1848), until the cessation of the Cossacks' progress in November of that year, is the named source. According to the historian Adam Teller: \"In the Jewish collective memory, the events in the summer and autumn of 1648 define the uprising in general, and therefore the riots were known as the 1848s.\" Thousands were slaughtered or died of starvation and epidemics, and many others fled, sold into slavery, or converted. The number of Jews killed by the Cossack rebels in 1648 was estimated at a few thousand to 20,000 at most; It is estimated that all the parties - the Cossacks, the Russians, the Swedes, their allies and the Poles themselves who massacred them on suspicion of collaborating with the invaders - killed between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews in total.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1569, with the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], large land tracts (of today's Ukraine) were transferred from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] to the rule of the Kingdom of Poland. The aristocracy, which enjoyed independence and even chose the king, controlled the area that had been ruled until then by the [[Tatars]] from the [[Crimea]]. In the territories western to the [[Dnieper River]], tens of thousands of people from the rest of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] came to settle down. The great [[Magnates]], which most of them were descendants of the local aristocracy, established vast agricultural estates and imposed strict rules on the local Ruthenian peasants.\n\nAmong the settlers, there were many [[Jews]]. They were pushed from [[Poland]] itself under the pressure of city residents who wanted to reduce the economic competition. Many of the [[Jews]] were employed by the nobility as [[leases]] and estate managers. Dozens of new communities were established in [[Ukraine]], mainly on the right bank (western area) of the [[Dnieper]]. The eastern side was a somewhat wild area. It was closer to the [[Crimea]] and dangerous to settlement, although some estates and cities were there and drew [[Jews]] looking for jobs. Southern to where the river bends, lived the [[Cossacks]] from the  [[Zaporozhian Sich]], a semi-nomadic society that maintained a routine of constant fighting with the [[Tatars]]. The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] maintained strained relations with the [[Cossacks]] and tried to subordinate them to its authority while exploiting them for military usage.\n\nThe nobility mercilessly brutalized the general population and especially the [[serfs]]. The economic and social tension, which also led to strong hostility towards Jewish lessees, had gotten worse due to religious reasons. At the end of the 16th century, in the framework of the counter-reformation, the [[Jesuits]] have reached the area. Although they intended to fight any manifestation of Protestantism, they soon turned their attention to the [[Ruthenians]], which almost all were Orthodox Christians. [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (King Sigismund III) was a devout Catholic, as were most of the Polish nobles. Under these pressures, many of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobles converted to Catholicism. Similar attempts, which were also expressed in establishing a local Uniate church and the persecution of Orthodox priests who refused to join it, were made towards the common people. The local's rage for all this was quickly channeled into acts of rebellion led by the [[Cossacks]], who were experienced fighters and they rebelled eight times between 1592 and 1638.\n\nIn the 19th century, with the creation of [[Ukrainian nationalism]], many historians tried to describe the conflict between a local [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] independence movement and foreign Polish nobility and its Jewish servants. The great [[Magnates]] in the region were, in fact, mostly Catholics or Unites, but they were descendants of the original inhabitants, such as the [[Ostrogski family]]. The [[Voivode]] [[Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki]] (the Vishnotzky Duke of the book \" The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)\", in Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05b5\u05df \u05de\u05b0\u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4) was the son of a well-known Orthodox family and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. There are reports of cooperation between Jews and locals against the nobility and the Jews participation in Cossack raids. Like all the townspeople in the area, the Jews were obliged to participate in defending the towns in case of a siege. In the East Bank, many were obliged to carry the weapon in case of Tartar attacks.\n\n== The Events ==\n\n=== The Outbreak of the Uprising ===\n{{Main|1=Khmelnytsky Uprising}}One of the victims of the landowners was a local junior nobleman named Bogdan Khmelnytsky. In early 1647, his property and his intended fianc\u00e9 were taken (and according to a single report, his ten-year-old son was murdered) by Daniel Czaplinski, apparently the deputy of the magnate Alexander Koniecpolski. When Bogdan Khmelnytsky turned to the courts and didn\u2019t receive any response, a great rebellion began to develop, which was much bigger the previous ones.\n\nIn the spring of 1648, Khmelnitsky, who was appointed to be the Ataman (officer) of the Zapurozi, led an army of Cossacks against the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. He made an alliance with the Tatars, who provided him with 4,000 cavalry under the command of Tugai Bay. In April he crossed the Dnieper with his army and won two crushing victories against the crown forces, one on the Yellow River on May 15 and the other in Kurson on the 26th.\n\nThe news of his victories sparked a huge uprising among the people throughout the country. The Cossacks and the masses massacred the Jews, nobles, Catholics, and Uniates wherever they reached. The disturbances spread to southern of today's Belarus, and the Cossack troops reached Pinsk. The eastern bank of the Dnieper, where the population was almost entirely Orthodox and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's presence was weak, fell without a real struggle. The following day after the victory in Kurson, on the first day of Shavuot (a Jewish holiday), on May 27, 1648, began a mass deportation of the Jews in the surrounding districts to the fortified cities, desecrating the holiday. About the same time, Yirmi Vishniewiecki withdrew from his estates in Lubny with his own army and took with him several hundred of Jews along with the other refugees. He kept gathering Jewish people on the way.\n\nNathan Neta Hanover, whose book \" ''The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)'' \" is the best-known chronicle of events, described what he heard about the riots in the eastern bank that fell into the hands of the rebels:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"many communities beyond the Dnieper, and close to the battle field, such as Pereyaslaw, Baryszowka, Piratyn, and Boryspole, Lubin and Lachowce and their neighbors, who were unable to escape, perished for the sanctification of His Name. These persons died cruel and bitter deaths. Some were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chopped off, and their bodies thrown on the highway only to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some had wounds inflicted upon them, and thrown on the street to die a slow death; they writhed in their blood until they breathed their last; others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in the laps of their mothers. They were sliced into pieces like fish. They slashed the bellies of pregnant women, removed their infants and tossed them in their faces. Some women had their bellies torn open and live cats placed in them. The bellies were then sewed up with the living cats remaining within. They chopped off the hands of the victims so that they would not be able to remove the cats from the bellies. The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears, roasted on the fire and then brought to their mothers to be eaten. Many times they used the bodies of Jewish children as improvised bridges upon which they later crossed. There was no cruel device of murder in the whole world that was not perpetrated by the enemies.\"|sign=[[Nathan Neta Hanover]]|source=\"[[The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)]]\", chapter IV}}\n\nOn the first day of June, Khmelnitsky's main camp was stopped at Bila Sarkawa and ceased moving westward. Yet, the masses in the territories that remained under the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth control continued to rebel. Some atamans (officers) Cossack, with the most dominant of them all- Maxim Krivonos, used their forces to support the acts of rebellion. On the tenth of June, 1648, Krivonos conquered the city of Nemyriv, where a large Jewish population had fortified. According to Hanover and other record-writers, he pretended to be a friendly force and flew flags of the Crown Army, while Cossack sources reported from inside. As soon as Nemyriv fell, the Cossacks slaughtered all the Catholics and the Jews inside. Hanover reported 6,000 Jews killed, an improbable number which was denied by modern historians but still provides a measure of destruction. Mordechai Nadav noted that events of the size of that in Pinsk, in which several dozen Jews were apparently killed during the invasion, were more typical of the events. Similar massacres took place in many other cities, such as Polona and Bar. In Nemyriv, the Jewish chronologists noted a mass refusal of Jews to offer the slaughterers to convert to Christianity and to be saved, although at the same time the Shakh (Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen) wrote that \"many Jews violated the covenant.\" A group of Jews which swore allegiance to the Cossacks and converted to Christianity rescued itself from the city after a short time, when Nemyriv fell into the hands of Vishniewitzky.\n\nOn June 18, Krivonos began a siege of Tulchyn, and broke through the wall on the 21st. The next day the fort fell. Then there was a time-out for several days and on June 26 the massacre took place. Hanover and others argued that the local commander, Duke Janusz Chetvartinsky, betrayed the Jews and gave them to the rioters while trying in vain to save his own life. Israel Halperin determined that there was no evidence of this and Chturtinsky probably tried to release all those who were inside by means of a bribe, but the Cossacks killed them all. He believed that the source of the rumor was because Cheturtinsky belonged to a devout Orthodox family and that is why the Catholics suspected him. Hannover noted that Jews were also offered to convert to Christianity, but they rejected it and chose death for the sanctification of God's Name. The historian Yechezkel Feram rejected Hannover's description and claimed that Hanover based on another person's testimony. Fram believed that the description was a distortion of the story \"cliff of the times\" about a similar sanction in Hommel that took place at the same time, on the 20th of June, 1648. Meir Meshbreshin reported that several rabbis urged the people to surrender and not to convert, and all of them were slaughtered, but this event is doubted as well.\n\nOthers like Hanover tended to link the sanctions of 1848-1988 to the Ashkenazi Kiddush tradition of the Middle Ages, from events such as the 1096 decrees of Blois from 1171. The day Nemyriv was conquered, 10 June 1648, is also the Memorial Day In memory of the victims of the Cossacks. Yet, there were no similar events like the mass suicide in the days of the Crusaders in 1650. Historian Jacob Katz tended to associate this to the erosion of the ideal of Kiddush Hashem (the sanctification of God's name through martyrdom) in the past centuries, but Feram wrote that it remained as strong as ever. The difference between the riots was due to external circumstances. Unlike the Crusaders, the rebellious Ruthenians had no organized policy of conversion: they classified anyone who was not Orthodox as an enemy, but did not intended to spread their own faith. Also, there are reports of Jews who converted to Christianity voluntarily and still were killed. The Eastern Church had no direct connection with the rioters. For their part, they dealt with looting and killing for their own sake, nobility, Catholics and Uniates as Jews. Paul of Aleppo, who visited the country a few years later, told of a desire for extermination. Even the masses, who were not familiar with the halakhic elements of the hour of annihilation but were well aware of the principle of a long tradition, viewed the events as a politic class struggle rather than an attempt to convert them, as many reports indicate, both from the chronicles and from testimonies to the courts after everything happened.\n\nIn September the noble armies suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Filabetsi, and in fact, there was no significant force remained until Warsaw itself. Khmelnytsky advanced toward Lviv and Zamo\u015b\u0107. In Lviv, the city's residents were offered to extradite the Jews in return for lifting the siege, but they refused. As in all other cities, the Jews took part in its defense. At the end of November, fearing a prolonged battle in the winter and after the new Polish-Lithuanian king offered him extensive concessions, Khmelnitsky retreated to Kiev. The fighting resumed at the end of May 1649, and continued intermittently for years to come. Large-scale killings were carried out against the Ukrainian Jews and the parts of Belarus that fell into the hands of the rebels. The number of people who converted to Christianity, which many of them kept their new religion even after the conquest of their homes by the crown's faithful soldiers, was big enough that on the 2nd of May, 1650, King Jan Kazimierz gave a special order that allows all those who wished it to return to Judaism. Many were captured by the Tartars. Among the Jews, it was thought that the Tartars were interested in any Jew in order to sell them in slavery markets. However, they often wanted only slaves who would provide a worthwhile price. These included young women, men of working age and children. There were cases in which the Ruthenian masses rejected the attempts to sell them slaves who were not included among these classifications. It was also reported that the elderly and other non-wanted slaves were separated from the captured prisoners and burned alive so that they would not burden the caravans. However, the Tartars did not take part in the massacres known as Tulchyn and Nemyriv; these were the work of Maksym Kryvonis. The Cossacks themselves did not take slaves but killed those who fell into their hands. The Jewish communities joined forces in the efforts to redeem the Jewish slaves, which were located mainly in the large market in Constantinople. Large donations were made throughout the Jewish world: a special tax was imposed by the Council of Four Lands in areas not affected by the revolt, the Karaites in the Ottoman capital raised donations, and the main help came from a slavery-redeeming company in Venice whose emissaries came as far as Hamburg and Amsterdam to request charity. With these funds and its official delegate, the community of Constantinople redeemed 1,500 people by July 1651, in exchange for a total amount of 150,000 Spanish reais. The stream then decreased and in total there were 2,000 redeemed people in 1648, some in distant markets such as Persia and Algiers.\n\nThe number of Jewish victims was evaluated as great. Samuel Ben-Nathan Feidel, in his book from 1650, counted 281 communities destroyed and claimed that six hundred thousand Jews were killed. The Shakh on the other hand, noted that there were one thousand. Menashe Ben Israel wrote to Oliver Cromwell that there were one hundred and eighty thousand. Although in the 20th century, Isaac Schifer estimated that there were three hundred thousand killed or taken prisoner from 1648 to -1655. Modern research has greatly reduced estimates of the victims of the massacres: Professor Shmuel Ettinger estimated the entire Jewish population of Ukraine in 1648 at -51,325 persons, based on documents from that period. Prof. Shaul Stampfer claimed that there were 40,000, stating that \"'''at most 50% (20,000) and perhaps much less'''\" than those who died at the outbreak of the revolt in 1648.\n\n===  Additional disputes  ===\nIn 1654 Tsardom of Russia gave Suzerainty to Khmelnytsky and their armies invaded together into the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, both in Ukraine and in the north, in Belarus and Lithuania. At the beginning of August 1655 Vilna fell into the hands of the occupier and a mass slaughter was carried out, although the reports showed that most of the Jews had managed to escape in time. In October, Lublin was captured, where the chronicles cite about 2,000 Jews who died. It was the greatest disaster of the new battle. The historian Dov Weinryb, based both on Polish records and on personal reports, stated that the correct number was probably several hundred. The Russians also tended to take many prisoners, and a new wave of Jewish slaves reached the markets in 1665 and 1656. Once again, a great effort began to raise funds for their redemption.\n\nIn the summer of 1655 invaded a new enemy to the republic, the Swedish Empire led by King Carl Gustav. This war was the most destructive of all the struggles between Poland and Lithuania. It is still estimated to be worse than World War II in terms of the relative damage caused to the country. In what became known as the \"Swedish Flood,\" the most affluent and populated areas of Poland were completely destroyed. The circumstances led to great hunger that year. Jewish reports staged the invaders as sympathetic towards them. Although they did not take special action against them except for a random killing, many Jews, together with the rest of the people, died of starvation, epidemics and sword. For example, the Jewish quarter of Kazimierz in Krak\u00f3w was completely destroyed by the siege on the city in September\u2013October 1655 and the survivors fled to Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was almost collapsing: Many nobles believed that Karl Gustav would do them good and change sides with their armies. The magnate Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142 swore allegiance in return for protection from the Russians and cut off Lithuania from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. But the scales were tipped by the massacres and looting of the Swedes, and especially by the awakening of Catholic sentiment with the successful defense of the Jesna Gora Monastery since November. The Pi\u0142sudski (a family of nobility that originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and increased in notability under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Second Polish Republic) began to resent the Swedish king, who neglected their affairs, and most of them renewed their loyalty to Jan Kazimierz. The masses of the people and the minor nobility, headed by Hetman Stefan Czerniecki, launched a guerilla war against the Lutheran conquerors. In the fall of 1656, the Czar estimated that Sweden might become too strong and started supporting the King of Poland.\n\nThe rebels, driven also by the betrayal of the Calvinist Radziwill, ran what they perceived as a struggle for the Catholic Church. Lutherans, Calvinists, neo-Aryans, Orthodox and Jews were all marked as enemies and suspected of collaborating with the Swedes. Different militias and the Crown Forces massacred them frequently. On January 22, 1656, the king confiscated the remains of Kazimierz and gave all the looting that could be extracted from it to the army after declaring that the Jews had cooperated with the enemy. In February 1656, Czerniecki killed 600 Jews, according to the records, when he liberated Sandomierz Castle. Poland, Lithuania and Sweden signed a peace agreement in 1660, and the fighting between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and Moscow resumed. It continued on a relatively limited scale until signing the Truce of Andrusovo Agreement in 1667, which brought tranquility to the kingdom for the first time in 19 years. The Lithuanian communities paid a large sum to include in the contract a clause allowing all Jewish prisoners in Russia, with the exception of converts and women who were married, to return home.\n\nThe historian Dov Weinryb wrote that according to records about the size of Jewish communities in the 1970s and 1980s, which together with other data indicate that many survived by conversion or immigration, \"a reasonable estimate\" of all Jews killed - By the sword, by all sides, and by epidemics and famine - during the turbulent period that swept Poland from 1648 to 1677, \"will be between 40,000 and 50,000, although historians point to far larger estimates, which are high enough to include between a fifth and a quarter of the Jewish population In Poland and Lithuania on the eve of the uprising. \"\n\n===  Following the Sanctions  ===\n[[File:Hebrewbooks_org_42621_520.jpg|right|thumb|312x312px|''\"El Maleh Rahamim\"'' in memory of the victims of the sanctions of 1096 and the sanctions of the Cossack riots.]]\nThe chaos that was in Poland following the sanctions brought the leaders of the communities and their rabbis into taking steps regarding the welfare of the refugees, both in material aid and in halachic discussions to allow a second marriage to women whose husbands had been lost. The problem of women whose husbands had been lost reached distant courts in communities where captives were redeemed and wanted to remarry. In Cairo, in a case cited in the \"Divrei Noam\", a group of women sent a messenger to Poland who returned with divorce documents from all their husbands.\n\nThe generation who lived at that time debated the question whether the sanctions were shedding clean blood for the sins of the House of Israel or punishment from god. Many adopted the first statement, but pamphlets published in Europe blamed the Polish Jewry of committing sins such as: loan interest, Folk distribution of Kabbalah books to the masses, raising pigs for non-Jews, lawlessness and more. The massive flight to the west also led to the renewed growth of the Holy Roman Empire as an important Torah center, after years of standing in the shadow of its neighbor to the east. Researchers in the past have frequently related the pogroms as a catalyst for the rise of Sabbateanism. Sarah, the wife of Shabtai Zvi, also became orphaned during it. Although this assertion lost its validity over time, Israel Halpern believed that the effort to raise funds for the redemption of captives throughout the continent hastened the horrific news of the events to the entire Diaspora and played an important role.\n\nIn memory of the heavy mourning, the rabbis decreed banquets and fancy costumes. Wearing silk and velvet was forbidden for three years. Women were forbidden to wear gold chains and gems for three years. It was forbidden to sing songs of joy for one year, except for wedding ceremonies, and the authority was given by the leaders of each community to extend the validity of the prohibitions for additional years.\n\nIn February 1650 The Council of Four Lands assembled in Lublin, where it was declared that the Memorial Day for the sanctions in Blois and for the day that nemyriv fell will be on the 10th of June, 1648 (20th of Sivan- a month from the Jewish calendar) In memory of the victims. Lamentations and special prayers were written to be said on this day. Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller then corrected the lament of ''\"Ella Ezekara in Third Tears\"'' for those who perished. In addition, various versions of the prayer ''\"El Malei Rachamim\"'' (a Jewish prayer for the soul of a person who has died, usually recited at the graveside during the burial service and at memorial services during the year) were also composed, to be recited on the 20th of Sivan, on Yom Kippur, on the Sabbath preceding Shavuot and on Shabbat Chazon.\n\nDespite its many inaccuracies, ''\"Abyss of Despair\"'' has become a historical memory because of the high quality of Hanover's writing. It was published in more than twenty editions in several languages, and remained a major source until the 20th century. The sanctions of 1648 are mentioned in several literary works in Hebrew. The most famous of them are: ''\"The Slave\"'' by Isaac Bashevis Singer, ''\"The Nazarene\"'' by Shalom Asch, ''\"A City In Its Fullness\"'' by SY Agnon and the Ballad ''\"the Rabbi's daughter\"'' by Shaul Tchernichovsky.\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Amelia Glaser (editor).

Massacre of the [[Jews of Poland]], [[Belarus]], and today's Ukraine occurred throughout the rebellion, which lasted for many years and during the [[Russo-Polish War]] (1654-1667) and the small northern war with the [[Swedish Empire]] that ignited them. Nevertheless, the sudden destruction of many communities from the beginning of April\u2013May 1648 (Iyar 1848), until the cessation of the Cossacks' progress in November of that year, is the named source. According to the historian Adam Teller: \"In the Jewish collective memory, the events in the summer and autumn of 1648 define the uprising in general, and therefore the riots were known as the 1848s.\" Thousands were slaughtered or died of starvation and epidemics, and many others fled, sold into slavery, or converted. The number of Jews killed by the Cossack rebels in 1648 was estimated at a few thousand to 20,000 at most; It is estimated that all the parties - the Cossacks, the Russians, the Swedes, their allies and the Poles themselves who massacred them on suspicion of collaborating with the invaders - killed between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews in total.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1569, with the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], large land tracts (of today's Ukraine) were transferred from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] to the rule of the Kingdom of Poland. The aristocracy, which enjoyed independence and even chose the king, controlled the area that had been ruled until then by the [[Tatars]] from the [[Crimea]]. In the territories western to the [[Dnieper River]], tens of thousands of people from the rest of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] came to settle down. The great [[Magnates]], which most of them were descendants of the local aristocracy, established vast agricultural estates and imposed strict rules on the local Ruthenian peasants.\n\nAmong the settlers, there were many [[Jews]]. They were pushed from [[Poland]] itself under the pressure of city residents who wanted to reduce the economic competition. Many of the [[Jews]] were employed by the nobility as [[leases]] and estate managers. Dozens of new communities were established in [[Ukraine]], mainly on the right bank (western area) of the [[Dnieper]]. The eastern side was a somewhat wild area. It was closer to the [[Crimea]] and dangerous to settlement, although some estates and cities were there and drew [[Jews]] looking for jobs. Southern to where the river bends, lived the [[Cossacks]] from the  [[Zaporozhian Sich]], a semi-nomadic society that maintained a routine of constant fighting with the [[Tatars]]. The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] maintained strained relations with the [[Cossacks]] and tried to subordinate them to its authority while exploiting them for military usage.\n\nThe nobility mercilessly brutalized the general population and especially the [[serfs]]. The economic and social tension, which also led to strong hostility towards Jewish lessees, had gotten worse due to religious reasons. At the end of the 16th century, in the framework of the counter-reformation, the [[Jesuits]] have reached the area. Although they intended to fight any manifestation of Protestantism, they soon turned their attention to the [[Ruthenians]], which almost all were Orthodox Christians. [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (King Sigismund III) was a devout Catholic, as were most of the Polish nobles. Under these pressures, many of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobles converted to Catholicism. Similar attempts, which were also expressed in establishing a local Uniate church and the persecution of Orthodox priests who refused to join it, were made towards the common people. The local's rage for all this was quickly channeled into acts of rebellion led by the [[Cossacks]], who were experienced fighters and they rebelled eight times between 1592 and 1638.\n\nIn the 19th century, with the creation of [[Ukrainian nationalism]], many historians tried to describe the conflict between a local [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] independence movement and foreign Polish nobility and its Jewish servants. The great [[Magnates]] in the region were, in fact, mostly Catholics or Unites, but they were descendants of the original inhabitants, such as the [[Ostrogski family]]. The [[Voivode]] [[Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki]] (the Vishnotzky Duke of the book \" The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)\", in Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05b5\u05df \u05de\u05b0\u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4) was the son of a well-known Orthodox family and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. There are reports of cooperation between Jews and locals against the nobility and the Jews participation in Cossack raids. Like all the townspeople in the area, the Jews were obliged to participate in defensing the towns in case of a siege. In the East Bank, many were obliged to carry the weapon in case of Tartar attacks.\n\n== The Events ==\n\n=== The Outbreak of the Uprising ===\n{{Main|1=Khmelnytsky Uprising}}One of the victims of the landowners was a local junior nobleman named Bogdan Khmelnytsky. In early 1647, his property and his intended fianc\u00e9 were taken (and according to a single report, his ten-year-old son was murdered) by Daniel Czaplinski, apparently the deputy of the magnate Alexander Koniecpolski. When Bogdan Khmelnytsky turned to the courts and didn\u2019t receive any response, a great rebellion began to develop, which was much bigger the previous ones.\n\nIn the spring of 1648, Khmelnitsky, who was appointed to be the Ataman (officer) of the Zapurozi, led an army of Cossacks against the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. He made an alliance with the Tatars, who provided him with 4,000 cavalry under the command of Tugai Bay. In April he crossed the Dnieper with his army and won two crushing victories against the crown forces, one on the Yellow River on May 15 and the other in Kurson on the 26th.\n\nThe news of his victories sparked a huge uprising among the people throughout the country. The Cossacks and the masses massacred the Jews, nobles, Catholics, and Uniates wherever they reached. The disturbances spread to southern of today's Belarus, and the Cossack troops reached Pinsk. The eastern bank of the Dnieper, where the population was almost entirely Orthodox and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's presence was weak, fell without a real struggle. The following day after the victory in Kurson, on the first day of Shavuot (a Jewish holiday), on May 27, 1648, began a mass deportation of the Jews in the surrounding districts to the fortified cities, desecrating the holiday. About the same time, Yirmi Vishniewiecki withdrew from his estates in Lubny with his own army and took with him several hundred of Jews along with the other refugees. He kept gathering Jewish people on the way.\n\nNathan Neta Hanover, whose book \" ''The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)'' \" is the best-known chronicle of events, described what he heard about the riots in the eastern bank that fell into the hands of the rebels:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"many communities beyond the Dnieper, and close to the battle field, such as Pereyaslaw, Baryszowka, Piratyn, and Boryspole, Lubin and Lachowce and their neighbors, who were unable to escape, perished for the sanctification of His Name. These persons died cruel and bitter deaths. Some were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chopped off, and their bodies thrown on the highway only to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some has wounds inflicted upon them, and thrown on the street to die a slow death; they writhed in their blood until they breathed their last; others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in the laps of their mothers. They were sliced into pieces like fish. They slashed the bellies of pregnant women, removed their infants and tossed them in their faces. Some women had their bellies torn open and live cats placed in them. The bellies were then sewed up with the living cats remaining within. They chopped off the hands of the victims so that they would not be able to remove the cats from the bellies. The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears, roasted on the fire and then brought to their mothers to be eaten. Many times they used the bodies of Jewish children as improvised bridges upon which they later crossed. There was no cruel device of murder in the whole world that was not perpetrated by the enemies.\"|sign=[[Nathan Neta Hanover]]|source=\"[[The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)]]\", chapter IV}}\n\nOn the first day of June, Khmelnitsky's main camp was stopped at Bila Sarkawa and ceased moving westward. Yet, the masses in the territories that remained under the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth control continued to rebel. Some atamans (officers) Cossack, with the most dominant of them all- Maxim Krivonos, used their forces to support the acts of rebellion. On the tenth of June, 1648, Krivonos conquered the city of Nemyriv, where a large Jewish population had fortified. According to Hanover and other record-writers, he pretended to be a friendly force and flew flags of the Crown Army, while Cossack sources reported from inside. As soon as Nemyriv fell, the Cossacks slaughtered all the Catholics and the Jews inside. Hanover reported 6,000 Jews killed, an improbable number which was denied by modern historians but still provides a measure of destruction. Mordechai Nadav noted that events of the size of that in Pinsk, in which several dozen Jews were apparently killed during the invasion, were more typical of the events. Similar massacres took place in many other cities, such as Polona and Bar. In Nemyriv, the Jewish chronologists noted a mass refusal of Jews to offer the slaughterers to convert to Christianity and to be saved, although at the same time the Shakh (Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen) wrote that \"many Jews violated the covenant.\" A group of Jews which swore allegiance to the Cossacks and converted to Christianity rescued itself from the city after a short time, when Nemyriv fell into the hands of Vishniewitzky.\n\nOn June 18, Krivonos began a siege of Tulchyn, and broke through the wall on the 21st. The next day the fort fell. Then there was a time-out for several days and on June 26 the massacre took place. Hanover and others argued that the local commander, Duke Janusz Chetvartinsky, betrayed the Jews and gave them to the rioters while trying in vain to save his own life. Israel Halperin determined that there was no evidence of this and Chturtinsky probably tried to release all those who were inside by means of a bribe, but the Cossacks killed them all. He believed that the source of the rumor was because Cheturtinsky belonged to a devout Orthodox family and that is why the Catholics suspected him. Hannover noted that Jews were also offered to convert to Christianity, but they rejected it and chose death for the sanctification of God's Name. The historian Yechezkel Feram rejected Hannover's description and claimed that Hanover based on another person's testimony. Fram believed that the description was a distortion of the story \"cliff of the times\" about a similar sanction in Hommel that took place at the same time, on the 20th of June, 1648. Meir Meshbreshin reported that several rabbis urged the people to surrender and not to convert, and all of them were slaughtered, but this event is doubted as well.\n\nOthers like Hanover tended to link the sanctions of 1848-1988 to the Ashkenazi Kiddush tradition of the Middle Ages, from events such as the 1096 decrees of Blois from 1171. The day Nemyriv was conquered, 10 June 1648, is also the Memorial Day In memory of the victims of the Cossacks. Yet, there were no similar events like the mass suicide in the days of the Crusaders in 1650. Historian Jacob Katz tended to associate this to the erosion of the ideal of Kiddush Hashem (the sanctification of God's name through martyrdom) in the past centuries, but Feram wrote that it remained as strong as ever. The difference between the riots was due to external circumstances. Unlike the Crusaders, the rebellious Ruthenians had no organized policy of conversion: they classified anyone who was not Orthodox as an enemy, but did not intended to spread their own faith. Also, there are reports of Jews who converted to Christianity voluntarily and still were killed. The Eastern Church had no direct connection with the rioters. For their part, they dealt with looting and killing for their own sake, nobility, Catholics and Uniates as Jews. Paul of Aleppo, who visited the country a few years later, told of a desire for extermination. Even the masses, who were not familiar with the halakhic elements of the hour of annihilation but were well aware of the principle of a long tradition, viewed the events as a politic class struggle rather than an attempt to convert them, as many reports indicate, both from the chronicles and from testimonies to the courts after everything happened.\n\nIn September the noble armies suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Filabetsi, and in fact, there was no significant force remained until Warsaw itself. Khmelnytsky advanced toward Lviv and Zamo\u015b\u0107. In Lviv, the city's residents were offered to extradite the Jews in return for lifting the siege, but they refused. As in all other cities, the Jews took part in its defense. At the end of November, fearing a prolonged battle in the winter and after the new Polish-Lithuanian king offered him extensive concessions, Khmelnitsky retreated to Kiev. The fighting resumed at the end of May 1649, and continued intermittently for years to come. Large-scale killings were carried out against the Ukrainian Jews and the parts of Belarus that fell into the hands of the rebels. The number of people who converted to Christianity, which many of them kept their new religion even after the conquest of their homes by the crown's faithful soldiers, was big enough that on the 2nd of May, 1650, King Jan Kazimierz gave a special order that allows all those who wished it to return to Judaism. Many were captured by the Tartars. Among the Jews, it was thought that the Tartars were interested in any Jew in order to sell them in slavery markets. However, they often wanted only slaves who would provide a worthwhile price. These included young women, men of working age and children. There were cases in which the Ruthenian masses rejected the attempts to sell them slaves who were not included among these classifications. It was also reported that the elderly and other non-wanted slaves were separated from the captured prisoners and burned alive so that they would not burden the caravans. However, the Tartars did not take part in the massacres known as Tulchyn and Nemyriv; these were the work of Maksym Kryvonis. The Cossacks themselves did not take slaves but killed those who fell into their hands. The Jewish communities joined forces in the efforts to redeem the Jewish slaves, which were located mainly in the large market in Constantinople. Large donations were made throughout the Jewish world: a special tax was imposed by the Council of Four Lands in areas not affected by the revolt, the Karaites in the Ottoman capital raised donations, and the main help came from a slavery-redeeming company in Venice whose emissaries came as far as Hamburg and Amsterdam to request charity. With these funds and its official delegate, the community of Constantinople redeemed 1,500 people by July 1651, in exchange for a total amount of 150,000 Spanish reais. The stream then decreased and in total there were 2,000 redeemed people in 1648, some in distant markets such as Persia and Algiers.\n\nThe number of Jewish victims was evaluated as great. Samuel Ben-Nathan Feidel, in his book from 1650, counted 281 communities destroyed and claimed that six hundred thousand Jews were killed. The Shakh on the other hand, noted that there were one thousand. Menashe Ben Israel wrote to Oliver Cromwell that there were one hundred and eighty thousand. Although in the 20th century, Isaac Schifer estimated that there were three hundred thousand killed or taken prisoner from 1648 to -1655. Modern research has greatly reduced estimates of the victims of the massacres: Professor Shmuel Ettinger estimated the entire Jewish population of Ukraine in 1648 at -51,325 persons, based on documents from that period. Prof. Shaul Stampfer claimed that there were 40,000, stating that \"'''at most 50% (20,000) and perhaps much less'''\" than those who died at the outbreak of the revolt in 1648.\n\n===  Additional disputes  ===\nIn 1654 Tsardom of Russia gave Suzerainty to Khmelnytsky and their armies invaded together into the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, both in Ukraine and in the north, in Belarus and Lithuania. At the beginning of August 1655 Vilna fell into the hands of the occupier and a mass slaughter was carried out, although the reports showed that most of the Jews had managed to escape in time. In October, Lublin was captured, where the chronicles cite about 2,000 Jews who died. It was the greatest disaster of the new battle. The historian Dov Weinryb, based both on Polish records and on personal reports, stated that the correct number was probably several hundred. The Russians also tended to take many prisoners, and a new wave of Jewish slaves reached the markets in 1665 and 1656. Once again, a great effort began to raise funds for their redemption.\n\nIn the summer of 1655 invaded a new enemy to the republic, the Swedish Empire led by King Carl Gustav. This war was the most destructive of all the struggles between Poland and Lithuania. It is still estimated to be worse than World War II in terms of the relative damage caused to the country. In what became known as the \"Swedish Flood,\" the most affluent and populated areas of Poland were completely destroyed. The circumstances led to great hunger that year. Jewish reports staged the invaders as sympathetic towards them. Although they did not take special action against them except for a random killing, many Jews, together with the rest of the people, died of starvation, epidemics and sword. For example, the Jewish quarter of Kazimierz in Krak\u00f3w was completely destroyed by the siege on the city in September\u2013October 1655 and the survivors fled to Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was almost collapsing: Many nobles believed that Karl Gustav would do them good and change sides with their armies. The magnate Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142 swore allegiance in return for protection from the Russians and cut off Lithuania from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. But the scales were tipped by the massacres and looting of the Swedes, and especially by the awakening of Catholic sentiment with the successful defense of the Jesna Gora Monastery since November. The Pi\u0142sudski (a family of nobility that originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and increased in notability under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Second Polish Republic) began to resent the Swedish king, who neglected their affairs, and most of them renewed their loyalty to Jan Kazimierz. The masses of the people and the minor nobility, headed by Hetman Stefan Czerniecki, launched a guerilla war against the Lutheran conquerors. In the fall of 1656, the Czar estimated that Sweden might become too strong and started supporting the King of Poland.\n\nThe rebels, driven also by the betrayal of the Calvinist Radziwill, ran what they perceived as a struggle for the Catholic Church. Lutherans, Calvinists, neo-Aryans, Orthodox and Jews were all marked as enemies and suspected of collaborating with the Swedes. Different militias and the Crown Forces massacred them frequently. On January 22, 1656, the king confiscated the remains of Kazimierz and gave all the looting that could be extracted from it to the army after declaring that the Jews had cooperated with the enemy. In February 1656, Czerniecki killed 600 Jews, according to the records, when he liberated Sandomierz Castle. Poland, Lithuania and Sweden signed a peace agreement in 1660, and the fighting between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and Moscow resumed. It continued on a relatively limited scale until signing the Truce of Andrusovo Agreement in 1667, which brought tranquility to the kingdom for the first time in 19 years. The Lithuanian communities paid a large sum to include in the contract a clause allowing all Jewish prisoners in Russia, with the exception of converts and women who were married, to return home.\n\nThe historian Dov Weinryb wrote that according to records about the size of Jewish communities in the 1970s and 1980s, which together with other data indicate that many survived by conversion or immigration, \"a reasonable estimate\" of all Jews killed - By the sword, by all sides, and by epidemics and famine - during the turbulent period that swept Poland from 1648 to 1677, \"will be between 40,000 and 50,000, although historians point to far larger estimates, which are high enough to include between a fifth and a quarter of the Jewish population In Poland and Lithuania on the eve of the uprising. \"\n\n===  Following the Sanctions  ===\n[[File:Hebrewbooks_org_42621_520.jpg|right|thumb|312x312px|''\"El Maleh Rahamim\"'' in memory of the victims of the sanctions of 1096 and the sanctions of the Cossack riots.]]\nThe chaos that was in Poland following the sanctions brought the leaders of the communities and their rabbis into taking steps regarding the welfare of the refugees, both in material aid and in halachic discussions to allow a second marriage to women whose husbands had been lost. The problem of women whose husbands had been lost reached distant courts in communities where captives were redeemed and wanted to remarry. In Cairo, in a case cited in the \"Divrei Noam\", a group of women sent a messenger to Poland who returned with divorce documents from all their husbands.\n\nThe generation who lived at that time debated the question whether the sanctions were shedding clean blood for the sins of the House of Israel or punishment from god. Many adopted the first statement, but pamphlets published in Europe blamed the Polish Jewry of committing sins such as: loan interest, Folk distribution of Kabbalah books to the masses, raising pigs for non-Jews, lawlessness and more. The massive flight to the west also led to the renewed growth of the Holy Roman Empire as an important Torah center, after years of standing in the shadow of its neighbor to the east. Researchers in the past have frequently related the pogroms as a catalyst for the rise of Sabbateanism. Sarah, the wife of Shabtai Zvi, also became orphaned during it. Although this assertion lost its validity over time, Israel Halpern believed that the effort to raise funds for the redemption of captives throughout the continent hastened the horrific news of the events to the entire Diaspora and played an important role.\n\nIn memory of the heavy mourning, the rabbis decreed banquets and fancy costumes. Wearing silk and velvet was forbidden for three years. Women were forbidden to wear gold chains and gems for three years. It was forbidden to sing songs of joy for one year, except for wedding ceremonies, and the authority was given by the leaders of each community to extend the validity of the prohibitions for additional years.\n\nIn February 1650 The Council of Four Lands assembled in Lublin, where it was declared that the Memorial Day for the sanctions in Blois and for the day that nemyriv fell will be on the 10th of June, 1648 (20th of Sivan- a month from the Jewish calendar) In memory of the victims. Lamentations and special prayers were written to be said on this day. Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller then corrected the lament of ''\"Ella Ezekara in Third Tears\"'' for those who perished. In addition, various versions of the prayer ''\"El Malei Rachamim\"'' (a Jewish prayer for the soul of a person who has died, usually recited at the graveside during the burial service and at memorial services during the year) were also composed, to be recited on the 20th of Sivan, on Yom Kippur, on the Sabbath preceding Shavuot and on Shabbat Chazon.\n\nDespite its many inaccuracies, ''\"Abyss of Despair\"'' has become a historical memory because of the high quality of Hanover's writing. It was published in more than twenty editions in several languages, and remained a major source until the 20th century. The sanctions of 1648 are mentioned in several literary works in Hebrew. The most famous of them are: ''\"The Slave\"'' by Isaac Bashevis Singer, ''\"The Nazarene\"'' by Shalom Asch, ''\"A City In Its Fullness\"'' by SY Agnon and the Ballad ''\"the Rabbi's daughter\"'' by Shaul Tchernichovsky.\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Amelia Glaser (editor).

Nadal finished the year ranked #1 and with more slams (2 to 1), more Masters titles (5 to 3), and more tournament titles (10 to 7).  Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic\u2019s consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title).<ref name=\"2013champions\">{{cite news |url=https://www.itftennis.com/news/163361.aspx |title=Williams and Djokovic named 2013 ITF World Champion |date=18 December 2013  |publisher= ITF }}</ref>\n\nOther instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 ([[Jimmy Connors]]), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl).   None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors

Nadal finished the year ranked #1 and with more slams (2 to 1), more Masters titles (5 to 3), and more tournament titles (10 to 7).  Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic\u2019s consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title).<ref name=\"2013champions\">{{cite news |url=https://www.itftennis.com/news/163361.aspx |title=Williams and Djokovic named 2013 ITF World Champion |date=18 December 2013  |publisher= ITF }}</ref>\n\nOther instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 ([[Jimmy Connors]]), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl).   None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors
