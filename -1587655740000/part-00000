June 6, 1931) was an American socialite whose mysterious drowning death at age 25 in 1931 became a sensational tabloid story. Newspapers published allegations that she had been sexually abused as a child by [[Andrew James Peters]], a wealthy, prominent politician and former [[Mayor of Boston]] (1918-1922). He was reportedly suspected of murdering her. Investigators were unable to determine whether her death was a homicide or a suicide, and her death remains unsolved.<ref name=nehs>{{cite web |url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-starr-faithfull-reveals-a-boston-mayors-sordid-secret/ |title=The Mysterious Death of Starr Faithfull Reveals a Boston Mayor's Sordid Secret |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014 |website=newenglandhistoricalsociety.com |publisher=New England Historical Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611014059/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-starr-faithfull-reveals-a-boston-mayors-sordid-secret |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=February 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFaithfull was found dead on the beach at [[Long Beach, New York]], on the south shore of [[Long Island]], on the morning of June 8, 1931.<ref name=harrisburgtel460716>{{cite news |title=Murder Mystery Investigator Dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43572435/ |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=Harrisburg Telegraph |location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania |page=13 |date=July 16, 1946 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription |access-date=February 22, 2016}}</ref> An [[autopsy]] found that she died by drowning, but she also had many bruises, apparently caused by beating or rough handling, and a large dose of a [[sedative]] in her system.

The taxi driver saw her walking back in the direction of the piers.<ref name=nyt19310618 /><ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q&f=false 163\u2013165].</ref>\n\nA beauty shop employee in [[Grand Central Terminal]] said that a \"Miss Faithfull\" had visited the shop on June 5 between 2:30 and 3 pm, and spoken to her about an appointment.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q&f=false 162\u2013163].</ref> A female acquaintance of Faithfull also reported seeing her at Grand Central around the same time.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Friend Saw Starr Faithfull Same Day She Disappeared |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/98036170/ |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=June 19, 1931 |page=2 |access-date=March 7, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Later, she was seen on board the Cunard liner [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS ''Mauretania'']], but was also seen leaving the ship before its 5 pm departure for [[the Bahamas]].<ref name=nash80>Nash, p.

Roberts confirmed that on June 5 he entertained Faithfull aboard the ''Carmania'' from about 5:30 pm until after 10 pm, including having a light meal at 8:30 pm. She had said she wanted to travel to Calcutta and Paris, where she said she had a woman friend who had willed her some money. Roberts said that shortly after 10 pm, he gave Faithfull a dollar for cab fare and put her into a cab near Pier 56, supposedly to drive her to another ocean liner, the ''[[SS \u00cele de France|\u00cele de France]]'', on which she planned to attend a party.<ref name=goodman241248 /> A police officer who recognized Faithfull from the ''Franconia'' incident saw her getting into the cab.<ref>Goodman, p.

She may have had an argument with her companion or have left with a group of other men. The hotel was a favorite rendezvous for New York City mobsters and [[rum-running|bootleggers]], including [[Bill Dwyer (mobster)|Bill Dwyer]], [[Vannie Higgins]], and [[Dutch Schultz]].<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA230#v=onepage&q&f=false 230\u2013239].</ref>\n\nAfter Faithfull's family had failed to locate her by the evening of Saturday, June 6, her stepfather reported her missing to the [[NYPD]] Missing Persons Bureau. Stanley and Helen Faithfull also sent a letter to Peters on June 7 informing him that their daughter was missing and seeking money.\n\n=== Discovery of body on Monday, June 8, 1931 ===\nOn the morning of Monday, June 8, 1931, around 6:30 am, Faithfull's dead body was found by a [[beachcombing|beachcomber]] at Long Beach, New York, on the beach near Minnesota Avenue.<ref name=kennedy /><ref name=wilkins /> When found, she was wearing only her dress, silk stockings, and a [[Girdle (undergarment)|suspender girdle]] that held up the stockings, with no other underwear. The rest of her outer clothing and accessories were missing. Neither her dress nor her manicured nails were damaged, although her body showed numerous bruises that the [[medical examiner]] said had been inflicted before death, apparently by another person.<ref name=fulton /> Faithfull's body was identified by her stepfather, Stanley, on the evening of June 8.\n\nAn [[autopsy]] determined that she had died of drowning and that her body had been in the water for at least 48 hours, suggesting that she died on the night of Friday, June 5 or the early morning of Saturday, June 6.<ref name=wilkins /> The time spent in the water and her estimated time of death would later be questioned by another expert, who had been handling drowning cases in the Long Beach area for many years and believed that Faithfull had been in the water for less than ten hours, meaning that she had died late on Sunday, June 7 or in the early morning of June 8, and probably drowned close to the beach where she was found.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA262#v=onepage&q&f=false 262\u2013264].</ref> Faithfull's lungs contained a large quantity of sand,<ref name=wilkins /> which was later interpreted as indicating that she drowned in shallow water near shore, rather than further out to sea. The autopsy revealed that she had eaten a large meal of meat, potatoes, mushrooms and fruit three to four hours before her death, but had not drunk alcohol for 36 hours before her death. Her liver contained a high level of a drug initially identified as the [[barbiturate]] [[barbital|Veronal]]<ref name=cj19310618 /> \u2013 a [[sedative]] that she frequently purchased and used. Before her death, Faithfull had taken a dose large enough to cause stupor or semi-stupor, but not large enough to kill her.<ref name=telegraph19310616 /> A later letter from the toxicologist and other evidence suggested that she might have taken a similar but stronger drug such as [[phenobarbital|Luminal]] or [[aprobarbital|Allonal]], which would have increased her stupor. The medical report initially said that she had been raped; a second report ruled out rape, but said she had sexual intercourse shortly before her death.\n\n== Investigation ==\nFaithfull's death was initially investigated as a [[homicide]]. With new evidence, investigators came to believe that she committed suicide or suffered a fatal accident, caused by her jumping or falling overboard from a ship. The Faithfulls insisted her death was a homicide and accused Peters of having her murdered; they revealed their allegations to the media. In so doing, the Faithfulls came under suspicion themselves for not cooperating fully with investigators and for having a monetary motive to accuse Peters, whose money they had been living on for years. The case was finally closed with no conclusion being reached as to whether Faithfull's death was a homicide, suicide, or accident. Several true crime writers have written books offering their own alternative theories about her death.\n\n=== Homicide investigation ===\nThe investigation into Faithfull's death was led by [[Nassau County Police Department|Nassau County Police]] Inspector Harold King, Nassau County [[District Attorney]] (DA) Elvin Edwards, and Assistant DA Martin Littleton Jr. After identifying his stepdaughter's body, Stanley told King and Littleton that he believed Peters had ordered her murder in order to prevent her from revealing her past sexual abuse by Peters. Faithfull also told the press that he believed his stepdaughter had been murdered, but initially did not give them Peters' name. He eventually told them she had been \"corrupted\" as a child by an unnamed older, wealthy male friend of the family who had later paid a settlement.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Harrowing Experience of Beautiful Starr Faithfull in Girlhood is Revealed |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/12802649 |newspaper=[[Corsicana Daily Sun]] |location=Corsicana, Texas |date=June 16, 1931 |pages=1, 11 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription |access-date=March 6, 2016}}</ref> London artist Rudolph Haybrook, a close friend of Faithfull, also was quoted in the press as saying she was murdered to prevent her from testifying in an upcoming $25,000 lawsuit.<ref name=telegraph19310612 />\n\nAlthough King thought the death was probably a suicide, even after hearing Faithfull's story, DA Edwards was convinced that it was murder.<ref name=nigol>{{cite book |last=Nigol |first=Paul |editor-last=Knafla |editor-first=Louis A. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bzFiu859lAC&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Crime, Gender, and Sexuality in Criminal Prosecutions |series=Criminal Justice History |volume=17 |date=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/crimegendersexua0017unse/page/197 197\u2013198] |chapter=Book Review: Jonathan Goodman, ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' |isbn=978-0-313-31013-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/crimegendersexua0017unse/page/197 }}</ref> At Edwards' direction, the investigators began to examine the death as a homicide, with Edwards traveling to Boston and announcing that he expected to indict two unnamed men in her death, one of whom he said \"played an important role in New York political circles\".

Later, the large amount of sand found in her lungs, coupled with the bruises to her upper body, caused them to believe that she had been drowned in the sandy water close to shore by being forcibly held under water,<ref name=telegraph19310612 /> perhaps near the spot where she was found, rather than having been pushed from a ship several miles offshore and having her body wash up on shore.<ref name=kennedy /> They gathered information from the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] about the tides and currents near Long Beach in an effort to determine how Faithfull's body might have arrived on the beach, but results of this query were never published.<ref>{{cite news |last=Jones |first=William Glynne |date=February 24, 1961 |title=The World's Strangest Stories: Mysterious Death of Miss Starr Faithfull |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19610224&id=S5sUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4agDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006,3933657&hl=en |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne |access-date=March 11, 2016 |page=15}}</ref><ref>Goodman, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe man named \"Brucie\", mentioned by the taxi driver, was at first thought to be the actor \"Bruce Winston\", whom Faithfull had said she met at Cerf's party.

An elderly British actor named Bruce Winston was found, but he had not been in the U.S. since February and had spent the past several weeks appearing in a play in London.<ref name=nyt19310618 /><ref name=chitrib19310617 /> Investigators then sought a Chicago gangster named Ernest Blue, alias Richard Bruce.<ref name=ms19310617 /> An acquaintance of Faithfull named David \"Bruce\" Blue was finally located in London, and he affirmed that he had been with her on the ''Mauretania'' on June 5.<ref name=cj19310618 />\n\nEfforts were made to locate the taxi driver who picked up Faithfull near Pier 56 after 10 pm on June 5. Despite substantial reward money being offered for information about Faithfull's route and destination that night, no taxi driver ever came forward. There was speculation that she was abducted by a taxi driver, or by someone else posing as a taxi driver and possibly under the control of mobsters.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA286#v=onepage&q&f=false 286\u2013287].</ref>\n\nAlthough Edwards and Littleton continued to investigate the death as a possible homicide until December 1931, including questioning Peters, they were unable to gather sufficient evidence to obtain [[indictment]]s or otherwise prove the homicide theory.\n\n=== Suicide and accident investigation ===\nWhile investigators were pursuing the homicide theory, Carr, having arrived in London on the ''Franconia'', received three letters that Faithfull had written to him dated May 30, June 2, and June 4, 1931. Carr personally hand-carried the letters back to the U.S. and provided them to the investigators around June 23, also being interviewed by police at that time.<ref name=kennedy /><ref name=nash /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the full text of the letters on June 22 and June 24.<ref name=nyt19310624 /><ref name=nyt19310622 />\n\nIn the first letter, dated May 30, Faithfull wrote, \n{{Quote|text=I am going (definitely now \u2013 I've been thinking of it for a long time) to end my worthless, disorderly bore of an existence \u2013 before I ruin any one else's life as well.

The letter began, \n{{Quote|text=It's all up with me now. This is something I am going to put through. The only thing that bothers me about it\u2014the only thing I dread\u2014is being outwitted and prevented from doing this, which is the only possible thing for me to do.

Her body eventually washed up on shore.

Based on Roberts' information about spending the evening with Faithfull on the ''Carmania'' and then putting her into a cab to go to a party on the ''\u00cele de France'', Littleton concluded that she probably stowed away on the ''\u00cele de France'' and then jumped overboard after it sailed.<ref name=goodman241248 /> Littleton issued a denial in the ''Times'' of an [[International News Service]] story claiming that he had located a witness who saw Faithfull jump from a ship.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 10, 1931 |title=Starr Faithfull Mystery Solved; Ended Own Life |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/49789795/ |newspaper=The Kane Republican |location=Kane, Pennsylvania |page=1 |access-date=February 25, 2016 |agency=[[International News Service]]|via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Faithfull Death Solution Denied |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=19 |date=December 11, 1931 <!--|access-date=February 22, 2016--> |via=[[ProQuest]]}}</ref>\n\nLater crime analysts have disputed the suicide conclusion. American true crime author [[Jay Robert Nash]] said in his book ''Open Files: A Narrative Encyclopedia of the World's Greatest Unsolved Crimes'' (1983) that there was no evidence of Faithfull ever having been aboard the ''\u00cele de France'', and little evidence that she had committed suicide, compared to more evidence that her death had been homicide.<ref name=nash80 /> Goodman, in his ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' (1990), stated that she could not have gone aboard the ''\u00cele de France'' because it sailed at 10 pm while she was still visiting Dr. Roberts. Also it was docked close enough to the ''Carmania'' that she would not have taken a cab to it. Goodman also concluded that she did not go overboard from any of the other ships leaving on June 5 or June 6 because, among other things, she would not have had time or inclination to consume her last large meal of meat, vegetables and fruit so soon after eating a light meal of different food with Roberts; her conversation with Roberts indicated that she did not have any barbiturates or any money to obtain them on June 5; and she had been seen intoxicated on both June 4 and June 5, contrary to the autopsy, which found she had consumed no alcohol for 36 hours before death. This suggests that she did not die until June 7 or early on June 8. Neither her silk dress nor silk stockings showed the damage expected from her having been 48 hours in the water, during a time when a storm was affecting the area.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false 251\u2013270].</ref>\n\n=== The Faithfulls' reaction to the investigation ===\nDuring the course of the investigation, Edwards and Littleton became suspicious of the Faithfull family and thought they were withholding information, being less than cooperative, and may even have been involved in Faithfull's murder.<ref name=telegraph19310612 /> Newspapers also reported on the family's apparent need for money and lack of visible means of support.<ref name=pettey />\n\nAfter the evidence of Faithfull's possible suicide came to light in late June 1931, the grand jury proceedings were closed, with no indictments issued, and the case began to fade from the headlines. Stanley, anxious to keep the press interested in the story, continued to state that his stepdaughter was murdered by hired killers acting on behalf of a high-profile person.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA221#v=onepage&q&f=false 221\u2013224].</ref> In July 1931, he alleged \"shameful official negligence\" on the part of the Nassau County investigators and further alleged that DA Edwards had been intimidated by persons \"too big and influential for him to tackle\".<ref name=kennedy /> Edwards strongly denied that he had been intimidated, and said that he believed Faithfull had been murdered, but did not have the evidence to prove it. He further said, \"Neither Peters nor anybody else is so highly placed that I won't proceed against them.\"<ref name=kennedy />\n[[File:12 St. Luke's Place, Greenwich Village, NYC, USA, March 2016.jpg|upright|thumb|12 St. Luke's Place in Greenwich Village, New York City, in 2016. The Faithfulls lived in an apartment here at the time of Starr Faithfull's death.]]\n\nOn July 25, Stanley for the first time publicly named Peters as the man alleged to have had an improper relationship with Faithfull when she was 11 years old. He also disclosed the original 1927 settlement agreement between the Faithfulls and Peters releasing him from liability for Starr's abuse, and his settlement check for $20,000. As a result of being publicly connected with the case, Peters suffered several [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdowns]].<ref name=kennedy /><ref>Goodman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA225#v=onepage&q&f=false 225].</ref>\n\nIn late July and early August, the grand jury probe was reopened to consider evidence provided by Stanley that the suicide letters to Carr were forgeries not written by his stepdaughter. <ref name=hen19310624 /><ref name=stlpd19310626 /> In early August, Governor Roosevelt also reviewed the case to determine whether the death had been properly investigated by the Nassau County authorities.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Roosevelt to Scan the Faithfull Case |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=30 |date=August 1, 1931 <!--|access-date=February 22, 2016--> |via=[[ProQuest]]}}</ref>\n\nThe New York ''|Daily News'', which had been conducting its own investigation, confirmed that the Faithfulls were in debt and in dire need of money, and that Stanley had traveled to Boston shortly before his stepdaughter's disappearance to seek additional payoffs from Peters. Stanley responded by suing the publisher of the ''Daily News'', the reporter who wrote the stories, and several other papers for [[libel]], but his claims were ultimately dismissed.<ref name=kennedy />\n\n=== Conclusion of the investigation ===\nBy October 1931, the Faithfull case was reported to be \"virtually closed\". But Roberts' statements about being with her on the ''Carmania'' were not obtained until the planned last days of the investigation in early December. Later in December, a final [[inquest]] was held into her death. It lasted fifteen minutes, and the jury reached no conclusion. Nassau County Coroner Edward Neu was quoted as saying, \"Whatever I decide, it will only be a matter of opinion.\"<ref name=kennedy />\n\n=== Alternative theories ===\nGoodman theorized that Faithfull was killed by Long Island mobster Vannie Higgins and his associates. According to Goodman's research, Higgins had learned that the Faithfulls were extorting money from Peters due to his past improper sexual relationship with Starr. Based on this information, Goodman suggested that Higgins, wishing to blackmail Peters or extort more money from him, had her kidnapped and driven to Island Park, where he provided her with a meal and barbiturates and questioned her in an effort to get more information that he could use against Peters. Unsatisfied with her answers, he beat her, causing the many bruises on her body. When she appeared to have died from the beating, he ordered her body dumped into the ocean near Long Beach.

According to this theory, Faithfull went to the beach with a man she had picked up, ostensibly to have sexual relations. Once there, she removed most of her clothing, but then teased or refused sex until the man became enraged, beat her, and drowned her in the shallow water and sand near the shoreline, possibly after sexually assaulting her.<ref name=nash /><ref name=markey>{{cite book |last=Markey |first=Morris |editor-last=Leighton |editor-first=Isabel |title=The Aspirin Age: 1919\u20131941|chapter-url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=LXP66YAL&tocp=41 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227052132/http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=LXP66YAL&tocp=41 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-02-27 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York City |date=1949 |chapter=1931: The Mysterious Death of Starr Faithfull |isbn=978-0-8488-1661-2 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}</ref> Goodman also wrote that this theory was supported by some facts.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA270#v=onepage&q&f=false 270\u2013271].</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nPeters was never prosecuted for any crime in connection with Faithfull's death.<ref name=russellp227>Russell, ''A City in Terror'', p.

The taxi driver saw her walking back in the direction of the piers.<ref name=nyt19310618 /><ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q&f=false 163\u2013165].</ref>\n\nA beauty shop employee in [[Grand Central Terminal]] said that a \"Miss Faithfull\" had visited the shop on June 5 between 2:30 and 3 pm, and spoken to her about an appointment.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q&f=false 162\u2013163].</ref> A female acquaintance of Faithfull also reported seeing her at Grand Central around the same time.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Friend Saw Starr Faithfull Same Day She Disappeared |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/98036170/ |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=June 19, 1931 |page=2 |access-date=March 7, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Later, she was seen on board the Cunard liner [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS ''Mauretania'']], but was also seen leaving the ship before its 5 pm departure for [[the Bahamas]].<ref name=nash80>Nash, p.

Roberts confirmed that on June 5 he entertained Faithfull aboard the ''Carmania'' from about 5:30 pm until after 10 pm, including having a light meal at 8:30 pm. She had said she wanted to travel to Calcutta and Paris, where she said she had a woman friend who had willed her some money. Roberts said that shortly after 10 pm, he gave Faithfull a dollar for cab fare and put her into a cab near Pier 56, supposedly to drive her to another ocean liner, the ''[[SS \u00cele de France|\u00cele de France]]'', on which she planned to attend a party.<ref name=goodman241248 /> A police officer who recognized Faithfull from the ''Franconia'' incident saw her getting into the cab.<ref>Goodman, p.

She may have had an argument with her companion or have left with a group of other men. The hotel was a favorite rendezvous for New York City mobsters and [[rum-running|bootleggers]], including [[Bill Dwyer (mobster)|Bill Dwyer]], [[Vannie Higgins]], and [[Dutch Schultz]].<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA230#v=onepage&q&f=false 230\u2013239].</ref>\n\nAfter Faithfull's family had failed to locate her by the evening of Saturday, June 6, her stepfather reported her missing to the [[NYPD]] Missing Persons Bureau. Stanley and Helen Faithfull also sent a letter to Peters on June 7 informing him that their daughter was missing and seeking money.\n\n=== Discovery of body on Monday, June 8, 1931 ===\nOn the morning of Monday, June 8, 1931, around 6:30 am, Faithfull's dead body was found by a [[beachcombing|beachcomber]] at Long Beach, New York, on the beach near Minnesota Avenue.<ref name=kennedy /><ref name=wilkins /> When found, she was wearing only her dress, silk stockings, and a [[Girdle (undergarment)|suspender girdle]] that held up the stockings, with no other underwear. The rest of her outer clothing and accessories were missing. Neither her dress nor her manicured nails were damaged, although her body showed numerous bruises that the [[medical examiner]] said had been inflicted before death, apparently by another person.<ref name=fulton /> Faithfull's body was identified by her stepfather, Stanley, on the evening of June 8.\n\nAn [[autopsy]] determined that she had died of drowning and that her body had been in the water for at least 48 hours, suggesting that she died on the night of Friday, June 5 or the early morning of Saturday, June 6.<ref name=wilkins /> The time spent in the water and her estimated time of death would later be questioned by another expert, who had been handling drowning cases in the Long Beach area for many years and believed that Faithfull had been in the water for less than ten hours, meaning that she had died late on Sunday, June 7 or in the early morning of June 8, and probably drowned close to the beach where she was found.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA262#v=onepage&q&f=false 262\u2013264].</ref> Faithfull's lungs contained a large quantity of sand,<ref name=wilkins /> which was later interpreted as indicating that she drowned in shallow water near shore, rather than further out to sea. The autopsy revealed that she had eaten a large meal of meat, potatoes, mushrooms and fruit three to four hours before her death, but had not drunk alcohol for 36 hours before her death. Her liver contained a high level of a drug initially identified as the [[barbiturate]] [[barbital|Veronal]]<ref name=cj19310618 /> \u2013 a [[sedative]] that she frequently purchased and used. Before her death, Faithfull had taken a dose large enough to cause stupor or semi-stupor, but not large enough to kill her.<ref name=telegraph19310616 /> A later letter from the toxicologist and other evidence suggested that she might have taken a similar but stronger drug such as [[phenobarbital|Luminal]] or [[aprobarbital|Allonal]], which would have increased her stupor. The medical report initially said that she had been raped; a second report ruled out rape, but said she had sexual intercourse shortly before her death.\n\n== Investigation ==\nFaithfull's death was initially investigated as a [[homicide]]. With new evidence, investigators came to believe that she committed suicide or suffered a fatal accident, caused by her jumping or falling overboard from a ship. The Faithfulls insisted her death was a homicide and accused Peters of having her murdered; they revealed their allegations to the media. In so doing, the Faithfulls came under suspicion themselves for not cooperating fully with investigators and for having a monetary motive to accuse Peters, whose money they had been living on for years. The case was finally closed with no conclusion being reached as to whether Faithfull's death was a homicide, suicide, or accident. Several true crime writers have written books offering their own alternative theories about her death.\n\n=== Homicide investigation ===\nThe investigation into Faithfull's death was led by [[Nassau County Police Department|Nassau County Police]] Inspector Harold King, Nassau County [[District Attorney]] (DA) Elvin Edwards, and Assistant DA Martin Littleton Jr. After identifying his stepdaughter's body, Stanley told King and Littleton that he believed Peters had ordered her murder in order to prevent her from revealing her past sexual abuse by Peters. Faithfull also told the press that he believed his stepdaughter had been murdered, but initially did not give them Peters' name. He eventually told them she had been \"corrupted\" as a child by an unnamed older, wealthy male friend of the family who had later paid a settlement.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Harrowing Experience of Beautiful Starr Faithfull in Girlhood is Revealed |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/12802649 |newspaper=[[Corsicana Daily Sun]] |location=Corsicana, Texas |date=June 16, 1931 |pages=1, 11 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription |access-date=March 6, 2016}}</ref> London artist Rudolph Haybrook, a close friend of Faithfull, also was quoted in the press as saying she was murdered to prevent her from testifying in an upcoming $25,000 lawsuit.<ref name=telegraph19310612 />\n\nAlthough King thought the death was probably a suicide, even after hearing Faithfull's story, DA Edwards was convinced that it was murder.<ref name=nigol>{{cite book |last=Nigol |first=Paul |editor-last=Knafla |editor-first=Louis A. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bzFiu859lAC&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Crime, Gender, and Sexuality in Criminal Prosecutions |series=Criminal Justice History |volume=17 |date=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/crimegendersexua0017unse/page/197 197\u2013198] |chapter=Book Review: Jonathan Goodman, ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' |isbn=978-0-313-31013-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/crimegendersexua0017unse/page/197 }}</ref> At Edwards' direction, the investigators began to examine the death as a homicide, with Edwards traveling to Boston and announcing that he expected to indict two unnamed men in her death, one of whom he said \"played an important role in New York political circles\".

Later, the large amount of sand found in her lungs, coupled with the bruises to her upper body, caused them to believe that she had been drowned in the sandy water close to shore by being forcibly held under water,<ref name=telegraph19310612 /> perhaps near the spot where she was found, rather than having been pushed from a ship several miles offshore and having her body wash up on shore.<ref name=kennedy /> They gathered information from the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] about the tides and currents near Long Beach in an effort to determine how Faithfull's body might have arrived on the beach, but results of this query were never published.<ref>{{cite news |last=Jones |first=William Glynne |date=February 24, 1961 |title=The World's Strangest Stories: Mysterious Death of Miss Starr Faithfull |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19610224&id=S5sUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4agDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006,3933657&hl=en |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne |access-date=March 11, 2016 |page=15}}</ref><ref>Goodman, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe man named \"Brucie\", mentioned by the taxi driver, was at first thought to be the actor \"Bruce Winston\", whom Faithfull had said she met at Cerf's party.

An elderly British actor named Bruce Winston was found, but he had not been in the U.S. since February and had spent the past several weeks appearing in a play in London.<ref name=nyt19310618 /><ref name=chitrib19310617 /> Investigators then sought a Chicago gangster named Ernest Blue, alias Richard Bruce.<ref name=ms19310617 /> An acquaintance of Faithfull named David \"Bruce\" Blue was finally located in London, and he affirmed that he had been with her on the ''Mauretania'' on June 5.<ref name=cj19310618 />\n\nEfforts were made to locate the taxi driver who picked up Faithfull near Pier 56 after 10 pm on June 5. Despite substantial reward money being offered for information about Faithfull's route and destination that night, no taxi driver ever came forward. There was speculation that she was abducted by a taxi driver, or by someone else posing as a taxi driver and possibly under the control of mobsters.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA286#v=onepage&q&f=false 286\u2013287].</ref>\n\nAlthough Edwards and Littleton continued to investigate the death as a possible homicide until December 1931, including questioning Peters, they were unable to gather sufficient evidence to obtain [[indictment]]s or otherwise prove the homicide theory.\n\n=== Suicide and accident investigation ===\nWhile investigators were pursuing the homicide theory, Carr, having arrived in London on the ''Franconia'', received three letters that Faithfull had written to him dated May 30, June 2, and June 4, 1931. Carr personally hand-carried the letters back to the U.S. and provided them to the investigators around June 23, also being interviewed by police at that time.<ref name=kennedy /><ref name=nash /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the full text of the letters on June 22 and June 24.<ref name=nyt19310624 /><ref name=nyt19310622 />\n\nIn the first letter, dated May 30, Faithfull wrote, \n{{Quote|text=I am going (definitely now \u2013 I've been thinking of it for a long time) to end my worthless, disorderly bore of an existence \u2013 before I ruin any one else's life as well.

The letter began, \n{{Quote|text=It's all up with me now. This is something I am going to put through. The only thing that bothers me about it\u2014the only thing I dread\u2014is being outwitted and prevented from doing this, which is the only possible thing for me to do.

Her body eventually washed up on shore.

Based on Roberts' information about spending the evening with Faithfull on the ''Carmania'' and then putting her into a cab to go to a party on the ''\u00cele de France'', Littleton concluded that she probably stowed away on the ''\u00cele de France'' and then jumped overboard after it sailed.<ref name=goodman241248 /> Littleton issued a denial in the ''Times'' of an [[International News Service]] story claiming that he had located a witness who saw Faithfull jump from a ship.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 10, 1931 |title=Starr Faithfull Mystery Solved; Ended Own Life |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/49789795/ |newspaper=The Kane Republican |location=Kane, Pennsylvania |page=1 |access-date=February 25, 2016 |agency=[[International News Service]]|via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Faithfull Death Solution Denied |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=19 |date=December 11, 1931 <!--|access-date=February 22, 2016--> |via=[[ProQuest]]}}</ref>\n\nLater crime analysts have disputed the suicide conclusion. American true crime author [[Jay Robert Nash]] said in his book ''Open Files: A Narrative Encyclopedia of the World's Greatest Unsolved Crimes'' (1983) that there was no evidence of Faithfull ever having been aboard the ''\u00cele de France'', and little evidence that she had committed suicide, compared to more evidence that her death had been homicide.<ref name=nash80 /> Goodman, in his ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' (1990), stated that she could not have gone aboard the ''\u00cele de France'' because it sailed at 10 pm while she was still visiting Dr. Roberts. Also it was docked close enough to the ''Carmania'' that she would not have taken a cab to it. Goodman also concluded that she did not go overboard from any of the other ships leaving on June 5 or June 6 because, among other things, she would not have had time or inclination to consume her last large meal of meat, vegetables and fruit so soon after eating a light meal of different food with Roberts; her conversation with Roberts indicated that she did not have any barbiturates or any money to obtain them on June 5; and she had been seen intoxicated on both June 4 and June 5, contrary to the autopsy, which found she had consumed no alcohol for 36 hours before death. This suggests that she did not die until June 7 or early on June 8. Neither her silk dress nor silk stockings showed the damage expected from her having been 48 hours in the water, during a time when a storm was affecting the area.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false 251\u2013270].</ref>\n\n=== The Faithfulls' reaction to the investigation ===\nDuring the course of the investigation, Edwards and Littleton became suspicious of the Faithfull family and thought they were withholding information, being less than cooperative, and may even have been involved in Faithfull's murder.<ref name=telegraph19310612 /> Newspapers also reported on the family's apparent need for money and lack of visible means of support.<ref name=pettey />\n\nAfter the evidence of Faithfull's possible suicide came to light in late June 1931, the grand jury proceedings were closed, with no indictments issued, and the case began to fade from the headlines. Stanley, anxious to keep the press interested in the story, continued to state that his stepdaughter was murdered by hired killers acting on behalf of a high-profile person.<ref>Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA221#v=onepage&q&f=false 221\u2013224].</ref> In July 1931, he alleged \"shameful official negligence\" on the part of the Nassau County investigators and further alleged that DA Edwards had been intimidated by persons \"too big and influential for him to tackle\".<ref name=kennedy /> Edwards strongly denied that he had been intimidated, and said that he believed Faithfull had been murdered, but did not have the evidence to prove it. He further said, \"Neither Peters nor anybody else is so highly placed that I won't proceed against them.\"<ref name=kennedy />\n[[File:12 St. Luke's Place, Greenwich Village, NYC, USA, March 2016.jpg|upright|thumb|12 St. Luke's Place in Greenwich Village, New York City, in 2016. The Faithfulls lived in an apartment here at the time of Starr Faithfull's death.]]\n\nOn July 25, Stanley for the first time publicly named Peters as the man alleged to have had an improper relationship with Faithfull when she was 11 years old. He also disclosed the original 1927 settlement agreement between the Faithfulls and Peters releasing him from liability for Starr's abuse, and his settlement check for $20,000. As a result of being publicly connected with the case, Peters suffered several [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdowns]].<ref name=kennedy /><ref>Goodman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&pg=PA225#v=onepage&q&f=false 225].</ref>\n\nIn late July and early August, the grand jury probe was reopened to consider evidence provided by Stanley that the suicide letters to Carr were forgeries not written by his stepdaughter. <ref name=hen19310624 /><ref name=stlpd19310626 /> In early August, Governor Roosevelt also reviewed the case to determine whether the death had been properly investigated by the Nassau County authorities.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Roosevelt to Scan the Faithfull Case |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=30 |date=August 1, 1931 <!--|access-date=February 22, 2016--> |via=[[ProQuest]]}}</ref>\n\nThe New York ''|Daily News'', which had been conducting its own investigation, confirmed that the Faithfulls were in debt and in dire need of money, and that Stanley had traveled to Boston shortly before his stepdaughter's disappearance to seek additional payoffs from Peters. Stanley responded by suing the publisher of the ''Daily News'', the reporter who wrote the stories, and several other papers for [[libel]], but his claims were ultimately dismissed.<ref name=kennedy />\n\n=== Conclusion of the investigation ===\nBy October 1931, the Faithfull case was reported to be \"virtually closed\". But Roberts' statements about being with her on the ''Carmania'' were not obtained until the planned last days of the investigation in early December. Later in December, a final [[inquest]] was held into her death. It lasted fifteen minutes, and the jury reached no conclusion. Nassau County Coroner Edward Neu was quoted as saying, \"Whatever I decide, it will only be a matter of opinion.\"<ref name=kennedy />\n\n=== Alternative theories ===\nGoodman theorized that Faithfull was killed by Long Island mobster Vannie Higgins and his associates. According to Goodman's research, Higgins had learned that the Faithfulls were extorting money from Peters due to his past improper sexual relationship with Starr.

According to this theory, Faithfull went to the beach with a man she had picked up, ostensibly to have sexual relations.

John Midas is delighted when, through a magical gift, everything his lips touch turns into chocolate. The story is patterned after the myth of [[King Midas]], whose magic turned everything he touched into gold. The original illustrations were by [[Mildred Coughlin McNutt]], but another edition in the same year, a \"newly illustrated\" edition, had illustrations by Margot Apple and more pages.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/chocolate-touch/oclc/748389234 ''The Chocolate Touch''] at [[WorldCat]]</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nJohn Midas is a young boy with an intense, but obsessive love of confectionery, especially chocolate. The family doctor warns John that his health is poor, and until further notice, he is to eat only those foods that are conducive to a healthy body, much to the boy's disgruntlement. The doctor's orders are backed by John's folks, who dispose of their son's entire candy stash and have control over his spending money. Angered at having his life [[micromanagement|micromanaged]], John goes for a walk to clear his head. \n\nWhilst on his excursion he sees a coin on the ground, and thinks his good fortune as a way to buy a quick fix of chocolate, only to be dismayed to think the coin must be a novelty, as it is engraved with the image of a fat boy and the letters JM. Even so, John remarks the coin is unique as JM stands for John Midas, and decides to hang on to it. Also on his walk he comes across a candy store he has never seen before. Even more odd is that the store is run by a storekeeper whom John has never met before, but is friendly and refers to John by name and extols his chocolate as the finest ever. The confectioner offers John a box of his chocolates in exchange for the strange coin. That night before going to bed, John decides to have one final chocolate feast, only to be dismayed to find the box contains nothing save for an ordinary chocolate ball, which does not taste overly different from most other types of chocolate.\n\nThe next morning, John is amazed to find everything he eats tastes like chocolate. Then, the Chocolate Touch's effects go into full swing, and whatever touches his mouth turns to chocolate. However, he cannot properly hydrate himself this way. He then gets tired of eating chocolate and begins to view foods with [[nutrients]] as the tastiest delicacies on earth. Soon he damages his friendship with a girl when he spoils a birthday party when bobbing for apples later in the day. John's dad asks where he got the chocolate, but both are dismayed when the candy store had mysteriously vanished. They go to Dr. Cranium, the family physician, who tries to give John a tonic - John promptly spits out chocolate syrup and a chocolate spoon. Dr. Cranium decides to name the disease \"Cranium's disease\" and Mrs. Midas cries when she finds out about the disease. In order to comfort her, John tries to kiss his mother, who also turns to chocolate. Horrified, he rushes to the candy store, which has now reappeared, and the chocolate vendor offers him a choice between removing the Chocolate Touch and restoring his mother: John asks the storekeeper to help his mother and the storekeeper forgives him. Everything returns to normal, including Mrs. Midas, and the candy store disappears once and for all.\n\n==Themes==\n''There are no memes\n\n==Significance==\n''The Chocolate Touch'' is still in print, and is often used in grade school curricula throughout the United States.<ref>[http://www.emints.org/ethemes/resources/S00000564.shtml eMints National Center], \"Literature: \"The Chocolate Touch\" by Patrick Catling\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref><ref>[http://www.ksagclassroom.org/Lessons/genag/3-4/The_Chocolate_Touch.pdf ksagclassroom.org], ''The Chocolate Touch'' in course material and lesson plan, accessed 01-21-2009</ref>  It won the [[Massachusetts Children's Book Award]]<ref>[http://www.noblenet.org/webcat/booklists/mcba.htm The Massachusetts Children's Book Award], \"1989 - The Chocolate Touch by Patrick Catling\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> in 1989, the Utah Children's Choice Honors Award in 1983,<ref>[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/664/Apple-Margot-1946.html Children's Choice Honors Award], \"Utah Children's Choice, 1983, for The Chocolate Touch\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> and the Beehive Award<ref>[http://mtpleasantlib.org/children/book-lists/the-utah-beehive-awards/ The Utah Beehive Awards], \"Utah Children's Fiction Book Award - The Chocolate Touch By Patrick Catling (1983)\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> from the Children's Literature Association of Utah in 1983.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chocolate Touch, The}}\n[[Category:1952 American novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Chocolate]]\n[[Category:Greco-Roman mythology in popular culture]]\n[[Category:1952 children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Book by Patrick Skene Catling}}\n{{Infobox book\n| italic title   = <!--(see above)-->\n| name           =  The Chocolate Touch\n| image          = \n| image_size     = \n| alt            = \n| caption        = \n| author         = [[Patrick Skene Catling]]\n| audio_read_by  = \n| title_orig     = \n| orig_lang_code = \n| title_working  = \n| translator     = \n| illustrator    = Mildred Coughlin McNutt\n| cover_artist   = \n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| series         = \n| release_number = \n| subject        = \n| genre          = \n| set_in         = \n| published      = 1952 by [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]]\n| media_type     = \n| pages          = 95\n| awards         = \n| isbn           = \n| oclc           = 1470182\n| dewey          = \n| congress       = \n}}'''''The Chocolate Touch''''' is a children's book by [[Patrick Skene Catling]], first published in the US in 1952.

It has sometimes been suggested that it derives from five-toed chickens brought to Britain by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the first century AD,{{r|sid|janet}} but it is not known whether the Romans brought poultry with them, nor if they found five-toed poultry when they arrived.{{r|rbst}} The Roman writer [[Columella]], active at that time, mentions five-toed hens as being the best breeding-stock: \"they are reckoned the most generous which have five toes\".{{r|millar|page=342}}\n\nThe Dorking originated in the southern [[home counties]] in south-east England, and is named for the [[market town]] of [[Dorking]], in [[Surrey]], from where birds were sent to the markets of London. It was the principal meat breed supplied to the metropolis until it was displaced by the [[Sussex (chicken)|Sussex]] in the early part of the twentieth century; it also became popular as an exhibition bird.{{r|dave}} It was among the breeds shown at the first [[poultry show]], at [[London Zoo]] in 1845.{{r|roberts|page=289}}\n\nThe Dorking was included in the first [[British Poultry Standard|poultry standard]], ''The Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry'', edited by [[William Bernhardt Tegetmeier]] and published in 1865 by the original [[Poultry Club of Great Britain]].{{r|1sted}} In the late nineteenth century, separate [[breed societies]] formed for the various colour varieties; two of these merged to form the Dorking Club, and a Scottish Dorking Club also formed. By about the time of the [[Second World War]], none of these remained active.{{r|dave}} Interest in the breed had decreased rapidly, and it drew close to extinction. The Dorking Club was restarted in 1970.{{r|dave}}\n\nThree colour varieties \u2013 coloured, silver-grey and white \u2013 were included in the first [[Standard of Perfection]] of the [[American Poultry Association]] in 1874; the red was added in 1995.{{r|apa}} Three bantam varieties \u2013 coloured, silver-grey and rose-comb white \u2013 were added in 1960.{{r|apa}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Dorking has a rectangular body with short, five-toed legs. As with all single comb poultry, the comb points may require protection in extremely cold weather. Dorkings are also well known for their versatility as a breed for both egg and meat production.

It has sometimes been suggested that it derives from five-toed chickens brought to Britain by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the first century AD,{{r|sid|janet}} but it is not known whether the Romans brought poultry with them, nor if they found five-toed poultry when they arrived.{{r|rbst}} The Roman writer [[Columella]], active at that time, mentions five-toed hens as being the best breeding-stock: \"they are reckoned the most generous which have five toes\".{{r|millar|page=342}}\n\nThe Dorking originated in the southern [[home counties]] in south-east England, and is named for the [[market town]] of [[Dorking]], in [[Surrey]], from where birds were sent to the markets of London. It was the principal meat breed supplied to the metropolis until it was displaced by the [[Sussex (chicken)|Sussex]] in the early part of the twentieth century; it also became popular as an exhibition bird.{{r|dave}} It was among the breeds shown at the first [[poultry show]], at [[London Zoo]] in 1845.{{r|roberts|page=289}}\n\nThe Dorking was included in the first [[British Poultry Standard|poultry standard]], ''The Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry'', edited by [[William Bernhardt Tegetmeier]] and published in 1865 by the original [[Poultry Club of Great Britain]].{{r|1sted}} In the late nineteenth century, separate [[breed societies]] formed for the various colour varieties; two of these merged to form the Dorking Club, and a Scottish Dorking Club also formed. By about the time of the [[Second World War]], none of these remained active.{{r|dave}} Interest in the breed had decreased rapidly, and it drew close to extinction. The Dorking Club was restarted in 1970.{{r|dave}}\n\nThree colour varieties \u2013 coloured, silver-grey and white \u2013 were included in the first [[Standard of Perfection]] of the [[American Poultry Association]] in 1874; the red was added in 1995.{{r|apa}} Three bantam varieties \u2013 coloured, silver-grey and rose-comb white \u2013 were added in 1960.{{r|apa}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Dorking has a rectangular body with short, five-toed legs. As with all single comb poultry, the comb points may require protection in extremely cold weather. Dorkings are also well known for their versatility as a breed for both egg and meat production.

Named after her late husband [[Steven J. Ross]], the school was founded in 1991 by Courtney Sale Ross as a day school for her daughter and several friends. Originally offering pre-nursery, nursery, and pre-kindergarten programs, the school discontinued these in September 2020<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garrison |first1=Virginia |title=Ross School To End Programs For Youngest Students |url=https://www.27east.com/east-hampton-press/ross-school-to-end-programs-for-youngest-students-1669510/ |publisher=East Hampton Press |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>. It transitioned to a boarding school in 2010 after Ms. Ross discontinued private funding. \n\nA majority of the student body is international, with the highest-represented nations including Brazil, China and Russia.

All five of these players would eventually go on to play at least a season in the NBA.\n\nOkafor flew under the recruiting radar for much of his high school career, but by the end of his senior year, Okafor was receiving late interest from top programs and chose to accept a scholarship at the [[University of Connecticut]], choosing the Huskies over [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] and [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/042001/col_042001025.shtml|title=Bellaire's Okafor to sign with Connecticut - Lubbock Online - Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|website=lubbockonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nOkafor played for the University of Connecticut from 2001 to 2004 where he was teammates with [[Charlie Villanueva]], [[Marcus Williams (basketball, born 1985)|Marcus Williams]], [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], [[Hilton Armstrong]] and [[Josh Boone (basketball)|Josh Boone]], who all went on to play in the NBA. He majored in [[finance]] during his time at Connecticut, and he graduated with honors after three years in May 2004 with a 3.8 [[Grade point average|GPA]]. Okafor was named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2004 for his work on and off the court.\n\nOkafor is noted for his impressive defensive ability, especially his shot-blocking. Although he was plagued by back problems for most of the 2003\u201304 season, Okafor led UConn to the program's second [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|national title]] in six seasons. He was crowned as the [[NCAA]] tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. In addition, Okafor led the nation in blocks that season and was also named National Defensive Player of the Year by the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]]. He also received the [[Big East Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big East Player of the Year]] award. Okafor graduated as Connecticut's leader in blocked shots with 441.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hoopshype.com/players/emeka_okafor.htm |title=HoopsHype Players \u2013 50 Emeka Okafor |work=HoopsHype.com |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> In light of his collegiate achievements, Okafor was made a member of the 2004 U.S. National Men's Basketball Team which represented the U.S. at the Olympics in Athens.\n\nOn February 5, 2007, he was inducted to the Husky Ring Of Honor at [[Harry A. Gampel Pavilion|Gampel Pavilion]] on the University of Connecticut campus in [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]] during halftime of the men's basketball game against the [[Syracuse Orange]] as part of a ceremony which recognized personal accomplishments of 13 former players and 3 coaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depthoffieldphoto.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/huskies-of-honor/|title=Huskies of Honor|date=July 23, 2008|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Charlotte Bobcats (2004\u20132009)===\nOn April 16, 2004, Okafor declared his eligibility for the [[2004 NBA draft]], giving up his one remaining year of college athletic eligibility. He did, however, receive his undergraduate degree in Accounting/Finance in three academic years. On June 24, Okafor was selected second overall in the draft, becoming the first ever draft pick by the expansion [[Charlotte Bobcats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/draft_okafor_062404.html |title=Bobcats Select Emeka Okafor As First-Ever Rookie Draft Pick |work=NBA.com |date=June 24, 2004 |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606002430/http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/draft_okafor_062404.html |archivedate=June 6, 2015 }}</ref> The following day, he accepted an invitation to join the [[Dream Team IV|United States team]] for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], which finished with the [[bronze medal]] in [[Athens]].\n\nThe [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] was a successful campaign as Okafor coped well with the pressures of being the star rookie on an expansion franchise. Highlights of the season included recording 19 straight [[Double-doubles|double-double]]s from November 21 through January 1, and finishing seventh among [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] forwards in [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] fan balloting with 408,082 votes, by far the highest number garnered by any [[rookie]] in 2005. At the end of the season, Okafor beat out his friend and former college teammate and roommate, [[Chicago Bulls]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], to win the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2053181 |title=Okafor named Rookie of Year |publisher=ESPN |date=May 5, 2005 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, the Bobcats picked up the option for the fourth year on Okafor's contract, as he quickly established himself as the face of the franchise, and a solid player for years to come. Okafor finished his rookie season with 44.7% [[field goal (basketball)|field goal]] percentage and per-game averages of 15.1 points, 10.9 rebounds (ranked 4th in the league<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2005.html|title=2004-05 NBA Season Summary - Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>), and 1.7 blocks.\n\nIn the 2005 offseason, Okafor's weight increased from 260 to 280&nbsp;lbs. It was this weight gain which he felt caused him to have trouble rehabbing his early season ankle injury and forced him to sit out most of the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] with injuries to his ankle.<ref name=\"dailydime\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dailydime-061125-26 |title=SPECIAL WEEKEND EDITION: Passing some hefty judgments |publisher=ESPN |date=November 26, 2006 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> Nonetheless in the few games he played he was effective as he averaged a double-double for the second consecutive season. For the season he finished with averages of 13.2 points on 41.5% shooting, 10.0 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game.\n\n[[File:Bobcats vs Pistons tip off.jpg|thumb|right|Okafor tipping-off against [[Rasheed Wallace]].]]\nDuring the offseason he continued his tutorials with [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], which he took up after his rookie season,<ref name=\"dailydime\" /> and lost the 20 pounds which he had gained for his second season. Okafor felt this weight loss gave him more energy and mobility. He led the Bobcats in rebounds per game, blocks per game, and field goal percentage. On December 29, 2006, in a home game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Emeka would record 22 points, 25 rebounds, and 4 blocks in over 51 minutes of play, in an epic 133\u2013124 triple overtime victory. He also had eight blocks in games against the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics. On January 12, 2007, he would record an NBA season high ten blocks in a game against the New York Knicks. His ten blocks were the most ever recorded in a single game at Madison Square Garden. In that game, he was one rebound away from recording the first ever [[triple-double]] in franchise history, finishing with 20 pts, 10 blocks, 9 rebounds, and 3 steals.  Later in the season, he suffered an ankle injury which caused him to miss fifteen games. He finished the season averaging 14.4 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 67 games.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2007\u201308 season, Okafor turned down a contract extension with the Charlotte Bobcats worth an estimated US$60 million over five years. Despite turning down the contract, Okafor maintained that he indeed wanted to remain with the Bobcats. Despite feuding with head coach Sam Vincent throughout the season, Okafor still managed to average a double-double for the fourth consecutive season of his career. He also played in all 82 games of the regular season for the first time in his career. At the end of the season head coach Sam Vincent was fired by part-owner Michael Jordan saying in a statement: \"The decision to remove Sam as head coach after just one season was difficult, but it was a decision that had to be made because my first obligation is to do what is in the best interest of our team.\"\n\nDuring the off-season, the Bobcats' top priority was to re-sign Okafor. Through tough negotiations the Bobcats and Okafor eventually reached an agreement on a six-year, $72 million deal, the largest in franchise history. In a statement, Okafor voiced his pleasure with remaining in the organization: \"The Bobcats and the entire Charlotte community embraced me from day one, and it's exciting to enter this season with a Hall of Fame coach and teammates who are committed to winning.\"\n\nOkafor entered the 2008\u201309 season with active franchise-record streaks of 93 consecutive games played and 92 consecutive games started.\n\n===New Orleans Hornets (2009\u20132012)===\nOn July 28, 2009, Okafor was traded to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] in exchange for [[Tyson Chandler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4359609 |title=Sources: Hornets, Cats agree on deal |publisher=ESPN |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> During the [[2010\u201311 NBA season|2010\u201311 season]], Okafor ended up making it to his first ever NBA playoff series against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

Phoebus]] of the [[Korean Basketball League]] (KBL). Okafor attended [[Bellaire High School (Bellaire, Texas)|Bellaire High School]] in [[Bellaire, Texas]] and the [[University of Connecticut]], where in 2004 he won a national championship.\n\n==Early life==\nOkafor was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

While in Bartlesville, Okafor's father took his son to the Bartlesville YMCA to learn the game of basketball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/stories/040604aac.html |title=Okafor Exemplifies Concept of 'Student-Athlete' |work=CSTV.com |date=April 6, 2004 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==High school career==\nOkafor played at Bellaire High School with future Oklahoma State star [[John Lucas III]]. Okafor averaged 22 points, 16 rebounds and 7 blocks in his senior season. Bellaire was 26\u20135 in that season, losing 56\u201342 in the third round of the 2001 [[University Interscholastic League|UIL]] state playoffs, to [[Willowridge High School (Houston)|Willowridge High School]] and future [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] standout [[T. J. Ford]]. This game is particularly notable, however, because it featured five players who would go on to play in an NCAA Final Four (Bellaire had Lucas and Okafor, while Willowridge featured Ford, Oklahoma State's [[Ivan McFarlin]] and Duke's [[Daniel Ewing]]). All five of these players would eventually go on to play at least a season in the NBA.\n\nOkafor flew under the recruiting radar for much of his high school career, but by the end of his senior year, Okafor was receiving late interest from top programs and chose to accept a scholarship at the [[University of Connecticut]], choosing the Huskies over [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] and [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/042001/col_042001025.shtml|title=Bellaire's Okafor to sign with Connecticut - Lubbock Online - Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|website=lubbockonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nOkafor played for the University of Connecticut from 2001 to 2004 where he was teammates with [[Charlie Villanueva]], [[Marcus Williams (basketball, born 1985)|Marcus Williams]], [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], [[Hilton Armstrong]] and [[Josh Boone (basketball)|Josh Boone]], who all went on to play in the NBA. He majored in [[finance]] during his time at Connecticut, and he graduated with honors after three years in May 2004 with a 3.8 [[Grade point average|GPA]]. Okafor was named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2004 for his work on and off the court.\n\nOkafor is noted for his impressive defensive ability, especially his shot-blocking. Although he was plagued by back problems for most of the 2003\u201304 season, Okafor led UConn to the program's second [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|national title]] in six seasons. He was crowned as the [[NCAA]] tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. In addition, Okafor led the nation in blocks that season and was also named National Defensive Player of the Year by the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]]. He also received the [[Big East Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big East Player of the Year]] award. Okafor graduated as Connecticut's leader in blocked shots with 441.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hoopshype.com/players/emeka_okafor.htm |title=HoopsHype Players \u2013 50 Emeka Okafor |work=HoopsHype.com |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> In light of his collegiate achievements, Okafor was made a member of the 2004 U.S. National Men's Basketball Team which represented the U.S. at the Olympics in Athens.\n\nOn February 5, 2007, he was inducted to the Husky Ring Of Honor at [[Harry A. Gampel Pavilion|Gampel Pavilion]] on the University of Connecticut campus in [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]] during halftime of the men's basketball game against the [[Syracuse Orange]] as part of a ceremony which recognized personal accomplishments of 13 former players and 3 coaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depthoffieldphoto.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/huskies-of-honor/|title=Huskies of Honor|date=July 23, 2008|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Charlotte Bobcats (2004\u20132009)===\nOn April 16, 2004, Okafor declared his eligibility for the [[2004 NBA draft]], giving up his one remaining year of college athletic eligibility. He did, however, receive his undergraduate degree in Accounting/Finance in three academic years. On June 24, Okafor was selected second overall in the draft, becoming the first ever draft pick by the expansion [[Charlotte Bobcats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/draft_okafor_062404.html |title=Bobcats Select Emeka Okafor As First-Ever Rookie Draft Pick |work=NBA.com |date=June 24, 2004 |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606002430/http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/draft_okafor_062404.html |archivedate=June 6, 2015 }}</ref> The following day, he accepted an invitation to join the [[Dream Team IV|United States team]] for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], which finished with the [[bronze medal]] in [[Athens]].\n\nThe [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] was a successful campaign as Okafor coped well with the pressures of being the star rookie on an expansion franchise. Highlights of the season included recording 19 straight [[Double-doubles|double-double]]s from November 21 through January 1, and finishing seventh among [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] forwards in [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] fan balloting with 408,082 votes, by far the highest number garnered by any [[rookie]] in 2005. At the end of the season, Okafor beat out his friend and former college teammate and roommate, [[Chicago Bulls]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], to win the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2053181 |title=Okafor named Rookie of Year |publisher=ESPN |date=May 5, 2005 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, the Bobcats picked up the option for the fourth year on Okafor's contract, as he quickly established himself as the face of the franchise, and a solid player for years to come. Okafor finished his rookie season with 44.7% [[field goal (basketball)|field goal]] percentage and per-game averages of 15.1 points, 10.9 rebounds (ranked 4th in the league<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2005.html|title=2004-05 NBA Season Summary - Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>), and 1.7 blocks.\n\nIn the 2005 offseason, Okafor's weight increased from 260 to 280&nbsp;lbs. It was this weight gain which he felt caused him to have trouble rehabbing his early season ankle injury and forced him to sit out most of the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] with injuries to his ankle.<ref name=\"dailydime\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dailydime-061125-26 |title=SPECIAL WEEKEND EDITION: Passing some hefty judgments |publisher=ESPN |date=November 26, 2006 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> Nonetheless in the few games he played he was effective as he averaged a double-double for the second consecutive season. For the season he finished with averages of 13.2 points on 41.5% shooting, 10.0 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game.\n\n[[File:Bobcats vs Pistons tip off.jpg|thumb|right|Okafor tipping-off against [[Rasheed Wallace]].]]\nDuring the offseason he continued his tutorials with [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], which he took up after his rookie season,<ref name=\"dailydime\" /> and lost the 20 pounds which he had gained for his second season. Okafor felt this weight loss gave him more energy and mobility. He led the Bobcats in rebounds per game, blocks per game, and field goal percentage. On December 29, 2006, in a home game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Emeka would record 22 points, 25 rebounds, and 4 blocks in over 51 minutes of play, in an epic 133\u2013124 triple overtime victory. He also had eight blocks in games against the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics. On January 12, 2007, he would record an NBA season high ten blocks in a game against the New York Knicks. His ten blocks were the most ever recorded in a single game at Madison Square Garden. In that game, he was one rebound away from recording the first ever [[triple-double]] in franchise history, finishing with 20 pts, 10 blocks, 9 rebounds, and 3 steals.  Later in the season, he suffered an ankle injury which caused him to miss fifteen games. He finished the season averaging 14.4 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 67 games.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2007\u201308 season, Okafor turned down a contract extension with the Charlotte Bobcats worth an estimated US$60 million over five years. Despite turning down the contract, Okafor maintained that he indeed wanted to remain with the Bobcats. Despite feuding with head coach Sam Vincent throughout the season, Okafor still managed to average a double-double for the fourth consecutive season of his career. He also played in all 82 games of the regular season for the first time in his career. At the end of the season head coach Sam Vincent was fired by part-owner Michael Jordan saying in a statement: \"The decision to remove Sam as head coach after just one season was difficult, but it was a decision that had to be made because my first obligation is to do what is in the best interest of our team.\"\n\nDuring the off-season, the Bobcats' top priority was to re-sign Okafor. Through tough negotiations the Bobcats and Okafor eventually reached an agreement on a six-year, $72 million deal, the largest in franchise history. In a statement, Okafor voiced his pleasure with remaining in the organization: \"The Bobcats and the entire Charlotte community embraced me from day one, and it's exciting to enter this season with a Hall of Fame coach and teammates who are committed to winning.\"\n\nOkafor entered the 2008\u201309 season with active franchise-record streaks of 93 consecutive games played and 92 consecutive games started.\n\n===New Orleans Hornets (2009\u20132012)===\nOn July 28, 2009, Okafor was traded to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] in exchange for [[Tyson Chandler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4359609 |title=Sources: Hornets, Cats agree on deal |publisher=ESPN |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> During the [[2010\u201311 NBA season|2010\u201311 season]], Okafor ended up making it to his first ever NBA playoff series against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

A remake of the 1987 [[Hindi]] film ''[[Khudgarz]]'', itself based on [[Jeffrey Archer]]'s novel ''[[Kane and Abel (novel)|Kane and Abel]]'', it stars [[Rajinikanth]], [[Khushbu Sundar|Kushboo]] and [[Sarath Babu]] with [[Radha Ravi]], [[Nizhalgal Ravi]] and [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]] in supporting roles. The film revolves around Annaamalai, a poor milkman, and Ashok, the son of a rich businessman, who have been friends since childhood, a friendship opposed by Ashok's father who attempts to create a rift between the two.\n\n''Annaamalai'' was launched with director [[Vasanth]], who later opted out due to personal reasons. Suresh Krissna replaced him as director, and also contributed to the screenplay while Shanmugasundaram wrote the dialogues. [[Principal photography]] of the film began in March 1992 and the entire filming process lasted 45 working days. The score and soundtrack were composed by [[Deva (composer)|Deva]] and lyrics for all songs were written by [[Vairamuthu]]. The cinematography was handled by P. S. Prakash and editing by the duo Ganesh\u2013Kumar.\n\n''Annaamalai'' was released on 27 June 1992. The film became a box-office success, running for 175 days in theatres and was the highest-grossing film in [[Tamil cinema]] until 1995 when the record was broken by ''[[Baashha]]''. It was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] in 1993 as ''[[Kondapalli Raja]]'' and in [[Kannada]] in 2003 as ''[[Gokarna (film)|Gokarna]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nAnnaamalai is a milkman, while Ashok is the owner of a five-star hotel in Chennai. They have been very close friends since their childhood. Ashok's father Gangadharan never liked his son's friendship with a poor milkman. Annaamalai is kind-hearted and innocent, and falls in love with Subbulakshmi, a college girl he eventually marries. Ashok too falls in love with a poor girl, Shanthi. Annaamalai arranges Ashok and Shanthi's wedding which angers Gangadharan as he thinks Shanthi lacks the status to become his daughter-in-law.\n\nAnnaamalai encounters a problem with a politician named Ekambaram following which Ekambaram understands Annaamalai's good nature. Annaamalai's small home along with a few cents of empty land is located in prime location, to which Annaamalai held sentimental values to, made Gangadharan pressure Ashok to buy so that they can construct a star hotel. Ashok is initially hesitant as he does not want to mix business and friendship, but later agrees. Annaamalai happily accepts and also agrees to give the land for free of cost emulating pure friendship. Ashok feels proud of Annaamalai and informs his father that Annaamalai has to be made a shareholder in the new hotel. Gangadharan agrees but decides to cheat Annaamalai and gets signature in empty papers.\n\nThe star hotel is constructed and Gangadharan plans to demolish Annaamalai's home which is located next to the hotel. Gangadharan and Ashok's cousin Sargunam forge documents and take control of Annaamalai's empty land. Annaamalai learns of this plan and picks up quarrel with Gangadharan. Ashok interrupts and he misunderstands Annaamalai without knowing the truth for fighting with Ashok's father. Ashok gets angry and demolishes Annaamalai's home which is in the remembrance of Annaamalai's father. In response, Annaamalai challenges that he will also become rich and take revenge on Ashok.\n\nEkambaram helps Annaamalai to secure funds. Annaamalai starts a small sweets business and, over the course of fifteen years, he becomes so rich and he also builds a star hotel in Chennai which becomes more popular than Ashok's hotel. Sargunam steals money from Ashok and knowing this, Ashok asks him to leave. Sargunam joins Annaamalai's hotel and also marries Annaamalai's sister, Kamala. Annaamalai wins Ashok and become the president of hotels association and Ashok also faces financial troubles. Annaamalai's daughter and Ashok's son love each other; Annamalai opposes this because of his hatred for Ashok. Annaamalai and Ashok appear for a public auction and the auction price keeps increasing. Ashok wins the auction for {{INRConvert|120|m|lk=no|year=1992}} despite Gangadharan asking him not to quote such a huge amount as this was a trick played by Annaamalai to increase the price.\n\nAshok has no money to pay for the auction and is forced to sell his bungalow to get money. Annaamalai purchases Ashok's bungalow, thereby winning the challenge made years ago. But Annaamalai gives the registration document to his mother Sivagami and asks her to handover to Ashok itself thinking about the old friendship in mind and he did not want to punish his friend. Ashok and Gangadharan realise their mistake and apologise to Sivagami knowing Annaamalai's kind heart. Annaamalai also gets to know that it was only Gangadharan and Sargunam who forged the documents and Ashok was unaware of his father's plans. Sargunam later hires an assassin to kill Ashok to usurp his wealth. But Annaamalai saves Ashok, kills the assassin and Sargunam seeks forgiveness. Annaamalai and Ashok reconcile and become best friends again, and fix their children's marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Rajinikanth]] as Annaamalai\n*[[Khushbu Sundar|Kushboo]] as Subbulakshmi\n*[[Sarath Babu]] as Ashok\n*[[Rekha (South Indian actress)|Rekha]] as Shanthi<ref name=\"dinamalarnellai\" />\n*[[Radha Ravi]] as Gangadharan\n*[[Janagaraj]] as Panchachari (Panchu)\n*[[Nizhalgal Ravi]] as Sargunam{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=53}}\n*[[Tiger Prabhakar]] as Don<ref>{{cite news |last1=Raman |first1=Pratiba |title=Rajinikanth\u2019s Darbar trailer breakdown/review: How is it?

A remake of the 1987 [[Hindi]] film ''[[Khudgarz]]'', itself based on [[Jeffrey Archer]]'s novel ''[[Kane and Abel (novel)|Kane and Abel]]'', it stars [[Rajinikanth]], [[Khushbu Sundar|Kushboo]] and [[Sarath Babu]] with [[Radha Ravi]], [[Nizhalgal Ravi]] and [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]] in supporting roles. The film revolves around Annaamalai, a poor milkman, and Ashok, the son of a rich businessman, who have been friends since childhood, a friendship opposed by Ashok's father who attempts to create a rift between the two.\n\n''Annaamalai'' was launched with director [[Vasanth]], who later opted out due to personal reasons. Suresh Krissna replaced him as director, and also contributed to the screenplay while Shanmugasundaram wrote the dialogues. [[Principal photography]] of the film began in March 1992 and the entire filming process lasted 45 working days. The score and soundtrack were composed by [[Deva (composer)|Deva]] and lyrics for all songs were written by [[Vairamuthu]]. The cinematography was handled by P. S. Prakash and editing by the duo Ganesh\u2013Kumar.\n\n''Annaamalai'' was released on 27 June 1992. The film became a box-office success, running for 175 days in theatres and was the highest-grossing film in [[Tamil cinema]] until 1995 when the record was broken by ''[[Baashha]]''. It was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] in 1993 as ''[[Kondapalli Raja]]'' and in [[Kannada]] in 2003 as ''[[Gokarna (film)|Gokarna]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nAnnaamalai is a milkman, while Ashok is the owner of a five-star hotel in Chennai. They have been very close friends since their childhood. Ashok's father Gangadharan never liked his son's friendship with a poor milkman. Annaamalai is kind-hearted and innocent, and falls in love with Subbulakshmi, a college girl he eventually marries. Ashok too falls in love with a poor girl, Shanthi. Annaamalai arranges Ashok and Shanthi's wedding which angers Gangadharan as he thinks Shanthi does not have the status to become his daughter-in-law.\n\nAnnaamalai encounters a problem with a politician named Ekambaram following which Ekambaram understands Annaamalai's good nature. Annaamalai's small home along with a few cents of empty land is located in prime location, to which Annaamalai held sentimental values to, made Gangadharan pressurise Ashok to buy so that they can construct a star hotel. Ashok is initially hesitant as he does not want to mix business and friendship, but later agrees. Annaamalai happily accepts and also agrees to give the land for free of cost emulating pure friendship. Ashok feels proud of Annaamalai and informs his father that Annaamalai has to be made a shareholder in the new hotel. Gangadharan agrees but decides to cheat Annaamalai and gets signature in empty papers.\n\nThe star hotel is constructed and Gangadharan plans to demolish Annaamalai's home which is located next to the hotel. Gangadharan and Ashok's cousin Sargunam forge documents and take control of Annaamalai's empty land. Annaamalai learns of this plan and picks up quarrel with Gangadharan. Ashok interrupts and he misunderstands Annaamalai without knowing the truth for fighting with Ashok's father. Ashok gets angry and demolishes Annaamalai's home which is in the remembrance of Annaamalai's father. In response, Annaamalai challenges that he will also become rich and take revenge on Ashok.\n\nEkambaram helps Annaamalai to secure funds. Annaamalai starts a small sweets business and, over the course of fifteen years, he becomes so rich and he also builds a star hotel in Chennai which becomes more popular than Ashok's hotel. Sargunam steals money from Ashok and knowing this, Ashok asks him to leave. Sargunam joins Annaamalai's hotel and also gets married to Annaamalai's sister, Kamala. Annaamalai wins Ashok and become the president of hotels association and Ashok also faces financial troubles. Annaamalai's daughter and Ashok's son love each other; Annamalai opposes this because of his hatred for Ashok. Annaamalai and Ashok appear for a public auction and the auction price keeps increasing. Ashok wins the auction for {{INRConvert|120|m|lk=no|year=1992}} despite Gangadharan asking him not to quote such a huge amount as this was a trick played by Annaamalai to increase the price.\n\nAshok has no money to pay for the auction and is forced to sell his bungalow to get money. Annaamalai purchases Ashok's bungalow, thereby winning the challenge made years ago. But Annaamalai gives the registration document to his mother Sivagami and asks her to handover to Ashok itself thinking about the old friendship in mind and he did not want to punish his friend. Ashok and Gangadharan realise their mistake and apologise to Sivagami knowing Annaamalai's kind heart. Annaamalai also gets to know that it was only Gangadharan and Sargunam who forged the documents and Ashok was unaware of his father's plans. Sargunam later hires an assassin to kill Ashok to usurp his wealth. But Annaamalai saves Ashok, kills the assassin and Sargunam seeks forgiveness. Annaamalai and Ashok reconcile and become best friends again, and fix their children's marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Rajinikanth]] as Annaamalai\n*[[Khushbu Sundar|Kushboo]] as Subbulakshmi\n*[[Sarath Babu]] as Ashok\n*[[Rekha (South Indian actress)|Rekha]] as Shanthi<ref name=\"dinamalarnellai\" />\n*[[Radha Ravi]] as Gangadharan\n*[[Janagaraj]] as Panchachari (Panchu)\n*[[Nizhalgal Ravi]] as Sargunam{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=53}}\n*[[Tiger Prabhakar]] as Don<ref>{{cite news |last1=Raman |first1=Pratiba |title=Rajinikanth\u2019s Darbar trailer breakdown/review: How is it?

Upon arrival the same day, he was informed that Balachander, his mentor, was waiting for him.

Krissna realised there was still a lot of work to be done because reasons like \"why does his house mean so much to him, why does the rich man's father hate this milkman, what angers the hero so much that he goes against his rich friend\" had yet to be established.

Krissna removed the scene from the final cut as he felt it had no bearing on the script.{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nThe scene where Annaamalai enters a ladies' hostel and gets terrified by a snake was shot at Chakra House, Alwarpet.{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=19}} A snake was brought specially for the scene. The owner of the snake earlier worked in previous films of Rajinikanth. Suresh asked his assistants Nagappan and [[K. Natraj]] to check the details about the snake charmer. Krissna recalled that he covered his nervousness with his smile. Krissna told cinematographer P. S. Prakash to use zoom lens so that he could adjust a camera according to the situation. After the scene was finished, the members of the crew enjoyed the shot. Krissna congratulated Rajinikanth and asked him how he performed it so well and if it was planned, and Rajinikanth replied it was not planned; expressions in the scene were a result of his fear. In the same scene, Shanmugasundaram came with initial dialogues to convey Annaamalai's fear. Krissna felt that dialogues were redundant in such situation. Rajinikanth insisted to keep ''Kadavule Kadavule'' (Oh God! Oh God!) as the dialogue. Krissna agreed to keep the dialogue as it went well into the situation of the scene.{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=19\u201324}} According to Krissna, nobody on set realised that the snake's mouth was not stitched; it was only after filming ended for that day that the director came to realise that Rajinikanth's life was at risk the entire time.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nKrissna wanted the picturisation of \"Vanthenda Paalkaaran\" to be vibrant and colourful stating that he got inspired from the Hindi songs of [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. The scene where Annaamalai shows his face to the camera was extended in slow motion by Krissna as fans would feel as if he was looking towards the audience. The song was choreographed by [[Prabhu Deva]].{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=31\u201334}} The title song \"Annaamalai\" where the title character and Subbu appear in periodic costumes was shot at Fern Hill Palace Hotel while the matching shots were shot at Sivaji Gardens. Krissna shot the song sequence in a technique where the lip sync is perfect while the dance movements being fast revealing that he got inspired from the song \"Mamavukku Koduma\" from ''[[Punnagai Mannan]]'' (1986).{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=35\u201337}} The scene where Annaamalai beats up Sargunam in a one-sided fight was filmed at [[Egmore#Various buildings|Hotel Ambassador Pallava]].{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=81}} Filming was completed in 45 working days.{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|p=146}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\n[[File:Super Star Rajni.gif|thumb|The \"Super Star\" graphic title card]]\n''Annaamalai'' was edited by the duo Ganesh\u2013Kumar.{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=68}} It was the first film to feature the introductory \"Super Star\" graphic title card, where the words 'SUPER' and 'STAR' form in blue dots on the screen followed by R-A-J-N-I in gold, set to the sound of laser beams while the word \"Hey!\" plays in [[Loop (music)|loop]] in the background.<ref name=\"SuperStarTitle\" />{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|p=148}} This idea was conceived by Krissna, who was inspired by the opening [[gun barrel sequence]] in the [[Production of the James Bond films|James Bond films]], and felt that Rajinikanth, who was becoming a phenomenon, \"warranted a unique logo to go with his name\".{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=89}}\n\nRajinikanth initially objected to the inclusion of the Super Star title card as he felt it was \"brazen self-aggrandisement\" and \"embarrassing\",{{Sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=90}} but Krissna convinced him, saying it would generate large applause.{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|pp=148\u2013149}} Balachander supported Krissna, and asked Rajinikanth, \"What is wrong in Suresh's idea Rajini?

It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.

The war had been fought in the name of freedom, however around the globe, millions of Africans and [[African diaspora|Afro-Diaspora]] populations lived under European [[Colonialism|colonial rule]]. The Fifth Congress was also unique in comparison to the four earlier Congresses as it was attended by delegates from across the African Diaspora, such as [[Afro-Caribbean people|Afro-Caribbean\u2019s]], [[African Americans|African American\u2019s]], and [[Black British people|Black Briton\u2019s]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml|title=Manchester And The Pan-African Movement|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The Congress made demands for Independence as well as condemning [[imperialism]], [[racial discrimination]], and [[capitalism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shadowandact.com/details-on-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-and-pan-african-film-installation-london|title=Details on the Fifth Pan-African Congress and Pan-African Film Installation (London)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n=== Delegates ===\nOrganised by the influential [[Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Trinidadian]] pan-Africanist [[George Padmore]] and Ghanaian independence leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the Fifth Pan-African Congress was attended by over 90 delegates, including 26 from Africa, 33 from the West Indies and 35 from various British organisations,including the [[West African Students Union]].There were also a few South Asian delegates in attendance.Also, in attendance were several \u00a0black activists living in Manchester.  Delegates included scholars, intellectuals and political activists who would later go on to become influential leaders in various [[African independence movements]] and [[Civil rights movement|American civil rights movements]]. The presence of 77-year-old [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was historic, as he had organized the First Pan-African Congress in 1919.\n\nAmong the delegates were:\n\n* [[Jomo Kenyatta]], Kenya\n* [[W. E. B.

A number of resolutions were passed, among them the criminalization of [[racial discrimination]] and the main resolution decrying [[imperialism]] and [[capitalism]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Katzenellenbogen|first1=Simon|title=The 1945 Pan-African Congress and its Aftermath at The Manchester Civic Celebration, October 13th to 15th, 1995|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/30/058.html|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=2 May 1995}}</ref>\n\n[[Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre|The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre]] holds a collection of material that relates to the 5th Pan-African Congress.

It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.
