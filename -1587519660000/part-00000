{"title_page": "Beaver Area Memorial Library", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe '''Beaver Area Memorial Library''' is part of the [[Beaver County Library System]] in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]]. It is located on College Avenue in [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Beaver Area Memorial Library started as a small collection of books in the basement of the [[Beaver Trust Co.]] (Now [[Huntington Bank]]) in the 1940s and was run by the [[Beaver Civic Club]]. It eventually moved into the basement of a former [[high school]] on College Avenue in Beaver. In 1948, the Beaver County courts granted a charter for the official formation of the Beaver Memorial Library. In early 1949, an old house on the corner of Insurance and Fourth Streets was leased from the Beaver Area [[school district]] for the price of one dollar per year. With the help of local merchants who donated materials and labors, the old house was completely renovated. The library was officially open to the public on September 17, 1949 with Mrs. W. Wallace Rinehart as its [[librarian]] and Miss Jean Sebring as her assistant. By April 1950, the library already had a reported collection of over 4,000 books.\n\nBy 1959, the expanding library had outgrown its quarters on Insurance and Fourth, so the Board of Trustees purchased property on River Road and College Avenue to be used for a new building. A [[fundraiser]] was started in Beaver County in 1961 to raise the $130 thousand to build the new establishment. Due to the support of citizens county wide, the name of the library was changed in 1961 to the Beaver Area Memorial Library to reflect this support. The new building, which continues to serve as the [[public library]] today, was officially dedicated on April 8, 1962 and open to the public.\n\nOver the next fourteen years, the library continued to expand. By 1974 library services and clientele had increased by almost five-fold. Because of this growth, the Board of Trustees put into work an expansion of this building which was finished in 1980. This addition added {{convert|2500|sqft|m2}} at a cost of nearly $140 thousand.\n\nThe library soon outgrew this new addition, and the necessity for yet another addition arose. This time, {{convert|4200|sqft|m2}} was added to the library; expanding [[storage space]], increasing the [[children's library]], enhancing the work area, and allowing more [[computer]]s to be added to suit growing public demand for them. During this addition, [[landscaping]] and the exterior appearance of the library underwent significant improvements. In total, the new renovations costs a total of $1 million.\n\nThe last and latest addition added to the library  was completed in 2003 with the addition of a new wing in the library. Originally planned for the spring of 1998, unforeseen delays stalled the project until early 2001.
