This proposal, although rejected in favour of [[David Asper]]'s plan, called for a $265&nbsp;million stadium at the former Public Markets site in the St. Boniface industrial park, which Canad Inns purchased from the city. The domed stadium would have been part of a $500&nbsp;million complex that would have included a four-star hotel and an indoor water park.<ref name=\"CanadProp\">{{cite news |title = Canad Inns proposes domed stadium for Winnipeg |publisher = CBC News|date = 10 April 2007 |url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/canad-inns-proposes-domed-stadium-for-winnipeg-1.642575|accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref>\n\nDavid Asper's original proposal involved both [[Government of Canada|federal]] and [[Government of Manitoba|provincial]] government financial contributions ($40&nbsp;million each), as well as a transfer of assets (the publicly owned Blue Bomber franchise itself will be transferred into Asper's control, and the existing undeveloped commercial real estate surrounding the stadium). As part of Creswin's commitment to the project, Asper pledged to contribute $65&nbsp;million toward the Maroons Road development. In addition to stadium construction, the Asper proposal included {{convert|217000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail development and a two-level parking facility.\n\n[[File:Investors Group Field logo.png|right|thumb|Logo from 2013 to 2019]]\n\nThe Blue Bombers' board of directors investigated the possibility of rebuilding or substantially upgrading the existing stadium, largely with funds generated from the sale or lease of the adjacent commercial lands<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgowanrussell.com/projects/wbb.php|title=McGowan Russell Group|website=Mcgowanrussell.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref> (the team holds the right to develop this property itself as part of its refinancing agreement with the city of Winnipeg and province of Manitoba). However, being a community owned business, the Bombers organization would have had difficulty in accessing the capital required to move forward with such plans directly. The board placed its plans on hold pending the outcome of Asper's proposal.\n\nThe government was unwilling to grant Asper the $40&nbsp;million at both the provincial and federal levels because it believed the money to be more of a gift than a grant. Creswin drew up a second proposal, where the same 30,000\u201340,000-seat stadium would be built instead in south Point Douglas.<ref>{{cite news |title = Asper unveils new stadium vision |newspaper = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date = 27 June 2008 |url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/32918854.html |accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref> This new plan, they said, would greatly aid in urban renewal in what is the poorest neighborhood in Winnipeg. There was also a state-of-the-art water park and hotel, commercial buildings and several other new buildings in the multimillion-dollar proposal. However, there was controversy as well because south Point Douglas is an avid art community, and many of the residents did not want their character buildings to be destroyed or suffer the loss of their homes.<ref>{{cite news |author = Gary Lawless |title = Selinger grabs ball on stadium |newspaper = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date = 27 March 2010 |url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/selinger-grabs-ball-on-stadium-89319412.html |accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref>\n[[File:Winnipeg Nov 2 2013 Max Hall.JPG|thumb|An in-game photo of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on offence against the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]].]]\nA letter of intent was signed on September 13, 2009, between Asper's Creswin Properties and the University of Manitoba, allowing planning to continue for a stadium at the intersection of Chancellor Matheson Drive and University Crescent. The site is adjacent to the current [[University Stadium (Winnipeg)|University Stadium]], which was built for the 1967 Pan American Games. The new proposal includes the construction of a 33,422-seat stadium, renovation of the existing stadium, and a world-class fitness facility. Inflatable \"bubbles\" covering the playing field were also proposed for both stadiums during the winter months. The cost of the new stadium, was projected to be $115&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bombers-stadium-costs-climb-higher-1.894278|title=Bombers stadium costs climb higher|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe new stadium would also be home of the [[University of Manitoba Bisons]] football team.

([[CJFL]]).\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 33,500 and is partially covered. The stadium contains a corrugated metal roof, restaurant, 52 suites, walk of fame and other amenities.\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\nThe owners of [[Canad Inns]], a Winnipeg-based hotel business and naming rights holder for the [[Canad Inns Stadium|Blue Bombers' former stadium]], forwarded a plan in 2007 to redevelop the entire site for commercial use and construct a football stadium for the Blue Bombers in another location. This proposal, although rejected in favour of [[David Asper]]'s plan, called for a $265&nbsp;million stadium at the former Public Markets site in the St. Boniface industrial park, which Canad Inns purchased from the city. The domed stadium would have been part of a $500&nbsp;million complex that would have included a four-star hotel and an indoor water park.<ref name=\"CanadProp\">{{cite news |title = Canad Inns proposes domed stadium for Winnipeg |publisher = CBC News|date = 10 April 2007 |url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/canad-inns-proposes-domed-stadium-for-winnipeg-1.642575|accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref>\n\nDavid Asper's original proposal involved both [[Government of Canada|federal]] and [[Government of Manitoba|provincial]] government financial contributions ($40&nbsp;million each), as well as a transfer of assets (the publicly owned Blue Bomber franchise itself will be transferred into Asper's control, and the existing undeveloped commercial real estate surrounding the stadium). As part of Creswin's commitment to the project, Asper pledged to contribute $65&nbsp;million toward the Maroons Road development. In addition to stadium construction, the Asper proposal included {{convert|217000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail development and a two-level parking facility.\n\n[[File:Investors Group Field logo.png|right|thumb|Logo from 2013 to 2019]]\n\nThe Blue Bombers' board of directors investigated the possibility of rebuilding or substantially upgrading the existing stadium, largely with funds generated from the sale or lease of the adjacent commercial lands<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgowanrussell.com/projects/wbb.php|title=McGowan Russell Group|website=Mcgowanrussell.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref> (the team holds the right to develop this property itself as part of its refinancing agreement with the city of Winnipeg and province of Manitoba). However, being a community owned business, the Bombers organization would have had difficulty in accessing the capital required to move forward with such plans directly. The board placed its plans on hold pending the outcome of Asper's proposal.\n\nThe government was unwilling to grant Asper the $40&nbsp;million at both the provincial and federal levels because it believed the money to be more of a gift than a grant. Creswin drew up a second proposal, where the same 30,000\u201340,000-seat stadium would be built instead in south Point Douglas.<ref>{{cite news |title = Asper unveils new stadium vision |newspaper = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date = 27 June 2008 |url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/32918854.html |accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref> This new plan, they said, would greatly aid in urban renewal in what is the poorest neighborhood in Winnipeg. There was also a state-of-the-art water park and hotel, commercial buildings and several other new buildings in the multimillion-dollar proposal. However, there was controversy as well because south Point Douglas is an avid art community, and many of the residents did not want their character buildings to be destroyed or suffer the loss of their homes.<ref>{{cite news |author = Gary Lawless |title = Selinger grabs ball on stadium |newspaper = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date = 27 March 2010 |url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/selinger-grabs-ball-on-stadium-89319412.html |accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref>\n[[File:Winnipeg Nov 2 2013 Max Hall.JPG|thumb|An in-game photo of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on offence against the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]].]]\nA letter of intent was signed on September 13, 2009, between Asper's Creswin Properties and the University of Manitoba, allowing planning to continue for a stadium at the intersection of Chancellor Matheson Drive and University Crescent. The site is adjacent to the current [[University Stadium (Winnipeg)|University Stadium]], which was built for the 1967 Pan American Games. The new proposal includes the construction of a 33,422-seat stadium, renovation of the existing stadium, and a world-class fitness facility. Inflatable \"bubbles\" covering the playing field were also proposed for both stadiums during the winter months. The cost of the new stadium, was projected to be $115&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bombers-stadium-costs-climb-higher-1.894278|title=Bombers stadium costs climb higher|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe new stadium would also be home of the [[University of Manitoba Bisons]] football team. The design allows for expansion to 40,000 seats for the [[Grey Cup]] (however for [[2015 Grey Cup]] 36,500 seats were available). The stadium was approved on 2 April 2009.

It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations. In response to the controversy, BioWare released the ''Extended Cut'' [[downloadable content]] pack, which expands upon the original ending. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and Game of the Year from ''[[Game Informer]]''. In March 2017, it was followed by a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[sequel]], ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 3'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes control of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Prima Character\">{{cite book|last1=Musa|first1=Alexander|last2=Bueno|first2=Fernando|last3=Lierop|first3=Raphael Van|title=Mass Effect 3: Prima Official Game Guide|date=2012|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|location=Roseville, CA|isbn=978-0-307-89148-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> If the player has a completed [[saved game]] from ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the character from that game can be imported.<ref name=\"Import\">{{cite web|last1=Moriarty|first1=Colin|title=Mass Effect 3 Review: Page 2 of 3|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/06/mass-effect-3-review?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> By importing an old character, decisions from prior ''Mass Effect'' titles are carried over, which impacts the plot of ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Import\" /> Similar to previous installments in the series, the player is able to choose from six different [[character class]]es that each have their own unique set of skills.<ref name=\"Tips\">{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Kate|title=Before You Start\u2026 Tips for Playing Mass Effect 3 The Best Way|url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HQfbTNo?url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Adept class is proficient in [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers whereas the Soldier class is proficient in weapons.<ref name=\"Tips\"/> By completing assignments and [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], the player is rewarded with [[experience point]]s.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> Once enough points are earned, Shepard levels up, which allows for the unlocking or upgrading of skills along a [[Glossary of video game terms#Skilltree|tree]].<ref name=GSCC>{{cite web|url=http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |title=Comic-Con 2011: Mass Effect 3 Hands-On Preview - Biotics and Branching Upgrades |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053512/http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |website=[[GameSpot]]|last1=McInnis|first1=Shaun}}</ref>\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' has three pre-set [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] modes: Action, Story, and RPG.<ref name=\"Three Modes\">{{cite magazine |last1=Francis |first1=Tom |title=Mass Effect 3 Narrative Mode and Action Mode explained |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/ |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 3, 2018 |date=March 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HSz91FS?url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Action Mode, conversations have automatic replies and normal combat difficulty; in Story Mode, conversations have manual replies and minimal combat difficulty; and in RPG Mode, conversations have manual replies and normal combat difficulty.<ref name=\"Three Modes\" /> The game contains various [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] elements,<ref name=Best>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|title=BioWare: Mass Effect 3 Is the Best Game We've Ever Made|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011|last=Westbrook|first=Logan|magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HT6O6rv?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the ability to augment guns with different ammo types, barrels, modifications, and scopes to improve their effectiveness in combat.

\"generally favorable reviews\" from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game finished with scores of 93 out of 100, making ''Mass Effect 3'' the [[2012 in video gaming|highest-rated game of 2012]] on both systems.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" /><ref name=\"MCPS3\" /><ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCWii\" />\n\nCritics felt that ''Mass Effect 3'' was a satisfying conclusion to the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. In a perfect review for ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Dan Whitehead praised the game for providing a definitive close to the saga instead of something more ambiguous or open-ended.<ref name=\"eurog-review\" /> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner proclaimed that BioWare had created one of the most \"intricately crafted\" stories in the history of video gaming.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> Tom Francis of [[PC Gamer#PC Gamer US|''PC Gamer'' (US)]] remarked that the finale was a \"mixed bag\", but ultimately praised its scale and emotional impact, which he felt was more satisfying than its main plot.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|title=Mass Effect 3 review|last=Francis|first=Tom|date=March 6, 2012|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121208143402/http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|archivedate=December 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nReviewers highlighted the experience of playing ''Mass Effect 3'' with an imported saved game. In a piece for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Arthur Gies opined that, while the game would be engaging without any previous context, it would be more meaningful for players who also played through ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gies |first1=Arthur |title=Mass Effect 3 Review: The Sharp Edge of Hope |url=https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |date=March 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150201115511/http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |archivedate=February 1, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gus Mastrapa of [[The A.V.

Discussing combat for [[IGN]], Colin Moriarty observed that while changes from prior installments were minor, they were still evident, and anticipated that multiplayer would give the game added replay value.<ref name=\"ign-review\" /> While ''Game Informer'' noted that combat was not perfect, they were still positive and concluded that enemy encounters were more intense and interesting than in ''Mass Effect 2'', due in part to a greater variety in environment and enemy types.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> In an otherwise enthusiastic write-up for [[GameSpot]], Kevin VanOrd recounted numerous glitches during combat, such as party members putting themselves in the line of fire by climbing onto crates and enemies getting stuck on walls.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]] also noted numerous bugs, but relented that ''Mass Effect 3'' was still a memorable experience, citing the game's strong characters as compensation for its flaws.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" />\n\nOther aspects of ''Mass Effect 3'' to receive praise included its art design, music, and [[voice acting]]. GameSpot described the art design as \"fantastic\" and gave particular attention to its use of color and composition.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> In that same review, the website complimented the game's voice acting for bringing its major characters to life.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> ''PC Gamer'' (US) made special mention of the game's music, calling it \"gorgeous\" and observing that it significantly added to the emotional impact of the game.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\" /> ''[[The Verge]]'' went a step further and described the score as one of the most \"powerful and memorable\" ever created for a video game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Hulick - Biography |url=https://samhulick.com/#bio |publisher=Sam Hulick Official Website |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200101160444/https://samhulick.com/%23bio#bio |archivedate=January 1, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kirk Hamilton of ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the score represented some of the best video game music of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |title=The Best Video Game Music of 2012 |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |date=December 13, 2012 |website=[[Kotaku]] |url=http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130521094426/http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archivedate=May 21, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\n{{quote box\n | align = right\n | width = 30%\n | quote = \"I remember about a week or so after we had launched [the game], we'd seen all these excellent critical reviews ... then all of a sudden people were saying, 'I felt the ending was weak.'

Critics felt the ending rendered character choices inconsequential; a general lack of closure; lore contradictions and plot holes; character and narrative inconsistencies; the absence of a final boss

The final installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. A [[Wii U]] version of the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3: Special Edition'', was later released in November 2012. ''Mass Effect 3'' is set within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] in 2186, where civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of [[Synthetic intelligence|synthetic]]-[[Carbon-based life|organic]] starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations. In response to the controversy, BioWare released the ''Extended Cut'' [[downloadable content]] pack, which expands upon the original ending. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and Game of the Year from ''[[Game Informer]]''. In March 2017, it was followed by a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[sequel]], ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 3'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes control of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Prima Character\">{{cite book|last1=Musa|first1=Alexander|last2=Bueno|first2=Fernando|last3=Lierop|first3=Raphael Van|title=Mass Effect 3: Prima Official Game Guide|date=2012|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|location=Roseville, CA|isbn=978-0-307-89148-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> If the player has a completed [[saved game]] from ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the character from that game can be imported.<ref name=\"Import\">{{cite web|last1=Moriarty|first1=Colin|title=Mass Effect 3 Review: Page 2 of 3|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/06/mass-effect-3-review?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> By importing an old character, decisions from prior ''Mass Effect'' titles are carried over, which impacts the plot of ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Import\" /> Similar to previous installments in the series, the player is able to choose from six different [[character class]]es that each have their own unique set of skills.<ref name=\"Tips\">{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Kate|title=Before You Start\u2026 Tips for Playing Mass Effect 3 The Best Way|url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HQfbTNo?url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Adept class is proficient in [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers whereas the Soldier class is proficient in weapons.<ref name=\"Tips\"/> By completing assignments and [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], the player is rewarded with [[experience point]]s.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> Once enough points are earned, Shepard levels up, which allows for the unlocking or upgrading of skills along a [[Glossary of video game terms#Skilltree|tree]].<ref name=GSCC>{{cite web|url=http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |title=Comic-Con 2011: Mass Effect 3 Hands-On Preview - Biotics and Branching Upgrades |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053512/http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |website=[[GameSpot]]|last1=McInnis|first1=Shaun}}</ref>\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' has three pre-set [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] modes: Action, Story, and RPG.<ref name=\"Three Modes\">{{cite magazine |last1=Francis |first1=Tom |title=Mass Effect 3 Narrative Mode and Action Mode explained |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/ |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 3, 2018 |date=March 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HSz91FS?url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Action Mode, conversations have automatic replies and normal combat difficulty; in Story Mode, conversations have manual replies and minimal combat difficulty; and in RPG Mode, conversations have manual replies and normal combat difficulty.<ref name=\"Three Modes\" /> The game contains various [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] elements,<ref name=Best>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|title=BioWare: Mass Effect 3 Is the Best Game We've Ever Made|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011|last=Westbrook|first=Logan|magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HT6O6rv?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the ability to augment guns with different ammo types, barrels, modifications, and scopes to improve their effectiveness in combat.

\"generally favorable reviews\" from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game finished with scores of 93 out of 100, making ''Mass Effect 3'' the [[2012 in video gaming|highest-rated game of 2012]] on both systems.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" /><ref name=\"MCPS3\" /><ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCWii\" />\n\nCritics felt that ''Mass Effect 3'' was a satisfying conclusion to the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. In a perfect review for ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Dan Whitehead praised the game for providing a definitive close to the saga instead of something more ambiguous or open-ended.<ref name=\"eurog-review\" /> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner proclaimed that BioWare had created one of the most \"intricately crafted\" stories in the history of video gaming.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> Tom Francis of [[PC Gamer#PC Gamer US|''PC Gamer'' (US)]] remarked that the finale was a \"mixed bag\", but ultimately praised its scale and emotional impact, which he felt was more satisfying than its main plot.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|title=Mass Effect 3 review|last=Francis|first=Tom|date=March 6, 2012|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121208143402/http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|archivedate=December 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nReviewers highlighted the experience of playing ''Mass Effect 3'' with an imported saved game. In a piece for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Arthur Gies opined that, while the game would be engaging without any previous context, it would be more meaningful for players who also played through ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gies |first1=Arthur |title=Mass Effect 3 Review: The Sharp Edge of Hope |url=https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |date=March 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150201115511/http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |archivedate=February 1, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gus Mastrapa of [[The A.V.

Discussing combat for [[IGN]], Colin Moriarty observed that while changes from prior installments were minor, they were still evident, and anticipated that multiplayer would give the game added replay value.<ref name=\"ign-review\" /> While ''Game Informer'' noted that combat was not perfect, they were still positive and concluded that enemy encounters were more intense and interesting than in ''Mass Effect 2'', due in part to a greater variety in environment and enemy types.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> In an otherwise enthusiastic write-up for [[GameSpot]], Kevin VanOrd recounted numerous glitches during combat, such as party members putting themselves in the line of fire by climbing onto crates and enemies getting stuck on walls.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]] also noted numerous bugs, but relented that ''Mass Effect 3'' was still a memorable experience, citing the game's strong characters as compensation for its flaws.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" />\n\nOther aspects of ''Mass Effect 3'' to receive praise included its art design, music, and [[voice acting]]. GameSpot described the art design as \"fantastic\" and gave particular attention to its use of color and composition.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> In that same review, the website complimented the game's voice acting for bringing its major characters to life.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> ''PC Gamer'' (US) made special mention of the game's music, calling it \"gorgeous\" and observing that it significantly added to the emotional impact of the game.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\" /> ''[[The Verge]]'' went a step further and described the score as one of the most \"powerful and memorable\" ever created for a video game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Hulick - Biography |url=https://samhulick.com/#bio |publisher=Sam Hulick Official Website |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200101160444/https://samhulick.com/%23bio#bio |archivedate=January 1, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kirk Hamilton of ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the score represented some of the best video game music of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |title=The Best Video Game Music of 2012 |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |date=December 13, 2012 |website=[[Kotaku]] |url=http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130521094426/http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archivedate=May 21, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\n{{quote box\n | align = right\n | width = 30%\n | quote = \"I remember about a week or so after we had launched [the game], we'd seen all these excellent critical reviews ... then all of a sudden people were saying, 'I felt the ending was weak.'

The thirty minute [[Christmas special]] was directed by [[Gary Trousdale]] and produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] reprised their roles from the feature films. This Christmas special takes place between ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''. As with the other ''Shrek'' animations, this television special was based on the 1990 children's book ''[[no no square]]'' by [[William Steig]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] ([[Mike Myers]])  is quietly living in the swamp with his family when the Christmas season arrives.  Under [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] ([[Eddie Murphy]])'s urging, Shrek reluctantly promises [[Princess Fiona]] ([[Cameron Diaz]]) a special Christmas surprise.  Shrek goes to the local bookstore in Far, Far Away to try to find a present for Fiona, but since he does not know what Christmas is all about, the shopkeeper ([[Marissa Jaret Winokur]]) gives Shrek a copy of ''Christmas For Village Idiots'', a step by step guide to celebrating the holiday. Shrek proceeds to follow the book's advice by decorating the house and getting a tree so he can spend a quiet Christmas Eve with his family, but Donkey brings the entire \"family\" to the swamp, spoiling Shrek's plans.\n\nAs Shrek tries to recite \"[[The Night Before Christmas|A Visit from St. Nicholas]]\", Gingy ([[Conrad Vernon]]), Donkey, and [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] ([[Antonio Banderas]]) interrupt and each tell their own Christmas story. Donkey tells of a Christmas parade passing by the swamp and licking an enormous waffle Santa, and absentmindedly starts licking Shrek's foot. Puss' version of the Santa Claus story ends with playing with the tassel on Santa's hat, while in reality he is playing with a bauble.\n\nGingy tells a horrifying story about how his girlfriend Suzy was eaten by Santa Claus. Donkey calls it ridiculous, and finds Shrek's ''Christmas for Village Idiots'' book. A fight breaks out over the book and Shrek's supper is destroyed. Shrek finally loses his temper and kicks his friends out of his house.\n\nWith their Christmas spirit ruined, Fiona is upset at Shrek's behavior and leaves with the ogre triplets. She catches up to their friends and explains to Donkey what Shrek had wanted for Christmas.\n\nShrek, remorseful at what he's done, catches up with the group and apologizes for his behavior. He then tells everyone this is also his first Christmas, since ogres don't celebrate anything. They return to the swamp and Shrek tells his own version of \"The Night Before Christmas\", featuring himself as Ogre Claus. Soon they hear bells and go outside to see Santa and his reindeer, although Gingy is still afraid of Santa Claus and runs back inside in fear. The special ends with Santa using his magic to put ogre ears on the moon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingy]]\n* [[Cody Cameron]] as [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]] and [[Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|The Three Little Pigs]]\n* [[Aron Warner]] as [[Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Big Bad Wolf]]\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|Three Blind Mice]]\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]] and [[List of Shrek characters#Dronkeys|Dronkeys]]\n* Miles Christopher Bakshi, Nina Zoe Bakshi, and Dante James Hauser as [[List of Shrek characters#Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia|Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia]]\n* [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] as Bookstore Clerk\n* [[Gary Trousdale]] as Santa\n\n==Production==\n''Shrek the Halls'' was produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]], concretely, at the [[Pacific Data Images|PDI/DreamWorks]] studio.

The thirty minute [[Christmas special]] was directed by [[Gary Trousdale]] and produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] reprised their roles from the feature films. This Christmas special takes place between ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''. As with the other ''Shrek'' animations, this television special was based on the 1990 children's book ''[[Shrek!]]'' by [[William Steig]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] ([[Mike Myers]])  is quietly living in the swamp with his family when the Christmas season arrives.  Under [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] ([[Eddie Murphy]])'s urging, Shrek reluctantly promises [[Princess Fiona]] ([[Cameron Diaz]]) a special Christmas surprise.  Shrek goes to the local bookstore in Far, Far Away to try to find a present for Fiona, but since he does not know what Christmas is all about, the shopkeeper ([[Marissa Jaret Winokur]]) gives Shrek a copy of ''Christmas For Village Idiots'', a step by step guide to celebrating the holiday. Shrek proceeds to follow the book's advice by decorating the house and getting a tree so he can spend a quiet Christmas Eve with his family, but Donkey brings the entire \"family\" to the swamp, spoiling Shrek's plans.\n\nAs Shrek tries to recite \"[[The Night Before Christmas|A Visit from St. Nicholas]]\", Gingy ([[Conrad Vernon]]), Donkey, and [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] ([[Antonio Banderas]]) interrupt and each tell their own Christmas story. Donkey tells of a Christmas parade passing by the swamp and licking an enormous waffle Santa, and absentmindedly starts licking Shrek's foot. Puss' version of the Santa Claus story ends with playing with the tassel on Santa's hat, while in reality he is playing with a bauble.\n\nGingy tells a horrifying story about how his girlfriend Suzy was eaten by Santa Claus. Donkey calls it ridiculous, and finds Shrek's ''Christmas for Village Idiots'' book. A fight breaks out over the book and Shrek's supper is destroyed. Shrek finally loses his temper and kicks his friends out of his house.\n\nWith their Christmas spirit ruined, Fiona is upset at Shrek's behavior and leaves with the ogre triplets. She catches up to their friends and explains to Donkey what Shrek had wanted for Christmas.\n\nShrek, remorseful at what he's done, catches up with the group and apologizes for his behavior. He then tells everyone this is also his first Christmas, since ogres don't celebrate anything. They return to the swamp and Shrek tells his own version of \"The Night Before Christmas\", featuring himself as Ogre Claus. Soon they hear bells and go outside to see Santa and his reindeer, although Gingy is still afraid of Santa Claus and runs back inside in fear. The special ends with Santa using his magic to put ogre ears on the moon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingy]]\n* [[Cody Cameron]] as [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]] and [[Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|The Three Little Pigs]]\n* [[Aron Warner]] as [[Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Big Bad Wolf]]\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|Three Blind Mice]]\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]] and [[List of Shrek characters#Dronkeys|Dronkeys]]\n* Miles Christopher Bakshi, Nina Zoe Bakshi, and Dante James Hauser as [[List of Shrek characters#Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia|Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia]]\n* [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] as Bookstore Clerk\n* [[Gary Trousdale]] as Santa\n\n==Production==\n''Shrek the Halls'' was produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]], concretely, at the [[Pacific Data Images|PDI/DreamWorks]] studio.
