He was first exhibited at a [[freak show]] as the \"'''Elephant Man'''\", and then went to live at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]] after he met [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]], subsequently becoming well known in London society.\n\nMerrick was born in [[Leicester]] and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His mother died when he was 11<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin61 /> and his father soon remarried. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home and went to live with his uncle Charles Merrick.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin77 /> In 1879, 17-year-old Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin83 /> In 1884 he contacted a showman named [[Sam Torr]] and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man.\n\nAfter touring the [[East Midlands]], Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a [[penny gaff]] shop rented by showman [[Tom Norman]]. Norman's shop was visited by surgeon [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] who invited Merrick to be examined. After Merrick was displayed by Treves at a meeting of the [[Pathological Society of London]] in 1884, Norman's shop was closed by the police<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin120 /> and Merrick joined Sam Roper's circus and was toured in Europe.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin123 />\n\nIn [[Belgium]], Merrick was robbed by his road manager and abandoned in [[Brussels]]. He eventually made his way back to the London Hospital<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin141 /> where he was allowed to stay for the rest of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society, including [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]. Although the official cause of his death was [[asphyxia]], Treves, who performed the [[autopsy]], said Merrick had died of a dislocated neck.\n\nThe exact cause of Merrick's deformities is unclear. In 1986 it was conjectured that he had [[Proteus syndrome]]. DNA tests on his hair and bones in a 2003 study were inconclusive.\n\nMerrick's life was depicted in [[The Elephant Man (play)|a 1979 play]] by [[Bernard Pomerance]], [[The Elephant Man (film)|a 1980 film]] by [[David Lynch]], both titled ''The Elephant Man''. In 2020, ''The Elephant Man: A New Musical'' was released, with book/lyrics by Jai Sepple and music/lyrics by Christopher Weeks.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:josephmerrick1889.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Merrick photographed in 1889, the year before his death]]\n\nJoseph Carey Merrick was born on August 5, 1862 at 50 Lee Street in [[Leicester]], to Joseph Rockley Merrick and his wife Mary Jane (n\u00e9e Potterton).<ref name=odnb /> Joseph Rockley Merrick (c. 1838\u20131897) was the son of London-born weaver Barnabas Merrick (1791\u20131856) who moved to Leicester during the 1820s or 1830s, and his third wife Sarah Rockley.<ref name=Howell33 /> Mary Jane Potterton (c. 1837\u20131873) had been born at [[Evington]], Leicestershire, her father being William Potterton, who was described as an agricultural labourer in the 1851 census of Thurmaston, Leicestershire.<ref>The National Archives: HO107/2087, f.666, p.12</ref> She was said to have some form of physical disability and as a young woman worked as a domestic servant in Leicester before marrying Joseph Rockley Merrick, then a warehouseman,<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin38 /> in 1861.\n\nThe following year, Joseph Carey Merrick was born, apparently healthy, and had no outward symptoms of any disorder for the first few years of his life. Named after his father, he was given the middle name Carey by his mother, a [[Baptist]], after the preacher [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]].<ref name=Howell42 /> The Merricks had two more children, not three as stated on his mother's grave. John Thomas Merrick, born 21 April 1864, who died of [[smallpox]] on 24 July of the same year, was not related to Joseph and Mary Jane Merrick.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin59 />\n\nThe other two children were: William Arthur, born January 1866, who died of [[scarlet fever]] on 21 December 1870 aged four and was buried on Christmas Day 1870; and Marian Eliza, born 28 September 1867, who was born with physical disabilities and died of [[myelitis]] and \"seizures\" on 19 March 1891, aged 24. William is buried with his mother, aunts and uncles in Welford Road Cemetery in Leicester<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin58 /> while Marian is buried with her father in Belgrave Cemetery in Leicester.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin79 /> In his book ''The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity'', [[Ashley Montagu]] states that \"{{sic|John Thomas}} Merrick was born on 21 April 1864\".<ref name=Montagu39 /> Montagu believed Treves's statement in his book, ''The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences'', referring to Merrick's first name as John, not Joseph, was due to confusing him with his supposed younger brother, who was later discovered to be of no relation to Joseph Merrick.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin59 />\n\nA pamphlet titled \"The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick\", produced c.&nbsp;1884 to accompany his exhibition, states that he started to display symptoms at approximately five years of age, with \"thick lumpy skin{{nbsp}}... like that of an elephant, and almost the same colour\".<ref name=pamphlet /> According to a 1930 article in the ''Illustrated Leicester Chronicle'', he began to develop swellings on his lips at the age of 21 months, followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and roughening of the skin.<ref name=Howell43 />{{refn|An article was published anonymously in the ''Illustrated Leicester Chronicle'' on 27 December 1930 which was, according to Howell & Ford (1992), \"clearly based on a knowledge of the Merrick family circumstances\". It included information about Merrick's mother's background, his early development and his attempts to gain employment.<ref>[[#Howell|Howell & Ford (1992)]], pp. 32, 42, 50</ref>|group=nb}} As he grew, a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared and both his feet became significantly enlarged.<ref name=Howell43 /> The Merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of Mary's being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with Joseph.<ref name=Howell43 /> The concept of [[maternal impression]]\u2014that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effect on their unborn children\u2014was still common in 19th-century Britain.<ref name=Howell129 /> Merrick held this belief about the cause of his affliction for his entire life.<ref name=Howell128 />\n\nIn addition to his deformities, at some point during his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame.<ref name=Howell44 /> Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother.<ref name=Howell44 /> She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an [[Railroad engineer|engine driver]] at a cotton factory, as well as running a [[haberdasher]]y business.<ref name=Howell44 /> On 29 May 1873, fewer than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from [[bronchopneumonia]].<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin61 /> Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.<ref name=Howell47 />\n\n==Employment and the workhouse==\n{{Quote box\n |quote = \"I was taunted and sneered at so that I would not go home to my meals, and used to stay in the streets with a hungry belly rather than return for anything to eat, what few half-meals I did have, I was taunted with the remark\u2014'That's more than you have earned.'\"\n |source =\u2014 \"The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick\"<ref name=pamphlet />\n |align = right\n |salign = right\n |width = 33%\n}}\nMerrick left school aged 13, which was usual for the time.<ref name=Howell48 /> His home-life was now \"a perfect misery\",<ref name=pamphlet /> and neither his father nor his stepmother demonstrated affection towards him.<ref name=Howell47 /> He ran away \"two or three\" times, but was brought back by his father each time.<ref name=pamphlet /> At 13, he found work rolling cigars in a factory, but after three years, his right hand deformity had worsened and he no longer had the dexterity required for the job.<ref name=Howell48 /> Now unemployed, he spent his days wandering the streets, looking for work and avoiding his stepmother's taunts.<ref name=odnb />\n\nMerrick was becoming a greater financial burden on his family, and eventually his father secured him a [[Peddler|hawker]]'s licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door.<ref name=Howell49 /> This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but followed him out of curiosity.<ref name=Howell49 /> Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.<ref name=Howell50 />\n[[File:ElephantMan2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Merrick photographed in 1888]]\n\nMerrick was now homeless on the streets of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home.<ref name=Howell51 /> Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester for the next two years but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for [[Hackney carriage#History|Hackney Carriages]] withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal.<ref name=Howell51 /> With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union [[Workhouse]].<ref name=Howell52 />\n\nMerrick became one of 1,180 residents in the workhouse.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin88 /> Joseph was given a classification to determine his place of accommodation. The class system determined which department or ward he would reside in as well as the amounts of food he would receive. Joseph was classed as class one for able bodied males and females.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin88 /> On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering, Merrick signed himself out of the workhouse and spent two days looking for work. With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time he stayed for four years.<ref name=Howell57 />\n\nAround 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8\u20139 inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat.<ref name=Howell58 /> He was operated on in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan and had a large part of the mass removed.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin96 />\n\n==Life as a curiosity==\n\nMerrick concluded that his only escape from the workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions.<ref name=Howell62 /><ref name=HumanMarvel/> He knew of a Leicester [[music hall]] comedian and proprietor named [[Sam Torr]]. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided he could make money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, he would have to be a travelling exhibit.<ref name=Howell62 /> To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.<ref name=Howell63 />\n[[File:merrick-shop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The shop on [[Whitechapel Road]] where Merrick was exhibited. Today it sells [[sari]]s.]]\n\nThe showmen named Merrick the ''Elephant Man'', and advertised him as \"Half-a-Man and Half-an-Elephant\".<ref name=Howell63 /> They showed him around the [[East Midlands]], including in Leicester and [[Nottingham]], before moving him on to London for the winter season. George Hitchcock contacted an acquaintance, showman [[Tom Norman]], who ran [[penny gaff]] shops in [[East End of London|London's East End]] exhibiting human curiosities. Without a meeting, Norman agreed to take over Merrick's management and in November, Hitchcock travelled with Merrick to London.<ref name=Howell64 />\n\nWhen Tom Norman first saw Merrick, he was dismayed by the extent of his deformities, fearing his appearance might be too horrific to be a successful novelty.<ref name=Howell72 /> Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on [[Whitechapel Road]]. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learnt that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk \"waking with a broken neck\".<ref name=Howell75 /> Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant.<ref name=Howell73 /> A pamphlet titled \"The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick\" was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.<ref name=Howell53 />\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote =Ladies and gentlemen{{nbsp}}... I would like to introduce Mr Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man.

He would then lead his onlookers into the shop, explaining that the Elephant Man was \"not here to frighten you but to enlighten you\".<ref name=Howell73 /> Drawing aside the curtain, he allowed the onlookers\u2014often visibly horrified\u2014to observe Merrick up close, while describing the circumstances leading to his present condition, including his mother's alleged accident with an elephant.\n\nThe Elephant Man exhibit was moderately successful, and made money primarily from the sales of the autobiographical pamphlet.<ref name=Howell75 /> Merrick was able to put his share of the profits aside, hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own.<ref name=Howell78 /> The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]], an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick.<ref name=Howell75 /> One visitor was a young [[Pre-registration house officer (UK)|house surgeon]] named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by the Elephant Man's deformities and told his senior colleague [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]].<ref name=Howell5 />\n[[File:merrick-hood.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Merrick's cap and hood]]\n\nFrederick Treves first met Merrick that November at a private viewing, before Norman opened the shop for the day.<ref name=Howell75 /> Treves later recalled in his 1923 ''Reminiscences'' that Merrick was \"the most disgusting specimen of humanity that I had ever seen{{nbsp}}... at no time had I met with such a degraded or perverted version of a human being as this lone figure displayed.\"<ref name=Treves /> The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed.<ref name=Howell76 /> To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a hessian sack covering his face, and rode in a cab hired by Treves.<ref name=Howell13 />{{refn|Although Treves states that Merrick's outfit on this occasion included the black cloak and brown cap, there is evidence to suggest that Merrick acquired this particular costume a year later, while travelling with Sam Roper's Fair. If that was the case, Treves was remembering the clothing from a later meeting with Merrick.<ref name=Howell81 />|group=nb}}<ref name=HumanMarvel>{{cite web | first=Pednaud, J. | last=Tithonus | title=Joseph Merrick - The Elephant Man | website=The Human Marvels | url=http://www.thehumanmarvels.com/joseph-merrick-the-elephant-man/ | accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the hospital, Treves examined Merrick, observing that he was \"shy, confused, not a little frightened, and evidently much cowed\".<ref name=Treves /> At this point, Treves assumed the Elephant Man was an \"[[imbecile]]\".<ref name=Treves /> He measured Merrick's head circumference at the large size of {{convert|36|in|cm}}, his right wrist at {{convert|12|in|cm}} and one of his fingers at {{convert|5|in|cm}} in circumference. He noted that his skin was covered in [[papilloma]]ta ([[wart]]y growths), the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell.<ref name=Howell23 /> The [[subcutaneous tissue]] appeared to be weakened and caused a loosening of the skin, which in some areas hung away from the body. There were bone deformities in the right arm, both legs, and, most conspicuously, in the large skull.<ref name=Howell24 /> Despite the corrective surgery to his mouth in 1882, Merrick's speech remained barely intelligible. His left arm and hand were not large and were not deformed. His penis and scrotum were normal. Apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip, Treves concluded that Merrick appeared to be in good general health.<ref name=Howell25 />\n\nNorman later recalled that Merrick went to the hospital for examination \"two or three\" times<ref name=Howell76 /> and during one of their meetings, Treves gave Merrick his [[Visiting card|calling card]].<ref name=odnb /> On one of the visits, Treves had photographs taken, and he provided Merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet.<ref name=Howell79 /> On 2 December, Treves presented Merrick at a meeting of the [[Pathological Society of London]] in [[Bloomsbury]].<ref name=Howell26 /> Eventually, Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was \"stripped naked and felt like an animal in a cattle market\".<ref name=Howell77 />\n\nDuring this time in Victorian Britain, tastes were changing in regard to freak show exhibitions like the Elephant Man. Shows like Norman's were a cause for public concern, both on the grounds of decency and due to the disruption caused by crowds gathering outside them.<ref name=Howell29 /> Not long after Merrick's last examination with Frederick Treves, the police closed down Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road, and Merrick's Leicester managers withdrew him from Norman's care.<ref name=Howell77 /> In 1885, Merrick went on the road with Sam Roper's travelling fair.<ref name=Howell80 /> He befriended two other performers, \"Roper's Midgets\"\u2014Bertram Dooley and Harry Bramley\u2014who on occasion defended Merrick from public harassment.<ref name=Howell81 />\n\n==Europe==\n\nThe dampening of public enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued and the police and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing down shows. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities.<ref name=Howell81 /> Merrick's group of managers decided he should go on tour in continental Europe, with the hope that authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the continent.<ref name=Howell84 /> The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's \u00a350 (2018 equivalent \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1886|2018|r=-2}}}}) savings.<ref name=Howell85 /> Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to [[Ostend]], where he attempted to board a ferry for [[Dover]] but was refused passage.<ref name=Howell86 /> He travelled to [[Antwerp]] and was able to board a ship bound for [[Harwich]] in [[Essex]]. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at [[Liverpool Street station]].<ref name=Howell87 />\n\nMerrick arrived at Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely back in his own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not eligible to enter a workhouse in London for more than one night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was {{convert|98|mi|km}} away.<ref name=Howell88 /> He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he huddled in a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card.<ref name=Howell89 /> The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves took him in a [[hansom cab]] to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for [[bronchitis]], washed, fed and put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospital's attic.<ref name=Howell90 />\n\n==London Hospital==\n[[File:Image-Fredericktreves.jpg|alt=|thumb|Merrick's close friend and doctor Frederick Treves in 1884]]\n\nWith Merrick admitted into the hospital, Treves now had time to conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over the previous two years and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and had only a few years left to live.<ref name=Howell94 /> Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him.<ref name=Howell95 />\n\nThe problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.<ref name=Howell95 />\n\nCarr Gomm contacted other institutions and hospitals more suited to caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions.<ref name=Howell93 /> The public response\u2014in letters and donations\u2014was significant, and the situation was even covered by the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.<ref name=BMJDec86 /> With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life.<ref name=Howell99 /> He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and\u2014at Treves's instruction\u2014no mirrors.<ref name=Howell100 />\n\nMerrick settled into his new life at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and spent a couple of hours with him every Sunday.<ref name=Howell102 /> Now that Merrick had found someone who understood his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor.<ref name=Howell102 /> Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that his mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby.<ref name=Howell102 /> Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers.<ref name=Howell103 /> It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.<ref name=Howell102 />\n[[File:merrick-letter.jpg|thumb|right|The only surviving letter written by Merrick]]\n\nTreves observed that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily.<ref name=Howell104 /> At times Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of depression.<ref name=Howell106 /> He had spent his entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance.<ref name=Howell105 /> His opinions about women were derived from his memories of his mother and what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal.<ref name=Howell107 /> The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, \"a young and pretty widow\", to visit Merrick.<ref name=Treves /> She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion.<ref name=Howell107 /> He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him, and the first to shake his hand.<ref name=Treves /> She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her for the gift of a book and a brace of [[grouse]], is the only surviving letter written by Merrick.<ref name=Howell145 /> This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence.<ref name=Howell108 /> He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick's hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind, where he might meet a woman who could not see his deformities.<ref name=Howell108 />\n\nMerrick wanted to know about the \"real world\", and questioned Treves on a number of topics. One day he expressed a desire to see inside what he considered a \"real\" house and Treves obliged, taking him to visit his [[Wimpole Street]] townhouse and meet his wife.<ref name=Howell114 /> At the hospital Merrick filled his days with reading and constructing models of buildings out of card. He entertained visits from Treves and his house surgeons. He rose each day in the afternoon and would leave his rooms to walk in the small adjacent courtyard, after dark.\n[[File:merrick-church.jpg|thumb|left|Card church built by Merrick, a replica of Mainz cathedral]]\n\nAs a result of Carr Gomm's letters to ''The Times'', Merrick's case attracted the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress [[Madge Kendal]].<ref name=Howell109 /> Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick.<ref name=Howell111 /> She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft.<ref name=Howell112 /> Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows.<ref name=Howell113 /> A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin.<ref name=Howell111 /> Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared he might frighten the patients.<ref name=Howell113 />\n\nOn 21 May 1887, two new buildings were completed at the hospital and the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] came to open them officially.<ref name=Howell115 /> Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed.<ref name=Howell116 /> She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a [[Christmas card]] each year.<ref name=Treves />\n\nOn at least one occasion, Merrick was able to fulfil a long-held desire to visit the theatre.<ref name=Howell119 /> Treves, with the help of Madge Kendal, arranged for him to attend the Christmas [[pantomime]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. Treves sat with some nurses, concealed in [[Lady Burdett-Coutts]]' private box.<ref name=Howell120 /> According to Treves, Merrick was \"awed\" and \"enthralled\". \"The spectacle left him speechless, so that if he were spoken to he took no heed.\"<ref name=Treves /> For weeks following the show Merrick talked about the pantomime, reliving the story as if it had been real.<ref name=Howell126 />\n\n==Last years==\n\nOn three occasions Merrick left the hospital and London on holiday, spending a few weeks at a time in the countryside.<ref name=Howell142 /> Through elaborate arrangements that allowed Merrick to board a train unseen and have an entire carriage to himself, he travelled to [[Northamptonshire]] to stay at [[Fawsley Hall]], the estate of [[Louisa Knightley|Lady Knightley]].<ref name=Howell142 /> He stayed at the [[gamekeeper]]'s cottage and spent the days walking in the estate's woods, collecting wild flowers.<ref name=Howell143 /> He befriended a young farm labourer who later recalled Merrick as an interesting and well-educated man.<ref name=Howell145 /> Treves called this \"the one supreme holiday of [Merrick's] life\", although in fact there were three such trips.<ref name=Treves /><ref name=Howell144 />\n\nMerrick's condition gradually deteriorated during his four years at the London Hospital. He required a great deal of care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed, or sitting in his quarters, with diminishing energy.<ref name=Howell145 /> His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became even more enlarged. He died on 11 April 1890, at the age of 27.<ref name=Howell146 /> At around 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Treves's house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead across his bed. His body was formally identified by his uncle, Charles Merrick.<ref name=timesobit /> An [[inquest]] was held on 15 April by [[Wynne Edwin Baxter]], who had come to notoriety conducting inquests for the [[Whitechapel murders]] of 1888.<ref name=Howell146 />\n{{Quote box\n |quote =He often said to me that he wished he could lie down to sleep 'like other people'{{nbsp}}... he must, with some determination, have made the experiment{{nbsp}}...

The case received only a brief mention in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', and the ''[[Lancet (journal)|Lancet]]'' declined to mention it at all.<ref name=Howell27 /> Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations.\n\nOne of the doctors present at the meeting was [[Henry Radcliffe Crocker]], a [[dermatologist]] who was an authority on skin diseases.<ref name= Howell28 /> After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of [[pachydermatocele]] and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system.<ref name=Howell29 /> Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book ''Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment''.<ref name= Howell127 />\n\nIn 1909, dermatologist [[Frederick Parkes Weber]] wrote an article about von Recklinghausen disease in the ''[[British Journal of Dermatology]]'',<ref name= Howell133 /> erroneously citing Merrick as an example of the disease, which German pathologist [[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen]] had described in 1882,<ref name=Howell132 /> but recently it has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin,<ref name=Howell134 /> and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called [[caf\u00e9 au lait spot]]s;<ref name=Korf /> however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body.<ref name=Howell137 /> For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnoses were advanced, such as [[Maffucci syndrome]] and [[polyostotic fibrous dysplasia]] (Albright's disease).<ref name= Howell137 />\n\nIn a 1986 article in the ''British Medical Journal'', [[Michael Cohen (doctor)|Michael Cohen]] and J.A.R. Tibbles put forward the theory that Merrick had suffered from [[Proteus syndrome]], a very rare [[congenital disorder]] recently identified by Cohen in 1979 (this explains why this diagnosis was not advanced previously), citing Merrick's lack of reported caf\u00e9 au lait spots and the absence of any [[histology|histological]] proof that he had suffered from the previously conjectured syndrome.<ref name=Tibbles /> In fact, Proteus syndrome affects tissue other than nerves, and it is a sporadic disorder rather than a genetically transmitted disease.<ref name=Pletcher /> Cohen and Tibbles said Merrick showed the following signs of Proteus syndrome: \"[[macrocephaly]]; [[hyperostosis]] of the large skull; [[hypertrophy]] of long bones; and thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues, particularly of the hands and feet, including [[plantar]] [[hyperplasia]], [[lipoma]]s, and other unspecified subcutaneous masses\".<ref name=Tibbles />\n\nIn a letter to ''Biologist'' in June 2001, British teacher and [[Chartered Biologist]] [[Paul Spiring]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.societyofbiology.org/membership/individual-membership/fellowship-fsb/our-fellows| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113000214/https://www.societyofbiology.org/membership/individual-membership/fellowship-fsb/our-fellows | archivedate=13 November 2013 | title=List of Current Fellows |publisher=Society of Biology|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> speculated that Merrick might have suffered from a combination of Proteus syndrome and [[neurofibromatosis]]. This hypothesis was reported by [[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Robert Matthews]], a correspondent for ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''.<ref name=Matthews /> The possibility that Merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled ''The Curse of The Elephant Man'' which was produced for the [[Discovery Health Channel]] by [[Natural History New Zealand]].<ref name= BBCunravelled /><ref name=telegraph />\n\nDuring 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a [[BBC]] appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took [[DNA]] samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition.<ref name=BBCSelby /> During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.<ref name=BBCunravelled /><ref name=telegraph /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bomford|first=Andrew|title=Unlocking the secrets of the Elephant Man |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23863974|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n<!-- Trivia is unencyclopedic and inadmissible, such as media containing idle mention of the Elephant Man. Please see WP:TRIVIA WP:NOTDIR and discuss on the Talk page if not absolutely certain. -->\n\nIn 1923, Frederick Treves published a volume, ''The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences'', in which he detailed what he knew of Merrick's life and their personal interactions. This account is the source of much of what is known about Merrick, but there were several inaccuracies in the book. Merrick never completely confided in Treves about his early life, so these details were consequently sketchy in Treves's ''Reminiscences''. A more mysterious error is that of Merrick's first name. Treves, in his earlier journal articles as well as his book, insisted on calling him John Merrick. The reason for this is unclear; Merrick clearly signed his name as \"Joseph\" in the examples of his handwriting that remain.<ref name=Howell7 /> In the handwritten manuscript for ''The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences'', Treves began his account by writing \"Joseph\" and then crossed it out and replaced it with \"John\".<ref name=Howell164 /> Whatever the reason for the error, it is one that persisted throughout much of the 20th century; later biographers who based their work on Treves's book have continued the error.\n\nTreves's depiction of [[Tom Norman]], the showman who had exhibited Merrick, was that of a cruel drunk who had ruthlessly exploited his charge.<ref name=odnbnorman /><ref name=shef /> In a letter to the ''World's Fair'' newspaper, and later in his own memoirs, Norman denied this characterisation and said he provided his show attractions with a way of earning a living, and that at the London Hospital Merrick was still on display, but with no control over how or when he was viewed. According to Nadja Durbach, author of ''The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture'', Norman's view gives an insight into the Victorian freak show's function as a means of survival for poor people with deformities, as well as the attitude of medical professionals of the time.<ref name=Durbach34 /> Durbach cautions that both Treves's and Norman's memoirs must be understood as \"narrative reconstructions{{nbsp}}... that reflect personal and professional prejudices and cater to the demands and expectations of their very different audiences\".<ref name=Durbach37 />\n\nIn 1971, anthropologist [[Ashley Montagu]] published ''The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity'' which drew on Treves's book and explored Merrick's character.<ref name= Howell171 /> Montagu reprinted Treves's account alongside various others such as Carr Gomm's letter to the ''Times'' and the report on Merrick's inquest. He pointed out inconsistencies between the accounts and sometimes disputed Treves's version of events; he noted, for example, that while Treves claimed Merrick knew nothing of his mother's appearance, Carr Gomm refers to Merrick carrying a painting of his mother with him,<ref name=Montagu41 /> and he criticised Treves's assumption that Merrick's mother was \"worthless and inhuman\".<ref name=Montagu41 /> However, Montagu also perpetuated some of the errors in Treves's work,<ref name=Howell178 /> including his use of the name \"John\" rather than \"Joseph\".<ref name=Montagu41 />\n\nIn 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford published ''[[The True History of the Elephant Man]]'', presenting the fruits of their detailed archival research. Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother had not abandoned him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = 'Tis true my form is something odd,<br />\nBut blaming me is blaming God;<br />\nCould I create myself anew<br />\nI would not fail in pleasing you.<br /><br />\nIf I could reach from pole to pole<br />\nOr grasp the ocean with a span,<br />\nI would be measured by the soul;<br />\nThe mind's the standard of the man.\n |source =&nbsp;\u2014poem used by Joseph Merrick to end his letters, adapted from \"False&nbsp;Greatness\" by [[Isaac Watts]]<ref name=pamphlet />\n |width  = 40%\n |align  = center\n |qalign = center\n}}\n\nSome persons remarked on Merrick's strong Christian faith (Treves is also said to have been a Christian), and his strong character and courage in the face of afflictions earned him admiration.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sitton |first1=Jeanette |last2=Stroshane |first2=Mae Siu Wai |title=Measured by the soul : the life of Joseph Carey Merrick, also known as the Elephant Man |date=2012 |publisher=Friends of Joseph Carey Merrick |isbn=978-1-300-45725-1 |pages=8,8,192 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Measured_by_Soul_The_Life_of_Joseph_Care/5T0HBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1 |accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref> Between 1979 and 1982, Merrick's life story became the basis of several works of dramatic art; these were based on the accounts of Treves and Montagu.

He was first exhibited at a [[freak show]] as the \"'''Elephant Man'''\", and then went to live at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]] after he met [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]], subsequently becoming well known in London society.\n\nMerrick was born in [[Leicester]] and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His mother died when he was 11<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin61 /> and his father soon remarried. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home and went to live with his uncle Charles Merrick.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin77 /> In 1879, 17-year-old Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin83 /> In 1884 he contacted a showman named [[Sam Torr]] and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man.\n\nAfter touring the [[East Midlands]], Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a [[penny gaff]] shop rented by showman [[Tom Norman]]. Norman's shop was visited by surgeon [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] who invited Merrick to be examined. After Merrick was displayed by Treves at a meeting of the [[Pathological Society of London]] in 1884, Norman's shop was closed by the police<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin120 /> and Merrick joined Sam Roper's circus and was toured in Europe.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin123 />\n\nIn [[Belgium]], Merrick was robbed by his road manager and abandoned in [[Brussels]]. He eventually made his way back to the London Hospital<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin141 /> where he was allowed to stay for the rest of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society, including [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]. Although the official cause of his death was [[asphyxia]], Treves, who performed the [[autopsy]], said Merrick had died of a dislocated neck.\n\nThe exact cause of Merrick's deformities is unclear. In 1986 it was conjectured that he had [[Proteus syndrome]]. DNA tests on his hair and bones in a 2003 study were inconclusive.\n\nMerrick's life was depicted in [[The Elephant Man (play)|a 1979 play]] by [[Bernard Pomerance]], [[The Elephant Man (film)|a 1980 film]] by [[David Lynch]], both titled ''The Elephant Man''. In 2020, ''The Elephant Man: A New Musical'' was released, with book/lyrics by Jai Sepple and music/lyrics by Christopher Weeks.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:josephmerrick1889.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Merrick photographed in 1889, the year before his death]]\n\nJoseph Carey Merrick was born on August 5th, 1862 at 50 Lee Street in [[Leicester]], to Joseph Rockley Merrick and his wife Mary Jane (n\u00e9e Potterton).<ref name=odnb /> Joseph Rockley Merrick (c. 1838\u20131897) was the son of London-born weaver Barnabas Merrick (1791\u20131856) who moved to Leicester during the 1820s or 1830s, and his third wife Sarah Rockley.<ref name=Howell33 /> Mary Jane Potterton (c. 1837\u20131873) had been born at [[Evington]], Leicestershire, her father being William Potterton, who was described as an agricultural labourer in the 1851 census of Thurmaston, Leicestershire.<ref>The National Archives: HO107/2087, f.666, p.12</ref> She was said to have some form of physical disability and as a young woman worked as a domestic servant in Leicester before marrying Joseph Rockley Merrick, then a warehouseman,<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin38 /> in 1861.\n\nThe following year, Joseph Carey Merrick was born, apparently healthy, and had no outward symptoms of any disorder for the first few years of his life. Named after his father, he was given the middle name Carey by his mother, a [[Baptist]], after the preacher [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]].<ref name=Howell42 /> The Merricks had two more children, not three as stated on his mother's grave. John Thomas Merrick, born 21 April 1864, who died of [[smallpox]] on 24 July of the same year, was not related to Joseph and Mary Jane Merrick.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin59 />\n\nThe other two children were: William Arthur, born January 1866, who died of [[scarlet fever]] on 21 December 1870 aged four and was buried on Christmas Day 1870; and Marian Eliza, born 28 September 1867, who was born with physical disabilities and died of [[myelitis]] and \"seizures\" on 19 March 1891, aged 24. William is buried with his mother, aunts and uncles in Welford Road Cemetery in Leicester<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin58 /> while Marian is buried with her father in Belgrave Cemetery in Leicester.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin79 /> In his book ''The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity'', [[Ashley Montagu]] states that \"{{sic|John Thomas}} Merrick was born on 21 April 1864\".<ref name=Montagu39 /> Montagu believed Treves's statement in his book, ''The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences'', referring to Merrick's first name as John, not Joseph, was due to confusing him with his supposed younger brother, who was later discovered to be of no relation to Joseph Merrick.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin59 />\n\nA pamphlet titled \"The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick\", produced c.&nbsp;1884 to accompany his exhibition, states that he started to display symptoms at approximately five years of age, with \"thick lumpy skin{{nbsp}}... like that of an elephant, and almost the same colour\".<ref name=pamphlet /> According to a 1930 article in the ''Illustrated Leicester Chronicle'', he began to develop swellings on his lips at the age of 21 months, followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and roughening of the skin.<ref name=Howell43 />{{refn|An article was published anonymously in the ''Illustrated Leicester Chronicle'' on 27 December 1930 which was, according to Howell & Ford (1992), \"clearly based on a knowledge of the Merrick family circumstances\". It included information about Merrick's mother's background, his early development and his attempts to gain employment.<ref>[[#Howell|Howell & Ford (1992)]], pp. 32, 42, 50</ref>|group=nb}} As he grew, a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared and both his feet became significantly enlarged.<ref name=Howell43 /> The Merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of Mary's being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with Joseph.<ref name=Howell43 /> The concept of [[maternal impression]]\u2014that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effect on their unborn children\u2014was still common in 19th-century Britain.<ref name=Howell129 /> Merrick held this belief about the cause of his affliction for his entire life.<ref name=Howell128 />\n\nIn addition to his deformities, at some point during his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame.<ref name=Howell44 /> Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother.<ref name=Howell44 /> She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an [[Railroad engineer|engine driver]] at a cotton factory, as well as running a [[haberdasher]]y business.<ref name=Howell44 /> On 29 May 1873, fewer than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from [[bronchopneumonia]].<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin61 /> Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own.

Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but followed him out of curiosity.<ref name=Howell49 /> Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.<ref name=Howell50 />\n[[File:ElephantMan2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Merrick photographed in 1888]]\n\nMerrick was now homeless on the streets of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home.<ref name=Howell51 /> Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester for the next two years but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for [[Hackney carriage#History|Hackney Carriages]] withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal.<ref name=Howell51 /> With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union [[Workhouse]].<ref name=Howell52 />\n\nMerrick became one of 1,180 residents in the workhouse.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin88 /> Joseph was given a classification to determine his place of accommodation. The class system determined which department or ward he would reside in as well as the amounts of food he would receive. Joseph was classed as class one for able bodied males and females.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin88 /> On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering, Merrick signed himself out of the workhouse and spent two days looking for work. With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time he stayed for four years.<ref name=Howell57 />\n\nAround 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8\u20139 inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat.<ref name=Howell58 /> He was operated on in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan and had a large part of the mass removed.<ref name=Vigor-Mungovin96 />\n\n==Life as a curiosity==\n\nMerrick concluded that his only escape from the workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions.<ref name=Howell62 /><ref name=HumanMarvel/> He knew of a Leicester [[music hall]] comedian and proprietor named [[Sam Torr]]. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided he could make money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, he would have to be a travelling exhibit.<ref name=Howell62 /> To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.<ref name=Howell63 />\n[[File:merrick-shop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The shop on [[Whitechapel Road]] where Merrick was exhibited. Today it sells [[sari]]s.]]\n\nThe showmen named Merrick the ''Elephant Man'', and advertised him as \"Half-a-Man and Half-an-Elephant\".<ref name=Howell63 /> They showed him around the [[East Midlands]], including in Leicester and [[Nottingham]], before moving him on to London for the winter season. George Hitchcock contacted an acquaintance, showman [[Tom Norman]], who ran [[penny gaff]] shops in [[East End of London|London's East End]] exhibiting human curiosities. Without a meeting, Norman agreed to take over Merrick's management and in November, Hitchcock travelled with Merrick to London.<ref name=Howell64 />\n\nWhen Tom Norman first saw Merrick, he was dismayed by the extent of his deformities, fearing his appearance might be too horrific to be a successful novelty.<ref name=Howell72 /> Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on [[Whitechapel Road]]. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learnt that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk \"waking with a broken neck\".<ref name=Howell75 /> Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant.<ref name=Howell73 /> A pamphlet titled \"The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick\" was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.<ref name=Howell53 />\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote =Ladies and gentlemen{{nbsp}}...

He would then lead his onlookers into the shop, explaining that the Elephant Man was \"not here to frighten you but to enlighten you\".<ref name=Howell73 /> Drawing aside the curtain, he allowed the onlookers\u2014often visibly horrified\u2014to observe Merrick up close, while describing the circumstances leading to his present condition, including his mother's alleged accident with an elephant.\n\nThe Elephant Man exhibit was moderately successful, and made money primarily from the sales of the autobiographical pamphlet.<ref name=Howell75 /> Merrick was able to put his share of the profits aside, hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own.<ref name=Howell78 /> The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]], an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick.<ref name=Howell75 /> One visitor was a young [[Pre-registration house officer (UK)|house surgeon]] named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by the Elephant Man's deformities and told his senior colleague [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]].<ref name=Howell5 />\n[[File:merrick-hood.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Merrick's cap and hood]]\n\nFrederick Treves first met Merrick that November at a private viewing, before Norman opened the shop for the day.<ref name=Howell75 /> Treves later recalled in his 1923 ''Reminiscences'' that Merrick was \"the most disgusting specimen of humanity that I had ever seen{{nbsp}}... at no time had I met with such a degraded or perverted version of a human being as this lone figure displayed.\"<ref name=Treves /> The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed.<ref name=Howell76 /> To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a hessian sack covering his face, and rode in a cab hired by Treves.<ref name=Howell13 />{{refn|Although Treves states that Merrick's outfit on this occasion included the black cloak and brown cap, there is evidence to suggest that Merrick acquired this particular costume a year later, while travelling with Sam Roper's Fair. If that was the case, Treves was remembering the clothing from a later meeting with Merrick.<ref name=Howell81 />|group=nb}}<ref name=HumanMarvel>{{cite web | first=Pednaud, J. | last=Tithonus | title=Joseph Merrick - The Elephant Man | website=The Human Marvels | url=http://www.thehumanmarvels.com/joseph-merrick-the-elephant-man/ | accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the hospital, Treves examined Merrick, observing that he was \"shy, confused, not a little frightened, and evidently much cowed\".<ref name=Treves /> At this point, Treves assumed the Elephant Man was an \"[[imbecile]]\".<ref name=Treves /> He measured Merrick's head circumference at the large size of {{convert|36|in|cm}}, his right wrist at {{convert|12|in|cm}} and one of his fingers at {{convert|5|in|cm}} in circumference. He noted that his skin was covered in [[papilloma]]ta ([[wart]]y growths), the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell.<ref name=Howell23 /> The [[subcutaneous tissue]] appeared to be weakened and caused a loosening of the skin, which in some areas hung away from the body. There were bone deformities in the right arm, both legs, and, most conspicuously, in the large skull.<ref name=Howell24 /> Despite the corrective surgery to his mouth in 1882, Merrick's speech remained barely intelligible. His left arm and hand were not large and were not deformed. His penis and scrotum were normal. Apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip, Treves concluded that Merrick appeared to be in good general health.<ref name=Howell25 />\n\nNorman later recalled that Merrick went to the hospital for examination \"two or three\" times<ref name=Howell76 /> and during one of their meetings, Treves gave Merrick his [[Visiting card|calling card]].<ref name=odnb /> On one of the visits, Treves had photographs taken, and he provided Merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet.<ref name=Howell79 /> On 2 December, Treves presented Merrick at a meeting of the [[Pathological Society of London]] in [[Bloomsbury]].<ref name=Howell26 /> Eventually, Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was \"stripped naked and felt like an animal in a cattle market\".<ref name=Howell77 />\n\nDuring this time in Victorian Britain, tastes were changing in regard to freak show exhibitions like the Elephant Man. Shows like Norman's were a cause for public concern, both on the grounds of decency and due to the disruption caused by crowds gathering outside them.<ref name=Howell29 /> Not long after Merrick's last examination with Frederick Treves, the police closed down Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road, and Merrick's Leicester managers withdrew him from Norman's care.<ref name=Howell77 /> In 1885, Merrick went on the road with Sam Roper's travelling fair.<ref name=Howell80 /> He befriended two other performers, \"Roper's Midgets\"\u2014Bertram Dooley and Harry Bramley\u2014who on occasion defended Merrick from public harassment.<ref name=Howell81 />\n\n==Europe==\n\nThe dampening of public enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued and the police and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing down shows. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities.<ref name=Howell81 /> Merrick's group of managers decided he should go on tour in continental Europe, with the hope that authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the continent.<ref name=Howell84 /> The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's \u00a350 (2018 equivalent \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1886|2018|r=-2}}}}) savings.<ref name=Howell85 /> Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to [[Ostend]], where he attempted to board a ferry for [[Dover]] but was refused passage.<ref name=Howell86 /> He travelled to [[Antwerp]] and was able to board a ship bound for [[Harwich]] in [[Essex]]. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at [[Liverpool Street station]].<ref name=Howell87 />\n\nMerrick arrived at Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely back in his own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not eligible to enter a workhouse in London for more than one night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was {{convert|98|mi|km}} away.<ref name=Howell88 /> He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he huddled in a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card.<ref name=Howell89 /> The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves took him in a [[hansom cab]] to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for [[bronchitis]], washed, fed and put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospital's attic.<ref name=Howell90 />\n\n==London Hospital==\n[[File:Image-Fredericktreves.jpg|alt=|thumb|Merrick's close friend and doctor Frederick Treves in 1884]]\n\nWith Merrick admitted into the hospital, Treves now had time to conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over the previous two years and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and had only a few years left to live.<ref name=Howell94 /> Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him.<ref name=Howell95 />\n\nThe problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.<ref name=Howell95 />\n\nCarr Gomm contacted other institutions and hospitals more suited to caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions.<ref name=Howell93 /> The public response\u2014in letters and donations\u2014was significant, and the situation was even covered by the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.<ref name=BMJDec86 /> With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life.<ref name=Howell99 /> He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and\u2014at Treves's instruction\u2014no mirrors.<ref name=Howell100 />\n\nMerrick settled into his new life at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and spent a couple of hours with him every Sunday.<ref name=Howell102 /> Now that Merrick had found someone who understood his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor.<ref name=Howell102 /> Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that his mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby.<ref name=Howell102 /> Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers.<ref name=Howell103 /> It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.<ref name=Howell102 />\n[[File:merrick-letter.jpg|thumb|right|The only surviving letter written by Merrick]]\n\nTreves observed that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily.<ref name=Howell104 /> At times Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of depression.<ref name=Howell106 /> He had spent his entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance.<ref name=Howell105 /> His opinions about women were derived from his memories of his mother and what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal.<ref name=Howell107 /> The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, \"a young and pretty widow\", to visit Merrick.<ref name=Treves /> She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion.<ref name=Howell107 /> He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him, and the first to shake his hand.<ref name=Treves /> She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her for the gift of a book and a brace of [[grouse]], is the only surviving letter written by Merrick.<ref name=Howell145 /> This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence.<ref name=Howell108 /> He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick's hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind, where he might meet a woman who could not see his deformities.<ref name=Howell108 />\n\nMerrick wanted to know about the \"real world\", and questioned Treves on a number of topics. One day he expressed a desire to see inside what he considered a \"real\" house and Treves obliged, taking him to visit his [[Wimpole Street]] townhouse and meet his wife.<ref name=Howell114 /> At the hospital Merrick filled his days with reading and constructing models of buildings out of card. He entertained visits from Treves and his house surgeons. He rose each day in the afternoon and would leave his rooms to walk in the small adjacent courtyard, after dark.\n[[File:merrick-church.jpg|thumb|left|Card church built by Merrick, a replica of Mainz cathedral]]\n\nAs a result of Carr Gomm's letters to ''The Times'', Merrick's case attracted the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress [[Madge Kendal]].<ref name=Howell109 /> Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick.<ref name=Howell111 /> She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft.<ref name=Howell112 /> Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows.<ref name=Howell113 /> A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin.<ref name=Howell111 /> Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared he might frighten the patients.<ref name=Howell113 />\n\nOn 21 May 1887, two new buildings were completed at the hospital and the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] came to open them officially.<ref name=Howell115 /> Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed.<ref name=Howell116 /> She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a [[Christmas card]] each year.<ref name=Treves />\n\nOn at least one occasion, Merrick was able to fulfil a long-held desire to visit the theatre.<ref name=Howell119 /> Treves, with the help of Madge Kendal, arranged for him to attend the Christmas [[pantomime]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. Treves sat with some nurses, concealed in [[Lady Burdett-Coutts]]' private box.<ref name=Howell120 /> According to Treves, Merrick was \"awed\" and \"enthralled\". \"The spectacle left him speechless, so that if he were spoken to he took no heed.\"<ref name=Treves /> For weeks following the show Merrick talked about the pantomime, reliving the story as if it had been real.<ref name=Howell126 />\n\n==Last years==\n\nOn three occasions Merrick left the hospital and London on holiday, spending a few weeks at a time in the countryside.<ref name=Howell142 /> Through elaborate arrangements that allowed Merrick to board a train unseen and have an entire carriage to himself, he travelled to [[Northamptonshire]] to stay at [[Fawsley Hall]], the estate of [[Louisa Knightley|Lady Knightley]].<ref name=Howell142 /> He stayed at the [[gamekeeper]]'s cottage and spent the days walking in the estate's woods, collecting wild flowers.<ref name=Howell143 /> He befriended a young farm labourer who later recalled Merrick as an interesting and well-educated man.<ref name=Howell145 /> Treves called this \"the one supreme holiday of [Merrick's] life\", although in fact there were three such trips.<ref name=Treves /><ref name=Howell144 />\n\nMerrick's condition gradually deteriorated during his four years at the London Hospital. He required a great deal of care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed, or sitting in his quarters, with diminishing energy.<ref name=Howell145 /> His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became even more enlarged. He died on 11 April 1890, at the age of 27.<ref name=Howell146 /> At around 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Treves's house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead across his bed.

The case received only a brief mention in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', and the ''[[Lancet (journal)|Lancet]]'' declined to mention it at all.<ref name=Howell27 /> Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations.\n\nOne of the doctors present at the meeting was [[Henry Radcliffe Crocker]], a [[dermatologist]] who was an authority on skin diseases.<ref name= Howell28 /> After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of [[pachydermatocele]] and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system.<ref name=Howell29 /> Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book ''Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment''.<ref name= Howell127 />\n\nIn 1909, dermatologist [[Frederick Parkes Weber]] wrote an article about von Recklinghausen disease in the ''[[British Journal of Dermatology]]'',<ref name= Howell133 /> erroneously citing Merrick as an example of the disease, which German pathologist [[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen]] had described in 1882,<ref name=Howell132 /> but recently it has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin,<ref name=Howell134 /> and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called [[caf\u00e9 au lait spot]]s;<ref name=Korf /> however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body.<ref name=Howell137 /> For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnoses were advanced, such as [[Maffucci syndrome]] and [[polyostotic fibrous dysplasia]] (Albright's disease).<ref name= Howell137 />\n\nIn a 1986 article in the ''British Medical Journal'', [[Michael Cohen (doctor)|Michael Cohen]] and J.A.R. Tibbles put forward the theory that Merrick had suffered from [[Proteus syndrome]], a very rare [[congenital disorder]] recently identified by Cohen in 1979 (this explains why this diagnosis was not advanced previously), citing Merrick's lack of reported caf\u00e9 au lait spots and the absence of any [[histology|histological]] proof that he had suffered from the previously conjectured syndrome.<ref name=Tibbles /> In fact, Proteus syndrome affects tissue other than nerves, and it is a sporadic disorder rather than a genetically transmitted disease.<ref name=Pletcher /> Cohen and Tibbles said Merrick showed the following signs of Proteus syndrome: \"[[macrocephaly]]; [[hyperostosis]] of the large skull; [[hypertrophy]] of long bones; and thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues, particularly of the hands and feet, including [[plantar]] [[hyperplasia]], [[lipoma]]s, and other unspecified subcutaneous masses\".<ref name=Tibbles />\n\nIn a letter to ''Biologist'' in June 2001, British teacher and [[Chartered Biologist]] [[Paul Spiring]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.societyofbiology.org/membership/individual-membership/fellowship-fsb/our-fellows| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113000214/https://www.societyofbiology.org/membership/individual-membership/fellowship-fsb/our-fellows | archivedate=13 November 2013 | title=List of Current Fellows |publisher=Society of Biology|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> speculated that Merrick might have suffered from a combination of Proteus syndrome and [[neurofibromatosis]]. This hypothesis was reported by [[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Robert Matthews]], a correspondent for ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''.<ref name=Matthews /> The possibility that Merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled ''The Curse of The Elephant Man'' which was produced for the [[Discovery Health Channel]] by [[Natural History New Zealand]].<ref name= BBCunravelled /><ref name=telegraph />\n\nDuring 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a [[BBC]] appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took [[DNA]] samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition.<ref name=BBCSelby /> During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.<ref name=BBCunravelled /><ref name=telegraph /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bomford|first=Andrew|title=Unlocking the secrets of the Elephant Man |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23863974|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n<!-- Trivia is unencyclopedic and inadmissible, such as media containing idle mention of the Elephant Man. Please see WP:TRIVIA WP:NOTDIR and discuss on the Talk page if not absolutely certain. -->\n\nIn 1923, Frederick Treves published a volume, ''The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences'', in which he detailed what he knew of Merrick's life and their personal interactions. This account is the source of much of what is known about Merrick, but there were several inaccuracies in the book. Merrick never completely confided in Treves about his early life, so these details were consequently sketchy in Treves's ''Reminiscences''. A more mysterious error is that of Merrick's first name. Treves, in his earlier journal articles as well as his book, insisted on calling him John Merrick. The reason for this is unclear; Merrick clearly signed his name as \"Joseph\" in the examples of his handwriting that remain.<ref name=Howell7 /> In the handwritten manuscript for ''The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences'', Treves began his account by writing \"Joseph\" and then crossed it out and replaced it with \"John\".<ref name=Howell164 /> Whatever the reason for the error, it is one that persisted throughout much of the 20th century; later biographers who based their work on Treves's book have continued the error.\n\nTreves's depiction of [[Tom Norman]], the showman who had exhibited Merrick, was that of a cruel drunk who had ruthlessly exploited his charge.<ref name=odnbnorman /><ref name=shef /> In a letter to the ''World's Fair'' newspaper, and later in his own memoirs, Norman denied this characterisation and said he provided his show attractions with a way of earning a living, and that at the London Hospital Merrick was still on display, but with no control over how or when he was viewed. According to Nadja Durbach, author of ''The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture'', Norman's view gives an insight into the Victorian freak show's function as a means of survival for poor people with deformities, as well as the attitude of medical professionals of the time.<ref name=Durbach34 /> Durbach cautions that both Treves's and Norman's memoirs must be understood as \"narrative reconstructions{{nbsp}}... that reflect personal and professional prejudices and cater to the demands and expectations of their very different audiences\".<ref name=Durbach37 />\n\nIn 1971, anthropologist [[Ashley Montagu]] published ''The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity'' which drew on Treves's book and explored Merrick's character.<ref name= Howell171 /> Montagu reprinted Treves's account alongside various others such as Carr Gomm's letter to the ''Times'' and the report on Merrick's inquest. He pointed out inconsistencies between the accounts and sometimes disputed Treves's version of events; he noted, for example, that while Treves claimed Merrick knew nothing of his mother's appearance, Carr Gomm refers to Merrick carrying a painting of his mother with him,<ref name=Montagu41 /> and he criticised Treves's assumption that Merrick's mother was \"worthless and inhuman\".<ref name=Montagu41 /> However, Montagu also perpetuated some of the errors in Treves's work,<ref name=Howell178 /> including his use of the name \"John\" rather than \"Joseph\".<ref name=Montagu41 />\n\nIn 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford published ''[[The True History of the Elephant Man]]'', presenting the fruits of their detailed archival research. Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother had not abandoned him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = 'Tis true my form is something odd,<br />\nBut blaming me is blaming God;<br />\nCould I create myself anew<br />\nI would not fail in pleasing you.<br /><br />\nIf I could reach from pole to pole<br />\nOr grasp the ocean with a span,<br />\nI would be measured by the soul;<br />\nThe mind's the standard of the man.\n |source =&nbsp;\u2014poem used by Joseph Merrick to end his letters, adapted from \"False&nbsp;Greatness\" by [[Isaac Watts]]<ref name=pamphlet />\n |width  = 40%\n |align  = center\n |qalign = center\n}}\n\nSome persons remarked on Merrick's strong Christian faith (Treves is also said to have been a Christian), and his strong character and courage in the face of afflictions earned him admiration.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sitton |first1=Jeanette |last2=Stroshane |first2=Mae Siu Wai |title=Measured by the soul : the life of Joseph Carey Merrick, also known as the Elephant Man |date=2012 |publisher=Friends of Joseph Carey Merrick |isbn=978-1-300-45725-1 |pages=8,8,192 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Measured_by_Soul_The_Life_of_Joseph_Care/5T0HBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1 |accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref> Between 1979 and 1982, Merrick's life story became the basis of several works of dramatic art; these were based on the accounts of Treves and Montagu.

The two stations share studios on North Tryon Street ([[U.S. Route 29 in North Carolina|US 29]]/[[North Carolina Highway 49|NC 49]]) north of uptown Charlotte and transmitter facilities near [[Reedy Creek Park (Charlotte, North Carolina)|Reedy Creek Park]] in the Newell section of the city. \n\nOn [[cable television|cable]], WSOC-TV is carried in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] on [[Spectrum (cable service)|Charter Spectrum]] channel 4 in the immediate Charlotte area (channel 9 in Kannapolis, [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]] and on legacy Charter systems), [[Comporium Communications]] channel 104 and [[AT&T U-verse]] channel 9, and in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on Spectrum [[digital cable|digital]] channel 1200 (channel 709 on legacy Charter systems), Comporium channel 1104 and U-verse channel 1009.\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on April 28, 1957<ref name=\"highdef\">{{cite news|title=Channel 9 Eyewitness News Is Now In High Definition!|url=http://www.wsoctv.com/news/12833433/detail.html|date=April 22, 2007|publisher=WSOC-TV|location=Charlotte, NC|accessdate=February 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928120844/http://www.wsoctv.com/news/12833433/detail.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> as Charlotte's third television station, after [[WBTV]] (channel 3) and WAYS-TV (channel 36, which operated from 1954 to 1955); it was also Charlotte's second station on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band. WSOC-TV is Charlotte's second-oldest continuously operating station, behind WBTV. It operated from a temporary facility on Plaza Road Extension in what was then a rural portion of eastern Mecklenburg County.\n\nWSOC was originally locally owned by Carolina Broadcasting, operated by the Jones family, along with WSOC radio (1240 AM, now [[WYFQ]] on 930 AM) and [[WSOC-FM]] 103.7. WSOC was the second radio station to sign on in Charlotte, having made its debut in 1929, seven years after the debut of [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] (1110 AM). Channel 9 originally operated as a primary [[NBC]] affiliate (owing to WSOC radio's affiliation with the [[NBC Red Network]]), and maintained a secondary affiliation with ABC, sharing the network with WBTV. In 1959, WSOC-AM-FM-TV were sold to Cox Enterprises under its forerunner, Miami Valley Broadcasting Company. That same year, it dedicated its current studios on North Tryon Street.\n\nChannel 36 returned to the air in November 1964 as [[WCCB]]. WCCB moved to the stronger UHF channel 18 allocation in November 1966, but it continued to be at a competitive disadvantage because many Charlotte-area households did not yet have television sets with UHF tuning capability. As a result, ABC retained a secondary affiliation with WSOC and WBTV, while WCCB aired programs from all three networks (ABC, NBC and [[CBS]]) that WSOC and WBTV declined to air. In 1967, WSOC became an exclusive NBC affiliate, while WCCB became a full-time ABC affiliate.\n\nBy 1978, ABC had become the highest-rated broadcast television network in the United States for the first time; the network wanted a stronger affiliate in Charlotte than WCCB. WSOC switched its affiliation back to ABC on July 1, 1978, this time as a full-time affiliate. NBC programming was moved over to former independent station WRET (channel 36, now [[WCNC-TV]]), due to a promise by then-owner [[Ted Turner]] to make $2.5 million in upgrades to that station, including the planned launch of a news department and upgrades to its transmitter;<ref>''The Charlotte Observer'', Apr. 25 and 29, 1978.</ref> WCCB became an independent station by default, remaining so for the next nine years until it affiliated with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] when that network launched in October 1986. The WSOC radio stations were sold off in the early 1990s (the AM station that is now WYFQ is now owned by [[Bible Broadcasting Network]]; WSOC-FM is currently owned by [[Beasley Broadcast Group]]).\n\nBy the mid-1990s, WSOC-TV had a problem. It owned the rights to a large amount of syndicated programming, but increased local news commitments left it without enough time in its broadcast day to air it all. In 1996, it found a solution in the form of a [[local marketing agreement|joint sales agreement]] with independent station WKAY-TV (channel 64). As part of the deal, WKAY moved its operations to WSOC-TV's studios and changed its call letters to WAXN-TV. Under the JSA, much of channel 9's inventory of syndicated programming was acquired by WAXN. One of those programs was ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''; it had been a mainstay on channel 9 for decades on weekday afternoons at 5 p.m. before being bumped in favor of a 5 p.m. newscast. Cox purchased WAXN outright for $3 million in 1999, shortly after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) reversed its long-standing ban on television station [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]];<ref>{{cite press release | title = FCC Revises Local Television Ownership Rules | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | date = August 5, 1999 | url = http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/1999/nrmm9019.html | accessdate = January 31, 2007}}</ref> the sale was officially approved by the FCC in 2000.<ref>{{cite web | title = Television Application For Assignment Of License Granted | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | date = January 31, 2000 | url = http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Public_Notices/Brdcst_Actions/ac000203.txt | accessdate = January 31, 2007 }}</ref> WSOC-TV served as the Charlotte \"Love Network\" affiliate of the ''[[Jerry Lewis]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|Labor Day Telethon]]'' from 1974 to 2001; the program moved to WAXN thereafter, before returning to WSOC in 2013 (by this point, known as the ''MDA Show of Strength'') after the program abandoned its syndicated long-form [[telethon]] format and became a shortened two-hour network telecast on ABC; the telecast was discontinued after 2014.\n\nOn December 21, 2010, a distraught 51-year-old woman armed with a gun entered the WSOC-TV studios, forcing the station to temporarily go off the air just after the start of that evening's 5 p.m. newscast. After a one-hour standoff, the woman was taken into custody; it was later determined that the gun was not loaded. No injuries were reported in the incident.<ref name=\"gun\">{{ cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/12/22/47922/woman-with-gun-at-wsoc-in-custody |title=Woman With Gun At WSOC In Custody |publisher=TVNewsCheck |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 2017, WSOC-TV announced that it would launch [[Telemundo]] Charlotte, on subchannel 9.2, which launched on June 1 of that year.

However, its overall news presentation is very similar to the ''[[Action News]]'' format at Atlanta sister station WSB-TV. When channel 9 expanded its 6 p.m. newscast to a full hour, it began airing ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' at 7 p.m. This ended in 1993, when the addition of a newscast at 5:30 p.m. led the station to cut back the 6 p.m. newscast to a half hour and \"World News Tonight\" moved back to 6:30.\n\nFor most of its first quarter-century on the air, WSOC's newscasts placed a very distant second in the Charlotte market, behind the longer-established WBTV. However, in 1981, the station scored a major coup when longtime WBTV anchorman Doug Mayes moved to WSOC as its noon anchor, where he stayed until his retirement in 1992. Mayes said years later that WSOC made an offer too generous for him to turn down, considering that he had two kids in college at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbtv.com/story/23547364/doug-mayes-returnsto-wbtv-tonight-at-11 |title=Broadcasting legend, Doug Mayes, returns to WBTV for final broad \u2013 WBTV 3 News, Weather, Sports, and Traffic for Charlotte, NC |publisher=Wbtv.com |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref>  The move quickly paid off; in 1982, it overtook WBTV for the lead at 11 p.m., a lead it held for almost 25 years. It surpassed WBTV in most other timeslots beginning in 1990, but lost the lead in the noon time period to WBTV in 1994. \n\nChannel 9's two-decade dominance of the early evening news timeslots largely stemmed from the former presence of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' as a lead-in to the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast; the syndicated talk show aired on channel 9 throughout its national run from 1986 to 2011.

WSOC-TV is Charlotte's second-oldest continuously operating station, behind WBTV. It operated from a temporary facility on Plaza Road Extension in what was then a rural portion of eastern Mecklenburg County.\n\nWSOC was originally locally owned by Carolina Broadcasting, operated by the Jones family, along with WSOC radio (1240 AM, now [[WYFQ]] on 930 AM) and [[WSOC-FM]] 103.7. WSOC was the second radio station to sign on in Charlotte, having made its debut in 1929, seven years after the debut of [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] (1110 AM). Channel 9 originally operated as a primary [[NBC]] affiliate (owing to WSOC radio's affiliation with the [[NBC Red Network]]), and maintained a secondary affiliation with ABC, sharing the network with WBTV. In 1959, WSOC-AM-FM-TV were sold to Cox Enterprises under its forerunner, Miami Valley Broadcasting Company. That same year, it dedicated its current studios on North Tryon Street.\n\nChannel 36 returned to the air in November 1964 as [[WCCB]]. WCCB moved to the stronger UHF channel 18 allocation in November 1966, but it continued to be at a competitive disadvantage because many Charlotte-area households did not yet have television sets with UHF tuning capability. As a result, ABC retained a secondary affiliation with WSOC and WBTV, while WCCB aired programs from all three networks (ABC, NBC and [[CBS]]) that WSOC and WBTV declined to air. In 1967, WSOC became an exclusive NBC affiliate, while WCCB became a full-time ABC affiliate.\n\nBy 1978, ABC had become the highest-rated broadcast television network in the United States for the first time; the network wanted a stronger affiliate in Charlotte than WCCB. WSOC switched its affiliation back to ABC on July 1, 1978, this time as a full-time affiliate. NBC programming was moved over to former independent station WRET (channel 36, now [[WCNC-TV]]), due to a promise by then-owner [[Ted Turner]] to make $2.5 million in upgrades to that station, including the planned launch of a news department and upgrades to its transmitter;<ref>''The Charlotte Observer'', Apr. 25 and 29, 1978.</ref> WCCB became an independent station by default, remaining so for the next nine years until it affiliated with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] when that network launched in October 1986. The WSOC radio stations were sold off in the early 1990s (the AM station that is now WYFQ is now owned by [[Bible Broadcasting Network]]; WSOC-FM is currently owned by [[Beasley Broadcast Group]]).\n\nBy the mid-1990s, WSOC-TV had a problem. It owned the rights to a large amount of syndicated programming, but increased local news commitments left it without enough time in its broadcast day to air it all. In 1996, it found a solution in the form of a [[local marketing agreement|joint sales agreement]] with independent station WKAY-TV (channel 64). As part of the deal, WKAY moved its operations to WSOC-TV's studios and changed its call letters to WAXN-TV. Under the JSA, much of channel 9's inventory of syndicated programming was acquired by WAXN. One of those programs was ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''; it had been a mainstay on channel 9 for decades on weekday afternoons at 5 p.m. before being bumped in favor of a 5 p.m. newscast. Cox purchased WAXN outright for $3 million in 1999, shortly after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) reversed its long-standing ban on television station [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]];<ref>{{cite press release | title = FCC Revises Local Television Ownership Rules | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | date = August 5, 1999 | url = http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/1999/nrmm9019.html | accessdate = January 31, 2007}}</ref> the sale was officially approved by the FCC in 2000.<ref>{{cite web | title = Television Application For Assignment Of License Granted | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | date = January 31, 2000 | url = http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Public_Notices/Brdcst_Actions/ac000203.txt | accessdate = January 31, 2007 }}</ref> WSOC-TV served as the Charlotte \"Love Network\" affiliate of the ''[[Jerry Lewis]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|Labor Day Telethon]]'' from 1974 to 2001; the program moved to WAXN thereafter, before returning to WSOC in 2013 (by this point, known as the ''MDA Show of Strength'') after the program abandoned its syndicated long-form [[telethon]] format and became a shortened two-hour network telecast on ABC; the telecast was discontinued after 2014.\n\nOn December 21, 2010, a distraught 51-year-old woman armed with a gun entered the WSOC-TV studios, forcing the station to temporarily go off the air just after the start of that evening's 5 p.m. newscast.

However, its overall news presentation is very similar to the ''[[Action News]]'' format at Atlanta sister station WSB-TV. When channel 9 expanded its 6 p.m. newscast to a full hour, it began airing ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' at 7 p.m. This ended in 1993, when the addition of a newscast at 5:30 p.m. led the station to cut back the 6 p.m. newscast to a half hour and \"World News Tonight\" moved back to 6:30.\n\nFor most of its first quarter-century on the air, WSOC's newscasts placed a very distant second in the Charlotte market, behind the longer-established WBTV. However, in 1981, the station scored a major coup when longtime WBTV anchorman Doug Mayes moved to WSOC as its noon anchor, where he stayed until his retirement in 1992. Mayes said years later that WSOC made an offer too generous for him to turn down, considering that he had two kids in college at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbtv.com/story/23547364/doug-mayes-returnsto-wbtv-tonight-at-11 |title=Broadcasting legend, Doug Mayes, returns to WBTV for final broad \u2013 WBTV 3 News, Weather, Sports, and Traffic for Charlotte, NC |publisher=Wbtv.com |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref>  The move quickly paid off; in 1982, it overtook WBTV for the lead at 11 p.m., a lead it held for almost 25 years. It surpassed WBTV in most other timeslots beginning in 1990, but lost the lead in the noon time period to WBTV in 1994. \n\nChannel 9's two-decade dominance of the early evening news timeslots largely stemmed from the former presence of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' as a lead-in to the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast; the syndicated talk show aired on channel 9 throughout its national run from 1986 to 2011.

During the February 2011 ratings period, WSOC's 10 p.m. newscast on WAXN placed second behind WCCB's in-house newscast; it also placed ahead of the WBTV-produced newscast on then-[[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WJZY]] (channel 46, now a Fox [[owned-and-operated station]]), as well as the 11 p.m. newscast on WCNC.<ref name=\"classics\" /> Bill Walker served as WSOC's main anchor from 1971 until his retirement in 2005, the longest tenure of any news anchor in Charlotte television history.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nOn April 22, 2007, WSOC-TV became the first television station in the Charlotte market and the second station in North Carolina overall (after [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] CBS affiliate [[WRAL-TV]]) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]] (WSOC was also the fourth Cox-owned station to upgrade its newscasts to HD, following WSB-TV and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]'s WFTV); the WAXN broadcasts were not included in the upgrade until October 2008.<ref name=\"highdef\"/> In September 2010, WSOC began producing a two-hour extension of its morning newscast for WAXN, airing from 7:00\u20139:00&nbsp;a.m. (which competes with WSOC's broadcast of ''[[Good Morning America]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/06/12/1494501/more-news-shows-coming-in-the.html| title=More News Shows Coming-in to beat WSOC's broadcast of GMA|accessdate=August 12, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nOn August 26, 2012, starting with its 6 p.m. newscast, WSOC-TV debuted a brand new news set and graphics package as well as an updated version of the station's \"Circle 9\" logo, which has been in use since 1984 (and is similar in resemblance to the \"9\" logo long used by [[KUSA (TV)|KUSA]] in [[Denver]] and formerly by [[KWTV-DT]] in [[Oklahoma City]]).<ref>[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/08/24/3474074/channel-9-launches-new-look-on.html Channel 9 launches new look on Sunday] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130119025839/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/08/24/3474074/channel-9-launches-new-look-on.html |date=2013-01-19 }}, ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', August 24, 2012.</ref> On December 2, 2013, WSOC expanded the WAXN 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast to one hour, citing the growing audience for the program (which had been placing at #1, among the primetime newscast in the Charlotte market; ahead of WCCB's late evening newscast and a WBTV-produced program on WJZY, which has since been replaced with its own in-house newscast) as the reason for the expansion.<ref>[http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/local/eyewitness-news-10-pm-waxn-tv64-expanding-1-hour/nbzqh/ Eyewitness News at 10:00 p.m. on WAXN-TV 64 expanding to 1-hour] ''WSOC.com'', November 21, 2013.</ref>\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Peter Daut]] \u2013 anchor/reporter (2012\u20132014, now at [[KCBS-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]])\n* [[Doreen Gentzler]] \u2013 anchor/reporter (1979\u20131983, now at [[WRC-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]])\n* [[Chuck Goudie]] \u2013 news reporter/sports anchor (1977\u20131980, now chief investigative reporter at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] owned [[WLS-TV]] in [[Chicago]])\n* [[Harold Johnson (sportscaster)|Harold Johnson]] \u2013 sports director (1979\u20132006, retired; 2010 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], [[North Carolina's 8th congressional district|8th District of North Carolina]])\n* [[Michelle Kosinski]] \u2013 reporter, now [[CNN]] correspondent\n* [[Bob Lamey]] \u2013 sportscaster, former [[Indianapolis Colts]] radio play-by-play broadcaster, now retired\n* [[Diana Williams]] \u2013 reporter (1979\u20131982; now at [[WABC-TV]] in [[New York City]])\n* Jim Bradley \u2013 reporter (1983\u20132017) retired \n* [[Blair Miller]] \u2013 anchor, now at WFXT-TV in Boston\n\n==Out-of-market cable and DirecTV carriage==\nIn recent years, WSOC has been carried on [[Cable television|cable]] in several areas outside of the Charlotte [[media market|television market]], including on cable systems within the [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]\u2013[[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]\u2013[[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]] market in North Carolina, the [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]] and [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]]\u2013[[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] markets in [[South Carolina]], and the [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] market in [[Tennessee]] and [[Virginia]].

{"title_page": "1998\u201399 OHL season", "text_new": "The '''1998\u201399 OHL season''' was the 19th season of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. The [[Brampton Battalion]] and the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] were added as expansion teams. The league realigned from three divisions into two conferences and four divisions. Brampton were placed in the Midwest division of the Western conference, and Mississauga were placed in the Central division of the Eastern conference. The OHL inaugurated four new trophies this season. The [[Holody Trophy]] was created for the regular season champion of the Midwest division. Two conference playoffs champions were created; the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] for the Eastern conference, and the [[Wayne Gretzky Trophy]] for the Western conference. The fourth new trophy was the [[Wayne Gretzky 99 Award]], to be awarded to the MVP of the playoffs. Twenty teams each played sixty-eight games. The [[Belleville Bulls]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[London Knights]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Brampton Battalion===\nOn December 3, 1996, the [[Brampton Battalion]] was granted an expansion franchise owned by [[Scott Abbott]]. The team began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Battalion's arena was the newly constructed [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]].\n\nBrampton played in their first game on September 24, 1998, losing 5-1 to the [[Peterborough Petes]] on the road. Their first home game was on October 9, as the Battalion dropped a 5-1 decision to the [[Kitchener Rangers]] in front of a sold out crowd of 4,800 at the [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]]. After beginning the season with six losses, Brampton won their first game, defeating the [[Sudbury Wolves]] 5-4 on October 18.\n\n===Mississauga IceDogs===\nOn January 21, 1997, the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] was granted an expansion franchise which included former [[Boston Bruins]] head coach [[Don Cherry]] in their ownership group. The IceDogs began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The IceDogs arena was the newly constructed [[Hershey Centre]].\n\nThe IceDogs played in their first game on September 25, 1998, losing a road game to the [[Kingston Frontenacs]] by a score of 10-0. Mississauga began the season with an 11 game road trip, as the club lost each game. In their home opener on October 30, Mississauga recorded their first win in franchise history, defeating the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] 4-3 in front of a sold out of 6,000 fans at the [[Hershey Centre]].\n\n==Realignment==\nWith the [[Brampton Battalion]] and [[Mississauga IceDogs]] joining the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1998-99 season, the league underwent a massive realignment in which two new conferences, the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, were created. Within each conference was two five-team divisions. The playoff format changed that the top eight teams in each conference made the post-season.\n\n===Eastern Conference===\n\n====East Division====\nThe East Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[Belleville Bulls]], [[Kingston Frontenacs]], [[Oshawa Generals]], [[Ottawa 67's]], and [[Peterborough Petes]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] left the division, joining the Central Division.\n\n====Central Division====\nThe Central Division underwent some major changes following the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] division. The [[Barrie Colts]], [[North Bay Centennials]] and [[Sudbury Wolves]] remained in the division, however, the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]], and [[Owen Sound Platers]] all left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division in the Western Conference. Joining the Central were the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] from the East Division, and the expansion [[Mississauga IceDogs]].\n\n===Western Conference===\n\n====Midwest Division====\nThe Midwest Division was a newly created division in the Western Conference. Joining the division were the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]] and [[Owen Sound Platers]] from the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] joined from the West Division. The expanion [[Brampton Battalion]] also joined the division.\n\n====West Division====\nThe West Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[London Knights]], [[Plymouth Whalers]], [[Sarnia Sting]], [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] and [[Windsor Spitfires]]. The [[Erie Otters]] left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division.\n\n==New Arena==\n===Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre===\nThe [[Sarnia Sting]] moved from the [[Sarnia Arena]] to their new home, the [[Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre]]. The Sting defeated the [[Kitchener Rangers]] 5-2 in their first game at their new home on September 25, 1998 in front of a sold out crowd of 4,635 fans.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = clinched conference title''\n\n=== Eastern conference ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! | Rank\n! width=\"27.5%\"| Team\n! |DIV\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"6.5%\"| W\n! width=\"6.5%\"| L\n! | T\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Barrie Colts]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 49 || 13 || 6 || '''104''' || 343 || 192\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| y-[[Ottawa 67's]] || align=left| East || 68 || 48 || 13 || 7 || '''103''' || 305 || 164\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || align=left| East || 68 || 39 || 22 || 7 || '''85''' || 334 || 246\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || align=left| East || 68 || 39 || 24 || 5 || '''83''' || 280 || 217\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || align=left| East || 68 || 40 || 26 || 2 || '''82''' || 266 || 213\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 25 || 35 || 8 || '''58''' || 261 || 288\n|-\n| 7 || align=left| x-[[North Bay Centennials]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 22 || 40 || 6 || '''50''' || 215 || 248\n|-\n| 8 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || align=left| East || 68 || 22 || 42 || 4 || '''48''' || 240 || 320\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 9 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 20 || 42 || 6 || '''46''' || 214 || 316\n|-\n| 10 || align=left| [[Mississauga IceDogs]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 4 || 61 || 3 || '''11''' || 145 || 426\n|}\n\n=== Western conference ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! | Rank\n! width=\"27.5%\"| Team\n! |DIV\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"6.5%\"| W\n! width=\"6.5%\"| L\n! | T\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || align=left| West || 68 || 51 || 13 || 4 || '''106''' || 313 || 162\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Guelph Storm]] || align=left| Midwest || 68 || 44 || 22 || 2 || '''90''' || 300 || 218\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || align=left| Midwest || 68 || 39 || 24 || 5 || '''83''' || 312 || 293\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || align=left| West || 68 || 37 || 25 || 6 || '''80''' || 279 || 216\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[London Knights]] || align=left| West || 68 || 34 || 30 || 4 || '''72''' || 260 || 217\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| x-[[Sault Ste.

The [[Brampton Battalion]] and the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] were added as expansion teams. The league realigned from three divisions into two conferences and four divisions. Brampton were placed in the Midwest division of the Western conference, and Mississauga were placed in the Central division of the Eastern conference. The OHL inaugurated four new trophies this season. The [[Holody Trophy]] was created for the regular season champion of the Midwest division. Two conference playoffs champions were created; the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] for the Eastern conference, and the [[Wayne Gretzky Trophy]] for the Western conference. The fourth new trophy was the [[Wayne Gretzky 99 Award]], to be awarded to the MVP of the playoffs. Twenty teams each played sixty-eight games. The [[Belleville Bulls]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[London Knights]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Brampton Battalion===\nOn December 3, 1996, the [[Brampton Battalion]] was granted an expansion franchise owned by [[Scott Abbott]]. The team began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Battalion's arena was the newly constructed [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]].\n\nBrampton played in their first game on September 24, 1998, losing 5-1 to the [[Peterborough Petes]] on the road. Their first home game was on October 9, as the Battalion dropped a 5-1 decision to the [[Kitchener Rangers]] in front of a sold out crowd of 4,800 at the [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]]. After beginning the season with six losses, Brampton won their first game, defeating the [[Sudbury Wolves]] 5-4 on October 18.\n\n===Mississauga IceDogs===\nOn January 21, 1997, the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] was granted an expansion franchise which included former [[Boston Bruins]] head coach [[Don Cherry]] in their ownership group. The IceDogs began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The IceDogs arena was the newly constructed [[Hershey Centre]].\n\nThe IceDogs played in their first game on September 25, 1998, losing a road game to the [[Kingston Frontenacs]] by a score of 10-0. Mississauga began the season with an 11 game road trip, as the club lost each game. In their home opener on October 30, Mississauga recorded their first win in franchise history, defeating the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] 4-3 in front of a sold out of 6,000 fans at the [[Hershey Centre]].\n\n==Realignment==\nWith the [[Brampton Battalion]] and [[Mississauga IceDogs]] joining the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1998-99 season, the league underwent a massive realignment in which two new conferences, the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, were created. Within each conference was two five-team divisions. The playoff format changed that the top eight teams in each conference made the post-season.\n\n===Eastern Conference===\n\n====East Division====\nThe East Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[Belleville Bulls]], [[Kingston Frontenacs]], [[Oshawa Generals]], [[Ottawa 67's]], and [[Peterborough Petes]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] left the division, joining the Central Division.\n\n====Central Division====\nThe Central Division underwent some major changes following the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] division. The [[Barrie Colts]], [[North Bay Centennials]] and [[Sudbury Wolves]] remained in the division, however, the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]], and [[Owen Sound Platers]] all left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division in the Western Conference. Joining the Central were the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] from the East Division, and the expansion [[Mississauga IceDogs]].\n\n===Western Conference===\n\n====Midwest Division====\nThe Midwest Division was a newly created division in the Western Conference. Joining the division were the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]] and [[Owen Sound Platers]] from the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] joined from the West Division. The expanion [[Brampton Battalion]] also joined the division.\n\n====West Division====\nThe West Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[London Knights]], [[Plymouth Whalers]], [[Sarnia Sting]], [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] and [[Windsor Spitfires]]. The [[Erie Otters]] left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division.\n\n==New Arena==\n===Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre===\nThe [[Sarnia Sting]] moved from the [[Sarnia Arena]] to their new home, the [[Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre]]. The Sting defeated the [[Kitchener Rangers]] 5-2 in their first game at their new home on September 25, 1998 in front of a sold out crowd of 4,635 fans.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = clinched conference title''\n\n=== Eastern conference ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! | Rank\n! width=\"27.5%\"| Team\n! |DIV\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"6.5%\"| W\n! width=\"6.5%\"| L\n! | T\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Barrie Colts]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 49 || 13 || 6 || '''104''' || 343 || 192\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| y-[[Ottawa 67's]] || align=left| East || 68 || 48 || 13 || 7 || '''103''' || 305 || 164\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || align=left| East || 68 || 39 || 22 || 7 || '''85''' || 334 || 246\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || align=left| East || 68 || 39 || 24 || 5 || '''83''' || 280 || 217\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || align=left| East || 68 || 40 || 26 || 2 || '''82''' || 266 || 213\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 25 || 35 || 8 || '''58''' || 261 || 288\n|-\n| 7 || align=left| x-[[North Bay Centennials]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 22 || 40 || 6 || '''50''' || 215 || 248\n|-\n| 8 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || align=left| East || 68 || 22 || 42 || 4 || '''48''' || 240 || 320\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 9 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 20 || 42 || 6 || '''46''' || 214 || 316\n|-\n| 10 || align=left| [[Mississauga IceDogs]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 4 || 61 || 3 || '''11''' || 145 || 426\n|}\n\n=== Western conference ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! | Rank\n! width=\"27.5%\"| Team\n! |DIV\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"6.5%\"| W\n! width=\"6.5%\"| L\n! | T\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || align=left| West || 68 || 51 || 13 || 4 || '''106''' || 313 || 162\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Guelph Storm]] || align=left| Midwest || 68 || 44 || 22 || 2 || '''90''' || 300 || 218\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || align=left| Midwest || 68 || 39 || 24 || 5 || '''83''' || 312 || 293\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || align=left| West || 68 || 37 || 25 || 6 || '''80''' || 279 || 216\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[London Knights]] || align=left| West || 68 || 34 || 30 || 4 || '''72''' || 260 || 217\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| x-[[Sault Ste.
