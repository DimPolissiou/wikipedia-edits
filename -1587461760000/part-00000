The facilities and launch support equipment were likely modelled on Soviet counterparts and the [[Soviet Union]] has likely provided technical support to Jiuquan.\n\nThe launch center has been the focus of many of China's ventures into space, including their first [[satellite]] [[Dong Fang Hong]] 1 in 1970, and their first [[manned space mission|crewed space mission]] ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' on 15 October 2003.\n\n[[Shenzhou 6]], the second crewed spaceflight of China, launched on 12 October 2005 on a [[Long March rocket]] from JSLC.\n\n[[Shenzhou 7]], the third crewed spaceflight mission of the Chinese space program, was launched from JSLC on 25 September 2008 by a [[Long March 2F]] (CZ-2F) rocket.

For example, when the prefix ''un-'' is added to the word ''happy'', it creates the word ''unhappy''. Particularly in the study of languages, a prefix is also called a '''preformative''', because it alters the form of the words to which it is affixed.\n\nPrefixes, like other affixes, can be either [[inflection]]al, creating a new form of the word with the same basic meaning and same [[part of speech|lexical category]] (but playing a different role in the sentence), or [[Morphological derivation|derivational]], creating a new word with a new [[semantics|semantic]] meaning and sometimes also a different [[Part of speech|lexical category]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Beard|first=Robert|title=The Handbook of Morphology|year=1998|publisher=Blackwell|pages=44\u201345|chapter=She Derivation}}</ref> Prefixes, like all other affixes, are usually [[Bound and unbound morphemes|bound morpheme]]s.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=152\u2013153}}\n\nIn [[English language|English]], there are no inflectional prefixes; English uses [[suffix]]es instead for that purpose.well that what we think\n\nThe word ''prefix'' is itself made up of the stem ''fix'' (meaning \"attach\", in this case), and the prefix ''pre-'' (meaning \"before\"), both of which are derived from [[Latin]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s.\n\n== In English ==\n\n===List of English derivational prefixes===\n{{main article|English prefixes}}\nThis is a fairly comprehensive, although not exhaustive, list of derivational prefixes in English.

''ge-'', on the other hand, expresses union or togetherness, and cannot simply be added to any noun or adjective.<ref name=\"CfChambers1970p63\">Cf. Chambers, W. Walker and Wilkie, John R.

''ent-'' expresses negation.

For example, when the prefix ''un-'' is added to the word ''happy'', it creates the word ''unhappy''.

Depending on precisely how one defines a derivational prefix, some of the neoclassical [[classical compound|combining forms]] may or may not qualify for inclusion in such a list. This list takes the broad view that ''acro-'' and ''auto-'' count as English derivational prefixes because they function the same way that prefixes such as ''over-'' and ''self-'' do.\n\nAs for [[numeral prefix]]es, only the most common members of that class are included here.

The term usually refers to [[mains electricity|mains (household AC)]] extensions but is also used to refer to extensions for other types of cabling. If the plug and power outlet are of different types, the term \"adapter cord\" may be used.  Most extension cords range from around two to thirty feet in length although they are made up to 300 feet in length.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Verlengsnoer op haspel (extension cord).jpg|thumb|upright|Extension cord reel (Germany)]]\nThe term \"extension cord\" has been in use since at least 1925.<ref>Addams Stratton McAllister, ''National Directory of Commodity Specifications: Classified and Alphabetical Lists and Brief Descriptions of Existing Commodity Specifications, Issue 65''\n National Bureau of Standards, United States. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce,\tU.S. Government Printing Office, 1925 page 230</ref>\n\nExtension cords come in various colors, lengths, thicknesses and service duties. In general, the more power needed by the appliance, the thicker the cord needs be (meaning larger [[Electrical conductor|wires]] inside). Cords which will be used outdoors, in wet areas, around oils, or exposed to sunlight for long periods of time should be selected for such specific conditions.\nAn extension [[reel]] is an extension lead that rolls up, usually into the socket end, which in some cases has more than one socket on it (often 2 or 4). Another type of extension reel hangs near the plug end and permits the user to draw the cord out by grasping the socket end.\n\nSome extension cords also incorporate safety features such as a polarized plug and receptacle, [[ground (power)|grounded]] terminals, a \"power-on\" indicator, a [[fuse (electrical)|fusible link]], or even a [[residual-current device]] (also known as a ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI).\n\nSome cords contain multiple female connectors in close proximity of one another; others have female connectors spaced along the length of the cord. Cords generally contain either grounded or ungrounded connectors. While a grounded male connector can be forced into an ungrounded female socket, this is unsafe.\n\n=== Variations ===\n[[File:Extensioncord.jpg|thumb|right|A power strip with power indicator and individual [[switch]]es for each socket (UK)]]\nA [[power strip]] is a block on the end of a power cable with a number of sockets (usually 3 or more), often arranged in a line. This term is also used to refer to the whole unit of a short extension cord terminating in a power strip.\n\nA removable [[power cord]] is similar but much shorter, and is designed to connect an appliance to a mains outlet. The female end mates with an [[appliance inlet]].\n\n==Regulations==\n\n=== National Electrical Code (US)===\nIn the United States the domestic voltage is 120&nbsp;V, and the [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) prohibits the use of extension cords in a 20&nbsp;A circuit unless they are of 16&nbsp;[[American wire gauge|AWG]] or larger diameter (for example, 14&nbsp;AWG or 12&nbsp;AWG).\n\nAs with other flexible cords, the NEC also prohibits their use where attached to building surfaces, concealed inside structures (walls, floors, ceilings), above suspended ceilings, or run through holes or other openings (windows, doors) in structures. The NEC does contain exceptions although they are very limited.\n\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ U.S. extension cord specifications<ref>Coleman Cable Inc.</ref>\n!

However most European extension reel cables now include an automatic current cut-out to avoid misuse of the cable. This requires manual resetting if excess current is drawn through the cable. (American multi-plug cords also include such a device, but single- or triple-outlet cords do not.)\n\n==Hazards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nFire incident history research has shown that a large proportion of structure fires are caused by extension cords that have been either damaged or overloaded.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe insulation of extension cords, particularly light-duty two-wire cords, is easily damaged by being pinched, crushed, or abraded. The cords can also be damaged at the plug and socket connections by being pulled on excessively, which sometimes happens when people trip on them. Overloading can cause an extension cord to heat up to the point that its insulation either melts or carbonizes. Heating appliances may also cause heat damage to the insulation of a cord, melting or burning it away.\n\nIf the internal metal wires are damaged, such as by the cord being crushed in a door, then where the unbroken part of the wires is narrower than the bulk of the wires, this can form a point of high resistance. A hot spot may develop as the resistance of the narrower part of the wire is higher than the rest of the wire, and thus tends to concentrate power dissipation there.\n\nAnimals may chew on the wires and remove some of the insulation.  In any of these cases if the damage is not noticed and the cord is not repaired or taken out of service, the damage can lead to arcing or a short circuit between the wires, which can ignite nearby materials.  The exposed wires of an extension cord with damaged insulation can also present a shock hazard to people and animals.\n\n==Safety==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nCords running across the floor should be covered with a suitable device to protect them from physical damage. However, they should never be covered with a rug or carpet, as this can produce a serious fire hazard.<ref>http://www.esfi.org/resource/extension-cord-safety-tips-478</ref>\n\nTo avoid the need for rolling-up excess length, using an extension reel or for cutting the cord to size, extension cords are sold in prefabricated lengths of 1 to 150 feet (30&nbsp;cm to 45 m). Every foot of cord increases the electrical resistance, in turn decreasing the power the cord can deliver. Therefore, the longer the cord, the larger the diameter of the conductors need be to minimise voltage drop (wire gauge numbers are smaller for larger diameter wire). Because of this, it is best to use a cord that's exactly as long as needed and no more.\n\nAn extension reel can only carry full rated current when completely extended. This is because the portion of cord on the reel is not exposed to air causing the [[Electric power transmission#Losses|loss power]], (the result of its [[Joule heating|series resistance]]), not to dissipate. An extension cord that is in use while coiled up or coiled in a reel can be a serious shock and fire hazard. The heat produced from the resistance cannot dissipate and is instead trapped between the tightly coiled cable, leading to the a fire or shock.<ref>http://shedheads.net/extension-cord-buyer-guide</ref> Additionally, the ESFI recommends to never use an extension cord that is covered by a rug or blanket, or that is run through a ceiling or wall, since the heat may not be able to dissipate appropriately.<ref>http://www.esfi.org/resource/extension-cord-safety-tips-478</ref>\n\n==Lead content==\nExtension cords sold in the United States may contain [[lead]] in the PVC insulation sheathing. [[California Proposition 65 (1986)]] requires manufacturers to warn consumers when products contain toxic chemicals. Many extension cords carry warning labels that advise consumers to wash their hands after handling them.\n\nThe European directive, [[RoHS]], restricts the use of hazardous materials like lead in the manufacture of electrical products such as extension cords. Some  manufacturers have moved to RoHS compliance{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} but there is currently no widespread movement in the US to stop the manufacture of products containing lead.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Maintenance==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nThe attention required to safely use an extension cord includes routing extension cords away from where they are likely to be damaged, using the shortest cord that will serve each intended purpose, and examining the cords periodically for damage or signs of overloading (melting deformation, darkening in color, or a \u201cburnt\u201d or \u201celectrical\u201d smell).\n\nPeriodic inspection is especially important for cords that may be used in place for a long time, for instance behind furniture, where damage may go unnoticed and by chance conditions are right for a fire or electrical shock incident to occur (e.g. some dust or paper falls near the arcing wire, or a liquid spill occurs and flows to the exposed wire).\n\nAnother dangerous modification to an extension cord is removing the third prong in order to fit sockets, which results in removing of the grounding prong, as well as loss of the hot/neutral prong distinction.\n\n==Signal cable extenders==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n{{Main|USB}}\n[[File:USB extender cable.jpg|thumb|USB extender cable (passive type; non-standard)]]\n\n'''Extension cords''' sometimes refer to cables that add to the length of signal transmission cables or combined signal/electrical cables (for example, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cables). They are more likely to be called \"extenders\" or \"extender cables\" or \"cable extenders\". Such extenders have one male and one female connector.\n\nPassive USB extender cables do not meet the USB standards and thus are forbidden to carry the USB logo.  The only cable structure recognized by the official USB standards is one with an A plug and a B plug (such as Micro USB, [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning]], and [[USB-C]] among others) at either end.  This restriction was intended to prevent cable lengths greater than the maximum allowed by the USB standard from being assembled and to avoid an accumulation of resistance in the connections exceeding the design limits of USB, in order to ensure consistent plug-and-play operation of the USB system without the need for users to calculate cable lengths or enforce technical rules.\n\nThe intention of USB is to make sure any standard-compliant cable can be used to connect any two compatible devices, and the connection will work, without question.  To this end, the USB standard limits the maximum length of any compliant (and thus logo-bearing) USB cable (to about 15 feet). For a longer cable length, a USB hub is required. Despite being nonstandard, these extender cables are readily available from many sources.\n\nAnother class of USB extenders are actually USB hubs with a length of cable permanently attached.  These do comply with the USB standard, if not more than a limited number of them are connected together.  However, they require power from the USB connection and so may reduce the power available for the device at the \"B\" end.\n\n==See also==\n* [[IEC 60320]]\n* [[MCX connector]] ([[antenna (radio)|antenna]])\n* [[Portable cord]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Extension cords}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716230229/http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/offerings/perspectives/consumer/productsafety/cords/ Extension Cords] at Underwriters Laboratories Inc\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6705313.stm A solution to the socket shortage?] BBC News article\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Power cables]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n[[Category:Electrical wiring]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2010}}\n{{globalize|date=March 2016}}\n}}\n[[File:Extension cord.JPG|thumb|right|Yellow [[NEMA connector#NEMA 5|NEMA 5-15]] extension cord]]\n[[File:NEMA-1 extension cord.jpg|thumb|NEMA-1 extension cord, common in the United States]]\nAn '''extension cord''', '''power extender''', '''drop cord''', or '''extension lead''' is a length of flexible electrical [[power cable]] (flex) with a [[AC power plugs and sockets|plug]] on one end and one or more sockets on the other end (usually of the same type as the plug). The term usually refers to [[mains electricity|mains (household AC)]] extensions but is also used to refer to extensions for other types of cabling. If the plug and power outlet are of different types, the term \"adapter cord\" may be used.  Most extension cords range from around two to thirty feet in length although they are made up to 300 feet in length.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Verlengsnoer op haspel (extension cord).jpg|thumb|upright|Extension cord reel (Germany)]]\nThe term \"extension cord\" has been in use since at least 1925.<ref>Addams Stratton McAllister, ''National Directory of Commodity Specifications: Classified and Alphabetical Lists and Brief Descriptions of Existing Commodity Specifications, Issue 65''\n National Bureau of Standards, United States. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce,\tU.S. Government Printing Office, 1925 page 230</ref>\n\nExtension cords come in various colors, lengths, thicknesses and service duties. In general, the more power needed by the appliance, the thicker the cord needs be (meaning larger [[Electrical conductor|wires]] inside). Cords which will be used outdoors, in wet areas, around oils, or exposed to sunlight for long periods of time should be selected for such specific conditions.\nAn extension [[reel]] is an extension lead that rolls up, usually into the socket end, which in some cases has more than one socket on it (often 2 or 4). Another type of extension reel hangs near the plug end and permits the user to draw the cord out by grasping the socket end.\n\nSome extension cords also incorporate safety features such as a polarized plug and receptacle, [[ground (power)|grounded]] terminals, a \"power-on\" indicator, a [[fuse (electrical)|fusible link]], or even a [[residual-current device]] (also known as a ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI).\n\nSome cords contain multiple female connectors in close proximity of one another; others have female connectors spaced along the length of the cord. Cords generally contain either grounded or ungrounded connectors. While a grounded male connector can be forced into an ungrounded female socket, this is unsafe.\n\n=== Variations ===\n[[File:Extensioncord.jpg|thumb|right|A power strip with power indicator and individual [[switch]]es for each socket (UK)]]\nA [[power strip]] is a block on the end of a power cable with a number of sockets (usually 3 or more), often arranged in a line. This term is also used to refer to the whole unit of a short extension cord terminating in a power strip.\n\nA removable [[power cord]] is similar but much shorter, and is designed to connect an appliance to a mains outlet. The female end mates with an [[appliance inlet]].\n\n==Regulations==\n\n=== National Electrical Code (US)===\nIn the United States the domestic voltage is 120&nbsp;V, and the [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) prohibits the use of extension cords in a 20&nbsp;A circuit unless they are of 16&nbsp;[[American wire gauge|AWG]] or larger diameter (for example, 14&nbsp;AWG or 12&nbsp;AWG).\n\nAs with other flexible cords, the NEC also prohibits their use where attached to building surfaces, concealed inside structures (walls, floors, ceilings), above suspended ceilings, or run through holes or other openings (windows, doors) in structures. The NEC does contain exceptions although they are very limited.\n\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ U.S. extension cord specifications<ref>Coleman Cable Inc.</ref>\n!

However most European extension reel cables now include an automatic current cut-out to avoid misuse of the cable. This requires manual resetting if excess current is drawn through the cable. (American multi-plug cords also include such a device, but single- or triple-outlet cords do not.)\n\n==Hazards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nFire incident history research has shown that a large proportion of structure fires are caused by extension cords that have been either damaged or overloaded.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe insulation of extension cords, particularly light-duty two-wire cords, is easily damaged by being pinched, crushed, or abraded. The cords can also be damaged at the plug and socket connections by being pulled on excessively, which sometimes happens when people trip on them. Overloading can cause an extension cord to heat up to the point that its insulation either melts or carbonizes. Heating appliances may also cause heat damage to the insulation of a cord, melting or burning it away.\n\nIf the internal metal wires are damaged, such as by the cord being crushed in a door, then where the unbroken part of the wires is narrower than the bulk of the wires, this can form a point of high resistance.

The [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains are located in the south of the Province.\n\nGansu has a population of 26 million, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|22nd in China]]. Its population is mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], along with [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|ranking 31st]] in GDP per capita. Most of Gansu's economy is based on the [[mining]] industry and the extraction of [[minerals]], especially [[rare earth elements]]. Tourism also plays a role in Gansu's economy.\n\nThe [[State of Qin]] originated in what is now southeastern Gansu and went on to form the first known Empire in what is now [[China]]. The [[Northern Silk Road]] ran through the [[Hexi Corridor]], which passes through Gansu, resulting in it being an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire.\n\nThe city of [[Jiayuguan City|Jiayuguan]], the second most populated city in Gansu, is known for its section of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and the [[Jiayu Pass|Jiayuguan Pass fortress complex]].\n\n==Name==\nGansu is a compound of the names of [[Ganzhou District|Ganzhou]] (now a [[district (PRC)|district]] of [[Zhangye]]) and [[Suzhou District|Suzhou]].

It is bound from north by the Gobi Desert and Qilian Mountains from the south.\n\nGansu generally has a semi-arid to arid continental climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk'' or ''BWk'') with warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters, although [[diurnal temperature range]]s are often so large that maxima remain above {{convert|0|C|F}} even in winter.  However, due to extreme altitude, some areas of Gansu exhibit a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dwc'') \u2013 with winter temperatures sometimes dropping to {{convert|-40|C|F}}. Most of the limited precipitation is delivered in the summer months: winters are so dry that snow cover is confined to very high altitudes and the [[snow line]] can be as high as {{convert|5500|m|ft|-1}} in the southwest.\n<gallery>\nFile:Mondsichelsee.JPG|[[Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)|Crescent Lake]], [[Dunhuang]]\nFile:Suzhou, Jiuquan, Gansu, China - panoramio (6).jpg|[[Qilian Mountains]] southeast of [[Jiuquan]]\nFile:\u9e1f\u77b0\u53bb\u9647\u5357\u7684\u516c\u8def - panoramio.jpg|[[Terrace farm]]s near [[Tianshui]]\nFile:\u5cb7\u53bf\u79e6\u8bb8\u4e61.jpg|Grasslands in [[Min County]]\nFile:\u739b\u66f2\uff0c\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6e7f\u5730 - panoramio.jpg|Wetland by the [[Yellow River]], [[Maqu County]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{main|List of administrative divisions of Gansu|List of township-level divisions of Gansu}}\nGansu is divided into fourteen [[Prefecture-level division|prefecture-level divisions]]: twelve [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] and two [[Autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China|autonomous prefectures]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; width:90%; font-size:smaller; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration.  Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.

Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [[Kashgar|Kashi (Kashgar)]], was a welcome sight to the merchants.

It lies between the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and the [[Loess Plateau]], bordering [[Mongolia]] ([[Govi-Altai Province]]) to the northwest, [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Ningxia]] to the north, [[Shaanxi]] to the east, [[Sichuan]] to the south, and [[Xinjiang]] to the west. The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. The province contains the [[geographical centre]] of China, marked by the Center of the Country Monument at {{coord|35|50|40.9|N|103|27|7.5|E|region:CN-62_type:landmark|name=Geographical centre of China}}.<ref>[http://en.people.cn/english/200009/13/eng20000913_50419.html English.people.com.cn]</ref>\n\nPart of the [[Gobi Desert]] is located in Gansu, as well as small parts of the [[Badain Jaran Desert]] and the [[Tengger Desert]].\n\nThe [[Yellow River]] gets most of its water from Gansu, flowing straight through Lanzhou. The area around Wuwei is part of [[Shiyang River Basin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurewater.nl/gmep/shiyang/general |accessdate=15 June 2009 |author=FutureWater |title=Groundwater Management Exploration Package |location=# [[Wageningen]], Netherlands |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152308/http://www.futurewater.nl/gmep/shiyang/general |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe landscape in Gansu is very mountainous in the south and flat in the north. The mountains in the south are part of the [[Qilian Mountains]], while the far western [[Altyn-Tagh]] contains the province's highest point, at {{convert|5830|m|ft|-1}}.\n\nA natural land passage known as [[Hexi Corridor]], stretching some {{convert|1000|km}} from Lanzhou to the [[Yumen Pass|Jade Gate]], is situated within the province. It is bound from north by the Gobi Desert and Qilian Mountains from the south.\n\nGansu generally has a semi-arid to arid continental climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk'' or ''BWk'') with warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters, although [[diurnal temperature range]]s are often so large that maxima remain above {{convert|0|C|F}} even in winter.  However, due to extreme altitude, some areas of Gansu exhibit a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dwc'') \u2013 with winter temperatures sometimes dropping to {{convert|-40|C|F}}. Most of the limited precipitation is delivered in the summer months: winters are so dry that snow cover is confined to very high altitudes and the [[snow line]] can be as high as {{convert|5500|m|ft|-1}} in the southwest.\n<gallery>\nFile:Mondsichelsee.JPG|[[Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)|Crescent Lake]], [[Dunhuang]]\nFile:Suzhou, Jiuquan, Gansu, China - panoramio (6).jpg|[[Qilian Mountains]] southeast of [[Jiuquan]]\nFile:\u9e1f\u77b0\u53bb\u9647\u5357\u7684\u516c\u8def - panoramio.jpg|[[Terrace farm]]s near [[Tianshui]]\nFile:\u5cb7\u53bf\u79e6\u8bb8\u4e61.jpg|Grasslands in [[Min County]]\nFile:\u739b\u66f2\uff0c\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6e7f\u5730 - panoramio.jpg|Wetland by the [[Yellow River]], [[Maqu County]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{main|List of administrative divisions of Gansu|List of township-level divisions of Gansu}}\nGansu is divided into fourteen [[Prefecture-level division|prefecture-level divisions]]: twelve [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] and two [[Autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China|autonomous prefectures]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; width:90%; font-size:smaller; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Jiayuguan Pass was built in the early [[Ming dynasty]], somewhere around the year 1372. It was built near an oasis that was then on the extreme western edge of China. Jiayuguan Pass was the first pass on the west end of the great wall so it earned the name \"The First And Greatest Pass Under Heaven\".\n\nAn extra brick is said to rest on a ledge over one of the gates.  One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration.  Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.  When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.<ref name=\"CNTOLEGEND\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnto.org/iconic/the-great-wall-in-gansu/|title=The Great Wall in Gansu|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mogao Grottoes===\n{{main|Mogao Caves}}\nThe Mogao Grottoes near [[Dunhuang]] have a collection of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] art. Originally there were a thousand grottoes, but now only 492 cave temples remain. Each temple has a large statue of a [[Buddha (general)|buddha]] or [[bodhisattva]] and paintings of religious scenes. In 336&nbsp;AD, a monk named Le Zun (Lo-tsun) came near Echoing Sand Mountain, when he had a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. He started to carve the first grotto. During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties period]] they ran out of room on the cliff and could not build any more grottoes.\n\n===Silk Road and Dunhuang City===\n[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 156.jpg|thumb|200px|A terracotta warrior from Gansu, with traces of polychrome and gold, from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907)]]\nThe historic [[Silk Road]] starts in [[Chang'an]] and goes to [[Constantinople]]. On the way merchants would go to Dunhuang in Gansu. In Dunhuang they would get fresh camels, food and guards for the journey around the dangerous [[Taklamakan Desert]]. Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [[Kashgar|Kashi (Kashgar)]], was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their [[Bactrian camel]]s for [[Dromedary|single humped]] ones. After Kashi they would keep going until they reached their next destination.\n\nLocated about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the city, the [[Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)|Crescent Lake]] or Yueyaquan is an oasis and popular spot for tourists seeking respite from the heat of the desert. Activities includes camel and 4x4 rides.\n\n===Silk Route Museum===\n{{main|Silk Route Museum}}\nThe Silk Route Museum is located in [[Jiuquan]] along the [[Silk Road]], a trading route connecting [[Rome]] to China, used by [[Marco Polo]]. It is also built over the tomb of the [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liang]] King.<ref name=\"touristlink\">[http://www.touristlink.com/china/silk-route-museum/overview.html Silk Route Museum China Tourist Information] Tourist Link.</ref>\n\n===Bingling Temple===\n{{main|Bingling Temple}}\nBingling Temple, or Bingling Grottoes, is a [[Buddhist]] cave complex in a canyon along the [[Yellow River]]. Begun in 420&nbsp;AD during the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], the site contains dozens of caves and caverns filled with outstanding examples of carvings, sculpture, and frescoes. The great Maitreya Buddha is more than 27 meters tall and is similar in style to the great Buddhas that once lined the cliffs of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]], Afghanistan. Access to the site is by boat from [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in the summer or fall. There is no other access point.\n\n===Labrang Monastery===\n{{main|Labrang Monastery}}\nLabrang Tashikyil Monastery is located in [[Xiahe|Xiahe County]], [[Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]], located in the southern part of Gansu, and part of the traditional Tibetan province of [[Amdo]]. It is one of the six major monasteries of the [[Gelukpa]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] in [[Tibet]], and the most important one in Amdo. Built in 1710, it is headed by the Jamyang-zhaypa. It has 6 ''dratsang'' (colleges), and houses over sixty thousand religious texts and other works of literature as well as other cultural artifacts.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n{{see also|List of universities and colleges in Gansu}}\n*[[Lanzhou University]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5170\u5dde\u5927\u5b66}})\n*[[Northwest Normal University]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u897f\u5317\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66}})\n*[[Lanzhou University of Technology]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5170\u5dde\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66}})\n*[[Lanzhou Jiaotong University]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5170\u5dde\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66}})\n*[[Northwest University of Nationalities]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u897f\u5317\u6c11\u65cf\u5927\u5b66}})\n*[[Gansu Agricultural University]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u7518\u8083\u519c\u4e1a\u5927\u5b66}})\n*[[Lanzhou City University]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5170\u5dde\u57ce\u5e02\u5b66\u9662}})\n*[[Gansu Political Science and Law Institute]], Lanzhou ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u7518\u8083\u653f\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662}})\n*[[Gansu University of Technology]]\n*[[Lanzhou Commercial College]]\n*[[Lanzhou Polytechnic College]]\n*[[Northwest Minority University]]\n*[[Tianshui Normal College]] (Tianshui)\n*[[Longdong College]] (Qingyang)\n\n==Natural resources==\n[[File:\u7518\u8083 \u8352\u5c71\u4e0e\u6c83\u571f - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Fertile fields near [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]]]]\n\n===Land===\n*{{convert|166400|km2}} grassland\n*{{convert|46700|km2}} mountain slopes suitable for livestock breeding\n*{{convert|46200|km2}} forests (standing timber reserves of {{convert|0.2|km3}})\n*{{convert|35300|km2}} cultivated land ({{convert|1400|m2}} per capita)\n*{{convert|66600|km2}} wasteland suitable for forestation\n*{{convert|10000|km2}} wasteland suitable for farming\n\n===Minerals===\nThree thousand deposits of 145 different minerals.

Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing form sub-branches of law born out of the interplay of general laws of contract and specific principles and statutory laws relating to these respective assets.\n\n== Mass licensing of software banana ==\n\n{{Main|End-user license agreement|Software license}}\n\nMass distributed software is used by individuals on personal computers under license from the developer of that software. Such license is typically included in a more extensive end-user license agreement (EULA){{Clarify|date=January 2018|reason=Difference between license and EULA is unclear.}} entered into upon the installation of that software on a computer.\nTypically, a license is associated with a unique code, that when approved grants the end user access to the software in question.\n\nUnder a typical end-user license agreement, the user may install the software on a limited number of computers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe enforceability of end-user license agreements is sometimes [[Software license agreement#Enforceability of EULAs in the United States|questioned]].\n\nAs of 2020, there are various ways to license software with different kinds of licensing models, which allow software vendors to profit from their product offerings in flexible ways. <ref>[https://www.10duke.com/software-licensing-models/ Software Licensing Models - Ultimate Guide (2020)] ''10duke.com''</ref>\n\n== Patent licensing ==\nA licensor may grant permission to a licensee to conduct activities which would otherwise be within the, offer for sale, or import a patented product, or to perform a patented process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/html/USCODE-2011-title35-partIII-chap28-sec271.htm|title=U.S.C. Title 35 - PATENTS|author=|date=|website=www.gpo.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>  The term of a [[patent]] license may be a \"fixed\" (i.e., specified) term, such as 5 years, or may be for the life of the patent (i.e., until the patent expires).  A patent is by its nature limited in territorial scope; it only covers activity within the borders of the country issuing the patent.  Accordingly, a patent license does not require a territory provision.\n\nThe consideration provided by the licensee in return for the patent license grant is called a patent [[royalty payment]].  In a \"paid-up\" license, the \"lump sum\" royalty payment is a specified monetary amount, typically due shortly after the effective date of the patent (e.g., within 15 business days of the effective date), and no further payments are required.  Otherwise, the royalty payment is a \"running royalty,\" typically payable on an annual basis.  The annual royalty may be a specified amount (e.g., one million dollars each year), or an amount proportional to the volume of licensed activity conducted by the licensee (e.g., one dollar per unit of licensed product sold by the licensee that year, or one percent of the net sales amount of the licensed products sold by the licensee that year).\n\nA '''licensing agreement''' is an arrangement whereby a licensor grants the right to intangible property to another entity for a specified period, and in return, the licensor receives a royalty fee from the licensee. Intangible property includes patents, inventions, formulas, processes, designs, copyrights, and trademarks.<ref name=\"McGraw Hill\">{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W.L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|pages=455\u2013456|edition=10th}}</ref>\n\n'''Advantages of a licensing agreement:''' \n* A primary advantage of a licensing agreement, the firm does not have to bear the development and risks associated with opening a foreign market. It is very attractive for firms lacking the capital to develop operations overseas. Licensing can be attractive when a firm is unwilling to commit substantial financial resources to an unfamiliar or politically volatile foreign market.<ref name=\"McGraw Hill\"/> Licensing is primarily used with a firm wants to participate in a foreign market but is prohibited because of barriers to investment.\n\n'''Disadvantages of a licensing agreement'''\n* First, it does not give a firm the tight control over manufacturing, marketing, and strategy that is required for realizing experience curve and location economies.<ref name=\"McGraw Hill\"/>\n* Second, competing in a global market may require a firm to coordinate strategic moves across countries by using profits earned in one country to support competitive attacks in another. Licensing limits a firm's ability to do this.<ref name=\"McGraw Hill\"/>\n* Lastly, a third problem with licensing is the relationship of the economic theory of FDI. This is associated with licensing technological know-how foreign companies. Technological know-how constitutes the basis of many multinational firms' competitive advantages. Most firms wish to control how their know-how is used, because they can lose control easily. Many firms make the mistake of thinking they could maintain control over their know-how within the licensing agreement.<ref name=\"McGraw Hill\"/>\n\n== Trademark and brand licensing ==\n\nA licensor may grant permission to a licensee to distribute products under a [[trademark]]. With such a license, the licensee may use the trademark without fear of a claim of trademark infringement by the licensor.\nThe assignment of a license often depends on specific [[contractual terms]]. The most common terms are, that a license is only applicable for a particular geographic region, just for a certain period of time or merely for a stage in the [[value chain]].\nMoreover, there are different types of fees within the trademark and brand licensing. The first form demands a fee independent of [[sales]] and [[profit (accounting)|profits]], the second type of license fee is dependent on the productivity of the licensee.\n\nWhen a licensor grants permission to a licensee to not only distribute, but manufacture a patented product, it is known as [[licensed production]].\n\n==Artwork and character licensing==\n\nA licensor may grant a permission to a licensee to copy and distribute [[copyright]]ed works such as \"art\" (e.g., [[Thomas Kinkade]]'s painting ''Dawn in Los Gato'') and characters (e.g., [[Mickey Mouse]]). With such license, a licensee need not fear a claim of copyright infringement brought by the copyright owner.\n\n[[Artistic license]] is, however, not related to the aforementioned license. It is a [[euphemism]] that denotes freedom of expression, the ability to make the subject appear more engaging or attractive, by [[fiction]]alising part of the subject.\n\n==Academia== <!-- This section is linked from [[Ecclesiastical court]] -->\n:''National examples of the licentiate are listed at [[licentiate (degree)]]''\n\nA [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] is an [[academic degree]] that traditionally conferred the license to teach at a university or to practice a particular profession. The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a [[doctorate]] is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate.<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/licentiate?region=uk&q=Licentiate Oxford Living Dictionaries] Accessed September 16, 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/licentiate|title=Definition of LICENTIATE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>  In English, the degree has never been called a license. In France, the ''licence'' is the first degree awarded in Universities.\n\nIn [[Education in Sweden|Sweden]], [[Education in Finland|Finland]], and in some other European university systems, a 'licentiate' is a postgraduate degree between the master's degree and the doctorate.  The licentiate is a popular choice in those countries where a full [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] would take five or more years to achieve.\n\n==Vehicle licensing==\n{{expand section|date=December 2016}}\n{{see also|Driver's license}}\nA license to driving certain vehicles has been applied to many countries around the world.

In particular, Katz and Shapiro (1986) have explored the optimal licensing strategy of a research lab selling to firms who are competitors on the product market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Michael L.|last2=Shapiro|first2=Carl|date=1986|title=How to License Intangible Property|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/101/3/567/1899659|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=567\u2013589|doi=10.2307/1885697|issn=0033-5533|via=|jstor=1885697}}</ref> It turns out that (compared to the welfare-maximizing solution) the licensor\u2019s incentives to develop innovations may be excessive, while the licensor\u2019s incentives to disseminate the innovation are typically too low. Subsequently, the seminal work of Katz and Shapiro (1986) has been extended in several directions. For example, Bhattacharya, Glazer, and Sappington (1992) have taken into account that the firms acquiring licenses must make further investments in order to develop marketable products.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sudipto|last2=Glazer|first2=Jacob|last3=Sappington|first3=David E.

According to Friedman, licenses and permits have become so burdensome due to legislation that favors the current  establishment of wealthy occupants that they decrease the supply of such occupations, which raises prices for the average consumer. Libertarians and the anti-authoritarian left ([[anarcho-communists]]) view competing guilds and other voluntary communes as being more beneficial for disseminating the skills and education required to perform a specified career.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n[[Intellectual property]]-related:\n* [[Brand licensing]]\n* [[Compulsory license]]\n* [[Cross-licensing]]\n* [[Licensed production]]\n* [[Music licensing]]\n* [[Smartphone patent licensing and litigation]]\n* [[Software license]]\n* [[Statutory license]]\n\nOther:\n* [[Amateur radio license]]\n* [[Banking license]]\n* [[Broadcast license]]\n* [[Dog license]]\n* [[Driver's license]]\n* [[Firearms license]]\n* [[Golf license]]\n* [[Hunting license]]\n* [[Admission to practice law|Law license]]\n* [[License to kill (concept)|License to kill]]\n* [[Licensee]]\n* [[Licensing context]] (linguistics)\n* [[Liquor license]]\n* [[Marriage license]]\n* [[Medical license]]\n* [[Pilot licensing and certification|Pilot license]]\n* [[Professional license]]\n* [[Television license]]\n* [[Vehicle license]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|licence}}\n*{{Wikibooks-inline|FOSS Licensing}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Law}}\n\n[[Category:Licenses| ]]\n[[Category:Licensing| ]]\n[[Category:Business law]]\n[[Category:Strategic alliances]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Licence|the historian|Tom Licence}}\n{{Selfref|For Wikipedia's licensing policy, see [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]].}}\n{{Property law}}\nA '''license''' (American English) or '''licence''' (British English)<ref name=cam>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/licence?a=british|title=licence Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).<ref name=cam/>\n\nA license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties.

The North Sydney Investment and Tramway Company or the North Shore and Middle Harbour Land Company made major investments in the area and planned to build a [[tram]]way and a bridge across Long Bay gully in order to open up the area for sales of residential land. A suspension bridge across the gully was opened to traffic in January 1892. It had taken two years and nine months to complete and cost [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]42,000. With a suspension span of {{convert|500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} centre to centre of towers, it was considered one of the engineering wonders of Sydney and became a great tourist attraction.<ref name=NSWHD/>  \n\nA toll of threepence return for adults and one penny for children was charged. The disastrous crash of 1892 saw both the above companies go into liquidation. The Depression of the 1890s slowed land sales and Northbridge did not develop as had been hoped; the tramway was not built.<ref name=NSWHD/> In 1894 a fundraising dance and promenade concert was held on the bridge.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/13982566 |title=ENTERTAINMENT ON THE NORTH SYDNEY SUSPENSION BRIDGE |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=12 November 1894 |access-date=23 March 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]]  }}</ref> In 1912 the bridge was handed over to the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] as a gift, on the condition that a tramway be extended to the north side and no toll charged. The tramway was extended over the bridge in 1913-14, with its terminus in Sailors Bay Road.<ref name=NSWHD/> \n\nBetween its construction and its handing over to the [[NSW Public Works|Department of Public Works]], the bridge was little used and poorly maintained for many years. Repairs and some strengthening works were carried out in conjunction with the construction of the tramway.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', August 1937, p.152.</ref> The Department of Main Roads (DMR) assumed control of the bridge in 1935 and inspections soon revealed serious corrosion in the steelwork and cables, partly attributable to defects in the design of the bridge. Water had been allowed to accumulate around the suspension rods as they passed through the cross girder ends in small, undrained reserves that had originally been filled with a bituminous mixture, which had not stood the test of time. The main suspension cables were also found to be weakened by corrosion.<ref name=NSWHD/>  \n\nThe bridge was carefully monitored and it rapidly became clear that replacement or substantial rebuilding would be necessary. From several options, it was decided that a large concrete arch span to support the deck of the old suspension bridge was the most satisfactory solution. The towers themselves were in very good condition and were recognised by the DMR as having local significance as a landmark and tourist attraction and as having considerable historical value. For these reasons they were retained and repeated in the design of the new work, with much attention to sympathetic design.<ref name=NSWHD/> The bridge closed in May 1936.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/231325607 |title=Closing Of Suspension Bridge |work=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |location=Sydney |date=28 May 1936 |access-date=23 March 2020 |page=23 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]]  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/247040758 |title=Suspension Bridge |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location=Sydney |date=27 May 1936  |access-date=23 March 2020 |page=7 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]]  }}</ref>\n\n===Current bridge===\nThe arch was designed and tested through the analysis of models within the DMR.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', August 1937, p.152-155.</ref> The construction contract was awarded to Hornibrook Bros. & Clark Pty.

While a 'Melan' system using a steel rib to serve as falsework and then reinforcement in the completed structure had been considered, the tenderers favoured the conventional system of timber falsework, and it was this system which was employed. An interesting innovation, however, was employed in the form of steel cylinders with base plate partly filled with a fine dune sand and fitted with a hardwood piston. The pistons bore the weight of the girders until it was time to strike the falsework when two small screw plugs on the cylinders could be opened to a carefully prepared schedule, with a large team of operators working to signals, and sand released so that the crown and then, gradually, the whole arch took up its own load. Worker safety was also an important factor in the design of construction methods for the bridge. The bridge was re-opened to traffic in late 1939.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', August 1939, p.113-116.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe original suspension bridge had a {{convert|500|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} main [[span (architecture)|span]] supported by steel cables and steel hanger rods. The deck was stiffened by an undertruss which was pin connected at the centre of the span. The steel cables were supported on ornate sandstone towers and anchored into bedrock at each end of the gorge. The wooden deck carried two lanes of traffic plus two tram tracks and footways.<ref name=NSWHD/>  \n\nDeterioration of the bridge due to corrosion led to the replacement of the suspension design by an arch in the 1930s. With a main span of {{convert|344|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, the arch consists of two concrete ribs, peaking some {{convert|167|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above stream level. Supported on the arches are columns carrying the deck on 14 reinforced concrete beam slab spans. The deck has expansion joints at the large piers directly over the arch springs. These also transfer wind load from the arch and deck back to the [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]]. Connecting these to the original towers are {{convert|50|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} concrete beam spans. The concrete detailing was done in [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Tudor (Jacobethan)|Victorian Gothic and Norman]] styles to reflect the Gothic sandstone towers, the main piers being given Norman castle features. As part of the reconstruction the roadway openings through the towers were increased to {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}}, and walkway openings cut through the towers. The bridge has light standards supported by the concrete railings.<ref name=NSWHD/> \n\n=== Modifications ===\n* Suspension system (which was corroded) was replaced by a concrete arch in 1937-39\n* Floodlighting was installed by Sydney electricity on 1992 \n* Safety fencing was installed on the bridge in 2010\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe bridge is intimately associated with the residential development of the area to the north of the bridge, essential infrastructure which allowed its development to proceed in the late nineteenth century. The concrete arch which was built 1936-9 is a fascinating episode in the bridge's history. The process of the design and construction of the arch is illustrative of an era in the history of bridge building in the Department of Main Roads. It is linked with the local historical theme of engineering and building the road system.

The bridge was transferred to the Department of Main Roads in 1935 and, in 1939, was rebuilt as a reinforced concrete two rib arch bridge, with the sandstone towers kept.<ref name=NSWHD>{{cite NSW HD|4309506|Suspension Bridge|date=|accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite NSW HD|2660227|Suspension Bridge|hr=I229|year=31 January 2013|accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite NSW HD|18382|Suspension Bridge over Tunks Park|hr=1995|year=17 November 1995|accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/EPI/2012/679/sch5 |title=Willoughby Local Environmental Plan 2012 |work=NSW legislation |publisher=Government of New South Wales |date=15 January 2020 |access-date=23 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Original bridge===\n\n[[File:SLNSW 796752 Suspension Bridge North Sydney.jpg|The suspension bridge, early 1900s|thumb|left]]\n\nWith the land boom of the 1880s, land to the north of Long Bay, [[Middle Harbour]], was sold and resold. The North Sydney Investment and Tramway Company or the North Shore and Middle Harbour Land Company made major investments in the area and planned to build a [[tram]]way and a bridge across Long Bay gully in order to open up the area for sales of residential land. A suspension bridge across the gully was opened to traffic in January 1892. It had taken two years and nine months to complete and cost [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]42,000. With a suspension span of {{convert|500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} centre to centre of towers, it was considered one of the engineering wonders of Sydney and became a great tourist attraction.<ref name=NSWHD/>  \n\nA toll of threepence return for adults and one penny for children was charged. The disastrous crash of 1892 saw both the above companies go into liquidation. The Depression of the 1890s slowed land sales and Northbridge did not develop as had been hoped; the tramway was not built.<ref name=NSWHD/> In 1894 a fundraising dance and promenade concert was held on the bridge.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/13982566 |title=ENTERTAINMENT ON THE NORTH SYDNEY SUSPENSION BRIDGE |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=12 November 1894 |access-date=23 March 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]]  }}</ref> In 1912 the bridge was handed over to the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] as a gift, on the condition that a tramway be extended to the north side and no toll charged. The tramway was extended over the bridge in 1913-14, with its terminus in Sailors Bay Road.<ref name=NSWHD/> \n\nBetween its construction and its handing over to the [[NSW Public Works|Department of Public Works]], the bridge was little used and poorly maintained for many years. Repairs and some strengthening works were carried out in conjunction with the construction of the tramway.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', August 1937, p.152.</ref> The Department of Main Roads (DMR) assumed control of the bridge in 1935 and inspections soon revealed serious corrosion in the steelwork and cables, partly attributable to defects in the design of the bridge. Water had been allowed to accumulate around the suspension rods as they passed through the cross girder ends in small, undrained reserves that had originally been filled with a bituminous mixture, which had not stood the test of time. The main suspension cables were also found to be weakened by corrosion.<ref name=NSWHD/>  \n\nThe bridge was carefully monitored and it rapidly became clear that replacement or substantial rebuilding would be necessary. From several options, it was decided that a large concrete arch span to support the deck of the old suspension bridge was the most satisfactory solution. The towers themselves were in very good condition and were recognised by the DMR as having local significance as a landmark and tourist attraction and as having considerable historical value. For these reasons they were retained and repeated in the design of the new work, with much attention to sympathetic design.<ref name=NSWHD/> The bridge closed in May 1936.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/231325607 |title=Closing Of Suspension Bridge |work=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |location=Sydney |date=28 May 1936 |access-date=23 March 2020 |page=23 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]]  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/247040758 |title=Suspension Bridge |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location=Sydney |date=27 May 1936  |access-date=23 March 2020 |page=7 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]]  }}</ref>\n\n===Current bridge===\nThe arch was designed and tested through the analysis of models within the DMR.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', August 1937, p.152-155.</ref> The construction contract was awarded to Hornibrook Bros. & Clark Pty.

While a 'Melan' system using a steel rib to serve as falsework and then reinforcement in the completed structure had been considered, the tenderers favoured the conventional system of timber falsework, and it was this system which was employed. An interesting innovation, however, was employed in the form of steel cylinders with base plate partly filled with a fine dune sand and fitted with a hardwood piston. The pistons bore the weight of the girders until it was time to strike the falsework when two small screw plugs on the cylinders could be opened to a carefully prepared schedule, with a large team of operators working to signals, and sand released so that the crown and then, gradually, the whole arch took up its own load. Worker safety was also an important factor in the design of construction methods for the bridge. The bridge was re-opened to traffic in late 1939.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', August 1939, p.113-116.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe original suspension bridge had a {{convert|500|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} main [[span (architecture)|span]] supported by steel cables and steel hanger rods. The deck was stiffened by an undertruss which was pin connected at the centre of the span. The steel cables were supported on ornate sandstone towers and anchored into bedrock at each end of the gorge. The wooden deck carried two lanes of traffic plus two tram tracks and footways.<ref name=NSWHD/>  \n\nDeterioration of the bridge due to corrosion led to the replacement of the suspension design by an arch in the 1930s. With a main span of {{convert|344|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, the arch consists of two concrete ribs, peaking some {{convert|167|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above stream level. Supported on the arches are columns carrying the deck on 14 reinforced concrete beam slab spans. The deck has expansion joints at the large piers directly over the arch springs. These also transfer wind load from the arch and deck back to the [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]]. Connecting these to the original towers are {{convert|50|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} concrete beam spans. The concrete detailing was done in [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Tudor (Jacobethan)|Victorian Gothic and Norman]] styles to reflect the Gothic sandstone towers, the main piers being given Norman castle features. As part of the reconstruction the roadway openings through the towers were increased to {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}}, and walkway openings cut through the towers. The bridge has light standards supported by the concrete railings.<ref name=NSWHD/> \n\n=== Modifications ===\n* Suspension system (which was corroded) was replaced by a concrete arch in 1937-39\n* Floodlighting was installed by Sydney electricity on 1992 \n* Safety fencing was installed on the bridge in 2010\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe bridge is intimately associated with the residential development of the area to the north of the bridge, essential infrastructure which allowed its development to proceed in the late nineteenth century. The concrete arch which was built 1936-9 is a fascinating episode in the bridge's history. The process of the design and construction of the arch is illustrative of an era in the history of bridge building in the Department of Main Roads. It is linked with the local historical theme of engineering and building the road system. The use of the concrete arch solution to support the older bridge and to allow its landmark features to be retained was a creative and heritage-sensitive response to an infrastructure problem in an era long before heritage values and processes were enshrined in legislation.<ref name=NSWHD/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<Gallery>\nFile:Long Gully Bridge, Northbridge.jpg|Long Gully Bridge viewed from Tunks Park\nFile:NorthbridgePlaque2.JPG|Plaque\nFile:Middle Harbour Bridge, North Sydney (4903243213).jpg|As a suspension bridge, late 1800s\n</Gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{portal|Australian roads|New South Wales|Architecture}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Sydney]]\n* [[Australian non-residential architectural styles]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n*{{NSW-HD-CC|name=Suspension Bridge|dno=2660227|id=I229|year=31 January 2013|accessdate=23 March 2020}}\n*{{NSW-HD-CC|name=Suspension Bridge|dno=4309506|id=|year=30 May 2011|accessdate=23 March 2020}}\n*{{NSW-HD-CC|name=Suspension Bridge over Tunks Park|dno=18382|id=1995|year=17 November 1995|accessdate=23 March 2020}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Citation |author1=New South Wales Department of Services, Technology and Administration |author2=Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW |title=Long Gully Bridge: the Northbridge suspension bridge: new safety barrier options analysis |publication-date=2009 |publisher=NSW Services, Technology & Administration |isbn=978-1-921692-00-0 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.livinglocalguide.com.au/the-long-gully-bridge/ |title=IF YOU BRIDGE IT, THEY WILL COME: THE LONG GULLY BRIDGE |author=Johnston, Robert C. |work=Sydney's north shore: Living local guide |publisher= |date=23 March 2015 |via= }}\n*{{cite web |url=https://structurae.net/en/structures/northbridge-suspension-bridge |title=Northbridge Suspension Bridge |work=Structurae |publisher=Nicolas Janberg |date=2020 }}\n \n{{Bridges in Sydney |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Road infrastructure in Sydney}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1892]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1939]]\n[[Category:New South Wales Heritage Database]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1892 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Northbridge, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Cammeray]]\n[[Category:Sandstone bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Victorian architecture in Australia]]\n[[Category:Concrete bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Arch bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Former toll bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Stone arch bridges in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "removedCategory:Arch bridges in AustraliausingHotCatduplicated category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Gully_Bridge"}
