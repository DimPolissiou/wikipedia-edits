King is best known for advancing [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] through [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]], inspired by his [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs and the nonviolent activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n\nKing led the 1955 [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and later became the first president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he then led an unsuccessful [[Albany Movement|1962 struggle against segregation]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington]], where he delivered his famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]].\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] through [[nonviolent resistance]]. In 1965, he helped organize the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], capitalism, and the [[Vietnam War]]. FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] from 1963 on. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and, in 1964, mailed King [[FBI\u2013King suicide letter|a threatening anonymous letter]], which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nBefore his death, King was planning a national occupation of [[Washington, D.C.]], to be called the [[Poor People's Campaign]], when he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories|Allegations]] that [[James Earl Ray]], the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting.\n\nKing was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and [[King County, Washington|a county]] in Washington was rededicated for him. The [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Birth and name change===\nKing was born '''Michael King Jr.''' on January 15, 1929, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the second of three children to the [[Reverend]] [[Michael King Sr.]] and [[Alberta Williams King|Alberta King]] ({{nee}} Williams).<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book| title=All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half Century of Brown v.

King is best known for advancing [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] through [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]], inspired by his [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs and the nonviolent activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n\nKing led the 1955 [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and later became the first president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he then led an unsuccessful [[Albany Movement|1962 struggle against segregation]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington]], where he delivered his famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]].\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] through [[nonviolent resistance]]. In 1965, he helped organize the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], capitalism, and the [[Vietnam War]]. FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] from 1963 on. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and, in 1964, mailed King [[FBI\u2013King suicide letter|a threatening anonymous letter]], which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nBefore his death, King was planning a national occupation of [[Washington, D.C.]], to be called the [[Poor People's Campaign]], when he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories|Allegations]] that [[James Earl Ray]], the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting.\n\nKing was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and [[King County, Washington|a county]] in Washington was rededicated for him. The [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Birth and name change===\nKing was born '''Michael King Jr.''' on January 15, 1929, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the second of three children to the [[Reverend]] [[Michael King Sr.]] and [[Alberta King]] ({{nee}} Williams).<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book| title=All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half Century of Brown v.

The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Bloody Sunday]] and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.{{sfn|King|1998|p=6}}\n\nOn March 5, King met with officials in the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] in order to request an [[injunction]] against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, \"If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.\"{{sfn|King|1998|pp=276\u201379}} Footage of [[police brutality]] against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=222\u201323}}\n\nKing next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order.

The commons also voted for the arrest of [[William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|William Scrope]] and Henry Green, both councillors of Richard II.\n\nDoreward was again made Speaker of the House of Commons for the parliament of 1413; this was the first of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], and he was appointed again apparently after his predecessor had resigned from ill-health.<ref name=manning/> The parliament of 1413 granted Henry V a subsidy for four years; an unusually long period, this is understood to be explained by the new king's popularity.\n\nSome historians have assumed that the John Doreward (or Dorewood) in the parliaments of 1399 and 1413 were father and son, but they are evidently the same person; the Speaker of the House of Commons in both cases was a serjeant-at-law, which was not an appointment held by either of Dorewood's sons.\n\nHe was appointed a member of Henry IV\u2019s council from Nov 1399 to May 1406.\n\n==Monument==\nDoreward is commemorated by a [[monumental brass]] in St Mary's Church, Bocking, on the floor before the South Chapel. This gives the year of his death as 1420 and names his second wife as Isabella.<ref>[http://www.stmarys-bocking.co.uk/history.htm History] at stmarys-bocking.co.uk, accessed 11 August 2008</ref> Inscribed in Latin: ''Exoretur mia(?)

This [[candy]] is formed by allowing a [[Supersaturation|supersaturated]] solution of sugar and [[water]] to crystallize onto a surface suitable for crystal [[nucleation]], such as a string, stick, or plain granulated sugar. Heating the water before adding the sugar allows more sugar to dissolve thus producing larger crystals. Crystals form after 6 to 7 days.  [[Food coloring]] may be added to the mixture to produce colored candy.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nEtymologically, \"sugar candy\" derives from late 13th century English (in reference to \"crystallized sugar\"), from Old French ''\u00e7ucre candi'' (meaning \"sugar candy\"), and ultimately from Arabic ''qandi'', from Persian ''qand'' (\"cane sugar\"), probably from [[Sanskrit]] ''khanda'' (\"piece of sugar)\",  The sense gradually broadened (especially in the U.S.A.) to mean by the late 19th century \"any [[confection]] having sugar as its basis\". In Britain these are  you are awesome\nsweets, and \"candy\" tends to be restricted to sweets made only from boiled sugar and striped in bright colors.<ref>{{cite web|website=etymonline.com|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/candy|title=Candy}}</ref>\n\nThe modern American term \"rock candy\" (referring to brittle large natural sugar crystals) should not be confused with the British term [[Rock (confectionery)|rock]] (referring to an amorphous and opaque boiled sugar product, initially hard but then chewy at mouth temperature).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author= Richardson, Tim|date= 2002|title= Sweets:  A History of Candy|publisher= Bloomsbury|isbn= 978-1582342290|page= [https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/90 90]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/90}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nIslamic writers in the first half of the 9th century described the production of candy sugar, where crystals were grown through cooling supersaturated sugar solutions.\nAccording to the production process, rock sugar is divided into two types: single crystal rock sugar and polycrystalline rock sugar. The former produced in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation period. During the Japanese occupation, rock sugar was one of Taiwan's important export commodities. Polycrystalline rock sugar is made by traditional techniques. In a period of Tang Dynasty (766-779A.D.), the Zou monk of Suining in Sichuan has invented this method. The related history can be seen in \"Tangshuangpu\", or \"Bencaogangmu\".  The biggest difference between the two is the way of crystal growth.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sugar-cultivation|title=SUGAR|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\nRock candy is often dissolved in tea. It is an important part of the [[tea culture]] of [[East Frisia]], where a lump of rock sugar is placed at the bottom of the cup. Rock candy consumed with tea is also the most common and popular way of drinking tea in Iran, where it is called ''nabat''; the most popular nabat is [[saffron]].<ref>{{cite web|website=My Persion Corner|url=http://www.mypersiancorner.com/2013/04/sweet-tea-persian-style.html|title=Sweet Tea Persion Style}}</ref>\n\nIt is a common ingredient in Chinese cooking. In [[China]], it is used to sweeten [[chrysanthemum tea]], as well as [[tong sui|Cantonese dessert soups]] and the liquor ''[[baijiu]]''.  Many households have rock candy available to marinate meats, add to stir fry, and to prepare food such as yao shan. In less modern times, rock sugar was a luxury only for the wealthy. Rock candy is also regarded as having medicinal properties, and in some Chinese provinces, it is used as a part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].{{citation needed|date = June 2012}} \n\nIn [[Mexico]], it is used during the [[Day of the Dead]] to make sugar skulls, often highly decorated. Sugar skulls are given to children so they will not fear death; they are also offered to the dead.\n\nIn the [[Friesland]] province of the [[Netherlands]], bits of rock candy are baked in the luxury white [[bread]] ''[[Fryske S\u00fbkerb\u00f4le]]''.\n\nRock candy is a common ingredient in [[Tamil cuisine]], particularly in the [[Sri Lanka]]n city of [[Jaffna]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n<gallery style=\"packed\">\nCalavera.jpg\nCalavera_de_az\u00facar.JPG\nCalaveritas_inakiherrasti.JPG\nDay_of_the_Dead_Coyoacan_2014_-_1.JPG\nCalavera en ofrenda with Cempasuchil flowers.JPG\n</gallery>\n\nIn the US, rock candy comes in many colors and flavors, and is slightly hard to find, due to it being considered old-fashioned.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Misri==\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Misri\n| image            = [[File:Misri.JPG|250px]]\n| caption          = Misri crystals\n| alternate_name   = \n| country          = [[India]] and [[Iran]]\n| region           = \n| creator          = \n| course           = \n| type             = Rock candy or [[sweetener]]\n| served           = \n| main_ingredient  = \n| variations       = \n| calories         = \n| other            = \n}}\n\n'''Misri''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u0633\u0631\u06cc}}}}, {{lang-hi|\u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940}}, {{lang-bn|\u09ae\u09bf\u099b\u09b0\u09bf}}) refers to crystallized [[sugar]] lumps, and a type of [[confectionery]] mineral, which has its origins in [[India]] and [[Persia]], also known as rock sugar elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tarladalal.com/glossary-misri-1150i |title=Glossary: Misri|website= [[Tarla Dalal]] }}</ref> It is used in [[India]] as a type of candy, or used to sweeten milk or tea.<ref name=\"Dar1996\">{{cite book|author=Dar, Bashir Ahmad |title=Studies in Muslim philosophy and literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-zjAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2011|date=January 1996|publisher=Iqbal Academy Pakistan|page=168}}</ref><ref name=\"Baden-Powell1868\">{{cite book|author= Baden-Powell, Henry|title=Hand-book of the economic products of the Punjab: with a combined index and glossary of technical vernacular words|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookeconomi00powgoog|accessdate=9 August 2011|year=1868|publisher= Thomason Civil Engineering College Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookeconomi00powgoog/page/n548 307]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Hinduism, mishri may be offered to a deity as ''bhog'' and distributed as ''[[prasad]]''.

This [[candy]] is formed by allowing a [[Supersaturation|supersaturated]] solution of sugar and [[water]] to crystallize onto a surface suitable for crystal [[nucleation]], such as a string, stick, or plain granulated sugar. Heating the water before adding the sugar allows more sugar to dissolve thus producing larger crystals. Crystals form after 6 to 7 days.  [[Food coloring]] may be added to the mixture to produce colored candy.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nEtymologically, \"sugar candy\" derives from late 13th century English (in reference to \"crystallized sugar\"), from Old French ''\u00e7ucre candi'' (meaning \"sugar candy\"), and ultimately from Arabic ''qandi'', from Persian ''qand'' (\"cane sugar\"), probably from [[Sanskrit]] ''khanda'' (\"piece of sugar)\",  The sense gradually broadened (especially in the U.S.A.) to mean by the late 19th century \"any [[confection]] having sugar as its basis\". In Britain these are sweets, and \"candy\" tends to be restricted to sweets made only from boiled sugar and striped in bright colors.<ref>{{cite web|website=etymonline.com|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/candy|title=Candy}}</ref>\n\nThe modern American term \"rock candy\" (referring to brittle large natural sugar crystals) should not be confused with the British term [[Rock (confectionery)|rock]] (referring to an amorphous and opaque boiled sugar product, initially hard but then chewy at mouth temperature).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author= Richardson, Tim|date= 2002|title= Sweets:  A History of Candy|publisher= Bloomsbury|isbn= 978-1582342290|page= [https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/90 90]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/90}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nIslamic writers in the first half of the 9th century described the production of candy sugar, where crystals were grown through cooling supersaturated sugar solutions.\nAccording to the production process, rock sugar is divided into two types: single crystal rock sugar and polycrystalline rock sugar. The former produced in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation period. During the Japanese occupation, rock sugar was one of Taiwan's important export commodities. Polycrystalline rock sugar is made by traditional techniques. In a period of Tang Dynasty (766-779A.D.), the Zou monk of Suining in Sichuan has invented this method. The related history can be seen in \"Tangshuangpu\", or \"Bencaogangmu\".  The biggest difference between the two is the way of crystal growth.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sugar-cultivation|title=SUGAR|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\nRock candy is often dissolved in tea. It is an important part of the [[tea culture]] of [[East Frisia]], where a lump of rock sugar is placed at the bottom of the cup. Rock candy consumed with tea is also the most common and popular way of drinking tea in Iran, where it is called ''nabat''; the most popular nabat is [[saffron]].<ref>{{cite web|website=My Persion Corner|url=http://www.mypersiancorner.com/2013/04/sweet-tea-persian-style.html|title=Sweet Tea Persion Style}}</ref>\n\nIt is a common ingredient in Chinese cooking. In [[China]], it is used to sweeten [[chrysanthemum tea]], as well as [[tong sui|Cantonese dessert soups]] and the liquor ''[[baijiu]]''.  Many households have rock candy available to marinate meats, add to stir fry, and to prepare food such as yao shan. In less modern times, rock sugar was a luxury only for the wealthy. Rock candy is also regarded as having medicinal properties, and in some Chinese provinces, it is used as a part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].{{citation needed|date = June 2012}} \n\nIn [[Mexico]], it is used during the [[Day of the Dead]] to make sugar skulls, often highly decorated. Sugar skulls are given to children so they will not fear death; they are also offered to the dead.\n\nIn the [[Friesland]] province of the [[Netherlands]], bits of rock candy are baked in the luxury white [[bread]] ''[[Fryske S\u00fbkerb\u00f4le]]''.\n\nRock candy is a common ingredient in [[Tamil cuisine]], particularly in the [[Sri Lanka]]n city of [[Jaffna]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n<gallery style=\"packed\">\nCalavera.jpg\nCalavera_de_az\u00facar.JPG\nCalaveritas_inakiherrasti.JPG\nDay_of_the_Dead_Coyoacan_2014_-_1.JPG\nCalavera en ofrenda with Cempasuchil flowers.JPG\n</gallery>\n\nIn the US, rock candy comes in many colors and flavors, and is slightly hard to find, due to it being considered old-fashioned.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Misri==\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Misri\n| image            = [[File:Misri.JPG|250px]]\n| caption          = Misri crystals\n| alternate_name   = \n| country          = [[India]] and [[Iran]]\n| region           = \n| creator          = \n| course           = \n| type             = Rock candy or [[sweetener]]\n| served           = \n| main_ingredient  = \n| variations       = \n| calories         = \n| other            = \n}}\n\n'''Misri''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u0633\u0631\u06cc}}}}, {{lang-hi|\u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940}}, {{lang-bn|\u09ae\u09bf\u099b\u09b0\u09bf}}) refers to crystallized [[sugar]] lumps, and a type of [[confectionery]] mineral, which has its origins in [[India]] and [[Persia]], also known as rock sugar elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tarladalal.com/glossary-misri-1150i |title=Glossary: Misri|website= [[Tarla Dalal]] }}</ref> It is used in [[India]] as a type of candy, or used to sweeten milk or tea.<ref name=\"Dar1996\">{{cite book|author=Dar, Bashir Ahmad |title=Studies in Muslim philosophy and literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-zjAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2011|date=January 1996|publisher=Iqbal Academy Pakistan|page=168}}</ref><ref name=\"Baden-Powell1868\">{{cite book|author= Baden-Powell, Henry|title=Hand-book of the economic products of the Punjab: with a combined index and glossary of technical vernacular words|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookeconomi00powgoog|accessdate=9 August 2011|year=1868|publisher= Thomason Civil Engineering College Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookeconomi00powgoog/page/n548 307]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Hinduism, mishri may be offered to a deity as ''bhog'' and distributed as ''[[prasad]]''.
