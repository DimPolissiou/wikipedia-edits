Vishwaveer discovers that an abandoned baby girl is able to protect Gauri from a familial curse, and he adopts her, naming her Kaali and making her Gauri's \"kaala teeka\".\n\n'''After 5 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Sargam Khurana]]) continues protecting Gauri ([[Adaa Narang]]) in every way. Gauri, being Vishwaveer's only child, is brought up surrounded with comforts, while Vishwaveer doesn't treat Kaali very well. She is mistreated by Vishwaveer's sister-in-law Kalyani Jha ([[Mona Ambegaonkar]]). Vishwaveer's first wife, Manjiri Jha ([[Dalljiet Kaur]]), who doesn't have children, adores Kaali and brings her up as her own daughter.\n\nKalyani plots to kill Gauri to get revenge from Vishwaveer for an old matter. She kills Kaali first, so that she is unable to protect Gauri. However, Kaali survives, and relates the incident to Manjiri, who decides to make Kalyani pay.\n\nKaali and Manjiri confront Kalyani in a temple, where Kalyani ends up killing Manjiri by strangling her, and making it look like Kaali did it. When the family finds out, Vishwaveer decides to take the blame on himself and go to jail in Kaali's place, so that Kaali can stay with Gauri and continue to protect her. As a result, Vishwaveer goes to jail for 14 years.\n\n'''After 14 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Simran Pareenja]]) and Gauri ([[Fenil Umrigar]]) are grown up. Kaali is very intelligent and a good singer, but all credits are taken by Gauri. Kaali writes exams for her and sings for her. A guy named Yug Choudhary ([[Rohan Gandotra]]) hears Kaali's voice and is taken aback by her voice. He tries to search for her but is unable to find her. Everyone thinks that it is Gauri who sings and Yug also thinks the same, but he is not able to find Gauri. Vishwaveer, while searching for a suitable groom for Gauri, comes across Yug and resolves to get her married to him. Gauri initially refuses but Kaali convinces her, and Gauri eventually falls in love with Yug and agrees for marriage after testing him a couple of times. When Yug's grandmother rejects the proposal considering Vishwa to be a criminal, he brainwashes Gauri's brother Neelkanth \"Neel\" Jha ([[Nivin Ramani]]) into trying to rape Yug's sister Sharmila Choudhary ([[Meenu Panchal]]). Neel attempts to do so, but is held back by his conscience at the last minute. In order to save Sharmila's reputation, Yug's grandmother agrees to get Yug married to Gauri in exchange for Neel marrying Sharmila. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Manjiri is still alive and that she lost her memory 14 years ago and saved Yug's life, after which his father took her in as his sister. She is now living with Yug.\n\nAfter a while Kaali finds out that Manjiri is still alive and with the help of Yug, Kaali brings her memory back. Yug-Gauri and Neel-Sharmila are now scheduled to get married. Instead destiny wants to bring Yug and Kaali together who have fallen in love. Yug is actually Kaali's childhood Ramji.\n\nThe show goes on with Manjiri and Yug supporting Kali in each and every step to get back love of Vishwaveer and prove him superstitions are waste. Gauri's kundli's truth comes out and Kaali is forced to agree to be Gauri's Kaala Teeka again and goes to Yug's house. She gets anxious and encounters Vishwa and decides to leave. Manjiri and Kali get kidnapped by Kalyani, but Yug saves them. Kalyani is arrested and Manjiri goes back to Vishwa and demands Kali and Yug's alliance. Gauri drinks poison but she is saved and Vishwa realises that it was not Kali being kaala teeka that worked for Gauri but her prayers were the ones which truly worked. He fixes Yug and Kali's alliance to which Yug's mother Leelavita \"Leela\" Choudhary agrees only because of a hidden motto and she doesn't want Kali to be her daughter-in-law. Therefore, Leela and Gauri team up. Yug marries Kali but everyone get tricked as they assume it is Gauri who is marrying Yug. Yug doesn't trust Kali anymore and goes with Gauri. Yug starts to hate Kali.\n\nTime passes by and Yug finally finds out the truth behind Gauri and gets married to Kali once again. Gauri then plans to make Kali seem dead by injecting some type of medicine on her but that plan fails when her injection breaks. Instead, she puts the poison in the safety pin and hooks it on Kali's doli. Kali is pricked by the safety pin. While performing rituals and praying in the temple at Yug's house, Kali faints. They call the doctor but the doctor tells everyone that Kali is dead. Just then, Yug realizes that it could have been Gauri and goes to her hotel to drag her there. She fakes and does some drama of crying and says she will bring Kali back to life by burning kapur on her hand. She has already put chemical on her hand to make sure her palm doesn't burn. The poison wears off and Kali regains conscientious, leaving everyone believing Gauri. However Yug does not believe Gauri and sends her out of the house. Gauri vows for revenge. She comes back as a servant and starts to make Leela believe that an evil spirit is haunting her. She brings a fake astrologer and he tells that Yug should be 21 kilometers away from the house. Leela and Yug believe it and Yug leaves. Later with the help of the astrologer, Gauri makes it look like Kali has the evil spirit inside her and Leela decides to sacrifice Kali. Manjiri comes to Yug's house and discovers that there is a pooja going on and asks for Kali, who is locked in a room. Manjiri gets suspicious and follows the car leading to the ashram. She brings a real astrologer and the truth behind Gauri gets revealed to everyone. Kali, enraged, slaps Gauri for her deeds and Gauri later reveals to everyone that Leela did not want Kali to be her daughter in law and encouraged Gauri that Yug would be married to her. Yug gets distraught and leaves while Gauri and the fake astrologer get arrested. Gauri vows to destroy his whole family. After three months however, Gauri who is released from jail returns and reveals to everyone that she is pregnant with Yug's child. Because of this Yug allows her to stay until the child is born. Later, it is revealed that Kaali is also pregnant. This matter however, is only known by Gauri and Vishwa as they bribed the nurse to get her reports before she does. In order to make sure that Kaali and Yug stay apart Gauri plans to have Kali thrown out of the house which is eventually carried out by Yug himself, as he does so Vishwa then takes Kaali to the top of a cliff and reveals her pregnancy to her just as he is about to push her off. Vishwa pushes Kali off of the cliff but Kali hangs onto a branch. Vishwa throws rock at her and she falls. Afterwards, Kali's suicide note comes and everyone believes Kali to be dead. Leela asks Yug to marry Gauri and give the child a legitimate name. Yug agrees to marry Gauri. Meanwhile, Kali doesn't die and is saved by a mentally challenged man named Nandu Singh ([[Mayank Gandhi]]). Kali asks Nandu to take her to Choudhary House. Nandu takes her there but returns. There back in his village, some kids tease him as Kali's husband. Nandu becomes shy and later, Nandu marries Kali and then takes her to the hospital where he gets to know that Kali is in coma.\n\n'''7 months later'''\n\nYug is now turned as a puppet for Vishwaveer. Vishwaveer is the new landlord of Choudhary House. Nandu is seen taking care of Kali in the hospital. The nurses discuss that Kali has lost her child. Gauri and Yug travel to Veerpur. On there way Gauri gets labour pain and Yug takes her to the same hospital where Kali is admitted. Vishwaveer finds out that Kali is in the hospital. Meanwhile, Gauri delivers a baby girl and names it Naina. Naina gets kidnapped by Vishwa, after being told that baby is threat to his life and Kali finds out about Yug and Gauri and decides to commit suicide on the same river where Vishwa places Naina in a basket and floating away. Kali feels the basket and finds Naina in it and decides to live. She begins to raise Naina. Unknown to Kali is that Naina is Yug and Gauri's daughter, who are distraught after their baby went missing, and names it Naina. It is revealed that Vishwa attempted to kill Naina because of a superstition that says Naina is a threat to him. Manjiri later finds Kali at a temple and Kali reveals that she was once pregnant with Yug's child and Vishwa threw her off the cliff for the sake of Gauri. Manjiri vows revenge on Vishwa and brings Kali to Yug's house. Gauri does not like this and tries to kill her own daughter Naina. However it backfires. Meanwhile, Nandu finds out that Vishwa attempted to kill Kali and vows not to spare him. Fearing that the truth would come out, Vishwa gets rid of all the evidence he could find. He also find out that Kali's adopted daughter is actually Gauri and Yug's daughter Naina. Vishwa attempts to kill Kali and Naina but fails because of Nandu. Manjiri later finds out about this and scolds Vishwa and reveals her revenge against him. Kali and Naina disappeared once again and Manjiri threatens to kill Vishwa if he does not reveal where Kali and Naina are. It is later revealed that Kali had planned this to get the truth from Vishwa. Later, while Vishwa, along with his partner Raj Purohit ([[Rajesh Puri]]) conduct a Pooja, assuming that Kali is dead, Kali pretends to be a spirit to get Vishwa to say the truth. With the help of Nandu and Manjiri, Kali gets the truth out. Yug gets distraught by hearing this and a chandelier falls on Kali. While she is hospitalized Manjiri reveals the truth behind Vishwa and Gauri. Yug later gets Raj and Vishwa arrested but they escape. Naina gets kidnapped again but Kali and Manjiri finds her. Vishwa finds Kali and Manjiri and threatens to kill Kali and Naina. Before he could, Manjiri grabs a trishul and stabs Vishwa, killing him. After Vishwa's funeral, Yug asks Kali for forgiveness but Kali rejects saying that she is not a doll to play with. Nandu offers Kali to stay at his place but Yug threatens to kill Naina if Kali leaves. Kali stays but scolds Yug for being selfish and will only stay for Naina's sake. Leela declares Kali as Naina's official mother as Gauri is too dangerous for the number of sins she committed. At this time, a tantrik named Devri Singh ([[Vineet Raina]]) is introduced and reveals to be Nandu's brother. Kali and Manjiri get suspicious about Devri and ask a priest at an ashram and Raj Purohit, as he has no other option. Manjiri and Kali discover that Devri was Vishwa's Kaala Teeka. They also discovers Devri's true intentions to kill the baby Naina to gain evil powers. It is also revealed in Nandu's kundli that Nandu is Naina's Kaala Teeka. Discovering that Devri is a threat, Yug bans Devri from coming into the house while Devri plot to kill Naina is underway. Devri also decides to kill Kali because she is an obstacle that he has to overcome to kill Naina. But Manjiri and Nandu save them and Nandu and Kali get married for Naina's protection. This infuriates Yug and he decides to kill Nandu but is stopped by Gauri. Devri decides to kill his own brother Nandu in order to get Naina but Devri mistakenly stabs himself. Devri is rushed to the hospital. Yug later snatched Naina from Kali saying that she is no longer her mother. Yug meets with an accident and Naina and Yug are hospitalized. Devri donates blood to Naina but Kali would forgive him if he goes to jail. But Devri escaped and forms another plan to kill Naina. Jamuna soon finds out about this and warns Kali. Kali decides to kill Devri. Raj Purohit later finds out that only Kali and Nandu can kill Devri. Nandu does not want to kill his brother Devri. Kali decides to kill Devri with the help of Yug and she was successful. But Devri is still alive and attempted to drown Kali but is saved by Nandu who kills his own brother Devri.\n\n'''After 8 months'''\n\nKali is now pregnant with Nandu's child and Naina is shown to be 8 months old and causing trouble for Kali, Yug and Gauri. Naina runs to a forest and Kali finds her there. while she was there, she gives birth to Nandu's child and names her Pavitra. A nearby tantrik reveals that Pavitra would not be able to live for no longer than seven years.\n\n'''5 years later'''\n\nNandu had died when he killed Devri. Yug decides to adopt Pavitra. Gauri gets jealous to Kaali because she think that Kaali was take her life. Gauri becomes angry after knowing that Kaali and Yug get closer again. She then burned the house. Everybody is dead but Kaali is trapped in her room. Naina and Pavitra was saved and they ran away from the house. Gauri chases them and wants to kill Pavitra. But fuel tank of her car was leaked and her car was exploded, Gauri dead. In the next day, Chulbuli comes home and is shocked to see the house was burned. Naina and Pavitra go back home and meet Chulbuli. They feel sad when everybody found dead. But Kaali still trapped in her room. They search Kaali and the found her, they take Kaali to hospital. Suddenly, Kaali wake up and hug Naina and Pavitra. Raj Purohit come to hospital and ask forgiveness to Kaali. Raj Purohit confess that myth about kaala teeka of Gauri is just a hoax. He made up the story about kaala teeka because he was treated by Vishwaveer. Kaali forgives him and make him promise to not tell about superstition anymore. Kaali want Chulbuli to take care of her daughter. Kaali closed her eyes and dies. A few days later, Jamuna come home and wants to take Pavitra to stay with her. Naina, Chulbuli and Pavitra herself didn't let her to take Pavitra. Chulbuli says to Raj Purohit to bring Naina and Pavitra to Neel and Sharmila in the city to avoid Jamuna. But before that happen, Jamuna comes and takes Pavitra away. Moving to Bhimpur, the bus in which they were traveling meets with an accident and Jamuna dies. Pavitra faints, falls into the river, and she floats away to another village. Maai finds her and says that she will take care of her.\n\n'''14 years later'''\n\nNaina ([[Sukirti Kandpal]]), Gauri and Yug's daughter, lives in [[Mumbai]] while Pavitra (also [[Simran Pareenja]]), Kaali and Nandu's daughter, lives in Bhimpur village. Pavitra just looks like her mother Kaali. Naina goes to college and on every holiday she goes to several villages in search of Pavitra. This time she went to Bhimpur. In Bhimpur, she stays at a girl's house called Barki, which she helped during a bus accident. Naina doesn't know that the girl in whose house she is staying is Pavitra's house. In Bhimpur, there is a ride called \"Ganga Darpan\" in which innocent girls are decked up as brides and are send to the other village, in order to do prostitution. But the villagers are not aware of this. They think that the girls are being send to an Ashram for being Sanyasi's all their lives. This all is a big sex scandal. In all of this, Thakur Dev Sinha ([[Parag Tyagi]]), the Thakur of the village and the Mahant was involved. However, Naina tried to exposed Thakur Dev and the Mahant in front of the villagers, but nobody listened to her and she was sent back to Mumbai. But Naina didn't gave up and went back to Bhimpur, this time with Chulbuli and Dimpy. There Naina meet Krishna Sinha ([[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]]), the son of Thakur Dev Sinha. There was a glimpse of love at first sight. With the help of Krishna and Barki, Naina created a plan to expose the Thakur. The 45th time Barki was chosen for the \"Ganga Darpan\" and Naina wanted to stop this and she succeeds, but Thakur Dev Sinha accused Mahant and he was sent to jail instead of both of them. Then all the girls returned to their parents. However, Thakur Dev tried to kill Naina and Krishna, but couldn't succeed. One day Mai (also Barki's mother) wanted to remove all the proof of Pavitra's existence, but could't do it because Barki got to know that she is Pavitra. Naina saves Barki and they got back to the village. Thakur Dev didn't stop his cunning and slimy tricks. He harms Naina and marries her, cheating Krishna who was about to marry Naina, in order to rape Naina, because she exposed him. Naina losts her memory. Pavitra marries Krishna to enter Thakur Dev's mansion in order to save Naina. Thakur Dev kidnaps Dimpy, Chulbuli and Chutki. When the others got to know that the three were kidnapped, they started to haunt and taunt thakur so that he tells that where Chulbuli, Chutki and Dimpy are. When Thakur Dev was fed up and had enough, he tried to kill Krishna, Naina, Pavitra and Mai. But they didn't died. They returned in Thakur Dev's life to make him pay for his sins, but they didn't succeed in their plans. Thakur Dev now tried to create a rift between Naina and Pavitra, but Pavitra promised that she will make everything right, how it was before. Chulbuli, Dimpy and Chutki managed to escape from the goons den and went to the mansion. Meanwhile, Naina regains her memory. She accuses and abuses Pavitra for marrying Krishna. Now she wants to avenge Pavitra by taking her back to Mumbai, but Thakur didn't want to let go off Naina, because his revenge isn't complete yet. He want to have sex with Naina. He said that Naina and Pavitra only can leave this village if they unmarry back (Krishna with Pavitra and Naina with Thakur Dev). But the opposite happens. Pavitra goes in the room of Thakur Dev to save Naina, but then Krishna arrives in the room of Thakur Dev. After that Thakur Dev beats Krishna up, for stopping him. Meanwhile, the Mahant arrives with the villagers and The Thakurayan to expose Thakur Dev in front of the villagers. Thakurayan succeeds in her plans and the Thakur gets arrested. Now Naina is all set to go to Mumbai, but Pavitra is sad. Pavitra gets married to Krishna in full tradition. Krishna is now the Thakur of the village and Pavitra, the thakurayan. On their home way to Mumbai, Naina's car meets with an accident, because Purohitji told them that if Pavitra and Naina doesn't live together, they won't remain happy in life, because of their half-swastik tattoo on their arms. Naina regains consciousness, and they both go home. From that day, they swore that they will never ever support and believe in superstition, and if they ever see an activity of superstition, they will take action. The story ends with Pavitra and Naina doing an aatma/shanti pooja for Kaali, promising that they will love and help each other and other people in life.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n====Before leap====\n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Kaali Jha, Vishwa and Manjiri's adopted daughter, Yug's ex wife, Nandu's wife, Pavitra's mother, Gauri and Neel's half-sister (2016-17)\n* [[Fenil Umrigar]] as Gauri Jha, Vishwa and Madhuri's daughter, Yug's second wife, Kaali's adoptive half-sister, Naina's mother (2016-17)\n* [[Rohan Gandotra]] as Yug Chaudhary, Kaali's ex-husband, Gauri's husband, Naina's father (2016-17) \n* [[Mayank Gandhi]] as Nandu Singh, Kaali's second husband, Pavitra's father (2016-17)\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor)|Bhupinder Singh]] as Acharya Jha, Gauri and Neel's father, Kaali's adoptive father, Manjiri and Madhuri's husband (2015-16)\n\n====After leap====   \n* [[Sukirti Kandpal]] as Naina Chaudhary, Gauri and Yug's daughter, Dev's ex-fianc\u00e9e (2017) \n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Thakurain Pavitra, Kaali and Nandu's daughter, Krishna's wife (2017)\n* [[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]] as Thakur Krishna Sinha, Dev's son, Naina's love interest, Pavitra's husband (2017)\n* [[Parag Tyagi]] as Thakur Dev Sinha, Krishna's father, Naina's ex-fianc\u00e9 (2017)\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Pratima Kazmi]] as Maai, Pavitra's caretaker (2017) \n* [[Ashita Dhawan]] as Chulbuli (2017) \n* [[Dalljiet Kaur|Daljeet Kaur Bhanot]] as Manjiri Jha, Vishwa's first wife, Kaali's adoptive mother, Gauri and Neel's step-mother (2015-16; 2016-17)\n* [[Rajesh Puri]] as Raj Purohit (2016-17)\n* Hifsa Sharma as Dimpy (2017)\n* [[Nivin Ramani]] as Neelkanth Jha, Vishwa-Madhuri's son, Gauri's brother, Kaali's adoptive half-brother, Sharmila's husband (2016-17)\n* Meenu Panchal as Sharmila Chaudhary, Yug's sister, Neel's wife (2016-17)\n* [[Vineet Raina]] as Devri Singh, Nandu's brother (2016-17) \n* Geeta Agarwal as Leelavati Chaudhary, Yug and Sharmila's mother (2016-17) \n* [[Mita Vashisht]] as Jethi Maa (2016)\n* Akshara Singh as Madhuri Jha, Vishwa's second wife, Gauri and Neel's mother, Kaali's adoptive step-mother (2015-17)\n* [[Mona Ambegaonkar]] as Kalyani Jha, Vishwa's sister-in-law, Gauri and Neel's aunt, Kaali's adoptive aunt (2015-17) \n* Shriyansh Tiwari as Heera (2015) \n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Shambhu (2015) \n* Surya Sharma as Aryan (2016)\n* Praveen Hingonia as Bablu (2015-16)\n* Pratichee Mishra as Jamuna (2016-17)\n* Adaa Narang as Young Gauri (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/Kaala-Teeka-Know-all-about-the-show/updates/49672251.cms|title=Kaala Teeka|work=The Times of India|accessdate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Sargam Khurana as young Kaali (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\" />\n* [[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Dancer in Temple, Special appearance in crossover episode with [[Sarojini - Ek Nayi Pehal|Sarojini]] (2016)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/kaala-teeka/0-6-126 Official website]\n\n{{Zee TV Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:Zee TV television series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:2015 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Indian television series endings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kaala Teeka\n| image                    = \n| caption                  = \n| show_name_2              = ''Kaala Teeka \u2013 Umeed Ka Naya Daur''\n| genre                    = [[Drama]] <br /> [[Romance (love)|Romance]]\n| creator                  = [[Bhavna Vyas]]\n| writer                   = [[Bhavna Vyas]], [[S.

Vishwaveer discovers that an abandoned baby girl is able to protect Gauri from a familial curse, and he adopts her, naming her Kaali and making her Gauri's \"kaala teeka\".\n\n'''After 5 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Sargam Khurana]]) continues protecting Gauri ([[Adaa Narang]]) in every way. Gauri, being Vishwaveer's only child, is brought up surrounded with comforts, while Vishwaveer doesn't treat Kaali very well. She is mistreated by Vishwaveer's sister-in-law Kalyani Jha ([[Mona Ambegaonkar]]). Vishwaveer's first wife, Manjiri Jha ([[Dalljiet Kaur]]), who doesn't have children, adores Kaali and brings her up as her own daughter.\n\nKalyani plots to kill Gauri to get revenge from Vishwaveer for an old matter. She kills Kaali first, so that she is unable to protect Gauri. However, Kaali survives, and relates the incident to Manjiri, who decides to make Kalyani pay.\n\nKaali and Manjiri confront Kalyani in a temple, where Kalyani ends up killing Manjiri by strangling her, and making it look like Kaali did it. When the family finds out, Vishwaveer decides to take the blame on himself and go to jail in Kaali's place, so that Kaali can stay with Gauri and continue to protect her. As a result, Vishwaveer goes to jail for 14 years.\n\n'''After 14 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Simran Pareenja]]) and Gauri ([[Fenil Umrigar]]) are grown up. Kaali is very intelligent and a good singer, but all credits are taken by Gauri. Kaali writes exams for her and sings for her. A guy named Yug Choudhary ([[Rohan Gandotra]]) hears Kaali's voice and is taken aback by her voice. He tries to search for her but is unable to find her. Everyone thinks that it is Gauri who sings and Yug also thinks the same, but he is not able to find Gauri. Vishwaveer, while searching for a suitable groom for Gauri, comes across Yug and resolves to get her married to him. Gauri initially refuses but Kaali convinces her, and Gauri eventually falls in love with Yug and agrees for marriage after testing him a couple of times. When Yug's grandmother rejects the proposal considering Vishwa to be a criminal, he brainwashes Gauri's brother Neelkanth \"Neel\" Jha ([[Nivin Ramani]]) into trying to rape Yug's sister Sharmila Choudhary ([[Meenu Panchal]]). Neel attempts to do so, but is held back by his conscience at the last minute. In order to save Sharmila's reputation, Yug's grandmother agrees to get Yug married to Gauri in exchange for Neel marrying Sharmila. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Manjiri is still alive and that she lost her memory 14 years ago and saved Yug's life, after which his father took her in as his sister. She is now living with Yug.\n\nAfter a while Kaali finds out that Manjiri is still alive and with the help of Yug, Kaali brings her memory back. Yug-Gauri and Neel-Sharmila are now scheduled to get married. Instead destiny wants to bring Yug and Kaali together who have fallen in love. Yug is actually Kaali's childhood Ramji.\n\nThe show goes on with Manjiri and Yug supporting Kali in each and every step to get back love of Vishwaveer and prove him superstitions are waste. Gauri's kundli's truth comes out and Kaali is forced to agree to be Gauri's Kaala Teeka again and goes to Yug's house. She gets anxious and encounters Vishwa and decides to leave. Manjiri and Kali get kidnapped by Kalyani, but Yug saves them. Kalyani is arrested and Manjiri goes back to Vishwa and demands Kali and Yug's alliance. Gauri drinks poison but she is saved and Vishwa realises that it was not Kali being kaala teeka that worked for Gauri but her prayers were the ones which truly worked. He fixes Yug and Kali's alliance to which Yug's mother Leelavita \"Leela\" Choudhary agrees only because of a hidden motto and she doesn't want Kali to be her daughter-in-law. Therefore, Leela and Gauri team up. Yug marries Kali but everyone get tricked as they assume it is Gauri who is marrying Yug. Yug doesn't trust Kali anymore and goes with Gauri. Yug starts to hate Kali.\n\nTime passes by and Yug finally finds out the truth behind Gauri and gets married to Kali once again. Gauri then plans to make Kali seem dead by injecting some type of medicine on her but that plan fails when her injection breaks. Instead, she puts the poison in the safety pin and hooks it on Kali's doli. Kali is pricked by the safety pin. While performing rituals and praying in the temple at Yug's house, Kali faints. They call the doctor but the doctor tells everyone that Kali is dead. Just then, Yug realizes that it could have been Gauri and goes to her hotel to drag her there. She fakes and does some drama of crying and says she will bring Kali back to life by burning kapur on her hand. She has already put chemical on her hand to make sure her palm doesn't burn. The poison wears off and Kali regains conscientious, leaving everyone believing Gauri. However Yug does not believe Gauri and sends her out of the house. Gauri vows for revenge. She comes back as a servant and starts to make Leela believe that an evil spirit is haunting her. She brings a fake astrologer and he tells that Yug should be 21 kilometers away from the house. Leela and Yug believe it and Yug leaves. Later with the help of the astrologer, Gauri makes it look like Kali has the evil spirit inside her and Leela decides to sacrifice Kali. Manjiri comes to Yug's house and discovers that there is a pooja going on and asks for Kali, who is locked in a room. Manjiri gets suspicious and follows the car leading to the ashram. She brings a real astrologer and the truth behind Gauri gets revealed to everyone. Kali, enraged, slaps Gauri for her deeds and Gauri later reveals to everyone that Leela did not want Kali to be her daughter in law and encouraged Gauri that Yug would be married to her. Yug gets distraught and leaves while Gauri and the fake astrologer get arrested. Gauri vows to destroy his whole family. After three months however, Gauri who is released from jail returns and reveals to everyone that she is pregnant with Yug's child. Because of this Yug allows her to stay until the child is born. Later, it is revealed that Kaali is also pregnant. This matter however, is only known by Gauri and Vishwa as they bribed the nurse to get her reports before she does. In order to make sure that Kaali and Yug stay apart Gauri plans to have Kali thrown out of the house which is eventually carried out by Yug himself, as he does so Vishwa then takes Kaali to the top of a cliff and reveals her pregnancy to her just as he is about to push her off. Vishwa pushes Kali off of the cliff but Kali hangs onto a branch. Vishwa throws rock at her and she falls. Afterwards, Kali's suicide note comes and everyone believes Kali to be dead. Leela asks Yug to marry Gauri and give the child a legitimate name. Yug agrees to marry Gauri. Meanwhile, Kali doesn't die and is saved by a mentally challenged man named Nandu Singh ([[Mayank Gandhi]]). Kali asks Nandu to take her to Choudhary House. Nandu takes her there but returns. There back in his village, some kids tease him as Kali's husband. Nandu becomes shy and later, Nandu marries Kali and then takes her to the hospital where he gets to know that Kali is in coma.\n\n'''7 months later'''\n\nYug is now turned as a puppet for Vishwaveer. Vishwaveer is the new landlord of Choudhary House. Nandu is seen taking care of Kali in the hospital. The nurses discuss that Kali has lost her child. Gauri and Yug travel to Veerpur. On there way Gauri gets labour pain and Yug takes her to the same hospital where Kali is admitted. Vishwaveer finds out that Kali is in the hospital. Meanwhile, Gauri delivers a baby girl and names it Naina. Naina gets kidnapped by Vishwa, after being told that baby is threat to his life and Kali finds out about Yug and Gauri and decides to commit suicide on the same river where Vishwa places Naina in a basket and floating away. Kali feels the basket and finds Naina in it and decides to live. She begins to raise Naina. Unknown to Kali is that Naina is Yug and Gauri's daughter, who are distraught after their baby went missing, and names it Naina. It is revealed that Vishwa attempted to kill Naina because of a superstition that says Naina is a threat to him. Manjiri later finds Kali at a temple and Kali reveals that she was once pregnant with Yug's child and Vishwa threw her off the cliff for the sake of Gauri. Manjiri vows revenge on Vishwa and brings Kali to Yug's house. Gauri does not like this and tries to kill her own daughter Naina. However it backfires. Meanwhile, Nandu finds out that Vishwa attempted to kill Kali and vows not to spare him. Fearing that the truth would come out, Vishwa gets rid of all the evidence he could find. He also find out that Kali's adopted daughter is actually Gauri and Yug's daughter Naina. Vishwa attempts to kill Kali and Naina but fails because of Nandu. Manjiri later finds out about this and scolds Vishwa and reveals her revenge against him. Kali and Naina disappeared once again and Manjiri threatens to kill Vishwa if he does not reveal where Kali and Naina are. It is later revealed that Kali had planned this to get the truth from Vishwa. Later, while Vishwa, along with his partner Raj Purohit ([[Rajesh Puri]]) conduct a Pooja, assuming that Kali is dead, Kali pretends to be a spirit to get Vishwa to say the truth. With the help of Nandu and Manjiri, Kali gets the truth out. Yug gets distraught by hearing this and a chandelier falls on Kali. While she is hospitalized Manjiri reveals the truth behind Vishwa and Gauri. Yug later gets Raj and Vishwa arrested but they escape. Naina gets kidnapped again but Kali and Manjiri finds her. Vishwa finds Kali and Manjiri and threatens to kill Kali and Naina. Before he could, Manjiri grabs a trishul and stabs Vishwa, killing him. After Vishwa's funeral, Yug asks Kali for forgiveness but Kali rejects saying that she is not a doll to play with. Nandu offers Kali to stay at his place but Yug threatens to kill Naina if Kali leaves. Kali stays but scolds Yug for being selfish and will only stay for Naina's sake. Leela declares Kali as Naina's official mother as Gauri is too dangerous for the number of sins she committed. At this time, a tantrik named Devri Singh ([[Vineet Raina]]) is introduced and reveals to be Nandu's brother. Kali and Manjiri get suspicious about Devri and ask a priest at an ashram and Raj Purohit, as he has no other option. Manjiri and Kali discover that Devri was Vishwa's Kaala Teeka. They also discovers Devri's true intentions to kill the baby Naina to gain evil powers. It is also revealed in Nandu's kundli that Nandu is Naina's Kaala Teeka. Discovering that Devri is a threat, Yug bans Devri from coming into the house while Devri plot to kill Naina is underway. Devri also decides to kill Kali because she is an obstacle that he has to overcome to kill Naina. But Manjiri and Nandu save them and Nandu and Kali get married for Naina's protection. This infuriates Yug and he decides to kill Nandu but is stopped by Gauri. Devri decides to kill his own brother Nandu in order to get Naina but Devri mistakenly stabs himself. Devri is rushed to the hospital. Yug later snatched Naina from Kali saying that she is no longer her mother. Yug meets with an accident and Naina and Yug are hospitalized. Devri donates blood to Naina but Kali would forgive him if he goes to jail. But Devri escaped and forms another plan to kill Naina. Jamuna soon finds out about this and warns Kali. Kali decides to kill Devri. Raj Purohit later finds out that only Kali and Nandu can kill Devri. Nandu does not want to kill his brother Devri. Kali decides to kill Devri with the help of Yug and she was successful. But Devri is still alive and attempted to drown Kali but is saved by Nandu who kills his own brother Devri.\n\n'''After 8 months'''\n\nKali is now pregnant with Nandu's child and Naina is shown to be 8 months old and causing trouble for Kali, Yug and Gauri. Naina runs to a forest and Kali finds her there. while she was there, she gives birth to Nandu's child and names her Pavitra. A nearby tantrik reveals that Pavitra would not be able to live for no longer than seven years.\n\n'''5 years later'''\n\nNandu had died when he killed Devri. Yug decides to adopt Pavitra. Gauri gets jealous to Kaali because she think that Kaali was take her life. Gauri becomes angry after knowing that Kaali and Yug get closer again. She then burned the house. Everybody is dead but Kaali is trapped in her room. Naina and Pavitra was saved and they ran away from the house. Gauri chases them and wants to kill Pavitra. But fuel tank of her car was leaked and her car was exploded, Gauri dead. In the next day, Chulbuli comes home and is shocked to see the house was burned.

Suddenly, Kaali wake up and hug Naina and Pavitra. Raj Purohit come to hospital and ask forgiveness to Kaali. Raj Purohit confess that myth about kaala teeka of Gauri is just a hoax. He made up the story about kaala teeka because he was treated by Vishwaveer. Kaali forgives him and make him promise to not tell about superstition anymore. Kaali want Chulbuli to take care of her daughter. Kaali closed her eyes and dies. A few days later, Jamuna come home and wants to take Pavitra to stay with her. Naina, Chulbuli and Pavitra herself didn't let her to take Pavitra. Chulbuli says to Raj Purohit to bring Naina and Pavitra to Neel and Sharmila in the city to avoid Jamuna. But before that happen, Jamuna comes and takes Pavitra away. Moving to Bhimpur, the bus in which they were traveling meets with an accident and Jamuna dies.

The 45th time Barki was chosen for the \"Ganga Darpan\" and Naina wanted to stop this and she succeeds, but Thakur Dev Sinha accused Mahant and he was sent to jail instead of both of them. Then all the girls returned to their parents. However, Thakur Dev tried to kill Naina and Krishna, but couldn't succeed. One day Mai (also Barki's mother) wanted to remove all the proof of Pavitra's existence, but could't do it because Barki got to know that she is Pavitra. Naina saves Barki and they got back to the village. Thakur Dev didn't stop his cunning and slimy tricks. He harms Naina and marries her, cheating Krishna who was about to get married to Naina, in order to rape Naina, because she exposed him. Naina losts her memory. Pavitra marries Krishna to enter Thakur Dev's mansion in order to save Naina. Thakur Dev kidnaps Dimpy, Chulbuli and Chutki. When the others got to know that the three were kidnapped, they started to haunt and taunt thakur so that he tells that where Chulbuli, Chutki and Dimpy are. When Thakur Dev was fed up and had enough, he tried to kill Krishna, Naina, Pavitra and Mai. But they didn't died. They returned in Thakur Dev's life to make him pay for his sins, but they didn't succeed in their plans. Thakur Dev now tried to create a rift between Naina and Pavitra, but Pavitra promised that she will make everything right, how it was before. Chulbuli, Dimpy and Chutki managed to escape from the goons den and went to the mansion. Meanwhile, Naina regains her memory. She accuses and abuses Pavitra for marrying Krishna. Now she wants to avenge Pavitra by taking her back to Mumbai, but Thakur didn't want to let go off Naina, because his revenge isn't complete yet. He want to have sex with Naina. He said that Naina and Pavitra only can leave this village if they unmarry back (Krishna with Pavitra and Naina with Thakur Dev). But the opposite happens. Pavitra goes in the room of Thakur Dev to save Naina, but then Krishna arrives in the room of Thakur Dev. After that Thakur Dev beats Krishna up, for stopping him. Meanwhile, the Mahant arrives with the villagers and The Thakurayan to expose Thakur Dev in front of the villagers. Thakurayan succeeds in her plans and the Thakur gets arrested. Now Naina is all set to go to Mumbai, but Pavitra is sad. Pavitra gets married to Krishna in full tradition. Krishna is now the Thakur of the village and Pavitra, the thakurayan. On their home way to Mumbai, Naina's car meets with an accident, because Purohitji told them that if Pavitra and Naina doesn't live together, they won't remain happy in life, because of their half-swastik tattoo on their arms. Naina regains consciousness, and they both go home. From that day, they swore that they will never ever support and believe in superstition, and if they ever see an activity of superstition, they will take action. The story ends with Pavitra and Naina doing an aatma/shanti pooja for Kaali, promising that they will love and help each other and other people in life.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n====Before leap====\n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Kaali Jha, Vishwa and Manjiri's adopted daughter, Yug's ex wife, Nandu's wife, Pavitra's mother, Gauri and Neel's half-sister (2016-17)\n* [[Fenil Umrigar]] as Gauri Jha, Vishwa and Madhuri's daughter, Yug's second wife, Kaali's adoptive half-sister, Naina's mother (2016-17)\n* [[Rohan Gandotra]] as Yug Chaudhary, Kaali's ex-husband, Gauri's husband, Naina's father (2016-17) \n* [[Mayank Gandhi]] as Nandu Singh, Kaali's second husband, Pavitra's father (2016-17)\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor)|Bhupinder Singh]] as Acharya Jha, Gauri and Neel's father, Kaali's adoptive father, Manjiri and Madhuri's husband (2015-16)\n\n====After leap====   \n* [[Sukirti Kandpal]] as Naina Chaudhary, Gauri and Yug's daughter, Dev's ex-fianc\u00e9e (2017) \n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Thakurain Pavitra, Kaali and Nandu's daughter, Krishna's wife (2017)\n* [[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]] as Thakur Krishna Sinha, Dev's son, Naina's love interest, Pavitra's husband (2017)\n* [[Parag Tyagi]] as Thakur Dev Sinha, Krishna's father, Naina's ex-fianc\u00e9 (2017)\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Pratima Kazmi]] as Maai, Pavitra's caretaker (2017) \n* [[Ashita Dhawan]] as Chulbuli (2017) \n* [[Dalljiet Kaur|Daljeet Kaur Bhanot]] as Manjiri Jha, Vishwa's first wife, Kaali's adoptive mother, Gauri and Neel's step-mother (2015-16; 2016-17)\n* [[Rajesh Puri]] as Raj Purohit (2016-17)\n* Hifsa Sharma as Dimpy (2017)\n* [[Nivin Ramani]] as Neelkanth Jha, Vishwa-Madhuri's son, Gauri's brother, Kaali's adoptive half-brother, Sharmila's husband (2016-17)\n* Meenu Panchal as Sharmila Chaudhary, Yug's sister, Neel's wife (2016-17)\n* [[Vineet Raina]] as Devri Singh, Nandu's brother (2016-17) \n* Geeta Agarwal as Leelavati Chaudhary, Yug and Sharmila's mother (2016-17) \n* [[Mita Vashisht]] as Jethi Maa (2016)\n* Akshara Singh as Madhuri Jha, Vishwa's second wife, Gauri and Neel's mother, Kaali's adoptive step-mother (2015-17)\n* [[Mona Ambegaonkar]] as Kalyani Jha, Vishwa's sister-in-law, Gauri and Neel's aunt, Kaali's adoptive aunt (2015-17) \n* Shriyansh Tiwari as Heera (2015) \n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Shambhu (2015) \n* Surya Sharma as Aryan (2016)\n* Praveen Hingonia as Bablu (2015-16)\n* Pratichee Mishra as Jamuna (2016-17)\n* Adaa Narang as Young Gauri (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/Kaala-Teeka-Know-all-about-the-show/updates/49672251.cms|title=Kaala Teeka|work=The Times of India|accessdate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Sargam Khurana as young Kaali (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\" />\n* [[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Dancer in Temple, Special appearance in crossover episode with [[Sarojini - Ek Nayi Pehal|Sarojini]] (2016)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/kaala-teeka/0-6-126 Official website]\n\n{{Zee TV Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:Zee TV television series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:2015 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Indian television series endings]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaala_Teeka"}

However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'', and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors [[economies of scale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|title=Paul Krugman, Nobel|author=Arvind Panagariya|date=October 13, 2008|work=Forbes|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107033738/https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of [[Volvo]]s all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.\n\n[[File:Distribution of Manufacturing between Two Regions.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graph illustrating Krugman's 'core-periphery' model.

So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of good, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033145/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== International finance ===\nKrugman has also been influential in the field of [[international finance]].

In ''Conscience'', Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.\n\nKrugman also argued that [[US Republican Party|Republicans]] owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South.<ref name=\"tomaskyconlibrev\">[[Michael Tomasky]], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 22, 2007, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20813 \"The Partisan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307063147/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20813 |date=March 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>Krugman, Paul.

In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published ''[[End This Depression Now!]]'', a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy \u2013 people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Krugman's Prescription For A 'Depression'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|work=NPR Books|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=May 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509153543/http://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|archive-date=May 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Commentator ==\n[[Martin Wolf]] has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|title= Lunch with the FT: Paul Krugman|newspaper= Financial Times|author= Martin Wolf|date= May 24, 2012|accessdate= 2012-05-29|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120528173702/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date= May 28, 2012|url-status= live|author-link= Martin Wolf}}</ref>\nEconomist [[J.

However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'', and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors [[economies of scale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|title=Paul Krugman, Nobel|author=Arvind Panagariya|date=October 13, 2008|work=Forbes|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107033738/https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of [[Volvo]]s all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one).

So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of good, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033145/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== International finance ===\nKrugman has also been influential in the field of [[international finance]].

In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published ''[[End This Depression Now!]]'', a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy \u2013 people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Krugman's Prescription For A 'Depression'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|work=NPR Books|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=May 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509153543/http://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|archive-date=May 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Commentator ==\n[[Martin Wolf]] has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|title= Lunch with the FT: Paul Krugman|newspaper= Financial Times|author= Martin Wolf|date= May 24, 2012|accessdate= 2012-05-29|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120528173702/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date= May 28, 2012|url-status= live|author-link= Martin Wolf}}</ref>\nEconomist [[J.

It one of the oldest and most elaborate [[passion play]]s in [[Mexico]] as well as the best known, covered by media both in Mexico and abroad. Unlike others in [[Latin America]], its origins are not in the colonial period but rather in a [[cholera]] epidemic in the 19th century, which gave rise to a procession to petition relief.

As a petition to ease the pestilence, the area began a procession to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de la Cuevita\u201d( Lord of the Small Cave), an image of Christ entering [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey which is found in a small natural cave in the community of [[Pueblo Culhuac\u00e1n]] .<ref name=zedillo/><ref name=cnnmex>{{cite news |title= Semana Santa en Iztapalapa, patrimonio intangible de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico   |url= http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2012/04/03/semana-santa-en-iztapalapa-patrimonio-intangible-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico |newspaper=CNN M\u00e9xico |location=Mexico City |date=April 3, 2012  |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Holy Week in Iztapalapa, intangible heritage of Mexico City }}</ref> When the epidemic ended it was seen as a miracle and it became a permanent annual event. Soon after, the procession included a reenactment of the crucifixion on Good Friday and over time, the passion play grew to cover almost all of the events associated with Holy Week.<ref name=once/> Although its origins are in the 19th century, there is evidence of syncretism with indigenous traditions. The procession changed from the image in the cave to Cerro de la Estrella in 1920, after a heavy rain inundated the original site. This site was that of the Pyramid of Mixcoatl, associated with the [[New Fire ceremony]]. Aztec drums and flutes appear in the event as well.<ref name=zedillo/>\n\nCatholic authorities have alternatively banned and approved the event since its inception. There is a letter dated 1867 asking [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] for help in its preservation against hostile church authorities. During the [[Mexican Revolution]], the event was suspended due to clashes between governmental and church authorities. However a legend states that [[Emiliano Zapata]] lent his horses and ordered the renewal of the event in 1914.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=zedillo/><ref name=draw100s/> Church criticisms of the play have included that it deviates too much from the Biblical account, and it does have elements of other stories such as Dante\u2019s [[Divine Comedy]]. Examples of deviation include King Herod\u2019s [[harem]] which performs a sensual [[belly dance]]. However, the play has survived not only church prosecution but also governmental opposition to public displays of religion and Iztapalapa\u2019s demographic change from indigenous to mestizo.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=lrohter/>\n\nThe popularity of the performance began to significant increase after [[World War II]], attracting tourists first from within Mexico then from abroad.

As a petition to ease the pestilence, the area began a procession to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de la Cuevita\u201d( Lord of the Small Cave), an image of Christ entering [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey which is found in a small natural cave in the community of [[Pueblo Culhuac\u00e1n]] .<ref name=zedillo/><ref name=cnnmex>{{cite news |title= Semana Santa en Iztapalapa, patrimonio intangible de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico   |url= http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2012/04/03/semana-santa-en-iztapalapa-patrimonio-intangible-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico |newspaper=CNN M\u00e9xico |location=Mexico City |date=April 3, 2012  |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Holy Week in Iztapalapa, intangible heritage of Mexico City }}</ref> When the epidemic ended it was seen as a miracle and it became a permanent annual event. Soon after, the procession included a reenactment of the crucifixion on Good Friday and over time, the passion play grew to cover almost all of the events associated with Holy Week.<ref name=once/> Although its origins are in the 19th century, there is evidence of syncretism with indigenous traditions. The procession changed from the image in the cave to Cerro de la Estrella in 1920, after a heavy rain inundated the original site. This site was that of the Pyramid of Mixcoatl, associated with the [[New Fire ceremony]]. Aztec drums and flutes appear in the event as well.<ref name=zedillo/>\n\nCatholic authorities have alternatively banned and approved the event since its inception. There is a letter dated 1867 asking [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] for help in its preservation against hostile church authorities. During the [[Mexican Revolution]], the event was suspended due to clashes between governmental and church authorities. However a legend states that [[Emiliano Zapata]] lent his horses and ordered the renewal of the event in 1914.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=zedillo/><ref name=draw100s/> Church criticisms of the play have included that it deviates too much from the Biblical account, and it does have elements of other stories such as Dante\u2019s [[Divine Comedy]]. Examples of deviation include King Herod\u2019s [[harem]] which performs a sensual [[belly dance]]. However, the play has survived not only church prosecution but also governmental opposition to public displays of religion and Iztapalapa\u2019s demographic change from indigenous to mestizo.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=lrohter/>\n\nThe popularity of the performance began to significant increase after [[World War II]], attracting tourists first from within Mexico then from abroad. This popularity increased in the 1960s, when [[Vatican II]] legitimated passion reenactments.<ref name=trexler/> It has become the most famous passion play in Mexico.<ref name=cnnmex/> Television coverage of the event began in the 1980s, and since is regularly broadcast to the Spanish speaking world, as well as covered by media in the United States and Europe.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=hcorzo/> While it remains first and foremost a religious event, it has also become a rite of local identity and has brought attention to the poverty of the borough.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=lrohter/> A documentary about the event called Iztapalapa, memoria y tradici\u00f3n was directed by Francisco Alatriste Torres of the Escuela Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia.<ref name=msuarez>{{cite news |title= Proyectar\u00e1n documental sobre la Semana Santa en Iztapalapa |author= Mariana Su\u00e1rez |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2012/05/29/capital/037n3cap |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=May 29, 2012 |page=37 |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Documentary Project about Holy Week in Iztapalapa }}</ref> The city government has declared the event to be an intangible cultural heritage of Mexico City, as part of an effort to gaining similar recognition from [[UNESCO]] .<ref name=patrimonio/> The increased tourism, as well as \u201ccompetition\u201d and influence from other passion plays have had an effect.

It was released on April 17, 1995 as a [[promotional single]] from the album.  The song received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] in 1996.\n\nIn 2002, [[Johnny Cash]] covered \"Hurt\" to commercial and critical acclaim; it was one of Cash's final hits released before his death, and the related music video is considered one of the greatest of all time by publications such as ''[[NME]]''. Reznor praised Cash's interpretation of the song for its \"sincerity and meaning\", going as far as to say \"that song isn't mine anymore.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Geoff |last=Rickly |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171015203101/http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |title=Geoff Rickly Interviews Trent Reznor |magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine) |Alternative Press]] |location= Cleveland, [[Ohio | OH]] |date=June 26, 2004 |accessdate=August 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Meaning==\nThe song includes references to [[self-harm]] and [[Drug abuse|heroin addiction]], although the overall meaning of the song is disputed. Some listeners contend that the song acts as a [[suicide note]] written by the song's [[protagonist]], as a result of his [[clinical depression|depression]], while others claim that it describes the difficult process of finding a reason to live in spite of depression and pain and does not have much to do with the storyline of ''The Downward Spiral''.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 104</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for Nine Inch Nails' original version of \"Hurt\" is a live performance that was recorded before the show in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on February 13, 1995, and can be found on ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'' and the [[DualDisc]] re-release of ''[[The Downward Spiral#DVD side|The Downward Spiral]]''. The audio portion appears on the UK version of ''[[Further Down the Spiral#UK version|Further Down the Spiral]]''.\nThe version released on ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'' differs slightly from the video originally aired on MTV.  In addition to using an uncensored audio track, the ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'' edit shows alternate views of the audience and performance at several points during the video.\n\nTo film the video, a [[Scrim (material)|scrim]] was dropped in front of the band on stage, onto which various images, such as [[war crime|war atrocities]], a [[nuclear bomb]] test, survivors of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], a snake staring at the camera, and a [[time-lapse]] film of a fox decomposing in reverse, were projected, adding visual symbolism to fit the song's subject matter. A spotlight was cast on Reznor so that he can be seen through the images. Compared to the live renditions performed on future tours, this version most resembles the studio recording with its use of the song's original [[Sampling (music)|samples]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThere are also official live recordings on the later releases ''[[And All that Could Have Been]]'' and ''[[Beside You in Time]]''. Each version features distinct instrumentation by the varying members of the band in the respective eras.\n\n==Live performances==\nDuring the ''[[Outside Tour|Dissonance]]'' tour in 1995, when Nine Inch Nails opened for [[David Bowie]], Bowie sang \"Hurt\" in a duet with Reznor, backed by an original melody and beat. This served as the conclusion to the dual act that began each Bowie set.\n\nDuring the ''Fragility'' tours, the progression was performed by [[Robin Finck]] on [[acoustic guitar]] rather than on piano.\n\nSince the 2005\u201306 ''Live: With Teeth'' tour, Nine Inch Nails has been playing \"Hurt\" in a more toned-down style, featuring only Reznor on keyboard and vocals until the final chorus, when the rest of the band joins in.\n\nThe song was brought back to its original form during the ''Lights In The Sky'' tour in 2008, before returning to the toned down style on the 2009 ''Wave Goodbye'' tour.\n\n==Track listing==\n*'''US promotional CD single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=\"Hurt\" |type=US promotional CD single |others=[[Nine Inch Nails]] |publisher=[[Interscope Records]] |year=1995 |id=PRCD 6179}}</ref>\n#\"Hurt\" (quiet version) {{small|(clean)}} \u2013 5:04\n#\"Hurt\" (live version) {{small|(clean)}} \u2013 5:15\n#\"Hurt\" (album version) {{small|(clean)}} \u2013 6:16\n#\"Hurt\" (quiet version) {{small|(soiled)}} \u2013 5:21\n#\"Hurt\" (live version) {{small|(soiled)}} \u2013 5:15\n#\"Hurt\" (album version) {{small|(soiled)}} \u2013 6:13\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Trent Reznor]] \u2013 [[lead vocalist|vocals]], [[guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[piano]], [[synthesizer]]s\n* [[Chris Vrenna]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Canadarock|8|chartid=9238|rowheader=true|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardradiosongs|54|artist=Nine Inch Nails|rowheader=true|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardalternativesongs|8|artist=Nine Inch Nails|rowheader=true|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}\n|}\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The song was featured in the season two finale of the adult animated science fiction program [[Rick and Morty]], overlaying the series of events in which Rick surrenders to the intergalactic authorities, allowing his family to return to earth while simultaneously abandoning them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sinacola |first=Dom |date=2015-12-17 |title=I Will Make You Hurt: Grief in Rick and Morty, The Leftovers and Heart of a Dog |URL=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/12/i-will-make-you-hurt-grief-in-rick-and-morty-the-l.html |work=Paste Magazine |access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Johnny Cash version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Hurt\n| cover      = Johnny_Cash_-_Personal_Jesus_and_Hurt_single.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Johnny Cash]]\n| album      = [[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]\n| B-side     = {{hlist|\"[[Personal Jesus]]\"|\"[[Wichita Lineman]]\"}}\n| released   = March 2003\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   = 2002\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Alternative rock]]<ref>[http://ajournalofmusicalthings.com/top-ten-most-depressing-alternative-rock-songs/ Top Ten Most Depressing Alternative Rock Songs] Retrieved January 5, 2015</ref>|{{nowrap|[[acoustic rock]]<ref>[http://www.planetrock.com/music/backstage/the-rock-lists/the-best-ever-acoustic-rock-song-the-top-40/ The Best Ever Acoustic Rock Songs: Top 40] Retrieved October 20, 2014</ref>}}|[[country music|country]]<ref>[http://www.ew.com/article/2008/04/07/johnny-cash-hur Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' still the greatest country video]<br>[[Entertainment Weekly]]<br>Retrieved August 9, 2016</ref>|{{nowrap|[[Southern gothic#Music|Southern gothic]]<ref>\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=pfkKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=The+Man+Comes+Around+Southern+Gothic&source=bl&ots=890sdtyIMr&sig=SMudFaKrpxbvT5bNt5vt1O6pXoc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjroOWh8DdAhUhnuAKHeDuALk4ChDoATACegQIBxAB#v=onepage&q=The%20Man%20Comes%20Around%20Southern%20Gothic&f=false Walking the Line: Country Music Lyricists and American Culture] Retrieved September 16, 2018</ref>}}\n}}\n| length     = 3:38\n| label      = {{hlist|[[American Recordings (record label)|American]]|[[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]}}\n| writer     = [[Trent Reznor]]\n| producer   = [[Rick Rubin]]\n| prev_title = [[The Man Comes Around (song)|The Man Comes Around]]\n| prev_year  = 2002\n| next_title = [[God's Gonna Cut You Down]]\n| next_year  = 2006\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{YouTube|8AHCfZTRGiI|\"Hurt\"}}}}\n}}\n\nIn 2002, [[Johnny Cash]] covered the song for his album, ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]''.

It was released on April 17, 1995 as a [[promotional single]] from the album.  The song received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] in 1996.\n\nIn 2002, [[Johnny Cash]] covered \"Hurt\" to commercial and critical acclaim; it was one of Cash's final hits released before his death, and the related music video is considered one of the greatest of all time by publications such as ''[[NME]]''. Reznor praised Cash's interpretation of the song for its \"sincerity and meaning\", going as far as to say \"that song isn't mine anymore.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Geoff |last=Rickly |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171015203101/http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |title=Geoff Rickly Interviews Trent Reznor |magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine) |Alternative Press]] |location= Cleveland, [[Ohio | OH]] |date=June 26, 2004 |accessdate=August 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Meaning==\nThe song includes references to [[self-harm]] and [[Drug abuse|heroin addiction]], although the overall meaning of the song is disputed. Some listeners contend that the song acts as a [[suicide note]] written by the song's [[protagonist]], as a result of his [[clinical depression|depression]], while others claim that it describes the difficult process of finding a reason to live in spite of depression and pain and does not have much to do with the storyline of ''The Downward Spiral''.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 104</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for Nine Inch Nails' original version of \"Hurt\" is a live performance that was recorded before the show in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on February 13, 1995, and can be found on ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'' and the [[DualDisc]] re-release of ''[[The Downward Spiral#DVD side|The Downward Spiral]]''. The audio portion appears on the UK version of ''[[Further Down the Spiral#UK version|Further Down the Spiral]]''.\nThe version released on ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'' differs slightly from the video originally aired on MTV.  In addition to using an uncensored audio track, the ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'' edit shows alternate views of the audience and performance at several points during the video.\n\nTo film the video, a [[Scrim (material)|scrim]] was dropped in front of the band on stage, onto which various images, such as [[war crime|war atrocities]], a [[nuclear bomb]] test, survivors of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], a snake staring at the camera, and a [[time-lapse]] film of a fox decomposing in reverse, were projected, adding visual symbolism to fit the song's subject matter. A spotlight was cast on Reznor so that he can be seen through the images. Compared to the live renditions performed on future tours, this version most resembles the studio recording with its use of the song's original [[Sampling (music)|samples]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThere are also official live recordings on the later releases ''[[And All that Could Have Been]]'' and ''[[Beside You in Time]]''. Each version features distinct instrumentation by the varying members of the band in the respective eras.\n\n==Live performances==\nDuring the ''[[Outside Tour|Dissonance]]'' tour in 1995, when Nine Inch Nails opened for [[David Bowie]], Bowie sang \"Hurt\" in a duet with Reznor, backed by an original melody and beat. This served as the conclusion to the dual act that began each Bowie set.\n\nDuring the ''Fragility'' tours, the progression was performed by [[Robin Finck]] on [[acoustic guitar]] rather than on piano.\n\nSince the 2005\u201306 ''Live: With Teeth'' tour, Nine Inch Nails has been playing \"Hurt\" in a more toned-down style, featuring only Reznor on keyboard and vocals until the final chorus, when the rest of the band joins in.\n\nThe song was brought back to its original form during the ''Lights In The Sky'' tour in 2008, before returning to the toned down style on the 2009 ''Wave Goodbye'' tour.\n\n==Track listing==\n*'''US promotional CD single'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=\"Hurt\" |type=US promotional CD single |others=[[Nine Inch Nails]] |publisher=[[Interscope Records]] |year=1995 |id=PRCD 6179}}</ref>\n#\"Hurt\" (quiet version) {{small|(clean)}} \u2013 5:04\n#\"Hurt\" (live version) {{small|(clean)}} \u2013 5:15\n#\"Hurt\" (album version) {{small|(clean)}} \u2013 6:16\n#\"Hurt\" (quiet version) {{small|(soiled)}} \u2013 5:21\n#\"Hurt\" (live version) {{small|(soiled)}} \u2013 5:15\n#\"Hurt\" (album version) {{small|(soiled)}} \u2013 6:13\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Trent Reznor]] \u2013 [[lead vocalist|vocals]], [[guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[piano]], [[synthesizer]]s\n* [[Chris Vrenna]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Canadarock|8|chartid=9238|rowheader=true|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardradiosongs|54|artist=Nine Inch Nails|rowheader=true|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardalternativesongs|8|artist=Nine Inch Nails|rowheader=true|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}\n|}\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The song was featured in the season two finale of the adult animated science fiction program [[Rick and Morty]], overlaying the series of events in which Rick surrenders to the intergalactic authorities, allowing his family to return to earth while simultaneously abandoning them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sinacola |first=Dom |date=2015-12-17 |title=I Will Make You Hurt: Grief in Rick and Morty, The Leftovers and Heart of a Dog |URL=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/12/i-will-make-you-hurt-grief-in-rick-and-morty-the-l.html |work=Paste Magazine |access-date=2020-03-03</ref>\n\n==Johnny Cash version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Hurt\n| cover      = Johnny_Cash_-_Personal_Jesus_and_Hurt_single.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Johnny Cash]]\n| album      = [[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]\n| B-side     = {{hlist|\"[[Personal Jesus]]\"|\"[[Wichita Lineman]]\"}}\n| released   = March 2003\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   = 2002\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Alternative rock]]<ref>[http://ajournalofmusicalthings.com/top-ten-most-depressing-alternative-rock-songs/ Top Ten Most Depressing Alternative Rock Songs] Retrieved January 5, 2015</ref>|{{nowrap|[[acoustic rock]]<ref>[http://www.planetrock.com/music/backstage/the-rock-lists/the-best-ever-acoustic-rock-song-the-top-40/ The Best Ever Acoustic Rock Songs: Top 40] Retrieved October 20, 2014</ref>}}|[[country music|country]]<ref>[http://www.ew.com/article/2008/04/07/johnny-cash-hur Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' still the greatest country video]<br>[[Entertainment Weekly]]<br>Retrieved August 9, 2016</ref>|{{nowrap|[[Southern gothic#Music|Southern gothic]]<ref>\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=pfkKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=The+Man+Comes+Around+Southern+Gothic&source=bl&ots=890sdtyIMr&sig=SMudFaKrpxbvT5bNt5vt1O6pXoc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjroOWh8DdAhUhnuAKHeDuALk4ChDoATACegQIBxAB#v=onepage&q=The%20Man%20Comes%20Around%20Southern%20Gothic&f=false Walking the Line: Country Music Lyricists and American Culture] Retrieved September 16, 2018</ref>}}\n}}\n| length     = 3:38\n| label      = {{hlist|[[American Recordings (record label)|American]]|[[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]}}\n| writer     = [[Trent Reznor]]\n| producer   = [[Rick Rubin]]\n| prev_title = [[The Man Comes Around (song)|The Man Comes Around]]\n| prev_year  = 2002\n| next_title = [[God's Gonna Cut You Down]]\n| next_year  = 2006\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{YouTube|8AHCfZTRGiI|\"Hurt\"}}}}\n}}\n\nIn 2002, [[Johnny Cash]] covered the song for his album, ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]''.

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form since 1999.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Otterson|first=Joe|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|twenty-first season]] (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season premiered on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref> On April 12, 2020, ABC renewed Millionaire for a twenty-second season with a premiere date yet to be announced.

The questions are of increasing difficulty,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millionairetv.com/rules.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020705162039/http://www.millionairetv.com/rules.html|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Syndicated Version original rules|date=June 28, 2002|publisher=Valleycrest Productions, Ltd. and Buena Vista Television|archivedate=July 5, 2002}}</ref> except in the 2010\u201315 format overhaul, where the contestants were faced with a round of ten questions of random difficulty, followed by a round of four questions of increasing difficulty.<ref name=\"millionairetv\">{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules-season-13/ |title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Official Rules (Season 13) |publisher=dadt.com |accessdate=July 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222225725/http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/ |archivedate=December 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Each question is worth a specified amount of money; the amounts are cumulative in the first round, but not in the second. If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/> With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if they answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite press release|url= https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/syndicated-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-premieres-new-season-september-13/|title=Syndicated ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Premieres New Season September 13|author= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Format history ===\n==== Original format (1999\u20132008; since 2020) ====\nFrom 1999 to 2002, 10 contestants played a round of Fastest Finger to determine who would play in the hot seat. The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows, in which it was removed again in the 2020 reboot. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008. In the 2020 reboot, a new lifeline was added called \"Ask The Host\", in which the host, Jimmy Kimmel, gives the player the best possible answer and some advice.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135 '''($500-$5,000):''' 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310 '''($7,500-$25,000):''' 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314 '''($50,000-$500,000):''' 45 seconds\n* Question 15 '''($1,000,000 question):''' 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe timer began to run as soon as the four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories. Beginning in 2017, a contestant who missed any of the first five questions left with $1,000, even if the missed question was of a lower value.\n\n===Payout structure===\nFive different ladders have been used over the course of the series:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"|Question<br>number\n!colspan=\"5\"|Question value\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%\"|1999\u20132004, 2020\u2013\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2004\u201309\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2009\u201310\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2010\u201315<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\"/>\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2015\u201319\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100\n|$500\n| rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>Random values</small><br>$100, $500, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $25,000\n|$500\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$200\n|$1,000\n|$1,000\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$300\n|$2,000\n|$2,000\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500\n|$3,000\n|$3,000\n|-\n|5\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$2,000\n|$7,500\n|$7,000\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4,000\n|$10,000\n|$10,000\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$8,000\n|$12,500\n|$20,000\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$16,000\n|$15,000\n|$30,000\n|-\n|10\n|'''$32,000'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$25,000'''\n|'''$50,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|$64,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$50,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n|-\n|12\n|$125,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n|-\n|13\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n|-\n|14\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|-\n|15\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|  colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c9cac8;\"|\n|}\n\nThe $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were initially lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication.

Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019; 2020): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AIM (software)|AIM]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call via [[Skype]], and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play. It could be used twice per game from 2010\u20132014, but only once from 2014\u20132015.\n*'''Phone a Friend''' (1999\u20132010; 2020): The contestant called a pre-arranged friend (via [[AT&T]] in ABC airings, except for ''Super Millionaire'' airings, until 2009) and was then given 30 seconds to discuss the question with that person. In 2010, this lifeline was eliminated due to an increasing use of search engines by home viewers to look up answers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Matt |title=How Google Killed \"Phone A Friend\" From \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-killed-phone-a-friend-52624 |website=Search Engine Land |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Switch/Cut the Question''' (2004\u20132008): Earned after answering 10 questions, this lifeline allowed a contestant to discard the current question and replace it with one of the same value. It has been used occasionally during Whiz Kids Week in the current version and is available from the outset.\n*'''Three Wise Men''' (2004): Used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed the contestant 30 seconds of advice from a panel of three experts, who were sequestered backstage and saw the question only when their help was requested.\n*'''Ask the Host''' (2020): Introduced during the 2020 season, this lifeline allows the contestant to ask for the host's advice on the current question and give the best possible answer.\n* The 2020 season features a lifeline similar to +1. This lifeline is offered to the contestant after the tenth question and allows them to consult with their accompanying supporter one time during the final five questions. However, in order to obtain this lifeline, the contestant must exchange one of his or her other remaining lifelines. (The contestant has unlimited access to their supporter for the first ten questions.)\n\n===Top prize winners===\nOver the course of the program's history, twelve people answered the final question correctly and walked away with the top prize:  \n*[[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]] \u2013 Became the first winner of the top prize on November 19, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taxman scoops a million|work=BBC News|date=November 21, 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/529186.stm|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=PeopleMillionaires>{{cite magazine |url=http://people.com/archive/millionaire-makeovers-vol-54-no-20/|title=Millionaire Makeovers!|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|volume=54 |number=20|date=November 13, 2000|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref>\n*Dan Blonsky \u2013 Won on January 18, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Joe Trela \u2013 Won on  March 23, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Bob House \u2013 Won on June 13, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kim Hunt \u2013 Won on July 6, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*David Goodman \u2013 Won on July 11, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kevin Olmstead \u2013 Won the top prize on April 10, 2001; however, because of the jackpot having been set to increase by $10,000 each episode, he won $2,180,000 \u2013 making him the biggest winner in television history at the time.<ref name=Jackpot>{{cite news|title=Double jackpot winner on US Millionaire|work=BBC News|date=April 11, 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271553.stm|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*Bernie Cullen \u2013 Won the top prize just five days after Olmstead's win on April 15, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2001/04/16/improbably-millionaire-strikes-again/ |title=Improbably, ''Millionaire'' Strikes Again|work=[[New York Post]]|last=Kaplan|first=Don|date=April 16, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref>\n*Ed Toutant \u2013 Won on September 7, 2001.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions.

At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants.

Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the shuffle format was introduced, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium, so that the contestant and host stood throughout the game and were also able to walk around the stage.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\"/> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displayed the current question in play, and another that displayed the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref name=\"New set\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n===ABC===\nThe U.S. version of ''Millionaire'' was launched by ABC as a half-hour primetime program on August 16, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/broadcast/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-for-ten-year-anniversary/24432/|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Returns for its Ten Year Anniversary|work=[[TV By the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> When it premiered, it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize to contestants.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November.<ref name=\"Far from\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/arts/television/09cart.html?pagewanted=all|title=''Millionaire'' Far From Its Final Answer|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref> The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000<ref>{{citation|title=Disney Factbook 2000 \u2013 Year in Review|author=Walt Disney Company|date=February 5, 2001|page=7}}</ref> and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |title=\"ABC Hopes \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" Lightning Can Strike Twice\" |last=Bauder |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132904/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Twenty One (game show)#2000|Twenty One]]'', etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as ''[[Winning Lines (American game show)|Winning Lines]]'', ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', and ''[[It's Your Chance of a Lifetime]]'').\n\nThe nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed. Beginning in September 2003, ''Millionaire'' joined WABC's lineup and remained part of the station's lineup for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|title=''Millionaire'' nabs key slots in syndication|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 2, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907080505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|archivedate=September 7, 2003}}</ref> ABC was impressed enough with the ratings improvement that the network, with one or two exceptions ([[WLS-TV]] in Chicago and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, though the latter would eventually add the series) picked up ''Millionaire'' for the other stations it owned.\n\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 season, ''Millionaire'' nearly was cancelled after a disagreement with BVT's successor, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the owner of the  format rights through its subsidiary [[2waytraffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/local-listings/|title=Local Listings|publisher=Millionaire TV|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> According to e-mails released in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]], ''Millionaire'''s declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The two sides eventually agreed on terms for renewal, which included a return to the original question format (but with fourteen questions) and cuts to the production budget, which resulted in the series leaving New York for [[Stamford, Connecticut]] (although this had been done in 2014) and later moving to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anotado|first=Cory|url=http://www.buzzerblog.com/2015/06/29/millionaire-re-introduces-ladder-format-for-2015-season/|title=Millionaire re-introduces ladder format for 2015 season|work=Buzzerblog|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Had the show not been renewed, SPE was going to place the show on extended hiatus for three years, after which it would reclaim full rights to the show and be free to shop the revived show to another network or syndicator.

As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for ''Super Millionaire'' were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and '''$10,000,000'''.\n\nContestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip.<ref name=SuperMillionaire/> The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former ''Millionaire'' contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave a contestant two chances to answer a question. Once used, the contestant must answer the question without using any further lifelines; moreover, if the \"first final answer\" was incorrect, the contestant could ''not'' walk away. If the \"second final answer\" was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.\n\n===''10th Anniversary Celebration''===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of ''Millionaire''{{'}}s U.S. debut, the show returned to ABC primetime for an eleven-night event hosted by Philbin, which aired from August 9 to 23, 2009.<ref name=\"accesshollywood.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-with-a-hollywood-makeover-74474/|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Returns With A Hollywood Makeover|publisher=AccessHollywood.com|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref> The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 economic crisis]] helped boost interest of renewal of the game show.<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/>\n\nThe episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants.

With a time of 4:39 (45 seconds + 3:54 banked time), Basin was given a question involving President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]]'s fondness for [[Fresca]]. Using his one remaining lifeline, Basin asked the audience, which supported his own hunch of [[Yoo-hoo]] rather than the correct answer. He decided to answer the question and lost $475,000, becoming the first contestant in the U.S. version to answer a $1,000,000 question incorrectly.

Deciding that six-plus years had been too long since someone had won the top prize, producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner.<ref>{{Cite episode|season=8|number=1|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|network=Syndicated|date=September 7, 2009}}</ref> For the first nine weeks of the 2009\u201310 season, each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what was referred to as the \"Tournament of Ten\". Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the highest-rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history, and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the primetime reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=\"Far from\"/>\n\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire'' also made catchphrases out of various lines used on the show. In particular, ''\"Is that your final answer?\"'', asked by ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hosts whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified, was popularized by Philbin during his tenure as host,<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> and was also included on [[TV Land]]'s special \"100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases\", which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger.

Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly.

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a Fastest Finger question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form since 1999.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Otterson|first=Joe|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|twenty-first season]] (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season premiered on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize, the show made television history by becoming one of the highest-rated game shows in the history of American television.

If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/> With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if they answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite press release|url= https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/syndicated-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-premieres-new-season-september-13/|title=Syndicated ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Premieres New Season September 13|author= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Format history ===\n==== Original format (1999\u20132008; since 2020) ====\nFrom 1999 to 2002, 10 contestants played a round of Fastest Finger to determine who would play in the hot seat. The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows, in which it was removed again in the 2020 reboot. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008. In the 2020 reboot, a new lifeline was added called \"Ask The Host\", in which the host, Jimmy Kimmel, gives the player the best possible answer and some advice.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135 '''($500-$5,000):''' 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310 '''($7,500-$25,000):''' 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314 '''($50,000-$500,000):''' 45 seconds\n* Question 15 '''($1,000,000 question):''' 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe timer began to run as soon as the four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories. Beginning in 2017, a contestant who missed any of the first five questions left with $1,000, even if the missed question was of a lower value.\n\n===Payout structure===\nFive different ladders have been used over the course of the series:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"|Question<br>number\n!colspan=\"5\"|Question value\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%\"|1999\u20132004, 2020\u2013\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2004\u201309\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2009\u201310\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2010\u201315<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\"/>\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2015\u201319\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100\n|$500\n| rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>Random values</small><br>$100, $500, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $25,000\n|$500\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$200\n|$1,000\n|$1,000\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$300\n|$2,000\n|$2,000\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500\n|$3,000\n|$3,000\n|-\n|5\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$2,000\n|$7,500\n|$7,000\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4,000\n|$10,000\n|$10,000\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$8,000\n|$12,500\n|$20,000\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$16,000\n|$15,000\n|$30,000\n|-\n|10\n|'''$32,000'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$25,000'''\n|'''$50,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|$64,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$50,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n|-\n|12\n|$125,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n|-\n|13\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n|-\n|14\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|-\n|15\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|  colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c9cac8;\"|\n|}\n\nThe $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were initially lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication. Contestants winning either of these prizes receive $250,000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder paid in equal annual payments. The $500,000 prize consists of $25,000 per year for 10 years, while the $1,000,000 prize consists of $37,500 per year for 20 years, all less taxes.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nFrom 2017\u20132019, contestants who answered one of the first five questions incorrectly received a $1,000 consolation prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Official Rules (Archive)|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|accessdate=24 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629022556/http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|archivedate=June 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On the original primetime version and in earlier seasons of the syndicated version prior to 2010, contestants who missed one of the first five questions left with no winnings.\n\n===Lifelines===\nForms of assistance known as \"lifelines\" are available for a contestant to use if a question proves difficult. Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019; 2020): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AIM (software)|AIM]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call via [[Skype]], and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play. It could be used twice per game from 2010\u20132014, but only once from 2014\u20132015.\n*'''Phone a Friend''' (1999\u20132010; 2020): The contestant called a pre-arranged friend (via [[AT&T]] in ABC airings, except for ''Super Millionaire'' airings, until 2009) and was then given 30 seconds to discuss the question with that person. In 2010, this lifeline was eliminated due to an increasing use of search engines by home viewers to look up answers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Matt |title=How Google Killed \"Phone A Friend\" From \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-killed-phone-a-friend-52624 |website=Search Engine Land |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Switch/Cut the Question''' (2004\u20132008): Earned after answering 10 questions, this lifeline allowed a contestant to discard the current question and replace it with one of the same value. It has been used occasionally during Whiz Kids Week in the current version and is available from the outset.\n*'''Three Wise Men''' (2004): Used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed the contestant 30 seconds of advice from a panel of three experts, who were sequestered backstage and saw the question only when their help was requested.\n*'''Ask the Host''' (2020): Introduced during the 2020 season, this lifeline allows the contestant to ask for the host's advice on the current question and give the best possible answer.\n* The 2020 season features a lifeline similar to +1.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions. Each person who successfully answered all five questions chose one tape date, and the contestants for that tape date were drawn from that pool.|group=note}} Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.\n\nThe syndicated version's potential contestants, depending on tryouts, were required to pass an electronically scored test<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |title=Be a Contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire |last=Grosvenor |first=Carrie |publisher=about.com |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113020940/http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> comprising a set of thirty questions which had to be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who failed the test were eliminated, while those who passed were interviewed for an audition by the production staff,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/television/2003638513_tvgameshowaudition28.html|title=Who wants to be a game-show contestant?|first=Claudia|last=Perry|date=March 28, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> and those who impressed the staff the most were then notified by postal mail that they had been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants. These are held in late spring or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue;<ref name=\"About.com\"/> however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nIn cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team, auditions for these episodes' contestants are announced on the show's website. Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection. If only one member of the team passes, he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed.<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n===Music===\nOriginally, the U.S. ''Millionaire'' carried over the musical score from the British version, composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the shuffle format was introduced, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium, so that the contestant and host stood throughout the game and were also able to walk around the stage.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\"/> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displayed the current question in play, and another that displayed the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref name=\"New set\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n===ABC===\nThe U.S. version of ''Millionaire'' was launched by ABC as a half-hour primetime program on August 16, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/broadcast/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-for-ten-year-anniversary/24432/|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Returns for its Ten Year Anniversary|work=[[TV By the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> When it premiered, it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize to contestants.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November.<ref name=\"Far from\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/arts/television/09cart.html?pagewanted=all|title=''Millionaire'' Far From Its Final Answer|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref> The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000<ref>{{citation|title=Disney Factbook 2000 \u2013 Year in Review|author=Walt Disney Company|date=February 5, 2001|page=7}}</ref> and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |title=\"ABC Hopes \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" Lightning Can Strike Twice\" |last=Bauder |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132904/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Twenty One (game show)#2000|Twenty One]]'', etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as ''[[Winning Lines (American game show)|Winning Lines]]'', ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', and ''[[It's Your Chance of a Lifetime]]'').\n\nThe nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television. In the 1999\u20132000 season, it averaged No. 1 in the ratings against all other television shows,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/recent_data/1999-00.html|title=TV Ratings 1999\u20132000|publisher=fbibler.chez.com|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> with 28,848,000 viewers.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed.

As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for ''Super Millionaire'' were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and '''$10,000,000'''.\n\nContestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip.<ref name=SuperMillionaire/> The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former ''Millionaire'' contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave a contestant two chances to answer a question. Once used, the contestant must answer the question without using any further lifelines; moreover, if the \"first final answer\" was incorrect, the contestant could ''not'' walk away. If the \"second final answer\" was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.\n\n===''10th Anniversary Celebration''===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of ''Millionaire''{{'}}s U.S. debut, the show returned to ABC primetime for an eleven-night event hosted by Philbin, which aired from August 9 to 23, 2009.<ref name=\"accesshollywood.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-with-a-hollywood-makeover-74474/|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Returns With A Hollywood Makeover|publisher=AccessHollywood.com|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref> The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 economic crisis]] helped boost interest of renewal of the game show.<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/>\n\nThe episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants.

With a time of 4:39 (45 seconds + 3:54 banked time), Basin was given a question involving President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]]'s fondness for [[Fresca]].

Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set.

This game featured an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve\u2014eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire now on Facebook: Compete with others for virtual riches|url=https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|last=Shaul|first=Brandy|publisher=AOL|date=April 7, 2011|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043122/https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|archivedate=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Album===\nWho Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Album (Celador Records), by [[Keith Strachan]], [[Matthew Strachan]], and various artists, was released August 1, 2000 and features songs based on the show.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keith Strachan & Matthew Strachan \u2013 Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (The Album) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Keith-Strachan-Matthew-Strachan-Who-Wants-To-Be-A-Millionaire-The-Album/release/3958022 |website=Discogs |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It!

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a Fastest Finger question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

Influences, especially of Japanese wood prints, could be traced in Maas' etchings and paintings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter 1996 she lived in [[Florence, Italy]], where she was accepted into the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]].

At the age of 17 she came back to Europe and went to [[Willem de Kooning Academy]] in [[Rotterdam]], and later continued her studies in New York, where she was introduced to the art of [[icon painting]]. The Russian [[History of art#Sacred art history|sacred art]], literature and philosophy greatly influenced Maas' life and work.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAt the age of 18, she was married, and to support her family began to work, as a model, travelling extensively throughout Europe, visiting Japan and Australia. Influences, especially of Japanese wood prints, could be traced in Maas' etchings and paintings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter 1996 she lived in [[Florence, Italy]], where she was accepted into the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]].
