Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport. In addition, the natural and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agricultural landscape of Turkey]] contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide trapped in forests, thus slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions. [[Energy policy of Turkey|Turkey's policies on energy]], industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cars and cows vent half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey, but a fifth is absorbed by trees.

The post-1965 situation saw major organisational as well as technical changes in the Pakistan Army. Until 1965 it was thought that divisions could function effectively while getting orders directly from the army's [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|GHQ]]. This idea failed miserably in the 1965 war and the need to have intermediate corps headquarters in between the GHQ and the fighting combat divisions was recognised as a foremost operational necessity after the 1965 war. In 1965 war the Pakistan Army had only one corps headquarters (the [[I Corps (Pakistan)|I Corps]]).<ref name=\"dawn.com\"/>\n\nSoon after the war had started the United States had imposed an embargo on military aid to both India and Pakistan. This embargo did not affect the Indian Army but produced major changes in the Pakistan Army's technical composition. US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] well summed it up when he said, \"Well if you are going to fight, go ahead and fight, but we\u2019re not going to pay for it\".<ref>Dennis Kux, India and the United States: Estranged Democracies (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press, 1992), 239.</ref>\n\nPakistan now turned to China for military aid and the Chinese tank [[T-59 (tank)|T-59]] started replacing the US [[M47 Patton|M-47/48]] tanks as the Pakistan Army's MBT (Main Battle Tank) from 1966. 80 tanks, the first batch of T-59s, a low-grade version of the Russian [[T-54/55]] series were delivered to Pakistan in 1965\u201366. The first batch was displayed in the Joint Services Day Parade on 23 March 1966. The 1965 War had proved that Pakistan Army's tank-infantry ratio was lopsided and more infantry was required. Three more infantry divisions (9, 16 and 17 Divisions) largely equipped with Chinese equipment and popularly referred to by the rank and file as \"The China Divisions\" were raised by the beginning of 1968. Two more corps headquarters: the [[II Corps (Pakistan)|2nd Corps]] Headquarters (Jhelum-Ravi Corridor) and the [[IV Corps (Pakistan)|4th Corps]] Headquarters (Ravi-Sutlej Corridor) were raised, also in [[East Pakistan]] a corps-sized formation titles as the [[Eastern Command (Pakistan)|Eastern Command]] was created.\n\n==President of Pakistan==\n[[File:President Nixon meets with President of Pakistan Yahya Khan - NARA - 194693.tif|thumb|President of Pakistan Yahya Khan with United States President [[Richard Nixon]] in October 1970.]]{{POV section|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] was President of Pakistan for most of the 1960s, but by the end of the decade, popular resentment had boiled over against him. Pakistan had fallen into a state of disarray, and long ongoing civil unrest in East Pakistan evolved into a [[1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan|mass uprising]] in January of the year. After having held unsuccessful talks with the opposition, Ayub Khan handed over power to Yahya Khan in March, who immediately imposed [[martial law]]. When Yahya assumed the office on 25 March 1969, he inherited a two-decade constitutional problem of inter-provincial ethnic rivalry between the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]-[[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]-[[Muhajir people|Mohajir]] dominated West Pakistan province and the ethnically [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Muslim East Pakistan province. In addition, Yahya also inherited an 11 year old problem of transforming an essentially one man ruled country to a democratic country, which was the ideological basis of the anti-Ayub movement of 1968\u201369. As an Army Chief Yahya had all the capabilities, qualifications and potential. But Yahya inherited an extremely complex problem and was forced to perform the multiple roles of ''caretaker'' head of the country, ''drafter'' of a provisional constitution, resolving the ''One Unit question'', satisfying the frustrations and the sense of exploitation and discrimination successively created in the ''East Wing'' by a series of government policies since 1948.\n\nThe American political scientist [[Lawrence Ziring]] observed that,\n{{quote|text=Yahya Khan has been widely portrayed as a ruthless uncompromising insensitive and grossly inept leader ... While Yahya cannot escape responsibility for these tragic events, it is also on record that he did not act alone ... All the major actors of the period were creatures of a historic legacy and a psycho-political milieu which did not lend itself to accommodation and compromise, to bargaining and a reasonable settlement. Nurtured on conspiracy theories, they were all conditioned to act in a manner that neglected agreeable solutions and promoted violent judgments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ziring |first=Lawrence |year=1980 |title=Pakistan: The Enigma of Political Development |publisher=Dawson |page=104 |isbn=978-0-7129-0954-9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nYahya Khan attempted to solve Pakistan's constitutional and inter-provincial/regional rivalry problems once he took over power from [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] in March 1969. The tragedy of the whole affair was the fact that all actions that Yahya took, although correct in principle, were too late in timing, and served only to further intensify the political polarisation between the East and West wings.\n* He dissolved the one unit restoring the pre-1955 provinces of West Pakistan\n* He promised free direct, one man one vote, fair elections on adult franchise, a basic human right which had been denied to the Pakistani people since the pre-independence 1946 elections by political inefficiency, double play and intrigue, by civilian governments from 1947 to 1958 and by Ayub's one-man rule from 1958 to 1969.\n\nHowever, dissolution of one unit did not lead to the positive results that it might have led to in case \"One Unit\" was dissolved earlier. Yahya also made an attempt to accommodate the East Pakistanis by abolishing the principle of parity, thereby hoping that greater share in the assembly would redress their wounded ethnic regional pride and ensure the integrity of Pakistan. Instead of satisfying the Bengalis it intensified their separatism since they felt that the west wing had politically suppressed them since 1958. Thus came the rise of anti-West Wing sentiment in the East Wing.\n\nDuring the course of 1968, the [[political pressure]] exerted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had weakened the President Ayub Khan, who had earlier sacked Bhutto after disagreeing with President Ayub's decision to implement on [[Tashkent Agreement]], facilitated by the [[Soviet Union]] to end the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|hostilities]] with India.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\">{{cite book|last=Akbar|first=M.K.|title=Pakistan from Jinnah to Sharif|year=1997|publisher=Mittal Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8170996743|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BcIniHQAHfUC&pg=PA50&dq=Yahya+Khan#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref> To ease the situation, President Ayub had tried reaching out to terms with the major parties, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and the [[Awami League]] (AL), but remained unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\"/> In poor health, President Ayub abrogated his own [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|constitution]] and suddenly resigned from the presidency.<ref name=\"Diane Publication Co.\">{{cite book|last=Peter R.

Finally, the [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in all over the country. In East Pakistan, the [[Awami League]] led by [[Mujibur Rahman]] held almost all [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]], but no seat in any of [[Four Provinces (Pakistan)|four provinces]] of [[West Pakistan]]. The socialist [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) had won the [[exclusive mandate]] in the four provinces of Pakistan, but none in the East Pakistan. The [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) led by [[Nurul Amin]] was the only party to have representation from all over the country, though it had failed to gain the mandate to run the government. The Awami League had 160 seats, all won from the East Pakistan; the socialist PPP had secured 81; the conservative PML had 10 seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[1970 Pakistani general elections|general elections]]'s results truly reflected the ugly political reality: the division of the Pakistani electorate along regional lines and political polarisation of the country between the two states, East Pakistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn political terms, therefore, Pakistan as a nation stood divided as a result. Series of bilateral talks between PPP and Mujibur Rahman produced no results and were unable to come to an agreement of [[Transfer of Power|transfer of power]]  from to East Pakistan's representatives on the basis of the [[Six point movement|Six-Point]] programme. In Pakistan, the people had felt that the Six-point agenda was a step towards secession.\n\n===Massacres in East Pakistan===\nWhile, the political deadlock remains between the Awami League, PPP, and the military government after the general elections in 1970. During this time, Yahya began coordinating several meetings with his military strategists over the issue in East Pakistan. On 25 March 1971, President Yahya initiated the [[Operation Searchlight|''Searchlight'']] in order to restore the writ of the government. The situation in East Pakistan worsened and the gulf between the two wings now was too wide to be bridged. Agitation was now transformed into a vicious insurgency as Bengali elements of [[Pakistan armed forces]] and [[Pakistan police|Police]] mutinied and formed [[Bangladesh Forces]] along with common people of all classes to launch both unconventional and hit and run operations. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe ''Searchlight'' ordered by Yahya was a violent planned military pacification carried out by the Pakistan Armed Forces to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bose |first=Sarmila |date=8 October 2005 |title=Anatomy of Violence: Analysis of Civil War in East Pakistan in 1971 |url=http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301084941/http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |archive-date=1 March 2007}}</ref> Ordered by the government in Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to Operation Blitz which had been launched in November 1970.\n\nThe original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 March 1971, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military,<ref>{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |title=Witness to surrender |publisher=University Press |location=Dhaka |year=1997 |pages=63, 228\u20139 |isbn=978-984-05-1373-4}}</ref> within one month.

Yahya's crackdown, however, had led to a [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] within Pakistan and India drew into the war and fought on behalf of Bangladeshis against Pakistan which would later extend in to the Indo Pak war of 1971.\n\nThe aftermaths of this war were mainly that East Pakistan became independent as Bangladesh and India captured approximately 15,000+ square kilometres (5,000+ square miles) of land of West Pakistan (now Pakistan).

The post-1965 situation saw major organisational as well as technical changes in the Pakistan Army. Until 1965 it was thought that divisions could function effectively while getting orders directly from the army's [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|GHQ]]. This idea failed miserably in the 1965 war and the need to have intermediate corps headquarters in between the GHQ and the fighting combat divisions was recognised as a foremost operational necessity after the 1965 war. In 1965 war the Pakistan Army had only one corps headquarters (the [[I Corps (Pakistan)|I Corps]]).<ref name=\"dawn.com\"/>\n\nSoon after the war had started the United States had imposed an embargo on military aid to both India and Pakistan. This embargo did not affect the Indian Army but produced major changes in the Pakistan Army's technical composition. US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] well summed it up when he said, \"Well if you are going to fight, go ahead and fight, but we\u2019re not going to pay for it\".<ref>Dennis Kux, India and the United States: Estranged Democracies (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press, 1992), 239.</ref>\n\nPakistan now turned to China for military aid and the Chinese tank [[T-59 (tank)|T-59]] started replacing the US [[M47 Patton|M-47/48]] tanks as the Pakistan Army's MBT (Main Battle Tank) from 1966. 80 tanks, the first batch of T-59s, a low-grade version of the Russian [[T-54/55]] series were delivered to Pakistan in 1965\u201366. The first batch was displayed in the Joint Services Day Parade on 23 March 1966. The 1965 War had proved that Pakistan Army's tank-infantry ratio was lopsided and more infantry was required. Three more infantry divisions (9, 16 and 17 Divisions) largely equipped with Chinese equipment and popularly referred to by the rank and file as \"The China Divisions\" were raised by the beginning of 1968. Two more corps headquarters: the [[II Corps (Pakistan)|2nd Corps]] Headquarters (Jhelum-Ravi Corridor) and the [[IV Corps (Pakistan)|4th Corps]] Headquarters (Ravi-Sutlej Corridor) were raised, also in [[East Pakistan]] a corps-sized formation titles as the [[Eastern Command (Pakistan)|Eastern Command]] was created.\n\n==President of Pakistan==\n[[File:President Nixon meets with President of Pakistan Yahya Khan - NARA - 194693.tif|thumb|President of Pakistan Yahya Khan with United States President [[Richard Nixon]] in October 1970.]]{{POV section|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] was President of Pakistan for most of the 1960s, but by the end of the decade, popular resentment had boiled over against him. Pakistan had fallen into a state of disarray, and long ongoing civil unrest in East Pakistan evolved into a [[1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan|mass uprising]] in January of the year. After having held unsuccessful talks with the opposition, Ayub Khan handed over power to Yahya Khan in March, who immediately imposed [[martial law]]. When Yahya assumed the office on 25 March 1969, he inherited a two-decade constitutional problem of inter-provincial ethnic rivalry between the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]-[[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]-[[Muhajir people|Mohajir]] dominated West Pakistan province and the ethnically [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Muslim East Pakistan province. In addition, Yahya also inherited an 11 year old problem of transforming an essentially one man ruled country to a democratic country, which was the ideological basis of the anti-Ayub movement of 1968\u201369. As an Army Chief Yahya had all the capabilities, qualifications and potential. But Yahya inherited an extremely complex problem and was forced to perform the multiple roles of ''caretaker'' head of the country, ''drafter'' of a provisional constitution, resolving the ''One Unit question'', satisfying the frustrations and the sense of exploitation and discrimination successively created in the ''East Wing'' by a series of government policies since 1948.\n\nThe American political scientist [[Lawrence Ziring]] observed that,\n{{quote|text=Yahya Khan has been widely portrayed as a ruthless uncompromising insensitive and grossly inept leader ... While Yahya cannot escape responsibility for these tragic events, it is also on record that he did not act alone ... All the major actors of the period were creatures of a historic legacy and a psycho-political milieu which did not lend itself to accommodation and compromise, to bargaining and a reasonable settlement. Nurtured on conspiracy theories, they were all conditioned to act in a manner that neglected agreeable solutions and promoted violent judgments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ziring |first=Lawrence |year=1980 |title=Pakistan: The Enigma of Political Development |publisher=Dawson |page=104 |isbn=978-0-7129-0954-9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nYahya Khan attempted to solve Pakistan's constitutional and inter-provincial/regional rivalry problems once he took over power from [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] in March 1969. The tragedy of the whole affair was the fact that all actions that Yahya took, although correct in principle, were too late in timing, and served only to further intensify the political polarisation between the East and West wings.\n* He dissolved the one unit restoring the pre-1955 provinces of West Pakistan\n* He promised free direct, one man one vote, fair elections on adult franchise, a basic human right which had been denied to the Pakistani people since the pre-independence 1946 elections by political inefficiency, double play and intrigue, by civilian governments from 1947 to 1958 and by Ayub's one-man rule from 1958 to 1969.\n\nHowever, dissolution of one unit did not lead to the positive results that it might have led to in case \"One Unit\" was dissolved earlier. Yahya also made an attempt to accommodate the East Pakistanis by abolishing the principle of parity, thereby hoping that greater share in the assembly would redress their wounded ethnic regional pride and ensure the integrity of Pakistan. Instead of satisfying the Bengalis it intensified their separatism since they felt that the west wing had politically suppressed them since 1958. Thus came the rise of anti-West Wing sentiment in the East Wing.\n\nDuring the course of 1968, the [[political pressure]] exerted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had weakened the President Ayub Khan, who had earlier sacked Bhutto after disagreeing with President Ayub's decision to implement on [[Tashkent Agreement]], facilitated by the [[Soviet Union]] to end the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|hostilities]] with India.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\">{{cite book|last=Akbar|first=M.K.|title=Pakistan from Jinnah to Sharif|year=1997|publisher=Mittal Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8170996743|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BcIniHQAHfUC&pg=PA50&dq=Yahya+Khan#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref> To ease the situation, President Ayub had tried reaching out to terms with the major parties, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and the [[Awami League]] (AL), but remained unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\"/> In poor health, President Ayub abrogated his own [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|constitution]] and suddenly resigned from the presidency.<ref name=\"Diane Publication Co.\">{{cite book|last=Peter R.

Finally, the [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in all over the country. In East Pakistan, the [[Awami League]] led by [[Mujibur Rahman]] held almost all [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]], but no seat in any of [[Four Provinces (Pakistan)|four provinces]] of [[West Pakistan]]. The socialist [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) had won the [[exclusive mandate]] in the four provinces of Pakistan, but none in the East Pakistan. The [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) led by [[Nurul Amin]] was the only party to have representation from all over the country, though it had failed to gain the mandate to run the government. The Awami League had 160 seats, all won from the East Pakistan; the socialist PPP had secured 81; the conservative PML had 10 seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[1970 Pakistani general elections|general elections]]'s results truly reflected the ugly political reality: the division of the Pakistani electorate along regional lines and political polarisation of the country between the two states, East Pakistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn political terms, therefore, Pakistan as a nation stood divided as a result. Series of bilateral talks between PPP and Mujibur Rahman produced no results and were unable to come to an agreement of [[Transfer of Power|transfer of power]]  from to East Pakistan's representatives on the basis of the [[Six point movement|Six-Point]] programme. In Pakistan, the people had felt that the Six-point agenda was a step towards secession.\n\n===Massacres in East Pakistan===\nWhile, the political deadlock remains between the Awami League, PPP, and the military government after the general elections in 1970. During this time, Yahya began coordinating several meetings with his military strategists over the issue in East Pakistan. On 25 March 1971, President Yahya initiated the [[Operation Searchlight|''Searchlight'']] in order to restore the writ of the government. The situation in East Pakistan worsened and the gulf between the two wings now was too wide to be bridged. Agitation was now transformed into a vicious insurgency as Bengali elements of [[Pakistan armed forces]] and [[Pakistan police|Police]] mutinied and formed [[Bangladesh Forces]] along with common people of all classes to launch both unconventional and hit and run operations. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe ''Searchlight'' ordered by Yahya was a violent planned military pacification carried out by the Pakistan Armed Forces to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bose |first=Sarmila |date=8 October 2005 |title=Anatomy of Violence: Analysis of Civil War in East Pakistan in 1971 |url=http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301084941/http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |archive-date=1 March 2007}}</ref> Ordered by the government in Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to Operation Blitz which had been launched in November 1970.\n\nThe original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 March 1971, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military,<ref>{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |title=Witness to surrender |publisher=University Press |location=Dhaka |year=1997 |pages=63, 228\u20139 |isbn=978-984-05-1373-4}}</ref> within one month.

Yahya became the highest-ranking casualty of the war: to forestall further unrest, on 20 December 1971 he handed over the [[Pakistani presidency|presidency]] and [[Government of Pakistan|government]] to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]\u2014 the ambitious leader of Pakistan's powerful and popular (at that time) [[Pakistan Peoples Party|People's Party]].\n\nWithin hours of Yahya stepping down, President Bhutto reversed [[Judge Advocate General Branch (Pakistan)|JAG]]'s verdict against [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and instead released him to see him off to London. President Bhutto also signed orders for Yahya's [[House arrest|house confinement]], the man who imprisoned Mujib in the first place. Both actions produced headlines around the world.\n\n==Death==\nYahya remained under house arrest orders until 1979 when he was released from the custody by [[Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|martial law]] administrator General [[Fazle Haq]]. He remained out from public events and died on 10 August 1980 in [[Rawalpindi]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], Pakistan.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bass |first=Gary J. |year=2013 |title=The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9PnNZTp3BQYC&pg=PT28 |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A.

While location of an archetypal form of harvesting technique can be identified (they all originated somewhere with a particular forester, and have been described in the scientific literature), and broad generalizations can be made, these are merely rules of thumb rather than strict blueprints on how techniques might be applied. This misunderstanding has meant that many older English textbooks did not capture the true complexity of silviculture as practiced where it originated in [[Mitteleuropa]].\n\nThis silviculture was culturally predicated on wood production in [[Temperate climate|temperate]] and [[Subarctic climate|boreal climate]]s and did not deal with [[Dietrich Brandis|tropical forestry]]. The misapplication of this philosophy to those tropical forests has been problematic. There is also an alternative silvicultural tradition which developed in [[Japan]] and thus created a different biocultural landscape called ''[[satoyama]]''.\n\nAfter harvesting comes regeneration, which may be split into natural and artificial (see below), and tending, which includes release treatments, [[pruning]], [[thinning]] and intermediate treatments.<ref>{{cite book|title=Silviculture: Concepts and Applications|last=Nyland|first=Ralph D.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2002|isbn=978-0-07-366190-2|edition=2nd|series=McGraw-Hill series in forest resources|location=Boston|pages=20|ref=harv}}</ref> It is conceivable that any of these 3 phases ([[Logging|harvesting]], [[Regeneration (ecology)|regeneration]], and tending) may happen at the same time within a stand, depending on the goal for that particular stand.\n\n==Regeneration==\nRegeneration is basic to the continuation of forested, as well as to the [[afforestation]] of treeless land. Regeneration can take place through self-sown [[seed]] (\"natural regeneration\"), by artificially sown seed, or by planted [[seedling]]s. In whichever case, the performance of regeneration depends on its growth potential and the degree to which its environment allows the potential to be expressed.<ref name=\"gross\">{{cite book|title=Ecophysiology of Northern Spruce Species: The Performance of Planted Seedlings|last1=Grossnickle|first1=Steven C.|last2=National Research Council Canada|publisher=NRC Research Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-660-17959-9|ref=harv}}</ref> Seed, of course, is needed for all regeneration modes, both for natural or artificial [[sowing]] and for raising planting stock in a [[Plant nursery|nursery]].\n\nNatural regeneration is a \"human-assisted natural regeneration\" means of establishing a [[Forest inventory#Timber metrics|forest age class]] from natural seeding or sprouting in an area after harvesting in that area through selection cutting, shelter (or seed-tree) harvest, soil preparation, or restricting the size of a clear-cut stand to secure natural regeneration from the surrounding trees.\n\nThe process of natural regeneration involves the renewal of forests by means of self-sown seeds, root suckers, or coppicing. In natural forests, [[conifer]]s rely almost entirely on regeneration through seed.

During extraction and processing, white spruce seeds gradually lost moisture, and total germination increased. Mittal et al. (1987)<ref name=\"mitt\">Mittal, R.K.; Wang, B.S.P. 1987.

Cone handling and storage conditions affect dormancy in that cold, humid storage (5&nbsp;\u00b0C, 75% to 95% relative humidity) of the cones prior to extraction seemingly eliminated dormancy by overcoming the need to stratify.<ref name=\"Haddon 1982\" /> Periods of cold, damp weather during the period of cone storage might provide natural cold (stratification) treatment. Once dormancy was removed in cone storage, subsequent kiln-drying and seed storage did not reactivate dormancy.\n\nHaddon and Winston (1982)<ref name=\"Haddon 1982\" /> found a reduction in viability of stratified seeds after 2 years of storage and suggested that stress might have been caused by stratification, e.g., by changes in seed biochemistry, reduced embryo vigor, seed aging or actual damage to the embryo. They further questioned the quality of the 2-year-old seed even though high [[germination]] occurred in the samples that were not stratified.\n\n====Cold stratification====\n\nCold stratification is the term applied to the storing of seeds in (and, strictly, in layers with) a moist medium, often peat or sand, with a view to maintaining viability and overcoming dormancy. Cold stratification is the term applied to storage at near-freezing temperatures, even if no medium is used. A common method of cold stratification, is to soak seed in tap water for up to 24 h, superficially dry it, then store moist for some weeks or even months at temperatures just above freezing.<ref name=\"van den Driessche 1969\">van den Driessche, R. 1969.

The term \"free growing\" is applied in some jurisdictions. Ontario's \"Free-to-Grow\" (FTG) equivalent relates to a forest stand that meets a minimum stocking standard and height requirement, and is essentially free of competition from surrounding vegetation that might impede growth.<ref name=\"ont\">Ontario Class Environmental Assessment for Timber Management. 1989. Ont. Min. Nat. Resour. Witness Statements, Evidence Panels I to XVII. Compiled 1989.02,22, Sections separately paginated.</ref> The FTG concept was introduced with the advent of the Forest Management Agreement program in Ontario in 1980 and became applicable to all management units in 1986. Policy, procedures, and methodologies readily applicable by forest unit managers to assess the effectiveness of regeneration programs were still under development during the Class Environmental Assessment hearings.\n\nIn British Columbia, the Forest Practices Code (1995)<ref name=\"forest\">British Columbia. Ministry of Forests. 1995. Forest practices code of British Columbia: Silvicultural systems guidebook. BC MoF, BC Ministry of Environment, 44 p.</ref> governs performance criteria. To minimize the subjectivity of assessing [[deciduous]] competition as to whether or not a plantation is established, minimum specifications of number, health, height, and competition have been specified in British Columbia. However, minimum specifications are still subjectively set and may need to be fine-tuned in order to avoid unwarranted delay in according established status to a plantation. For example, a vigorous white spruce with a strong, multi-budded leading shoot and its crown fully exposed to light on 3 sides would not qualify as free-growing in the current British Columbia Code but would hardly warrant description as unestablished.\n\n==Competition==\n\nCompetition arises when individual organisms are sufficiently close together to incur growth constraint through mutual modification of the local environment.<ref name=\"milt\">Milthorpe, F.L. 1961.

Young crop trees are often ill-equipped to fight it out with competition resurgent following initial site preparation and planting.\n\nPerhaps the most direct evaluation of the effect of competition on plantation establishment is provided by an effective [[herbicide]] treatment, given it is performed correctly and without contamination of waters of the state. The fact that herbicide treatment does not always produce positive results should not obscure the demonstrated potential of herbicides for significantly promoting plantation establishment. Factors that can vitiate the effectiveness of a herbicide treatment include: weather, especially temperature, prior to and during application; weather, especially wind, during application; weather, especially precipitation, in the 12 to 24 hours after application; vegetation characteristics, including species, size, shape, phenological stage, vigour, and distribution of weeds; crop characteristics, including species, phenology, and condition; the effects of other treatments, such as preliminary shearblading, burning or other prescribed or accidental site preparation; and the herbicide used, including dosage, formulation, carrier, spreader, and mode of application. There is a lot that can go wrong, but a herbicide treatment can be as good or better than any other method of site preparation.\n\n===Competition indices===\n\nThe study of competition dynamics requires both a measure of the competition level and a measure of crop response.

The treatment can be of the crop itself (e.g., spacing, pruning, thinning, and improvement cutting) or of competing vegetation (e.g., weeding, cleaning).<ref name=\"ford\" />\n\n===Planting===\n\nHow many trees per unit area (spacing) that should be planted is not an easily answered question. Establishment density targets or regeneration standards have commonly been based on traditional practice, with the implicit aim of getting the stand quickly to the free-to-grow stage.<ref name=\"AJW_WB_1995\">Willcocks, A.[J.] and Bell, W. 1995. How initial forest plantation density affects future stand growth. OMNR, Northeast Science & Technology, NEST Tech. Note TN-008. 16 p.</ref> Money is wasted if more trees are planted than are needed to achieve desired stocking rates, and the chance to establish other plantations is proportionately diminished. Ingress (natural regeneration) on a site is difficult to predict and often becomes surprisingly evident only some years after planting has been carried out. Early stand development after harvesting or other disturbance undoubtedly varies greatly among sites, each of which has its own peculiar characteristics.\n\nFor all practical purposes, the total volume produced by a stand on a given site is constant and optimum for a wide range of density or stocking. It can be decreased, but not increased, by altering the amount of growing stock to levels outside this range.<ref name=\"Smith 1962\">Smith, D.M. 1962. The Practice of Silviculture, 7th ed.

The slowness of juvenile growth and of crown closure delay the response to intra-competition. Initially, close spacing might even provide a positive nurse effect to offset any negative response to competition.\n\n===Thinning===\n\nSee [[Thinning#In forestry|Thinning]]\n\nThinning is an operation that artificially reduces the number of trees growing in a stand with the aim of hastening the development of the remainder.<ref>6 Savill, P.S. 2004;</ref> The goal of [[thinning]] is to control the amount and distribution of available growing space. By altering [[Stocking (forestry)|stand density]], [[foresters]] can influence the growth, quality, and health of residual [[trees]]. It also provides an opportunity to capture mortality and cull the commercially less desirable, usually smaller and malformed, trees. Unlike regeneration treatments, thinnings are not intended to establish a new tree crop or create permanent canopy openings.\n\nThinning greatly influences the [[ecology]] and micro-meteorology of the stand, lowering the inter-tree competition for water. The removal of any tree from a stand has repercussions on the remaining trees both above-ground and below. Silvicultural thinning is a powerful tool that can be used to influence stand development, stand stability, and the characteristics of the harvestable products.\n\nWhen considering intensive [[Pinophyta|conifer]] plantations designed for maximum production, it is essential to remember that tending and thinning regimes and wind and snow damage are intimately related.<ref name=\"nav\">Navratil, S.; Branter, K.; and Zasada, J. 1991.

When natural regeneration or artificial seeding has resulted in dense, overstocked young stands, natural [[thinning]] will in most cases eventually reduce stocking to more silviculturally desirable levels. But by the time some trees reach merchantable size, others will be overmature and defective, and others will still be unmerchantable. To reduce this unbalance and to obtain more economic returns, in the early stage, one kind of cleaning is done which is known as precommercial thinning. Generally, one or two times precommercial thinning is done to facilitate the growth of the tree\nThe yield of merchantable wood can be greatly increased and the rotation shortened by precommercial thinning.<ref name=\"Day 1967\">Day, M.W. 1967.

Sta., East Lansing MI, Quarterly Bull 50:59\u201362.</ref> Mechanical and chemical methods have been applied, but their costliness has militated against their ready adoption.\n\n===Pruning===\n[[Pruning]], as a silvicultural practice, refers to the removal of the lower branches of the young trees (also giving the shape to the tree) so clear [[Wood#Knots|knot]]-free wood can subsequently grow over the branch stubs. Clear knot-free [[lumber]] has a higher value. Pruning has been extensively carried out in the [[Monterey pine|Radiata pine]] plantations of [[New Zealand]] and [[Chile]], however the development of [[Finger joint]] technology in the production of [[lumber]] and [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]] has led to many forestry companies reconsidering their pruning practices. \"Brashing\" is an alternative name for the same process.<ref>[http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/brashing The Dictionary of Forestry, The Society of American Foresters]</ref>\nPruning can be done to all trees, or more cost effectively to a limited number of trees. There are two types of pruning: natural or self-pruning and artificial pruning. Most cases of self-pruning happen when branches do not receive enough sunlight and die. Wind can also take part in natural pruning which can break branches.<ref>Smith, D.M., B.C. Larson, M.J. Kelty, and P.M.S. Ashton. ''The Practice of Silviculture: Applied Forest Ecology.'' 9th edition. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Print.</ref> Artificial pruning is where people are paid to come and cut the branches. Or it can be natural, where trees are planted close enough that the effect is to cause self-pruning of low branches as energy is put into growing up for light reasons and not branchiness.\n\n===Stand Conversion===\n\nThe term ''stand conversion'' refers to a change from one silvicultural system to another and includes ''species conversion'', i.e., a change from one species (or set of species) to another.<ref name=\"ford\" /> Such change can be effected intentionally by various silvicultural means, or incidentally by default e.g., when high-grading has removed the [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] content from a [[mixedwood stand]], which then becomes exclusively self-perpetuating [[aspen]]. In general, such sites as these are the most likely to be considered for conversion.\n\n==Growth and yield==\n\nIn discussing yields that might be expected from the Canadian [[spruce]] forests, Haddock (1961)<ref name=\"Haddock 1961\">Haddock, P.G. 1961. Silvicultural views on the Canadian spruce forests. For. Chron. 37(4):376\u2013389.</ref> noted that Wright's (1959)<ref name=\"wri\">Wright, T.G. 1959. The Canadian spruce forest. For. Chron. 35(4):291\u2013297.</ref> quotation of spruce yields in the British Isles of 220 cubic feet per acre (15.4 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) per year and in Germany of 175 cubic feet per acre (12.25 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) per year was misleading, at least if it was meant to imply that such yields might be approached in the [[Taiga|Boreal Forest]] Region of Canada. Haddock thought that Wright's suggestion of 20 to 40 (average 30) cubic feet per acre (1.4 m<sup>3</sup>/ha to 2.8 m<sup>3</sup>/ha (average 2.1 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) per year was more reasonable, but still somewhat optimistic.\n\nThe principal way forest resource managers influence growth and yield is to manipulate the mixture of species and number (density) and distribution (stocking) of individuals that form the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of the stand.<ref name=\"dav\">Davis, L.S.; Johnson, K.N. 1987.

There is less [[spruce]] and more [[hardwood]]s in the second-growth forest than in the original forest; Hearnden et al. (1996)<ref name=\"hear\">Hearnden, K.W.; Millson, S.V.; Wilson, W.C. 1996. Ontario Independent Forest Audit Committee. Ont. Min. Nat. Resour., Sault Ste. Marie ON. 117 p.</ref> calculated that the spruce cover type had declined from 18% to only 4% of the total forested area in Ontario. Mixedwood occupies a greater proportion of Ontario's second-growth forest (41%) than in the original (36%), but its component of white spruce is certainly much diminished.\n\nGrowth performance is certainly influenced by site conditions and thus by the kind and degree of site preparation in relation to the nature of the site. It is important to avoid the assumption that site preparation of a particular designation will have a particular silvicultural outcome. Scarification, for instance, not only covers a wide range of operations that scarify, but also any given way of scarifying can have significantly different results depending on site conditions at the time of treatment. In point of fact, the term is commonly misapplied. ''Scarification'' is defined<ref name=\"ford\" /> as \"Loosening the top soil of open areas, or breaking up the forest floor, in preparation for regenerating by direct seeding or natural seedfall\", but the term is often misapplied to practices that include scalping, screefing, and blading, which pare off low and surface vegetation, together with most off its roots to expose a weed-free surface, generally in preparation for sowing or planting thereon.\n\nThus, it is not surprising that literature can be used to support the view that the growth of seedlings on scarified sites is much superior to that of growth on similar sites that have not been scarified,<ref name=\"wald4\">Waldron, R.M. 1966.

Surface temperatures in sandy soils on occasion reach lethal temperatures of 50&nbsp;\u00b0C to 60&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==Common methods of harvesting==\nSilvicultural regeneration methods combine both the harvest of the timber on the stand and re-establishment of the forest. The proper practice of sustainable forestry<ref>[http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_02.html Oregon State University Extension Service]</ref> should mitigate the potential negative impacts, but all harvest methods will have some impacts on the land and residual stand.<ref>[http://www.cnrhome.uidaho.edu/default.aspx?pid=73972 RESIDUAL DAMAGE IN A CONIFER STAND THINNED WITH A CTL SYSTEM, University of Idaho]</ref> The practice of sustainable forestry limits the impacts such that the values of the forest are maintained in perpetuity. Silvicultural prescriptions are specific solutions to a specific set of circumstances and management objectives.<ref>8 Bauhus, J\u00fcrgen 2009;</ref>  Following are some common methods:\n\n===Clearcut harvesting===\nConventional clearcut harvesting is relatively simple: all trees on a cutblock are felled and bunched with bunches aligned to the skidding direction, and a skidder then drags the bunches to the closest log deck.<ref name=\"saud\">Sauder, E.A. 1996. Techniques to maintain a windfirm understory. p. 31 ''in'' FERIC West, Vancouver BC, Work Program 1996.</ref> Feller-buncher operators concentrate on the width of the felled swath, the number of trees in a bunch, and the alignment of the bunch. Providing a perimeter boundary is felled during daylight, night-shift operations can continue without the danger of trespassing beyond the block. Productivity of equipment is maximized because units can work independently of one another.\n\n===[[Clearcutting]]===\nAn [[Even-aged timber management|even-aged regeneration method]] that can employ either natural or [[Treeplanting|artificial]] regeneration. It involves the complete removal of the forest stand at one time.<ref>''Effects of Group-Selection Opening Size on Breeding Bird Habitat Use in a Bottomland Forest.'' Christopher E. Moorman and David C. Guynn Jr.\n Ecological Applications, Vol. 11, No. 6 (Dec., 2001), pp. 1680-1691. Web. 4 Oct. 2013.</ref>  Clearcutting can be biologically appropriate with species that typically regenerate from stand replacing fires or other major [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]], such as [[Lodgepole Pine]] (''Pinus contorta''). Alternatively, clearcutting can change the dominating species on a stand with the introduction of non-native and invasive species as was shown at the Blodgett Experimental Forest near Georgetown California. Additionally, clearcutting can prolong [[Slash (logging)|slash]] decomposition, expose soil to erosion, impact visual appeal of a landscape and remove essential wildlife habitat. It is particularly useful in regeneration of tree species such as [[Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'') which is [[List of shade-tolerant species|shade intolerant]].{{Verify source|date=April 2012}}.  In addition, the general public's distaste for even-aged silviculture, particularly clearcutting, is likely to result in a greater role for uneven-aged management on public lands as well.<ref>9 Schulte, Benedict J. 1998;</ref> Across Europe, and in parts of North America, even-aged, production-orientated and intensively managed plantations are beginning to be regarded in the same way as old industrial complexes: something to abolish or convert to something else.<ref>12 Gamborg, Christian 2003;</ref>\n\nClearcutting will impact many site factors important in their effect on regeneration, including air and [[soil]] temperatures. Kubin and Kemppainen (1991),<ref name=\"kubin\">Kubin, E.; Kemppainen, L. 1991. Effect of clearcutting of boreal spruce forest on air and soil temperature conditions. Acta Forestalia Fennica No. 225. 42 p.</ref> for instance, measured temperatures in northern Finland from 1974 through 1985 in 3 clear-felled areas and in 3 neighouring forest stands dominated by [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]]. Clear felling had no significant influence on air temperature at 2 m above the ground surface, but the daily air temperature maxima at 10&nbsp;cm were greater in the clear-felled area than in the uncut forest, while the daily minima at 10&nbsp;cm were lower. Night frosts were more common in the clear-felled area. Daily soil temperatures at 5&nbsp;cm depth were 2&nbsp;\u00b0C to 3&nbsp;\u00b0C greater in the clear-felled area than in the uncut forest, and temperatures at depths of 50&nbsp;cm and 100&nbsp;cm were 3&nbsp;\u00b0C to 5&nbsp;\u00b0C greater. The differences between the clear-felled and uncut areas did not diminish during the 12 years following cutting.\n\n===[[Coppicing]]===\nA regeneration method which depends on the sprouting of cut trees.  Most hardwoods, the [[coast redwood#Reproduction|coast redwood]], and certain pines naturally sprout from stumps and can be managed through coppicing. Coppicing is generally used to produce fuelwood, pulpwood, and other products dependent on small trees. A close relative of coppicing is [[pollarding]].<ref>Smith, D.M., B.C. Larson, M.J. Kelty, P.M.S. Ashton (1997) The Practice of Silviculture: Applied Forest Ecology, John Wiley & Sons, p. 340-46</ref> Three systems of coppice woodland management are generally recognized: simple coppice, coppice with standards, and the coppice selection system.<ref>10 Harmer, R. 2004;</ref>\n*In Compound coppicing or '''coppicing with standards''', some of the highest quality trees are retained for multiple rotations in order to obtain larger trees for different purposes.\n\n===Direct seeding===\nProchnau (1963),<ref name=\"proch\">Prochnau, A.E. 1963. Direct seeding experiments with white spruce, alpine fir, Douglas fir and lodgepole pine in the central interior of British Columbia. B.C. Min. For. Lands, Victoria BC, MOFL No. 37, Res Note. 24 p.

The group selection method can still result in residual stand damage in dense stands, however directional falling can minimize the damage.  Additionally, [[forester]]s can select across the range of diameter classes in the stand and maintain a mosaic of age and diameter classes.\n\n===M\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le===\nClassical European silviculture achieved impressive results with systems such as Henri Biolley's ''m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le'' in Switzerland, in which the number and size of trees harvested were determined by reference to data collected from every tree in every stand measured every 7 years.<ref name=\"bio\">Biolley, H. 1920. L'am\u00e9nagement des for\u00eats par la m\u00e9thode exp\u00e9rimentale et sp\u00e9cialement la m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le. Paris, Attinger fr\u00e8res. 90 p.</ref>\n\nWhile not designed to be applied to boreal mixedwoods, the ''m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le'' is described briefly here to illustrate the degree of sophistication applied by some European foresters to the management of their forests. Development of management techniques that allowed for stand development to be monitored and guided into sustainable paths were in part a response to past experience, particularly in Central European countries, of the negative effects of pure, uniform stands with species often unsuited to the site, which greatly increased the risk of [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and biotic diseases. Increased mortality and decreased increment generated widespread concern, especially after reinforcement by other environmental stresses.\n\nMore or less uneven-aged, mixed forests of preponderantly native species, on the other hand, treated along natural lines, have proved to be healthier and more resistant to all kinds of external dangers; and in the long run such stands are more productive and easier to protect.\n\nHowever, irregular stands of this type are definitely more difficult to manage\u2014new methods and techniques had to be sought particularly for the establishment of inventories, as well as increment control and yield regulation. In Germany, for instance, since the beginning of the nineteenth century under the influence of G.L. Hartig (1764\u20131837), yield regulation has been effected almost exclusively by allotment or formula methods based on the conception of the uniform normal forest with a regular succession of cutting areas.\n\nIn France, on the other hand, efforts were made to apply another kind of forest management, one that aimed to bring all parts of the forest to a state of highest productive capacity in perpetuity. In 1878, the French forester A. Gurnaud (1825\u20131898) published a description of a ''m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le'' for determining increment and yield. The method was based on the fact that through careful, selective harvesting, the productivity of the residual stand can be improved, because timber is removed as a cultural operation. In this method, the increment of stands is accurately determined periodically with the object of gradually converting the forest, through selective management and continuous experimentation, to a condition of equilibrium at maximum productive capacity.\n\nHenri Biolley (1858\u20131939) was the first to apply Gurnaud's inspired ideas to practical forestry. From 1890 on, he managed the forests of his Swiss district according to these principles, devoting himself for almost 50 years to the study of increment and a treatment of stands directed towards the highest production, and proving the practicability of the check method. In 1920, he published this study giving a theoretical basis of management of forests under the check method, describing the procedures to be applied in practice (which he partly developed and simplified), and evaluating the results.\n\nBiolley's pioneering work formed the basis upon which most Swiss forest management practices were later developed, and his ideas have been generally accepted. Today, with the trend of intensifying forest management and productivity in most countries, the ideas and application of careful, continuous treatment of stands with the aid of the volume check method are meeting with ever-growing interest. In Britain and Ireland, for example, there is increased application of [[Continuous Cover Forestry]] principles to create permanently irregular structures in many woodlands.<ref>Helliwell, R., and E. R. Wilson. (2012). Continuous cover forestry in Britain: challenges and opportunities..Quarterly Journal of Forestry 106(3): 214-224 [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260031518_Continuous_cover_forestry_in_Britain_challenges_and_opportunities]</ref>\n\n===[[Patch cut]]===\n\n===Row and broadcast seeding===\nSpot and row seeders use less seed that does broadcast ground or aerial seeding but may induce clumping. Row and spot seeding confer greater ability to control seed placement than does broadcast seeding. Also, only a small percentage of the total area needs to be treated.\n\nIn the aspen type of the Great Lakes region, direct sowing of the seed of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] has usually failed.<ref name=\"kitt\" /> However, Gardner (1980)<ref name=\"gard\">Gardner, A.C. 1980.

Forest Regeneration at High,</ref> after trials in Yukon, which included broadcast seeding of white spruce seed at 2.24&nbsp;kg/ha that secured 66.5% stocking in the Scarified Spring Broadcast treatment 3 years after seeding, concluded that the technique held \"considerable promise\".\n\n===[[Seedstock|Seed-tree]]===\nAn even-aged regeneration method that retains widely spaced residual trees in order to provide uniform seed dispersal across a harvested area. In the seed-tree method, 2-12 seed trees per acre (5-30/ha) are left standing in order to regenerate the forest. They will be retained until regeneration has become established at which point they may be removed. It may not always be economically viable or biologically desirable to re-enter the stand to remove the remaining seed trees. Seed-tree cuts can also be viewed as a clearcut with natural regeneration and can also have all of the problems associated with clearcutting. This method is most suited for light-seeded species and those not prone to [[windthrow]].\n\n===Selection systems===\nSelection systems are appropriate where uneven stand structure is desired, particularly where the need to retain [[Continuous Cover Forestry|continuous cover forest]] for aesthetic or environmental reasons outweighs other management considerations. Selection logging has been suggested as being of greater utility than shelterwood systems in regenerating old-growth Engelmann Spruce Sub-alpine Fir (ESSF) stands in southern British Columbia.<ref name=\"weet\">Weetman, G.; Vyse, A. 1990.

The Hakmet seed shelter, for instance, is a semi-transparent plastic cone 8&nbsp;cm high, with openings of 7&nbsp;cm diameter in the 7.5&nbsp;cm diameter base and 17&nbsp;mm diameter in the 24&nbsp;mm diameter top.<ref name=\"lah\">L\u00e4hde, F. and Tuohisaari, O. 1976.

The shelter is designed to break down after a few years of exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\n\nSeed shelters and spring sowing significantly improved stocking compared with bare spot seeding, but sheltering did not significantly improve growth. Stocking of bare seedspots was extremely low, possibly due to smothering of seedlings by abundant broadleaf and herbaceous litter, particularly that from aspen and red raspberry, and exacerbated by strong competition from graminoids and raspberry.\n\nCone shelters (Cerkon\u2122) usually produced greater survival than unsheltered seeding on scarified seedspots in trials of direct seeding techniques in interior Alaska, and funnel shelters (Cerbel\u2122) usually produced greater survival than unsheltered seeding on non-scarified seedspots.<ref name=\"put2\">Putman, W.E.; Zasada, J.C. 1986.

The success of practising a shelterwood system is closely related to: 1. the length of the regeneration period, i.e. the time from the shelterwood cutting to the date when a new generation of trees has been established; 2.the quality of the new tree stand with respect to stand density and growth; and 3.the value increment of the shelter trees. Information on the establishment, survival and growth of seedlings influenced by the cover of shelter trees, as well as on the growth of these trees, is needed as a basis for modelling the economic return of practising a shelterwood system.<ref>4 Holg\u00e9n, Per 2000; 4 Holg\u00e9n, Per 2000;</ref> The method's objective is to establish new forest reproduction under the shelter of the retained trees. Unlike the seed-tree method, residual trees alter [[understory]] environmental conditions (i.e. sunlight, temperature, and moisture) that influence tree seedling growth. This method can also find a middle ground with the light ambiance by having less light accessible to competitors while still being able to provide enough light for tree regeneration.<ref>''Survival and Growth of Under-Planted Trees: A Meta-Analysis across Four Biomes''.\n Alain Paquette, Andr\u00e9 Bouchard and Alain Cogliastro\n Ecological Applications, Vol. 16, No. 4 (Aug., 2006), pp. 1575-1589</ref> Hence, shelterwood methods are most often chosen for site types characterized by extreme conditions, in order to create a new tree generation within a reasonable time period. These conditions are valid foremost on level ground sites which are either dry and poor or moist and fertile.<ref>4 Holg\u00e9n, Per 2000;</ref>\n\n===Shelterwood systems===\nShelterwood systems involve 2, 3, or exceptionally more partial cuttings. A final cut is made once adequate natural [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] has been obtained. The shelterwood system is most commonly applied as a 2-cut uniform shelterwood, first an initial regeneration (seed) cut, the second a final harvest cut. In stands less than 100 years old, a light preparatory cut can be useful.<ref name=\"zas1\" /> A series of intermediate cuts at intervals of 10\u201320 years has been recommended for intensively managed stands.<ref name=\"alex4\" />\n\nFrom operational or economic standpoints, however, there are disadvantages to the shelterwood system: harvesting costs are higher; trees left for deferred cutting may be damaged during the regeneration cut or related extraction operations; the increased risk of blowdown threatens the seed source; damage from bark beetles is likely to increase; regeneration may be damaged during the final cut and related extraction operations; the difficulty of any site preparation would be increased; and incidental damage to regeneration might be caused by any site preparation operations.<ref name=\"alex3\" /><ref name=\"Day 1970\">Day, M.W.; Rudolph, V.J. 1970.

Understorey white spruce is of particular importance in mixedwoods dominated by [[aspen]], as in the B15, B18a, and B19a Sections of Manitoba,<ref name=\"rowe2\">Rowe, J.S 1972. Forest regions of Canada. Can. Dep. Environ., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa ON, Publ. 1300. 172 p.</ref> and elsewhere. Until the latter part of the last century, white spruce understorey was mostly viewed as money in the bank on a long-term, low interest deposit, with final yield to be realized after slow natural succession,<ref name=\"brace3\">Brace, L.; Bella, I. 1988. Understanding the understorey: dilemma and opportunity. ''In'' White spruce understories. Canada\u2013Alberta Agreement, Projects 1480, 1488, 20204. For. Can., Northern For. Centre, Edmonton AB. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994)</ref> but the resource became increasingly threatened with the intensification of harvesting of aspen. White spruce plantations on mixedwood sites proved expensive, risky, and generally unsuccessful.<ref name=\"brace3\" /> This prompted efforts to see what might be done about growing aspen and white spruce on the same landbase by protecting existing white spruce advance growth, leaving a range of viable crop trees during the first cut, then harvesting both [[hardwood]]s and spruce in the final cut. Information about the understorey component is critical to spruce management planning. The ability of then current harvesting technology and crews employed to provide adequate protection for white spruce understories was questioned by Brace and Bella. Specialized equipment and training, perhaps with financial incentives, may be needed to develop procedures that would confer the degree of protection needed for the system to be feasible. Effective understorey management planning requires more than improved mixedwood inventory.\n\nAvoidance of damage to the understorey will always be a desideratum. Sauder's (1990)<ref name=\"saudnew\">Sauder, E.A. 1990. Mixedwood harvesting. section B In White spruce understories, Canada\u2013Alberta Agreement, Projects 1480, 1488, 20204. For.

Sauder concluded that: (1) operational measures that protected residual stems may not unduly increase costs, (2) all felling, conifers and hardwoods, needs to be done in one operation to minimize the entry of the feller-buncher into the residual stand, (3) several operational procedures can reduce understorey damage, some of them without incurring extra costs, and (4) successful harvesting of treatment blocks depends primarily on the intelligent location of skid trails and landings. In summary, the key to protecting the white spruce understorey without sacrificing logging efficiency is a combination of good planning, good supervision, the use of appropriate equipment, and having conscientious, well-trained operators.Even the best plan will not reduce understorey damage unless its implementation is supervised.<ref name=\"saud2\">Sauder, E.A.; Sinclair, A.W.J. 1989.

Brace articulated a widespread concern: \"The need for protection of spruce as a component of boreal mixedwoods goes beyond concern for the future commercial softwood timber supply. Concerns also include fisheries and wildlife habitat, aesthetics and recreation, a general dissatisfaction with cleacutting in mixedwoods and a strong interest in mixedwood perpetuation, as expressed recently in 41 public meetings on forestry development in northern Alberta...\".<ref name=\"brace1\" />\n\nOn the basis of tests of 3 logging systems in Alberta, Brace (1990)<ref name=\"brace2\">Brace, L. 1990.

On sites with a white spruce understorey, a regression model related the abundance of regeneration to rotten wood cover, spruce basal area, pine basal area, soil clay fraction, and grass cover (R\u00b2 = 0.36).

Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.\n\nThe ''Picea/Abies'' forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974)<ref name=\"end\">Endean, F.; Johnstone, W.D. 1974.

Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.\n\n===Ameliorative intervention===\n\nSlash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem < 4 inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the [[Wildfire|forest fire]] hazard on harvested sites.<ref name=\"kii1\">Kiil, A.D. 1965. Weight and size distribution of slash of white spruce and lodgepole pine. For. Chron. 41:432\u2013437.</ref> Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968).<ref name=\"kii2\">Kiil, A.D. 1968. Weight of the fuel complex in 70-year-old lodgepole pine stands of different densities. Department of Forestry and Rural Development, Forest Research Laboratory, Calgary, Alberta. Departmental Publication 1228. 13 p.</ref> In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (<1.27&nbsp;cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil's study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.\n\nThe need to provide shade for young outplants of [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] in the high [[Rocky Mountains]] is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material.<ref name=\"ronco\">Ronco, F. 1975. Diagnosis: sunburned trees. J. For. 73(1):31\u201335. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).</ref> Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.\n\n===Access===\n\nSite preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.\n\nWang et al. (2000)<ref name=\"wang\">Wang, G.G.; Siemens, A.; Keenan, V.; Philippot, D. 2000. Survival and growth of black and white spruce seedlings in relation to stock type, site preparation and plantation type in southeastern Manitoba. For. Chron. 76(5):775\u2013782.</ref> determined field performance of white and black spruces 8 and 9 years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in 2 plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97&nbsp;cm\u00b3) compared with black spruce sheltered (210&nbsp;cm\u00b3), as well as white spruce open (175&nbsp;cm\u00b3) and sheltered (229&nbsp;cm\u00b3) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329&nbsp;cm\u00b3) than open plantations (204&nbsp;cm\u00b3). Wang et al. (2000)<ref name=\"wang\" /> recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.\n\n===Mechanical===\n\nUp to 1970, no \"sophisticated\" site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario,<ref name=\"hall\">Hall, J. 1970. Site preparation in Ontario. For. Chron. 46:445\u2013447.</ref> but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.\n\nAccording to J. Hall (1970),<ref name=\"hall\" /> in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.\n\nJ. Hall's (1970)<ref name=\"hall\" /> report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant [[hardwood]] stands for natural regeneration of [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]]. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine\u2013spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been \"quite successful\" for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.\n\n===Mounding===\n\nSite preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985),<ref name=\"drap\">Draper, D.; Binder, W.; Fahlman, R.; Spittlehouse, D. 1985. Post-planting ecophysiology of Interior spruce. Interior Spruce Seedling Performance: State of the Art. Northern Silvic. Committee, Prince George BC. 18 p. (mimeo).</ref> for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).\n\nThe mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5&nbsp;cm and 10&nbsp;cm averaged 10 and 7&nbsp;\u00b0C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25&nbsp;\u00b0C to 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C at 10&nbsp;cm depth 5 days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until 58 days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had 3 times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10&nbsp;\u00b0C than did the control microsites.\n\nDraper et al.'s (1985)<ref name=\"drap\" /> mounds received 5 times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 \u00b5Em\u203e\u00b2s\u203e1 intensity range is the most important for [[photosynthesis]], the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.\n\n===Orientation of linear site preparation, e.g., disk-trenching===\n\nWith linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by [[topography]] or other considerations, but where the orientation can be chosen, it can make a significant difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants ([[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench; in north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows.<ref name=\"burt\">Burton, P.; Bedford, L.; Goldstein, M.; Osberg, M. 2000. Effect of disk trench orientation and planting spot position on the ten-year performance of lodgepole pine. New For. 20:23\u201344.</ref> Tenth-year stem volumes of trees on south, east, and west-facing microsites were significantly greater than those of trees on north-facing and untreated microsites. However, planting spot selection was seen to be more important overall than trench orientation.\n\nIn a Minnesota study, the N\u2013S strips accumulated more snow, but the snow melted faster than on E\u2013W strips in the first year after felling.<ref name=\"clau\">Clausen, J.C.; Mace, A.C., Jr. 1972.

Notes No. 34. 4 p.</ref> Snow-melt was faster on strips near the centre of the strip-felled area than on border strips adjoining the intact stand. The strips, 50 feet (15.24 m) wide, alternating with uncut strips 16 feet (4.88 m) wide, were felled in a ''Pinus resinosa'' stand, aged 90 to 100 years.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Agroforestry]]\n* [[Coppicing]]\n* [[Ecological thinning]]\n* [[Forest dynamics]]\n* [[Forestry]]\n* [[Forest management]]\n* [[History of the forest in Central Europe]]\n* [[Hardwood timber production]]\n* [[Live crown]]\n* [[Natural landscape]]\n* [[Permaculture]]\n* [[Plantations]]\n* [[Seed tree]]\n* [[Selection cutting]]\n* [[Silvology]]\n* [[Sustainable forest management]]\n* [[World Forestry Congress]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|}}\n* Daniel, T.

[[Adaptive management]] is common in silviculture, while forestry can include natural/conserved land without stand-level management and treatments being applied.\n\n==Silvicultural systems==\n\nThe [[Forestry#History|origin of forestry]] in [[History of the forest in Central Europe|German-speaking Europe]] has defined silvicultural systems broadly as [[High forest (woodland)|high forest]] ({{Lang|de|Hochwald}}), [[Coppice|coppice with standards]] ({{Lang|de|Mittelwald}}) and compound coppice, [[short rotation coppice]], and [[coppice]] ({{Lang|de|Niederwald}}). There are other systems as well. These varied silvicultural systems include several harvesting methods, which are often wrongly said to be a silvicultural systems, but may also be called rejuvenating or regenerating method depending on the purpose.\n\nThe high forest system is further subdivided in German:<ref>Invented by Reiniger at The Schl\u00e4gl Monastery, Austria http://www.stift-schlaegl.at/prodon.asp?peco=&Seite=373&Lg=1&Cy=1</ref> \n* High forest ({{Lang|de|Hochwald}})\n** Age class forest ({{Lang|de|Altersklassenwald}})\n*** Even-aged forestry\n**** [[Clear cutting]] ({{Lang|de|Kahlschlag}})\n**** [[Shelterwood cutting]] ({{Lang|de|Schirmschlag}})\n**** [[Seed tree|Seed-tree method]]\n*** Uneven-aged forestry\n**** [[Selection cutting|The Femel selection cutting (group selection cutting)]] ({{Lang|de|Femelschlag}})\n**** Strip selection cutting (strip-and-group [[felling]] system) ({{Lang|de|Saumschlag}})\n**** Shelterwood wedge cutting ({{Lang|de|Schirmkeilschlag}})\n**** Mixed-form regeneration methods ({{Lang|de|Mischformen}})\n** [[Continuous cover forestry]] ({{Lang|de|Dauerwald}})\n*** Uneven-aged forestry\n**** [[Selection cutting|Selection forest]] ({{Lang|de|Plenterwald}})\n**** Target diameter harvesting ({{Lang|de|Zielst\u00e4rkennutzung}})\nThese names give the impression is that these are neatly defined systems, but in practice there are variations within these harvesting methods in accordance with to local ecology and site conditions. While location of an archetypal form of harvesting technique can be identified (they all originated somewhere with a particular forester, and have been described in the scientific literature), and broad generalizations can be made, these are merely rules of thumb rather than strict blueprints on how techniques might be applied. This misunderstanding has meant that many older English textbooks did not capture the true complexity of silviculture as practiced where it originated in [[Mitteleuropa]].\n\nThis silviculture was culturally predicated on wood production in [[Temperate climate|temperate]] and [[Subarctic climate|boreal climate]]s and did not deal with [[Dietrich Brandis|tropical forestry]]. The misapplication of this philosophy to those tropical forests has been problematic. There is also an alternative silvicultural tradition which developed in [[Japan]] and thus created a different biocultural landscape called ''[[satoyama]]''.\n\nAfter harvesting comes regeneration, which may be split into natural and artificial (see below), and tending, which includes release treatments, [[pruning]], [[thinning]] and intermediate treatments.<ref>{{cite book|title=Silviculture: Concepts and Applications|last=Nyland|first=Ralph D.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2002|isbn=978-0-07-366190-2|edition=2nd|series=McGraw-Hill series in forest resources|location=Boston|pages=20|ref=harv}}</ref> It is conceivable that any of these 3 phases ([[Logging|harvesting]], [[Regeneration (ecology)|regeneration]], and tending) may happen at the same time within a stand, depending on the goal for that particular stand.\n\n==Regeneration==\nRegeneration is basic to the continuation of forested, as well as to the [[afforestation]] of treeless land. Regeneration can take place through self-sown [[seed]] (\"natural regeneration\"), by artificially sown seed, or by planted [[seedling]]s. In whichever case, the performance of regeneration depends on its growth potential and the degree to which its environment allows the potential to be expressed.<ref name=\"gross\">{{cite book|title=Ecophysiology of Northern Spruce Species: The Performance of Planted Seedlings|last1=Grossnickle|first1=Steven C.|last2=National Research Council Canada|publisher=NRC Research Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-660-17959-9|ref=harv}}</ref> Seed, of course, is needed for all regeneration modes, both for natural or artificial [[sowing]] and for raising planting stock in a [[Plant nursery|nursery]].\n\nNatural regeneration is a \"human-assisted natural regeneration\" means of establishing a [[Forest inventory#Timber metrics|forest age class]] from natural seeding or sprouting in an area after harvesting in that area through selection cutting, shelter (or seed-tree) harvest, soil preparation, or restricting the size of a clear-cut stand to secure natural regeneration from the surrounding trees.\n\nThe process of natural regeneration involves the renewal of forests by means of self-sown seeds, root suckers, or coppicing. In natural forests, [[conifer]]s rely almost entirely on regeneration through seed. Most of the [[Forest#Classification|broadleaves]], however, are able to regenerate by the means of emergence of shoots from stumps (coppice) and broken stems.<ref>11 Huss, J. 2004;</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Seedbed requirements===\n\nAny seed, self-sown or artificially applied, requires a seedbed suitable for securing [[germination]].\n\nIn order to [[germination|germinate]], a seed requires suitable conditions of temperature, [[Soil#Soil moisture content|moisture]], and [[Pore space in soil|aeration]].

Cold stratification is the term applied to storage at near-freezing temperatures, even if no medium is used. A common method of cold stratification, is to soak seed in tap water for up to 24 h, superficially dry it, then store moist for some weeks or even months at temperatures just above freezing.<ref name=\"van den Driessche 1969\">van den Driessche, R. 1969.

The term \"free growing\" is applied in some jurisdictions. Ontario's \"Free-to-Grow\" (FTG) equivalent relates to a forest stand that meets a minimum stocking standard and height requirement, and is essentially free of competition from surrounding vegetation that might impede growth.<ref name=\"ont\">Ontario Class Environmental Assessment for Timber Management. 1989.

Policy, procedures, and methodologies readily applicable by forest unit managers to assess the effectiveness of regeneration programs were still under development during the Class Environmental Assessment hearings.\n\nIn British Columbia, the Forest Practices Code (1995)<ref name=\"forest\">British Columbia. Ministry of Forests. 1995. Forest practices code of British Columbia: Silvicultural systems guidebook. BC MoF, BC Ministry of Environment, 44 p.</ref> governs performance criteria. To minimize the subjectivity of assessing [[deciduous]] competition as to whether or not a plantation is established, minimum specifications of number, health, height, and competition have been specified in British Columbia. However, minimum specifications are still subjectively set and may need to be fine-tuned in order to avoid unwarranted delay in according established status to a plantation. For example, a vigorous white spruce with a strong, multi-budded leading shoot and its crown fully exposed to light on 3 sides would not qualify as free-growing in the current British Columbia Code but would hardly warrant description as unestablished.\n\n==Competition==\n\nCompetition arises when individual organisms are sufficiently close together to incur growth constraint through mutual modification of the local environment.<ref name=\"milt\">Milthorpe, F.L. 1961.

Young crop trees are often ill-equipped to fight it out with competition resurgent following initial site preparation and planting.\n\nPerhaps the most direct evaluation of the effect of competition on plantation establishment is provided by an effective [[herbicide]] treatment, given it is performed correctly and without contamination of waters of the state. The fact that herbicide treatment does not always produce positive results should not obscure the demonstrated potential of herbicides for significantly promoting plantation establishment. Factors that can vitiate the effectiveness of a herbicide treatment include: weather, especially temperature, prior to and during application; weather, especially wind, during application; weather, especially precipitation, in the 12 to 24 hours after application; vegetation characteristics, including species, size, shape, phenological stage, vigour, and distribution of weeds; crop characteristics, including species, phenology, and condition; the effects of other treatments, such as preliminary shearblading, burning or other prescribed or accidental site preparation; and the herbicide used, including dosage, formulation, carrier, spreader, and mode of application. There is a lot that can go wrong, but a herbicide treatment can be as good or better than any other method of site preparation.\n\n===Competition indices===\n\nThe study of competition dynamics requires both a measure of the competition level and a measure of crop response. Various competition indices have been developed, e.g., by Bella (1971)<ref name=\"bella\">Bella, I.E. 1971. A new competition model for individual trees. For.

The treatment can be of the crop itself (e.g., spacing, pruning, thinning, and improvement cutting) or of competing vegetation (e.g., weeding, cleaning).<ref name=\"ford\" />\n\n===Planting===\n\nHow many trees per unit area (spacing) that should be planted is not an easily answered question. Establishment density targets or regeneration standards have commonly been based on traditional practice, with the implicit aim of getting the stand quickly to the free-to-grow stage.<ref name=\"AJW_WB_1995\">Willcocks, A.[J.] and Bell, W. 1995.

Ingress (natural regeneration) on a site is difficult to predict and often becomes surprisingly evident only some years after planting has been carried out. Early stand development after harvesting or other disturbance undoubtedly varies greatly among sites, each of which has its own peculiar characteristics.\n\nFor all practical purposes, the total volume produced by a stand on a given site is constant and optimum for a wide range of density or stocking. It can be decreased, but not increased, by altering the amount of growing stock to levels outside this range.<ref name=\"Smith 1962\">Smith, D.M. 1962. The Practice of Silviculture, 7th ed.

The problem is aggravated in species that have little self-pruning ability, such as [[Picea glauca|white spruce]]. Spacing is a thinning (of natural regeneration), in which all trees other than those selected for retention at fixed intervals are cut.

The slowness of juvenile growth and of crown closure delay the response to intra-competition. Initially, close spacing might even provide a positive nurse effect to offset any negative response to competition.\n\n===Thinning===\n\nSee [[Thinning#In forestry|Thinning]]\n\nThinning is an operation that artificially reduces the number of trees growing in a stand with the aim of hastening the development of the remainder.<ref>6 Savill, P.S. 2004;</ref> The goal of [[thinning]] is to control the amount and distribution of available growing space. By altering [[Stocking (forestry)|stand density]], [[foresters]] can influence the growth, quality, and health of residual [[trees]]. It also provides an opportunity to capture mortality and cull the commercially less desirable, usually smaller and malformed, trees. Unlike regeneration treatments, thinnings are not intended to establish a new tree crop or create permanent canopy openings.\n\nThinning greatly influences the [[ecology]] and micro-meteorology of the stand, lowering the inter-tree competition for water. The removal of any tree from a stand has repercussions on the remaining trees both above-ground and below. Silvicultural thinning is a powerful tool that can be used to influence stand development, stand stability, and the characteristics of the harvestable products.\n\nWhen considering intensive [[Pinophyta|conifer]] plantations designed for maximum production, it is essential to remember that tending and thinning regimes and wind and snow damage are intimately related.<ref name=\"nav\">Navratil, S.; Branter, K.; and Zasada, J. 1991.

Centre, Victoria BC, FRDA Report 164.</ref>\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that repeated thinnings over the course of a forest rotation increase carbon stores relative to stands that are clear-cut on short rotations and that the carbon benefits differ according to thinning method (e.g., thinning from above versus below).<ref>7 D'Amato, Anthony W. 2011;</ref>\n\n====Precommercial thinning====\nIn the early development of forest stand, density of trees remain high and there is competition among trees for nutrients. When natural regeneration or artificial seeding has resulted in dense, overstocked young stands, natural [[thinning]] will in most cases eventually reduce stocking to more silviculturally desirable levels. But by the time some trees reach merchantable size, others will be overmature and defective, and others will still be unmerchantable. To reduce this unbalance and to obtain more economic returns, in the early stage, one kind of cleaning is done which is known as precommercial thinning. Generally, one or two times precommercial thinning is done to facilitate the growth of the tree\nThe yield of merchantable wood can be greatly increased and the rotation shortened by precommercial thinning.<ref name=\"Day 1967\">Day, M.W. 1967.

Sta., East Lansing MI, Quarterly Bull 50:59\u201362.</ref> Mechanical and chemical methods have been applied, but their costliness has militated against their ready adoption.\n\n===Pruning===\n[[Pruning]], as a silvicultural practice, refers to the removal of the lower branches of the young trees (also giving the shape to the tree) so clear [[Wood#Knots|knot]]-free wood can subsequently grow over the branch stubs. Clear knot-free [[lumber]] has a higher value. Pruning has been extensively carried out in the [[Monterey pine|Radiata pine]] plantations of [[New Zealand]] and [[Chile]], however the development of [[Finger joint]] technology in the production of [[lumber]] and [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]] has led to many forestry companies reconsidering their pruning practices. \"Brashing\" is an alternative name for the same process.<ref>[http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/brashing The Dictionary of Forestry, The Society of American Foresters]</ref>\nPruning can be done to all trees, or more cost effectively to a limited number of trees. There are two types of pruning: natural or self-pruning and artificial pruning. Most cases of self-pruning happen when branches do not receive enough sunlight and die. Wind can also take part in natural pruning which can break branches.<ref>Smith, D.M., B.C. Larson, M.J. Kelty, and P.M.S. Ashton. ''The Practice of Silviculture: Applied Forest Ecology.'' 9th edition. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Print.</ref> Artificial pruning is where people are paid to come and cut the branches. Or it can be natural, where trees are planted close enough that the effect is to cause self-pruning of low branches as energy is put into growing up for light reasons and not branchiness.\n\n===Stand Conversion===\n\nThe term ''stand conversion'' refers to a change from one silvicultural system to another and includes ''species conversion'', i.e., a change from one species (or set of species) to another.<ref name=\"ford\" /> Such change can be effected intentionally by various silvicultural means, or incidentally by default e.g., when high-grading has removed the [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] content from a [[mixedwood stand]], which then becomes exclusively self-perpetuating [[aspen]]. In general, such sites as these are the most likely to be considered for conversion.\n\n==Growth and yield==\n\nIn discussing yields that might be expected from the Canadian [[spruce]] forests, Haddock (1961)<ref name=\"Haddock 1961\">Haddock, P.G. 1961. Silvicultural views on the Canadian spruce forests. For. Chron. 37(4):376\u2013389.</ref> noted that Wright's (1959)<ref name=\"wri\">Wright, T.G. 1959. The Canadian spruce forest. For. Chron. 35(4):291\u2013297.</ref> quotation of spruce yields in the British Isles of 220 cubic feet per acre (15.4 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) per year and in Germany of 175 cubic feet per acre (12.25 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) per year was misleading, at least if it was meant to imply that such yields might be approached in the [[Taiga|Boreal Forest]] Region of Canada. Haddock thought that Wright's suggestion of 20 to 40 (average 30) cubic feet per acre (1.4 m<sup>3</sup>/ha to 2.8 m<sup>3</sup>/ha (average 2.1 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) per year was more reasonable, but still somewhat optimistic.\n\nThe principal way forest resource managers influence growth and yield is to manipulate the mixture of species and number (density) and distribution (stocking) of individuals that form the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of the stand.<ref name=\"dav\">Davis, L.S.; Johnson, K.N. 1987.

Resour. 650 p.</ref> Species composition of much of the [[Taiga|boreal]] forest in North America already differs greatly from its pre-exploitation state. There is less [[spruce]] and more [[hardwood]]s in the second-growth forest than in the original forest; Hearnden et al. (1996)<ref name=\"hear\">Hearnden, K.W.; Millson, S.V.; Wilson, W.C. 1996. Ontario Independent Forest Audit Committee. Ont. Min. Nat. Resour., Sault Ste. Marie ON. 117 p.</ref> calculated that the spruce cover type had declined from 18% to only 4% of the total forested area in Ontario. Mixedwood occupies a greater proportion of Ontario's second-growth forest (41%) than in the original (36%), but its component of white spruce is certainly much diminished.\n\nGrowth performance is certainly influenced by site conditions and thus by the kind and degree of site preparation in relation to the nature of the site. It is important to avoid the assumption that site preparation of a particular designation will have a particular silvicultural outcome. Scarification, for instance, not only covers a wide range of operations that scarify, but also any given way of scarifying can have significantly different results depending on site conditions at the time of treatment. In point of fact, the term is commonly misapplied. ''Scarification'' is defined<ref name=\"ford\" /> as \"Loosening the top soil of open areas, or breaking up the forest floor, in preparation for regenerating by direct seeding or natural seedfall\", but the term is often misapplied to practices that include scalping, screefing, and blading, which pare off low and surface vegetation, together with most off its roots to expose a weed-free surface, generally in preparation for sowing or planting thereon.\n\nThus, it is not surprising that literature can be used to support the view that the growth of seedlings on scarified sites is much superior to that of growth on similar sites that have not been scarified,<ref name=\"wald4\">Waldron, R.M. 1966.

Surface temperatures in sandy soils on occasion reach lethal temperatures of 50&nbsp;\u00b0C to 60&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==Common methods of harvesting==\nSilvicultural regeneration methods combine both the harvest of the timber on the stand and re-establishment of the forest. The proper practice of sustainable forestry<ref>[http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_02.html Oregon State University Extension Service]</ref> should mitigate the potential negative impacts, but all harvest methods will have some impacts on the land and residual stand.<ref>[http://www.cnrhome.uidaho.edu/default.aspx?pid=73972 RESIDUAL DAMAGE IN A CONIFER STAND THINNED WITH A CTL SYSTEM, University of Idaho]</ref> The practice of sustainable forestry limits the impacts such that the values of the forest are maintained in perpetuity. Silvicultural prescriptions are specific solutions to a specific set of circumstances and management objectives.<ref>8 Bauhus, J\u00fcrgen 2009;</ref>  Following are some common methods:\n\n===Clearcut harvesting===\nConventional clearcut harvesting is relatively simple: all trees on a cutblock are felled and bunched with bunches aligned to the skidding direction, and a skidder then drags the bunches to the closest log deck.<ref name=\"saud\">Sauder, E.A. 1996. Techniques to maintain a windfirm understory. p. 31 ''in'' FERIC West, Vancouver BC, Work Program 1996.</ref> Feller-buncher operators concentrate on the width of the felled swath, the number of trees in a bunch, and the alignment of the bunch. Providing a perimeter boundary is felled during daylight, night-shift operations can continue without the danger of trespassing beyond the block. Productivity of equipment is maximized because units can work independently of one another.\n\n===[[Clearcutting]]===\nAn [[Even-aged timber management|even-aged regeneration method]] that can employ either natural or [[Treeplanting|artificial]] regeneration. It involves the complete removal of the forest stand at one time.<ref>''Effects of Group-Selection Opening Size on Breeding Bird Habitat Use in a Bottomland Forest.'' Christopher E. Moorman and David C. Guynn Jr.\n Ecological Applications, Vol. 11, No. 6 (Dec., 2001), pp. 1680-1691. Web. 4 Oct. 2013.</ref>  Clearcutting can be biologically appropriate with species that typically regenerate from stand replacing fires or other major [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]], such as [[Lodgepole Pine]] (''Pinus contorta''). Alternatively, clearcutting can change the dominating species on a stand with the introduction of non-native and invasive species as was shown at the Blodgett Experimental Forest near Georgetown California. Additionally, clearcutting can prolong [[Slash (logging)|slash]] decomposition, expose soil to erosion, impact visual appeal of a landscape and remove essential wildlife habitat. It is particularly useful in regeneration of tree species such as [[Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'') which is [[List of shade-tolerant species|shade intolerant]].{{Verify source|date=April 2012}}.  In addition, the general public's distaste for even-aged silviculture, particularly clearcutting, is likely to result in a greater role for uneven-aged management on public lands as well.<ref>9 Schulte, Benedict J. 1998;</ref> Across Europe, and in parts of North America, even-aged, production-orientated and intensively managed plantations are beginning to be regarded in the same way as old industrial complexes: something to abolish or convert to something else.<ref>12 Gamborg, Christian 2003;</ref>\n\nClearcutting will impact many site factors important in their effect on regeneration, including air and [[soil]] temperatures. Kubin and Kemppainen (1991),<ref name=\"kubin\">Kubin, E.; Kemppainen, L. 1991. Effect of clearcutting of boreal spruce forest on air and soil temperature conditions. Acta Forestalia Fennica No. 225. 42 p.</ref> for instance, measured temperatures in northern Finland from 1974 through 1985 in 3 clear-felled areas and in 3 neighouring forest stands dominated by [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]]. Clear felling had no significant influence on air temperature at 2 m above the ground surface, but the daily air temperature maxima at 10&nbsp;cm were greater in the clear-felled area than in the uncut forest, while the daily minima at 10&nbsp;cm were lower. Night frosts were more common in the clear-felled area. Daily soil temperatures at 5&nbsp;cm depth were 2&nbsp;\u00b0C to 3&nbsp;\u00b0C greater in the clear-felled area than in the uncut forest, and temperatures at depths of 50&nbsp;cm and 100&nbsp;cm were 3&nbsp;\u00b0C to 5&nbsp;\u00b0C greater. The differences between the clear-felled and uncut areas did not diminish during the 12 years following cutting.\n\n===[[Coppicing]]===\nA regeneration method which depends on the sprouting of cut trees.  Most hardwoods, the [[coast redwood#Reproduction|coast redwood]], and certain pines naturally sprout from stumps and can be managed through coppicing. Coppicing is generally used to produce fuelwood, pulpwood, and other products dependent on small trees. A close relative of coppicing is [[pollarding]].<ref>Smith, D.M., B.C. Larson, M.J. Kelty, P.M.S. Ashton (1997) The Practice of Silviculture: Applied Forest Ecology, John Wiley & Sons, p. 340-46</ref> Three systems of coppice woodland management are generally recognized: simple coppice, coppice with standards, and the coppice selection system.<ref>10 Harmer, R. 2004;</ref>\n*In Compound coppicing or '''coppicing with standards''', some of the highest quality trees are retained for multiple rotations in order to obtain larger trees for different purposes.\n\n===Direct seeding===\nProchnau (1963),<ref name=\"proch\">Prochnau, A.E. 1963. Direct seeding experiments with white spruce, alpine fir, Douglas fir and lodgepole pine in the central interior of British Columbia. B.C. Min. For. Lands, Victoria BC, MOFL No. 37, Res Note. 24 p. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).</ref> 4 years after sowing, found that 14% of viable white spruce seed sown on mineral [[soil]] had produced surviving seedlings, at a seed:seedling ratio of 7.1:1.

(Cited in Coates et al. 1994).</ref> obtained average 7th year seed:seedling ratios of 21:1 on scarified seedbeds on dry sites, 38:1 on moist sites, and 111:1 on litter seedbeds.\n\n===[[Selection cutting#Group selection|Group selection]]===\nThe group selection method is an uneven-aged regeneration method that can be used when mid-tolerant species regeneration is desired.  The group selection method can still result in residual stand damage in dense stands, however directional falling can minimize the damage.  Additionally, [[forester]]s can select across the range of diameter classes in the stand and maintain a mosaic of age and diameter classes.\n\n===M\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le===\nClassical European silviculture achieved impressive results with systems such as Henri Biolley's ''m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le'' in Switzerland, in which the number and size of trees harvested were determined by reference to data collected from every tree in every stand measured every 7 years.<ref name=\"bio\">Biolley, H. 1920. L'am\u00e9nagement des for\u00eats par la m\u00e9thode exp\u00e9rimentale et sp\u00e9cialement la m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le. Paris, Attinger fr\u00e8res. 90 p.</ref>\n\nWhile not designed to be applied to boreal mixedwoods, the ''m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le'' is described briefly here to illustrate the degree of sophistication applied by some European foresters to the management of their forests. Development of management techniques that allowed for stand development to be monitored and guided into sustainable paths were in part a response to past experience, particularly in Central European countries, of the negative effects of pure, uniform stands with species often unsuited to the site, which greatly increased the risk of [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and biotic diseases. Increased mortality and decreased increment generated widespread concern, especially after reinforcement by other environmental stresses.\n\nMore or less uneven-aged, mixed forests of preponderantly native species, on the other hand, treated along natural lines, have proved to be healthier and more resistant to all kinds of external dangers; and in the long run such stands are more productive and easier to protect.\n\nHowever, irregular stands of this type are definitely more difficult to manage\u2014new methods and techniques had to be sought particularly for the establishment of inventories, as well as increment control and yield regulation. In Germany, for instance, since the beginning of the nineteenth century under the influence of G.L. Hartig (1764\u20131837), yield regulation has been effected almost exclusively by allotment or formula methods based on the conception of the uniform normal forest with a regular succession of cutting areas.\n\nIn France, on the other hand, efforts were made to apply another kind of forest management, one that aimed to bring all parts of the forest to a state of highest productive capacity in perpetuity. In 1878, the French forester A. Gurnaud (1825\u20131898) published a description of a ''m\u00e9thode du contr\u00f4le'' for determining increment and yield. The method was based on the fact that through careful, selective harvesting, the productivity of the residual stand can be improved, because timber is removed as a cultural operation. In this method, the increment of stands is accurately determined periodically with the object of gradually converting the forest, through selective management and continuous experimentation, to a condition of equilibrium at maximum productive capacity.\n\nHenri Biolley (1858\u20131939) was the first to apply Gurnaud's inspired ideas to practical forestry. From 1890 on, he managed the forests of his Swiss district according to these principles, devoting himself for almost 50 years to the study of increment and a treatment of stands directed towards the highest production, and proving the practicability of the check method. In 1920, he published this study giving a theoretical basis of management of forests under the check method, describing the procedures to be applied in practice (which he partly developed and simplified), and evaluating the results.\n\nBiolley's pioneering work formed the basis upon which most Swiss forest management practices were later developed, and his ideas have been generally accepted. Today, with the trend of intensifying forest management and productivity in most countries, the ideas and application of careful, continuous treatment of stands with the aid of the volume check method are meeting with ever-growing interest. In Britain and Ireland, for example, there is increased application of [[Continuous Cover Forestry]] principles to create permanently irregular structures in many woodlands.<ref>Helliwell, R., and E. R. Wilson. (2012). Continuous cover forestry in Britain: challenges and opportunities..Quarterly Journal of Forestry 106(3): 214-224 [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260031518_Continuous_cover_forestry_in_Britain_challenges_and_opportunities]</ref>\n\n===[[Patch cut]]===\n\n===Row and broadcast seeding===\nSpot and row seeders use less seed that does broadcast ground or aerial seeding but may induce clumping. Row and spot seeding confer greater ability to control seed placement than does broadcast seeding. Also, only a small percentage of the total area needs to be treated.\n\nIn the aspen type of the Great Lakes region, direct sowing of the seed of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] has usually failed.<ref name=\"kitt\" /> However, Gardner (1980)<ref name=\"gard\">Gardner, A.C. 1980. Regeneration problems and options for white spruce on river floodplains in the Yukon Territory. p. 19\u201324 ''in'' Murray, M.; Van Veldhuizen, R.M. (Eds.). Forest Regeneration at High,</ref> after trials in Yukon, which included broadcast seeding of white spruce seed at 2.24&nbsp;kg/ha that secured 66.5% stocking in the Scarified Spring Broadcast treatment 3 years after seeding, concluded that the technique held \"considerable promise\".\n\n===[[Seedstock|Seed-tree]]===\nAn even-aged regeneration method that retains widely spaced residual trees in order to provide uniform seed dispersal across a harvested area. In the seed-tree method, 2-12 seed trees per acre (5-30/ha) are left standing in order to regenerate the forest. They will be retained until regeneration has become established at which point they may be removed. It may not always be economically viable or biologically desirable to re-enter the stand to remove the remaining seed trees. Seed-tree cuts can also be viewed as a clearcut with natural regeneration and can also have all of the problems associated with clearcutting. This method is most suited for light-seeded species and those not prone to [[windthrow]].\n\n===Selection systems===\nSelection systems are appropriate where uneven stand structure is desired, particularly where the need to retain [[Continuous Cover Forestry|continuous cover forest]] for aesthetic or environmental reasons outweighs other management considerations. Selection logging has been suggested as being of greater utility than shelterwood systems in regenerating old-growth Engelmann Spruce Sub-alpine Fir (ESSF) stands in southern British Columbia.<ref name=\"weet\">Weetman, G.; Vyse, A. 1990.

The Hakmet seed shelter, for instance, is a semi-transparent plastic cone 8&nbsp;cm high, with openings of 7&nbsp;cm diameter in the 7.5&nbsp;cm diameter base and 17&nbsp;mm diameter in the 24&nbsp;mm diameter top.<ref name=\"lah\">L\u00e4hde, F. and Tuohisaari, O. 1976.

The shelter is designed to break down after a few years of exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\n\nSeed shelters and spring sowing significantly improved stocking compared with bare spot seeding, but sheltering did not significantly improve growth. Stocking of bare seedspots was extremely low, possibly due to smothering of seedlings by abundant broadleaf and herbaceous litter, particularly that from aspen and red raspberry, and exacerbated by strong competition from graminoids and raspberry.\n\nCone shelters (Cerkon\u2122) usually produced greater survival than unsheltered seeding on scarified seedspots in trials of direct seeding techniques in interior Alaska, and funnel shelters (Cerbel\u2122) usually produced greater survival than unsheltered seeding on non-scarified seedspots.<ref name=\"put2\">Putman, W.E.; Zasada, J.C. 1986.

Damage by ravens was only 0.13% on unburned but otherwise similar areas.\n\nIn seeding trials in Manitoba between 1960 and 1966 aimed at converting [[aspen]] stands to spruce\u2013aspen mixedwoods, 1961 scarification in the [[Duck Mountain Provincial Forest]] remained receptive to natural seeding for many years.<ref name=\"dyck\">Dyck, J.R. 1994.

The success of practising a shelterwood system is closely related to: 1. the length of the regeneration period, i.e. the time from the shelterwood cutting to the date when a new generation of trees has been established; 2.the quality of the new tree stand with respect to stand density and growth; and 3.the value increment of the shelter trees. Information on the establishment, survival and growth of seedlings influenced by the cover of shelter trees, as well as on the growth of these trees, is needed as a basis for modelling the economic return of practising a shelterwood system.<ref>4 Holg\u00e9n, Per 2000; 4 Holg\u00e9n, Per 2000;</ref> The method's objective is to establish new forest reproduction under the shelter of the retained trees. Unlike the seed-tree method, residual trees alter [[understory]] environmental conditions (i.e. sunlight, temperature, and moisture) that influence tree seedling growth. This method can also find a middle ground with the light ambiance by having less light accessible to competitors while still being able to provide enough light for tree regeneration.<ref>''Survival and Growth of Under-Planted Trees: A Meta-Analysis across Four Biomes''.\n Alain Paquette, Andr\u00e9 Bouchard and Alain Cogliastro\n Ecological Applications, Vol. 16, No. 4 (Aug., 2006), pp. 1575-1589</ref> Hence, shelterwood methods are most often chosen for site types characterized by extreme conditions, in order to create a new tree generation within a reasonable time period. These conditions are valid foremost on level ground sites which are either dry and poor or moist and fertile.<ref>4 Holg\u00e9n, Per 2000;</ref>\n\n===Shelterwood systems===\nShelterwood systems involve 2, 3, or exceptionally more partial cuttings. A final cut is made once adequate natural [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] has been obtained. The shelterwood system is most commonly applied as a 2-cut uniform shelterwood, first an initial regeneration (seed) cut, the second a final harvest cut. In stands less than 100 years old, a light preparatory cut can be useful.<ref name=\"zas1\" /> A series of intermediate cuts at intervals of 10\u201320 years has been recommended for intensively managed stands.<ref name=\"alex4\" />\n\nFrom operational or economic standpoints, however, there are disadvantages to the shelterwood system: harvesting costs are higher; trees left for deferred cutting may be damaged during the regeneration cut or related extraction operations; the increased risk of blowdown threatens the seed source; damage from bark beetles is likely to increase; regeneration may be damaged during the final cut and related extraction operations; the difficulty of any site preparation would be increased; and incidental damage to regeneration might be caused by any site preparation operations.<ref name=\"alex3\" /><ref name=\"Day 1970\">Day, M.W.; Rudolph, V.J. 1970.

Understorey white spruce is of particular importance in mixedwoods dominated by [[aspen]], as in the B15, B18a, and B19a Sections of Manitoba,<ref name=\"rowe2\">Rowe, J.S 1972. Forest regions of Canada. Can. Dep. Environ., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa ON, Publ. 1300. 172 p.</ref> and elsewhere. Until the latter part of the last century, white spruce understorey was mostly viewed as money in the bank on a long-term, low interest deposit, with final yield to be realized after slow natural succession,<ref name=\"brace3\">Brace, L.; Bella, I. 1988. Understanding the understorey: dilemma and opportunity. ''In'' White spruce understories. Canada\u2013Alberta Agreement, Projects 1480, 1488, 20204. For. Can., Northern For. Centre, Edmonton AB. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994)</ref> but the resource became increasingly threatened with the intensification of harvesting of aspen. White spruce plantations on mixedwood sites proved expensive, risky, and generally unsuccessful.<ref name=\"brace3\" /> This prompted efforts to see what might be done about growing aspen and white spruce on the same landbase by protecting existing white spruce advance growth, leaving a range of viable crop trees during the first cut, then harvesting both [[hardwood]]s and spruce in the final cut. Information about the understorey component is critical to spruce management planning. The ability of then current harvesting technology and crews employed to provide adequate protection for white spruce understories was questioned by Brace and Bella. Specialized equipment and training, perhaps with financial incentives, may be needed to develop procedures that would confer the degree of protection needed for the system to be feasible. Effective understorey management planning requires more than improved mixedwood inventory.\n\nAvoidance of damage to the understorey will always be a desideratum.

Sauder concluded that: (1) operational measures that protected residual stems may not unduly increase costs, (2) all felling, conifers and hardwoods, needs to be done in one operation to minimize the entry of the feller-buncher into the residual stand, (3) several operational procedures can reduce understorey damage, some of them without incurring extra costs, and (4) successful harvesting of treatment blocks depends primarily on the intelligent location of skid trails and landings. In summary, the key to protecting the white spruce understorey without sacrificing logging efficiency is a combination of good planning, good supervision, the use of appropriate equipment, and having conscientious, well-trained operators.Even the best plan will not reduce understorey damage unless its implementation is supervised.<ref name=\"saud2\">Sauder, E.A.; Sinclair, A.W.J. 1989.

Formerly, white spruce in the understories had developed to commercial size through natural succession under the protection of the hardwoods. Brace articulated a widespread concern: \"The need for protection of spruce as a component of boreal mixedwoods goes beyond concern for the future commercial softwood timber supply. Concerns also include fisheries and wildlife habitat, aesthetics and recreation, a general dissatisfaction with cleacutting in mixedwoods and a strong interest in mixedwood perpetuation, as expressed recently in 41 public meetings on forestry development in northern Alberta...\".<ref name=\"brace1\" />\n\nOn the basis of tests of 3 logging systems in Alberta, Brace (1990)<ref name=\"brace2\">Brace, L. 1990.

On sites with a white spruce understorey, a regression model related the abundance of regeneration to rotten wood cover, spruce basal area, pine basal area, soil clay fraction, and grass cover (R\u00b2 = 0.36). About half the seedlings surveyed grew on rotten wood, and only 3% on mineral soil, and seedlings were 10 times more likely to have established on these substrates than on litter.

The purpose is to facilitate the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of that site by the chosen method. Site preparation may be designed to achieve, singly or in any combination: improved access, by reducing or rearranging slash, and amelioration of adverse forest floor, soil, vegetation, or other biotic factors. Site preparation is undertaken to ameliorate one or more constraints that would otherwise be likely to thwart the objectives of management. A valuable bibliography on the effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and [[Taiga|boreal]] tree species has been prepared by McKinnon et al. (2002).<ref name=\"mck\">McKinnon, L.M.; Mitchell, A.K.; Vyse, A. 2002. The effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and boreal tree species: a bibliography. Nat.

Chron. 46:448\u2013451.</ref>\n\nPrescribed burning is carried out primarily for slash hazard reduction and to improve site conditions for regeneration; all or some of the following benefits may accrue:\n\n:a) Reduction of logging slash, plant competition, and humus prior to direct seeding, planting, scarifying or in anticipation of natural seeding in partially cut stands or in connection with seed-tree systems.\n\n:b) Reduction or elimination of unwanted forest cover prior to planting or seeding, or prior to preliminary scarification thereto.\n\n:c) Reduction of humus on cold, moist sites to favour regeneration.\n\n:d) Reduction or elimination of slash, grass, or brush fuels from strategic areas around forested land to reduce the chances of damage by wildfire.\n\nPrescribed burning for preparing sites for direct seeding was tried on a few occasions in Ontario, but none of the burns was hot enough to produce a seedbed that was adequate without supplementary mechanical site preparation.<ref name=\"scott\">Scott, J.D. 1970. Direct seeding in Ontario. For. Chron. 46(6):453\u2013457.</ref>\n\nChanges in soil chemical properties associated with burning include significantly increased pH, which Macadam (1987)<ref name=\"Macadam 1987\" /> in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone of central British Columbia found persisting more than a year after the burn. Average fuel consumption was 20 to 24 t/ha and the forest floor depth was reduced by 28% to 36%. The increases correlated well with the amounts of slash (both total and \u22657&nbsp;cm diameter) consumed. The change in pH depends on the severity of the burn and the amount consumed; the increase can be as much as 2 units, a 100-fold change.<ref name=\"holt\">Holt, L. 1955.

Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.\n\nMarked increases in exchangeable calcium also correlated with the amount of slash at least 7&nbsp;cm in diameter consumed.<ref name=\"Macadam 1987\" /> Phosphorus availability also increased, both in the forest floor and in the 0&nbsp;cm to 15&nbsp;cm mineral soil layer, and the increase was still evident, albeit somewhat diminished, 21 months after burning. However, in another study<ref name=\"tay\">Taylor, S.W.; Feller, M.C. 1987. Initial effects of slashburning on the nutrient status of Sub-boreal Spruce Zone ecosystems.

Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.\n\nThe ''Picea/Abies'' forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974)<ref name=\"end\">Endean, F.; Johnstone, W.D. 1974. Prescribed fire and regeneration on clearcut spruce\u2013fir sites in the foothills of Alberta. Environ. Can., Can. For. Serv., Northern For. Res. Centre, Edmonton AB, Inf. Rep. NOR-X-126. 33 p.</ref> describe experiments to test prescribed burning as a means of seedbed preparation and site amelioration on representative clear-felled ''Picea/Abies'' areas. Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.\n\n===Ameliorative intervention===\n\nSlash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem < 4 inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the [[Wildfire|forest fire]] hazard on harvested sites.<ref name=\"kii1\">Kiil, A.D. 1965. Weight and size distribution of slash of white spruce and lodgepole pine. For. Chron. 41:432\u2013437.</ref> Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968).<ref name=\"kii2\">Kiil, A.D. 1968. Weight of the fuel complex in 70-year-old lodgepole pine stands of different densities. Department of Forestry and Rural Development, Forest Research Laboratory, Calgary, Alberta. Departmental Publication 1228. 13 p.</ref> In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (<1.27&nbsp;cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil's study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.\n\nThe need to provide shade for young outplants of [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] in the high [[Rocky Mountains]] is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material.<ref name=\"ronco\">Ronco, F. 1975. Diagnosis: sunburned trees. J. For. 73(1):31\u201335. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).</ref> Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.\n\n===Access===\n\nSite preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.\n\nWang et al. (2000)<ref name=\"wang\">Wang, G.G.; Siemens, A.; Keenan, V.; Philippot, D. 2000. Survival and growth of black and white spruce seedlings in relation to stock type, site preparation and plantation type in southeastern Manitoba. For. Chron. 76(5):775\u2013782.</ref> determined field performance of white and black spruces 8 and 9 years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in 2 plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97&nbsp;cm\u00b3) compared with black spruce sheltered (210&nbsp;cm\u00b3), as well as white spruce open (175&nbsp;cm\u00b3) and sheltered (229&nbsp;cm\u00b3) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329&nbsp;cm\u00b3) than open plantations (204&nbsp;cm\u00b3). Wang et al. (2000)<ref name=\"wang\" /> recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.\n\n===Mechanical===\n\nUp to 1970, no \"sophisticated\" site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario,<ref name=\"hall\">Hall, J. 1970. Site preparation in Ontario. For. Chron. 46:445\u2013447.</ref> but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.\n\nAccording to J. Hall (1970),<ref name=\"hall\" /> in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.\n\nJ. Hall's (1970)<ref name=\"hall\" /> report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant [[hardwood]] stands for natural regeneration of [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]]. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine\u2013spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been \"quite successful\" for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.\n\n===Mounding===\n\nSite preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985),<ref name=\"drap\">Draper, D.; Binder, W.; Fahlman, R.; Spittlehouse, D. 1985. Post-planting ecophysiology of Interior spruce. Interior Spruce Seedling Performance: State of the Art. Northern Silvic. Committee, Prince George BC. 18 p. (mimeo).</ref> for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).\n\nThe mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5&nbsp;cm and 10&nbsp;cm averaged 10 and 7&nbsp;\u00b0C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25&nbsp;\u00b0C to 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C at 10&nbsp;cm depth 5 days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until 58 days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had 3 times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10&nbsp;\u00b0C than did the control microsites.\n\nDraper et al.'s (1985)<ref name=\"drap\" /> mounds received 5 times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 \u00b5Em\u203e\u00b2s\u203e1 intensity range is the most important for [[photosynthesis]], the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.\n\n===Orientation of linear site preparation, e.g., disk-trenching===\n\nWith linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by [[topography]] or other considerations, but where the orientation can be chosen, it can make a significant difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants ([[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench; in north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows.<ref name=\"burt\">Burton, P.; Bedford, L.; Goldstein, M.; Osberg, M. 2000.

{"title_page": "Ketogenic diet", "text_new": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n{{short description|High-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet}}\n{{About|a dietary therapy for epilepsy|information on ketogenic diets as a lifestyle choice or for weight loss|Low-carbohydrate diet}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Ketonuria.jpg|thumb|alt=A test strip is compared with a colour chart that indicates the degree of ketonuria.|Testing for [[ketonuria|ketone bodies in urine]]]]\nThe '''ketogenic diet''' is a high-[[fat]], adequate-[[protein]], [[low-carbohydrate diet]] that in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) [[epilepsy]] in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than [[carbohydrate]]s. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into [[glucose]], which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in [[Brain metabolism|fueling brain function]]. However, if little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the [[liver]] converts [[triacylglycerol|fat]] into [[fatty acid]]s and [[ketone bodies]]. The ketone bodies pass into the [[brain]] and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as [[ketosis]], leads to a reduction in the frequency of [[epileptic seizure]]s.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Some evidence indicates that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified [[Atkins diet]], is similarly effective.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Potential side effects may include [[constipation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], growth slowing, [[acidosis]], and [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]].<ref name=Kossoff2013/>\n\nThe original therapeutic diet for [[epilepsy in children|paediatric epilepsy]] provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient [[food energy|calories]]<ref name=Units group=Note/> to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic [https://www.ketofy.in/what-is-keto-diet/ '''ketogenic diet'''] was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective [[anticonvulsant]] medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1  ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs)\u2014made from fatty acids with shorter [[carbon chain]]s than LCTs\u2014are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of [[coconut oil]], which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.<ref name=Liu2008/><ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]], whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] program and ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'' (1997), a [[television movie|made-for-television film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]]. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which\u2014announced in 1996\u2014marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/> \n\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\n==Epilepsy==\n[[Epilepsy]] is one of the most common [[neurology|neurological]] disorders after [[stroke]],<ref name=Stafstrom2004/> affecting around 50&nbsp;million people worldwide.<ref name=deBoer2008/> It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked [[seizure]]s. These occur when [[cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] [[neuron]]s fire excessively, [[Hypersynchronization of electrophysiological activity in epilepsy|hypersynchronously]], or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be [[focal seizure|focal]] (confined to a specific part of the brain) or [[generalised seizure|generalised]] (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic [[syndrome]]s, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three [[anticonvulsant]] drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include [[epilepsy surgery]], [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n==History==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[Mainstream#In science|mainstream]] dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of [[fasting]] to treat epilepsy.<ref name=Fasting group=Note/> Although popular in the 1920s and '30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20\u201330% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.<ref name=Freeman2007/><ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Fasting===\n[[File:Conklin Fasting - NewYorkTimes.png|thumb|alt=Scan of newspaper column. See image description page for full text.|A news report of Dr Hugh Conklin's \"water diet\" treatment from 1922]]\n\nPhysicians of [[ancient Greece]] treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'', covers the disease; it  dates from {{circa|400 BC}}. Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis.<ref name=Hippocrates1 group=Note/> In the same collection, the author of ''Epidemics'' describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink.<ref name=Hippocrates2 group=Note/> The royal physician [[Erasistratus]] declared, \"One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations.\"<ref name=Galen1 group=Note/> [[Galen]] believed an \"attenuating diet\"<ref name=Galen2 group=Note/> might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.<ref name=Temkin1971/>\n\nThe first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911.<ref name=Guelpa1911/> Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were \"detoxified\" by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients' mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, [[potassium bromide]], which dulled the mind.<ref name=Bailey2005/>\n\nAround this time, [[Bernarr Macfadden]], an American exponent of [[physical culture]], popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] Dr. Hugh William Conklin of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the [[Peyer's patches]] in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25&nbsp;days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his \"water diet\" and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin's case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nConklin's fasting therapy was adopted by [[neurology|neurologists]] in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the ''New York Medical Journal'' claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the [[American Medical Association]] convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite having studied the patients for only a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. [[Charles P. Howland]], the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study \"the ketosis of starvation\". As professor of paediatrics at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist [[Stanley Cobb]] and his assistant [[William G. Lennox]].<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Diet===\nIn 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and [[diabetes]]. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]], and [[acetone]] (known collectively as [[ketone bodies]]), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.<ref name=Wheless2004/> Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the [[Mayo Clinic]], built on this research and coined the term \"ketogenic diet\" to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood ([[ketonemia]]) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nWilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10\u201315&nbsp;g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka, Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.<ref name=Wheless2004/><ref name=Kossoff2007/>\n\n===Anticonvulsants and decline===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative [[Potassium bromide|bromides]] (discovered 1857) and [[phenobarbital]] (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when [[H. Houston Merritt|H. Houston Merritt, Jr.]] and [[Tracy Putnam]] discovered [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of [[sodium valproate]] in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as [[Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome]], declined further.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===MCT diet===\n[[File:Liquigen edit.jpg|thumb|alt=A glass bottle of 250 ml of Liquigen, a white opaque liquid|[[Medium-chain triglyceride]] (MCT) oil emulsion]]\nIn the 1960s,  [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides).<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the [[hepatic portal system]] rather than the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name=Neal2008/> The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, [[Peter Huttenlocher]] devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Revival===\nThe ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]]. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to [[John M. Freeman (neurologist)|John M. Freeman]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research.<ref name=Wheless2004/> A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published<ref name=Vining1998/> in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'', starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\nBy 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\n==Efficacy==\nThe ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Some evidence indicates that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Trial design===\nEarly studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a [[Cohort study|cohort]] of patients recently treated by the physician (a [[retrospective study]]) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from [[selection bias]], as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a [[prospective cohort study|prospective cohort]] (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as [[Intention to treat analysis|intent-to-treat analysis]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nAnother difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged [[fasting|fast]], designed to lose 5\u201310% [[body weight]], and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Outcomes===\nA study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]<ref name=Freeman1998/> and followed-up by a report published in 2001.<ref name=Hemingway2001/> As with most studies of the ketogenic diet,  no [[control group]] (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free.<ref name=Reduction group=Note/> At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.<ref name=Hemingway2001/><ref name=Kossoff2009c/>\n\nIt is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone\u2014a statistical method known as [[meta-analysis]]. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients.<ref name=Henderson2006/> It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control<ref name=Neal2008 />, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/>\n\nA systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up with the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence was inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]], high total [[cholesterol]], and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Liu2018/>\n\n==Indications and contraindications==\n[[File:Anticonvulsants.jpg|thumb|alt=Anticonvulsants|Experts on the ketogenic diet recommend it be strongly considered for children with uncontrolled epilepsy who have tried and failed two or three anticonvulsant drugs;<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> most children who start the ketogenic diet have failed at least three times this number.<ref name=Bergqvist2004/>]]\nThe ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with [[drug-resistant epilepsy]].<ref name=NICE/><ref name=SIGN/> It is approved by national [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]] in Scotland,<ref name=SIGN/> England, and Wales<ref name=NICE/> and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies.<ref name=Turner2006/> Children with a focal [[lesion]] (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for [[epilepsy surgery|surgery]] are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Stainman2007/> About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants\u2014the low [[glycaemic index]] treatment and the modified Atkins diet\u2014to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are [[feeding tube|tube-fed]].<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/><ref name=Kossoff2004b/>\n\nAdvocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Kossoff2004a/><ref name=Spendiff2008/> The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include [[Dravet syndrome]], [[infantile spasms]], [[myoclonic-astatic epilepsy]], and [[tuberous sclerosis complex]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Wang2014/>\n\nA survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] and clinical practice.<ref name=Mastriani2008/> One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained [[dietitian]]s who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\nBecause the ketogenic diet alters the body's metabolism, it is a [[first-line therapy]] in children with certain [[congenital metabolic disease]]s such as [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency|pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency]] and [[De Vivo disease|glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome]],<ref name=Wang2018/> which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.<ref name=Huffman2006/> However, it is absolutely [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the treatment of other diseases such as [[pyruvate carboxylase deficiency]], [[porphyria]], and other rare [[Inborn errors of lipid metabolism|genetic disorders of fat metabolism]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to [[ketoacidosis]], and eventually coma and death.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\n==Interactions==\nThe ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. Some evidence of synergistic benefits is seen when the diet is combined with the [[vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulator]] or with the drug [[zonisamide]], and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving [[phenobarbital]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\nThe ketogenic diet is not considered a [[Benignity|benign]], holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery.<ref name=Turner2006/> Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include [[constipation]], low-grade [[acidosis]], and [[hypoglycaemia]] if an initial fast is undertaken. [[Hyperlipidemia|Raised levels of lipids in the blood]] affect up to 60% of children<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> and [[Hypercholesterolemia|cholesterol levels may increase]] by around 30%.<ref name=Turner2006/> This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many [[micronutrient]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nLong-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and [[kidney stone]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> The diet reduces levels of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]] ([[topiramate]], [[zonisamide]]) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone.<ref name=Sampath2007/> The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet.<ref name=Sampath2007/> Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral [[potassium citrate]] supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in one-seventh of the incidence of kidney stones.<ref name=McNally2009/> However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Excess calcium in the urine ([[hypercalciuria]]) occurs due to increased bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones are mainly composed of [[calcium phosphate]]. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Hypocitraturia: the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* The urine has a low pH, which stops [[uric acid]] from dissolving, leading to crystals that act as a [[wikt:nidus|nidus]] for calcium stone formation.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80% of normal daily needs;<ref name=Sampath2007/> this practice is no longer encouraged.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nIn adolescent and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, [[dyslipidemia]], and in women, [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name=Kossoff2006/>\n\n==Implementation==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[medical nutrition therapy]] that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric [[dietitian]] who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric [[neurologist]] who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a [[registered nurse]] who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a [[medical social worker]] who works with the family and a [[pharmacist]] who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nImplementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.<ref name=Vogelstein2010/>\n\n===Initiation===\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted.<ref name=Kim2008/> It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nAt the initial consultation, patients are [[screening (medicine)|screened]] for conditions that may [[contraindicate]] the diet. A dietary [[medical history|history]] is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nThe day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/> are allowed until dinner, which consists of \"[[eggnog]]\"<ref name=Eggnog group=Note/> restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the \"eggnog\" dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal's caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not \"eggnog\"). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nWhen in the hospital, [[blood sugar|glucose levels]] are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic [[ketosis]] (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks.<ref name=Vining1998/> The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/>\n\nVariations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using [[outpatient]] clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of [[metabolic acidosis|acidosis]], hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nFor patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/> Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Maintenance===\nAfter initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital [[dietitian]]<ref name=Hartman2007b/> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> [[ketonuria|Urinary ketone levels]] are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> This is performed using ketone test strips containing [[nitroprusside]], which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).<ref name=Musa-Veloso2004/>\n\nA short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if [[ketone]] levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even \"sugar-free\" food can contain carbohydrates such as [[maltodextrin]], [[sorbitol]], [[starch]], and [[fructose]]. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\n===Discontinuation===\nAbout 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions.<ref name=Martinez2007/> This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nChildren who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30\u201350% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an [[electroencephalogram]]  shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an [[MRI scan]] shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with [[tuberous sclerosis]]). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.<ref name=Martinez2007/>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Ketogenic diets pie MCT.svg|thumb|alt=A series of four pie charts for the typical American diet, the induction phase of the Atkins diet, the classic ketogenic diet, and the MCD ketogenic diet. The typical American diet has about half its calories from carbohydrates, where the others have very little carbohydrate. The Atkins diet is higher in protein than the others. Most of the fat in the MCT diet comes from MCT oil.|The ratio of calorific contributions from food components of four diets, by weight]]\n\nThe ketogenic diet is calculated by a [[dietitian]] for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80\u201390% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle [[spasticity]] require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18&nbsp;months, older than 12&nbsp;years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9&nbsp;kcal/g (38&nbsp;kJ/g) compared to 4&nbsp;kcal/g (17&nbsp;kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1&nbsp;g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or [[dietary supplement|supplements]] must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nA computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008b/> The meals often have four components: [[cream|heavy whipping cream]], a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic [[weighing scale|scale]] accurate to 1&nbsp;g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nThe classic ketogenic diet is not a [[balanced diet]] and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, [[Food fortification|fortified]] cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the [[B vitamins]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]] must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient's age: a [[multivitamin]] with [[Dietary mineral|minerals]] and [[calcium]] with vitamin D.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500&nbsp;kcal (6,300&nbsp;kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:<ref name=Turner2006/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Sample meal plan for one day\n!Meal\n!Menu idea\n!Ingredients\n|-\n|Breakfast\n|Egg with bacon\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g egg (about half an egg)\n* 11&nbsp;g bacon (about half a slice)\n* 37&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 23&nbsp;g butter\n* 9&nbsp;g slice of apple (about 5% of one apple)\n|-\n|Morning snack\n|Peanut butter ball\n(serving size: 0.5&nbsp;ounce)\n|\n* 6&nbsp;g peanut butter\n* 9&nbsp;g butter\n|-\n|Lunch\n|Tuna salad\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g tuna fish\n* 30&nbsp;g mayonnaise\n* 10&nbsp;g celery\n* 36&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 15&nbsp;g lettuce (one large leaf)\n|-\n|Afternoon snack\n|Keto yogurt\n(serving size: 1.3&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 18&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 17&nbsp;g sour cream\n* 4&nbsp;g strawberries (about half of one small strawberry)\n* [[artificial sweetener]]\n|-\n|Dinner\n|Cheeseburger (no bun)\n|\n* 22&nbsp;g [[Ground beef|minced (ground) beef]]\n* 10&nbsp;g [[American cheese]] (half a slice of cheese)\n* 26&nbsp;g butter\n* 38&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 10&nbsp;g lettuce (one medium leaf)\n* 11&nbsp;g green beans (one spoonful)\n|-\n|Evening snack\n|Keto custard\n(serving size: 1.2&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 25&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 9&nbsp;g egg (half a [[tablespoon]])\n* Pure, unsweetened vanilla flavouring\n|}\n\n===MCT oil===\nNormal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). [[Medium-chain triglycerides]] (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate,<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes.<ref name=Liu2008/> The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by [[health insurance|insurance companies]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Modified Atkins===\nFirst reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10&nbsp;g per day in children or 20&nbsp;g per day in adults, and are increased to 20\u201330&nbsp;g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/>\n\nThe modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/> Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favorably with the traditional ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Low glycemic index treatment===\nThe low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)<ref name=Pfeifer2013/> is an attempt to achieve the stable [[blood glucose]] levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet,<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat),<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40\u201360&nbsp;g per day.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nShort-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/><ref name=Muzykewicz2009/>\n\n===Prescribed formulations===\n[[File:Measuring Ketocal.jpg|thumb|alt=A cream-coloured powder is poured from a tin into a measuring jug on an electronic kitchen scale.|Measuring KetoCal\u2014a powdered formula for administering the classic ketogenic diet]]\nInfants and patients fed via a [[Feeding tube|gastrostomy tube]] can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/> Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total [[cholesterol]] than a solid ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> KetoCal is a [[Enteral formula|nutritionally complete food]] containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding.<ref name=KetoCal/> Other formula products include KetoVolve<ref name=KetoVolve/> and Ketonia.<ref name=KetoBottle/> Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.<ref name=KetoBottle/>\n\n===Worldwide===\nThere are theoretically no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory, so calculating macronutrients such as fat, protein and carbohydrates can be difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn Asia, the traditional diet includes rice and noodles as the main source of energy, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians and will not eat root vegetables and will try to avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.<ref name=Kossoff2008b/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\n\n===Seizure pathology===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = [[Ketone bodies]]\n\n | image1 = beta-Hydroxybutyric acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = Skeletal formula of 3-hydroxybutyric acid\n | caption1 = [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]]\n\n | image2 = Acetoacetic acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | alt2 = Skeletal formula of 3-oxobutanoic acid\n | caption2 = [[acetoacetic acid]]\n\n | image3 = Acetone-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width3 = 75\n | alt3 = Skeletal formula of acetone\n | caption3 = [[acetone]]\n}}\nThe brain is composed of a network of [[Neurotransmission|neurons that transmit signals]] by propagating [[nerve impulse]]s. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by [[neurotransmitter]]s, though there are also [[Electrical synapse|electrical pathways]] between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|\u03b3-aminobutyric acid]], or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by [[glutamate]]). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThe nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through [[Voltage-gated sodium channel|channels]] in the neuron's [[cell membrane]] followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]), which is mediated by another [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|potassium channel]]. The flow through these [[ion channel]]s is governed by a \"gate\" which is opened by either a voltage change or a [[Ligand-gated ion channel|chemical messenger]] known as a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThere are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n===Seizure control===\nAlthough many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include [[Metabolic acidosis|systemic acidosis]] (high levels of acid in the blood), [[Electrolyte disturbance|electrolyte changes]] and [[hypoglycaemia]] (low [[blood glucose]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nOn the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty-acid oxidation]] in the cell's [[mitochondria]] (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some [[amino acid]]s into glucose by a process called [[gluconeogenesis]], but cannot do this by using fatty acids.<ref name=Kerndt1982/> Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three [[ketone bodies]] [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]] and [[acetone]]. These ketone bodies enter the brain and ''partially'' substitute for [[blood glucose]] as a source of energy.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in [[animal model]]s, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the [[neuron]]s to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a [[neuroprotective]] effect.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant.  Conversely, [[fenofibrate]], not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental [[anticonvulsant]] properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Porta2009/>  This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nAnticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants ([[valproate]], [[levetiracetam]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\n==Other applications==\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[autism]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\nBecause some cancer cells are [[Warburg effect (oncology)|inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy]], the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer.<ref name=\"Baranano2008\" /><ref name=\"Allen2014\" />  A 2018 review looked at the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy. The clinical studies in humans are typically very small, with some providing weak evidence for anti-tumour effect, particularly for [[glioblastoma]], but in other cancers and studies, no anti-tumour effect was seen. Taken together, results from preclinical studies, albeit sometimes contradictory, tend to support an anti-tumor effect rather than a pro-tumor effect of the KD for most solid cancers.<ref name=Weber2018/>\n\nThe evidence of benefit for these conditions has not reached the level where clinical recommendations can be made.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Atkins diet]] \u2013 brand of low-carbohydrate diet\n* [[Ketosis]] \u2013 metabolic process that uses fats as an energy source\n* [[List of diets]]\n* [[Low-carbohydrate diet]] \u2013 varieties of diets that focus on reducing carbohydrates\n* [[Medium-chain triglyceride]] \u2013 easily absorbed, naturally occurring type of fat \n* [[Fad diet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em|group=Note|refs=\n{{#tag:ref|Ketogenic \"eggnog\" is used during induction and is a drink with the required ketogenic ratio.

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than [[carbohydrate]]s. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into [[glucose]], which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in [[Brain metabolism|fueling brain function]]. However, if little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the [[liver]] converts [[triacylglycerol|fat]] into [[fatty acid]]s and [[ketone bodies]]. The ketone bodies pass into the [[brain]] and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as [[ketosis]], leads to a reduction in the frequency of [[epileptic seizure]]s.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Some evidence indicates that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified [[Atkins diet]], is similarly effective.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Potential side effects may include [[constipation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], growth slowing, [[acidosis]], and [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]].<ref name=Kossoff2013/>\n\nThe original therapeutic diet for [[epilepsy in children|paediatric epilepsy]] provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient [[food energy|calories]]<ref name=Units group=Note/> to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective [[anticonvulsant]] medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1  ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs)\u2014made from fatty acids with shorter [[carbon chain]]s than LCTs\u2014are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of [[coconut oil]], which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.<ref name=Liu2008/><ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]], whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] program and ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'' (1997), a [[television movie|made-for-television film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]]. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which\u2014announced in 1996\u2014marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/> \n\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\n==Epilepsy==\n[[Epilepsy]] is one of the most common [[neurology|neurological]] disorders after [[stroke]],<ref name=Stafstrom2004/> affecting around 50&nbsp;million people worldwide.<ref name=deBoer2008/> It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked [[seizure]]s. These occur when [[cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] [[neuron]]s fire excessively, [[Hypersynchronization of electrophysiological activity in epilepsy|hypersynchronously]], or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be [[focal seizure|focal]] (confined to a specific part of the brain) or [[generalised seizure|generalised]] (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic [[syndrome]]s, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three [[anticonvulsant]] drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include [[epilepsy surgery]], [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n==History==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[Mainstream#In science|mainstream]] dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of [[fasting]] to treat epilepsy.<ref name=Fasting group=Note/> Although popular in the 1920s and '30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20\u201330% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.<ref name=Freeman2007/><ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Fasting===\n[[File:Conklin Fasting - NewYorkTimes.png|thumb|alt=Scan of newspaper column. See image description page for full text.|A news report of Dr Hugh Conklin's \"water diet\" treatment from 1922]]\n\nPhysicians of [[ancient Greece]] treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'', covers the disease; it  dates from {{circa|400 BC}}. Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis.<ref name=Hippocrates1 group=Note/> In the same collection, the author of ''Epidemics'' describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink.<ref name=Hippocrates2 group=Note/> The royal physician [[Erasistratus]] declared, \"One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations.\"<ref name=Galen1 group=Note/> [[Galen]] believed an \"attenuating diet\"<ref name=Galen2 group=Note/> might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.<ref name=Temkin1971/>\n\nThe first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911.<ref name=Guelpa1911/> Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were \"detoxified\" by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients' mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, [[potassium bromide]], which dulled the mind.<ref name=Bailey2005/>\n\nAround this time, [[Bernarr Macfadden]], an American exponent of [[physical culture]], popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] Dr. Hugh William Conklin of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the [[Peyer's patches]] in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25&nbsp;days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his \"water diet\" and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin's case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nConklin's fasting therapy was adopted by [[neurology|neurologists]] in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the ''New York Medical Journal'' claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the [[American Medical Association]] convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite having studied the patients for only a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. [[Charles P. Howland]], the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study \"the ketosis of starvation\". As professor of paediatrics at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist [[Stanley Cobb]] and his assistant [[William G. Lennox]].<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Diet===\nIn 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and [[diabetes]]. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]], and [[acetone]] (known collectively as [[ketone bodies]]), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.<ref name=Wheless2004/> Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the [[Mayo Clinic]], built on this research and coined the term \"ketogenic diet\" to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood ([[ketonemia]]) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nWilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10\u201315&nbsp;g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka, Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.<ref name=Wheless2004/><ref name=Kossoff2007/>\n\n===Anticonvulsants and decline===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative [[Potassium bromide|bromides]] (discovered 1857) and [[phenobarbital]] (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when [[H. Houston Merritt|H. Houston Merritt, Jr.]] and [[Tracy Putnam]] discovered [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of [[sodium valproate]] in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as [[Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome]], declined further.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===MCT diet===\n[[File:Liquigen edit.jpg|thumb|alt=A glass bottle of 250 ml of Liquigen, a white opaque liquid|[[Medium-chain triglyceride]] (MCT) oil emulsion]]\nIn the 1960s,  [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides).<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the [[hepatic portal system]] rather than the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name=Neal2008/> The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, [[Peter Huttenlocher]] devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Revival===\nThe ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]]. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to [[John M. Freeman (neurologist)|John M. Freeman]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research.<ref name=Wheless2004/> A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published<ref name=Vining1998/> in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'', starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\nBy 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\n==Efficacy==\nThe ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Some evidence indicates that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Trial design===\nEarly studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a [[Cohort study|cohort]] of patients recently treated by the physician (a [[retrospective study]]) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from [[selection bias]], as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a [[prospective cohort study|prospective cohort]] (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as [[Intention to treat analysis|intent-to-treat analysis]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nAnother difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged [[fasting|fast]], designed to lose 5\u201310% [[body weight]], and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Outcomes===\nA study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]<ref name=Freeman1998/> and followed-up by a report published in 2001.<ref name=Hemingway2001/> As with most studies of the ketogenic diet,  no [[control group]] (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free.<ref name=Reduction group=Note/> At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.<ref name=Hemingway2001/><ref name=Kossoff2009c/>\n\nIt is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone\u2014a statistical method known as [[meta-analysis]]. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients.<ref name=Henderson2006/> It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control<ref name=Neal2008 />, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/>\n\nA systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up with the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence was inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]], high total [[cholesterol]], and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Liu2018/>\n\n==Indications and contraindications==\n[[File:Anticonvulsants.jpg|thumb|alt=Anticonvulsants|Experts on the ketogenic diet recommend it be strongly considered for children with uncontrolled epilepsy who have tried and failed two or three anticonvulsant drugs;<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> most children who start the ketogenic diet have failed at least three times this number.<ref name=Bergqvist2004/>]]\nThe ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with [[drug-resistant epilepsy]].<ref name=NICE/><ref name=SIGN/> It is approved by national [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]] in Scotland,<ref name=SIGN/> England, and Wales<ref name=NICE/> and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies.<ref name=Turner2006/> Children with a focal [[lesion]] (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for [[epilepsy surgery|surgery]] are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Stainman2007/> About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants\u2014the low [[glycaemic index]] treatment and the modified Atkins diet\u2014to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are [[feeding tube|tube-fed]].<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/><ref name=Kossoff2004b/>\n\nAdvocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Kossoff2004a/><ref name=Spendiff2008/> The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include [[Dravet syndrome]], [[infantile spasms]], [[myoclonic-astatic epilepsy]], and [[tuberous sclerosis complex]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Wang2014/>\n\nA survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] and clinical practice.<ref name=Mastriani2008/> One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained [[dietitian]]s who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\nBecause the ketogenic diet alters the body's metabolism, it is a [[first-line therapy]] in children with certain [[congenital metabolic disease]]s such as [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency|pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency]] and [[De Vivo disease|glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome]],<ref name=Wang2018/> which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.<ref name=Huffman2006/> However, it is absolutely [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the treatment of other diseases such as [[pyruvate carboxylase deficiency]], [[porphyria]], and other rare [[Inborn errors of lipid metabolism|genetic disorders of fat metabolism]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to [[ketoacidosis]], and eventually coma and death.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\n==Interactions==\nThe ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. Some evidence of synergistic benefits is seen when the diet is combined with the [[vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulator]] or with the drug [[zonisamide]], and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving [[phenobarbital]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\nThe ketogenic diet is not considered a [[Benignity|benign]], holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery.<ref name=Turner2006/> Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include [[constipation]], low-grade [[acidosis]], and [[hypoglycaemia]] if an initial fast is undertaken. [[Hyperlipidemia|Raised levels of lipids in the blood]] affect up to 60% of children<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> and [[Hypercholesterolemia|cholesterol levels may increase]] by around 30%.<ref name=Turner2006/> This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many [[micronutrient]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nLong-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and [[kidney stone]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> The diet reduces levels of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]] ([[topiramate]], [[zonisamide]]) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone.<ref name=Sampath2007/> The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet.<ref name=Sampath2007/> Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral [[potassium citrate]] supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in one-seventh of the incidence of kidney stones.<ref name=McNally2009/> However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Excess calcium in the urine ([[hypercalciuria]]) occurs due to increased bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones are mainly composed of [[calcium phosphate]]. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Hypocitraturia: the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* The urine has a low pH, which stops [[uric acid]] from dissolving, leading to crystals that act as a [[wikt:nidus|nidus]] for calcium stone formation.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80% of normal daily needs;<ref name=Sampath2007/> this practice is no longer encouraged.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nIn adolescent and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, [[dyslipidemia]], and in women, [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name=Kossoff2006/>\n\n==Implementation==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[medical nutrition therapy]] that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric [[dietitian]] who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric [[neurologist]] who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a [[registered nurse]] who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a [[medical social worker]] who works with the family and a [[pharmacist]] who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nImplementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.<ref name=Vogelstein2010/>\n\n===Initiation===\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted.<ref name=Kim2008/> It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nAt the initial consultation, patients are [[screening (medicine)|screened]] for conditions that may [[contraindicate]] the diet. A dietary [[medical history|history]] is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nThe day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/> are allowed until dinner, which consists of \"[[eggnog]]\"<ref name=Eggnog group=Note/> restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the \"eggnog\" dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal's caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not \"eggnog\"). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nWhen in the hospital, [[blood sugar|glucose levels]] are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic [[ketosis]] (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks.<ref name=Vining1998/> The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/>\n\nVariations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using [[outpatient]] clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of [[metabolic acidosis|acidosis]], hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nFor patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/> Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Maintenance===\nAfter initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital [[dietitian]]<ref name=Hartman2007b/> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> [[ketonuria|Urinary ketone levels]] are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> This is performed using ketone test strips containing [[nitroprusside]], which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).<ref name=Musa-Veloso2004/>\n\nA short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if [[ketone]] levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even \"sugar-free\" food can contain carbohydrates such as [[maltodextrin]], [[sorbitol]], [[starch]], and [[fructose]]. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\n===Discontinuation===\nAbout 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions.<ref name=Martinez2007/> This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nChildren who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30\u201350% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an [[electroencephalogram]]  shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an [[MRI scan]] shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with [[tuberous sclerosis]]). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.<ref name=Martinez2007/>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Ketogenic diets pie MCT.svg|thumb|alt=A series of four pie charts for the typical American diet, the induction phase of the Atkins diet, the classic ketogenic diet, and the MCD ketogenic diet. The typical American diet has about half its calories from carbohydrates, where the others have very little carbohydrate. The Atkins diet is higher in protein than the others. Most of the fat in the MCT diet comes from MCT oil.|The ratio of calorific contributions from food components of four diets, by weight]]\n\nThe ketogenic diet is calculated by a [[dietitian]] for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80\u201390% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle [[spasticity]] require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18&nbsp;months, older than 12&nbsp;years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9&nbsp;kcal/g (38&nbsp;kJ/g) compared to 4&nbsp;kcal/g (17&nbsp;kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1&nbsp;g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or [[dietary supplement|supplements]] must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nA computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008b/> The meals often have four components: [[cream|heavy whipping cream]], a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic [[weighing scale|scale]] accurate to 1&nbsp;g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nThe classic ketogenic diet is not a [[balanced diet]] and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, [[Food fortification|fortified]] cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the [[B vitamins]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]] must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient's age: a [[multivitamin]] with [[Dietary mineral|minerals]] and [[calcium]] with vitamin D.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500&nbsp;kcal (6,300&nbsp;kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:<ref name=Turner2006/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Sample meal plan for one day\n!Meal\n!Menu idea\n!Ingredients\n|-\n|Breakfast\n|Egg with bacon\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g egg (about half an egg)\n* 11&nbsp;g bacon (about half a slice)\n* 37&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 23&nbsp;g butter\n* 9&nbsp;g slice of apple (about 5% of one apple)\n|-\n|Morning snack\n|Peanut butter ball\n(serving size: 0.5&nbsp;ounce)\n|\n* 6&nbsp;g peanut butter\n* 9&nbsp;g butter\n|-\n|Lunch\n|Tuna salad\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g tuna fish\n* 30&nbsp;g mayonnaise\n* 10&nbsp;g celery\n* 36&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 15&nbsp;g lettuce (one large leaf)\n|-\n|Afternoon snack\n|Keto yogurt\n(serving size: 1.3&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 18&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 17&nbsp;g sour cream\n* 4&nbsp;g strawberries (about half of one small strawberry)\n* [[artificial sweetener]]\n|-\n|Dinner\n|Cheeseburger (no bun)\n|\n* 22&nbsp;g [[Ground beef|minced (ground) beef]]\n* 10&nbsp;g [[American cheese]] (half a slice of cheese)\n* 26&nbsp;g butter\n* 38&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 10&nbsp;g lettuce (one medium leaf)\n* 11&nbsp;g green beans (one spoonful)\n|-\n|Evening snack\n|Keto custard\n(serving size: 1.2&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 25&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 9&nbsp;g egg (half a [[tablespoon]])\n* Pure, unsweetened vanilla flavouring\n|}\n\n===MCT oil===\nNormal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). [[Medium-chain triglycerides]] (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate,<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes.<ref name=Liu2008/> The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by [[health insurance|insurance companies]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Modified Atkins===\nFirst reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10&nbsp;g per day in children or 20&nbsp;g per day in adults, and are increased to 20\u201330&nbsp;g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/>\n\nThe modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/> Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favorably with the traditional ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Low glycemic index treatment===\nThe low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)<ref name=Pfeifer2013/> is an attempt to achieve the stable [[blood glucose]] levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet,<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat),<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40\u201360&nbsp;g per day.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nShort-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/><ref name=Muzykewicz2009/>\n\n===Prescribed formulations===\n[[File:Measuring Ketocal.jpg|thumb|alt=A cream-coloured powder is poured from a tin into a measuring jug on an electronic kitchen scale.|Measuring KetoCal\u2014a powdered formula for administering the classic ketogenic diet]]\nInfants and patients fed via a [[Feeding tube|gastrostomy tube]] can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/> Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total [[cholesterol]] than a solid ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> KetoCal is a [[Enteral formula|nutritionally complete food]] containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding.<ref name=KetoCal/> Other formula products include KetoVolve<ref name=KetoVolve/> and Ketonia.<ref name=KetoBottle/> Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.<ref name=KetoBottle/>\n\n===Worldwide===\nThere are theoretically no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory, so calculating macronutrients such as fat, protein and carbohydrates can be difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn Asia, the traditional diet includes rice and noodles as the main source of energy, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians and will not eat root vegetables and will try to avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.<ref name=Kossoff2008b/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\n\n===Seizure pathology===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = [[Ketone bodies]]\n\n | image1 = beta-Hydroxybutyric acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = Skeletal formula of 3-hydroxybutyric acid\n | caption1 = [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]]\n\n | image2 = Acetoacetic acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | alt2 = Skeletal formula of 3-oxobutanoic acid\n | caption2 = [[acetoacetic acid]]\n\n | image3 = Acetone-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width3 = 75\n | alt3 = Skeletal formula of acetone\n | caption3 = [[acetone]]\n}}\nThe brain is composed of a network of [[Neurotransmission|neurons that transmit signals]] by propagating [[nerve impulse]]s. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by [[neurotransmitter]]s, though there are also [[Electrical synapse|electrical pathways]] between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|\u03b3-aminobutyric acid]], or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by [[glutamate]]). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThe nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through [[Voltage-gated sodium channel|channels]] in the neuron's [[cell membrane]] followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]), which is mediated by another [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|potassium channel]]. The flow through these [[ion channel]]s is governed by a \"gate\" which is opened by either a voltage change or a [[Ligand-gated ion channel|chemical messenger]] known as a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThere are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n===Seizure control===\nAlthough many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include [[Metabolic acidosis|systemic acidosis]] (high levels of acid in the blood), [[Electrolyte disturbance|electrolyte changes]] and [[hypoglycaemia]] (low [[blood glucose]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nOn the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty-acid oxidation]] in the cell's [[mitochondria]] (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some [[amino acid]]s into glucose by a process called [[gluconeogenesis]], but cannot do this by using fatty acids.<ref name=Kerndt1982/> Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three [[ketone bodies]] [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]] and [[acetone]]. These ketone bodies enter the brain and ''partially'' substitute for [[blood glucose]] as a source of energy.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in [[animal model]]s, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the [[neuron]]s to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a [[neuroprotective]] effect.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant.  Conversely, [[fenofibrate]], not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental [[anticonvulsant]] properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Porta2009/>  This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nAnticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants ([[valproate]], [[levetiracetam]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\n==Other applications==\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[autism]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\nBecause some cancer cells are [[Warburg effect (oncology)|inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy]], the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer.<ref name=\"Baranano2008\" /><ref name=\"Allen2014\" />  A 2018 review looked at the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy. The clinical studies in humans are typically very small, with some providing weak evidence for anti-tumour effect, particularly for [[glioblastoma]], but in other cancers and studies, no anti-tumour effect was seen. Taken together, results from preclinical studies, albeit sometimes contradictory, tend to support an anti-tumor effect rather than a pro-tumor effect of the KD for most solid cancers.<ref name=Weber2018/>\n\nThe evidence of benefit for these conditions has not reached the level where clinical recommendations can be made.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Atkins diet]] \u2013 brand of low-carbohydrate diet\n* [[Ketosis]] \u2013 metabolic process that uses fats as an energy source\n* [[List of diets]]\n* [[Low-carbohydrate diet]] \u2013 varieties of diets that focus on reducing carbohydrates\n* [[Medium-chain triglyceride]] \u2013 easily absorbed, naturally occurring type of fat \n* [[Fad diet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em|group=Note|refs=\n{{#tag:ref|Ketogenic \"eggnog\" is used during induction and is a drink with the required ketogenic ratio.

It feeds on the sap of developing conifer cones throughout its life, and its sap-sucking causes the developing seeds to wither and misdevelop. It has destroyed most of the pine nut seeds in Italy, threatening ''P. pinea'' in its [[native plant|native]] [[habitat]]s there.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theworld.org/2010/10/italy%E2%80%99s-pine-nut-pest/#comment-15095 | title=Italy\u2019s pine nut pest | publisher=[[Public Radio International]] | date=20 October 2010 | access-date=20 June 2012 | author=PR | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813134743/http://www.theworld.org/2010/10/italy%e2%80%99s-pine-nut-pest/#comment-15095 | archive-date=13 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Pinus pinea|Pinus pinea<br/>(Stone pine)}}\n* [http://www.euforgen.org/species/pinus-pinea/ ''Pinus pinea''] \u2212 distribution map, genetic conservation units and related resources.
