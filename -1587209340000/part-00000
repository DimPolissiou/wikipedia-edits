It organised [[free party|free parties]] and became involved in housing, social exclusion, and community projects, founded upon the principle of [[DIY culture]]. The group [[squatted]] buildings and repeatedly came into conflict with [[Bedfordshire Police]], which by 1995 had resulted in [[Bedfordshire County Council]] voting for a public inquiry  into alleged police harrassment. The license of a pub owned by the mother of people in the collective was revoked, a decision which was later overturned by a [[Judicial review|judicial review]].\n\nThe collective occupied a disused farm and turned it into a community project which they later bought. The fortnightly [[raves]] in venues across [[Bedfordshire]] attracted up to 10,000 people and, especially during the Marsh Farm riots of 1995, served to defuse tensions locally. By 2000, the collective was holding licensed raves in agreement with landowners. The collective disbanded in 2000, later reforming as a [[Dub music|dub]] sound system under the name '''Leviticus'''. Some former members were then involved in the Marsh Farm Outreach community group, which successfully campaigned to build a local community centre.\n\n==Formation==\nExodus as a [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]] was formed on 5 June 1992, when the collective hosted a [[free party]] near woods in [[Dunstable]], [[Bedfordshire]], promoting it through [[word of mouth]] in local pubs. A few days earlier, founding member DJ Hazad had reclaimed some speaker cabinets which had been left in a rubbish bin, enlisting a friend to fit speakers in them. The collective was inspired by Luton [[Dub music|dub]] sound system Gemini High Power.<ref name=\"mckay\">{{cite book |last1=Malyon |first1=Tim |editor1-last=McKay |editor1-first=George |title=DiY Culture: Party & Protest in Nineties Britain |date=1998 |publisher=[[Verso Books|Verso]] |location=London |isbn=9781859842607 |pages=187\u2013207 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KaP-bAMAYlYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=en |chapter=Tossed in the fire and they never got burnt: The Exodus Collective |access-date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403133706/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KaP-bAMAYlYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=3 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|188\u2013189}}\n\nExodus raised funds through donations and bar takings, reinvesting the money in equipment.

It organised [[free party|free parties]] and became involved in housing, social exclusion, and community projects, founded upon the principle of [[DIY culture]]. The group [[squatted]] buildings and repeatedly came into conflict with [[Bedfordshire Police]], which by 1995 had resulted in [[Bedfordshire County Council]] voting for a public inquiry  into alleged police harrassment. The license of a pub owned by the mother of people in the collective was revoked, a decision which was later overturned by a [[Judicial review|judicial review]].\n\nThe collective occupied a disused farm and turned it into a community project which they later bought. The fortnightly [[raves]] in venues across [[Bedfordshire]] attracted up to 10,000 people and, especially during the Marsh Farm riots of 1995, served to defuse tensions locally. By 2000, the collective was holding licensed raves in agreement with landowners. The collective disbanded in 2000, later reforming as a [[Dub music|dub]] sound system under the name '''Leviticus'''. Some former members were then involved in the Marsh Farm Outreach community group, which successfully campaigned to build a local community centre.\n\n==Formation==\nExodus as a [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]] was formed on 5 June 1992, when the collective hosted a [[free party]] near woods in [[Dunstable]], [[Bedfordshire]], promoting it through [[word of mouth]] in local pubs.

Potash ores are typically rich in potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl) and other salts and clays, and are typically obtained by conventional shaft mining with the extracted ore ground into a powder.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Management of Agricultural Inputs|last = Alikhan|first = Irfan|publisher = Agrotech Publishing Academy|year = 2014|isbn = 9789383101474|location = |pages = }}</ref> Other methods include dissolution mining and evaporation methods from brines.\n\nIn the evaporation method, hot water is injected into the potash which is dissolved and then pumped to the surface where it is concentrated by solar induced evaporation. [[Amine]] reagents are then added to either the mined or evaporated solutions. The amine coats the KCl but not NaCl. Air bubbles cling to the amine + KCl and float it to the surface while the NaCl and clay sink to the bottom. The surface is skimmed for the amine + KCl which is then dried and packaged for use as a K rich fertilizer\u2014KCl dissolves readily in water and is available quickly for [[plant nutrition]].<ref>[http://www.ipni.net/ipniweb/portal.nsf/0/68907f5d1e5922f8062577ce006ad872/$FILE/K%20Fert%20Prod%20&%20Tech%2011%2016%2010.pdf Potassium Fertilizer Production and Technology].

Potash was principally obtained by [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] the ashes of land and sea plants. Beginning in the 14th century potash was mined in [[Ethiopia]]. One of the world's largest deposits, 140 to 150 million tons, is located in the [[Tigray Region|Tigray]]'s [[Dallol, Ethiopia|Dallol]] area.<ref name=\"Ethiopia Mining\">[http://www.photius.com/countries/ethiopia/economy/ethiopia_economy_mining.html Ethiopia Mining]. Photius.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-21.</ref> Potash was one of the most important industrial chemicals. It was refined from the ashes of [[broad-leaved tree|broadleaved trees]] and produced primarily in the forested areas of Europe, [[Russia]], and [[North America]]. The first [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] of any kind was issued in 1790 to [[Samuel Hopkins (inventor)|Samuel Hopkins]] for an improvement \"in the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process\".<ref>[[s:United States patent X1|Patent X1: the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process (1790)]]. en.wikisource.org</ref> ''Pearl ash'' was a purer quality made by [[calcination]] of potash in a [[reverberatory furnace]] or kiln. [[Potash pit]]s were once used in [[England]] to produce potash that was used in making soap for the preparation of wool for yarn production.\n\nAs early as 1767, potash from wood ashes was exported from Canada, and exports of potash and pearl ash (potash and [[Lime (material)|lime]]) reached 43,958 barrels in 1865. There were 519 [[Ashery|asheries]] in operation in 1871. The industry declined in the late 19th century when large-scale production of potash from mineral salts was established in [[Germany]]. In 1943, potash was discovered in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, in the process of drilling for oil. Active exploration began in 1951. In 1958, the Potash Company of America became the first potash producer in Canada with the commissioning of an underground potash mine at [[Patience Lake]]; however, due to water seepage in its shaft, production stopped late in 1959 but following extensive grouting and repairs, resumed in 1965. The underground mine was flooded in 1987 and was reactivated for commercial production as a solution mine in 1989.<ref name=ce/>\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, potash production provided settlers in North America a way to obtain badly needed cash and credit as they cleared wooded land for crops. To make full use of their land, settlers needed to dispose of excess wood. The easiest way to accomplish this was to burn any wood not needed for fuel or construction. Ashes from [[hardwood]] trees could then be used to make [[Potassium hydroxide|lye]], which could either be used to make soap or boiled down to produce valuable potash. Hardwood could generate ashes at the rate of 60 to 100 [[bushel]]s per acre (500 to 900 m\u00b3/km\u00b2). In 1790, ashes could be sold for $3.25 to $6.25 per acre ($800 to $1,500/km\u00b2) in rural [[New York State]] \u2013 nearly the same rate as hiring a laborer to clear the same area. Potash making became a major industry in British North America. Great Britain was always the most important market. The American potash industry followed the woodsman's ax across the country. After about 1820, New York replaced New England as the most important source; by 1840 the center was in Ohio. Potash production was always a by-product industry, following from the need to clear land for agriculture.<ref name=\"digital.library.okstate.edu\">Robert C.

After the water evaporated, the potassium salts crystallized into beds of potash ore. These are the locations where potash is being mined today. The deposits are a naturally occurring mixture of potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl), more commonly known as [[table salt]]. Over time, as the surface of the earth changed, these deposits were covered by thousands of feet of earth.<ref name=\"digital.library.okstate.edu\"/>\n\nMost potash mines today are deep shaft mines as much as 4,400 feet (1,400 m) underground. Others are mined as strip mines, having been laid down in horizontal layers as [[sedimentary rock]]. In above-ground processing plants, the KCl is separated from the mixture to produce a high-analysis potassium fertilizer. Other potassium salts can be separated by various procedures, resulting in potassium sulfate and potassium-magnesium sulfate.\n\nToday some of the world's largest known potash deposits are spread all over the world from [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, to [[Brazil]], [[Belarus]], Germany, and the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]]. The Permian basin deposit includes the major mines outside of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], New Mexico, to the world's purest potash deposit in [[Lea County, New Mexico]] (not far from the Carlsbad deposits), which is believed to be roughly 80% pure. ([[Osceola County, Michigan]] has deposits 90+% pure; however, the only mine there was converted to salt production.) Canada is the largest producer, followed by Russia and Belarus. The most significant reserve of Canada's potash is located in the province of Saskatchewan and is mined by [[The Mosaic Company]], [[Nutrien]] and [[K+S]].<ref name=usgs2/>\n\nIn [[China]], most potash deposits are concentrated in the deserts and salt flats of the [[endorheic basins]] of its western provinces, particularly [[Qinghai]].

Geographically, economic growth in Asia and Latin America greatly contributed to the increased use of potash-based fertilizer. Rising incomes in developing countries also was a factor in the growing potash and fertilizer use. With more money in the household budget, consumers added more meat and dairy products to their diets. This shift in eating patterns required more acres to be planted, more fertilizer to be applied and more animals to be fed\u2014all requiring more potash.\n\nAfter years of trending upward, fertilizer use slowed in 2008.

Potash was principally obtained by [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] the ashes of land and sea plants. Beginning in the 14th century potash was mined in [[Ethiopia]]. One of the world's largest deposits, 140 to 150 million tons, is located in the [[Tigray Region|Tigray]]'s [[Dallol, Ethiopia|Dallol]] area.<ref name=\"Ethiopia Mining\">[http://www.photius.com/countries/ethiopia/economy/ethiopia_economy_mining.html Ethiopia Mining]. Photius.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-21.</ref> Potash was one of the most important industrial chemicals. It was refined from the ashes of [[broad-leaved tree|broadleaved trees]] and produced primarily in the forested areas of Europe, [[Russia]], and [[North America]]. The first [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] of any kind was issued in 1790 to [[Samuel Hopkins (inventor)|Samuel Hopkins]] for an improvement \"in the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process\".<ref>[[s:United States patent X1|Patent X1: the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process (1790)]]. en.wikisource.org</ref> ''Pearl ash'' was a purer quality made by [[calcination]] of potash in a [[reverberatory furnace]] or kiln. [[Potash pit]]s were once used in [[England]] to produce potash that was used in making soap for the preparation of wool for yarn production.\n\nAs early as 1767, potash from wood ashes was exported from Canada, and exports of potash and pearl ash (potash and [[Lime (material)|lime]]) reached 43,958 barrels in 1865. There were 519 [[Ashery|asheries]] in operation in 1871. The industry declined in the late 19th century when large-scale production of potash from mineral salts was established in [[Germany]]. In 1943, potash was discovered in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, in the process of drilling for oil. Active exploration began in 1951. In 1958, the Potash Company of America became the first potash producer in Canada with the commissioning of an underground potash mine at [[Patience Lake]]; however, due to water seepage in its shaft, production stopped late in 1959 but following extensive grouting and repairs, resumed in 1965. The underground mine was flooded in 1987 and was reactivated for commercial production as a solution mine in 1989.<ref name=ce/>\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, potash production provided settlers in North America a way to obtain badly needed cash and credit as they cleared wooded land for crops. To make full use of their land, settlers needed to dispose of excess wood. The easiest way to accomplish this was to burn any wood not needed for fuel or construction. Ashes from [[hardwood]] trees could then be used to make [[Potassium hydroxide|lye]], which could either be used to make soap or boiled down to produce valuable potash. Hardwood could generate ashes at the rate of 60 to 100 [[bushel]]s per acre (500 to 900 m\u00b3/km\u00b2). In 1790, ashes could be sold for $3.25 to $6.25 per acre ($800 to $1,500/km\u00b2) in rural [[New York State]] \u2013 nearly the same rate as hiring a laborer to clear the same area. Potash making became a major industry in British North America. Great Britain was always the most important market. The American potash industry followed the woodsman's ax across the country. After about 1820, New York replaced New England as the most important source; by 1840 the center was in Ohio. Potash production was always a by-product industry, following from the need to clear land for agriculture.<ref name=\"digital.library.okstate.edu\">Robert C.

After the water evaporated, the potassium salts crystallized into beds of potash ore. These are the locations where potash is being mined today. The deposits are a naturally occurring mixture of potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl), more commonly known as [[table salt]]. Over time, as the surface of the earth changed, these deposits were covered by thousands of feet of earth.<ref name=\"digital.library.okstate.edu\"/>\n\nMost potash mines today are deep shaft mines as much as 4,400 feet (1,400 m) underground. Others are mined as strip mines, having been laid down in horizontal layers as [[sedimentary rock]]. In above-ground processing plants, the KCl is separated from the mixture to produce a high-analysis potassium fertilizer. Other potassium salts can be separated by various procedures, resulting in potassium sulfate and potassium-magnesium sulfate.\n\nToday some of the world's largest known potash deposits are spread all over the world from [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, to [[Brazil]], [[Belarus]], Germany, and the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]]. The Permian basin deposit includes the major mines outside of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], New Mexico, to the world's purest potash deposit in [[Lea County, New Mexico]] (not far from the Carlsbad deposits), which is believed to be roughly 80% pure. ([[Osceola County, Michigan]] has deposits 90+% pure; however, the only mine there was converted to salt production.) Canada is the largest producer, followed by Russia and Belarus. The most significant reserve of Canada's potash is located in the province of Saskatchewan and is mined by [[The Mosaic Company]], [[Nutrien]] and [[K+S]].<ref name=usgs2/>\n\nIn [[China]], most potash deposits are concentrated in the deserts and salt flats of the [[endorheic basins]] of its western provinces, particularly [[Qinghai]].

Geographically, economic growth in Asia and Latin America greatly contributed to the increased use of potash-based fertilizer. Rising incomes in developing countries also was a factor in the growing potash and fertilizer use. With more money in the household budget, consumers added more meat and dairy products to their diets. This shift in eating patterns required more acres to be planted, more fertilizer to be applied and more animals to be fed\u2014all requiring more potash.\n\nAfter years of trending upward, fertilizer use slowed in 2008.

At that time the [[Communist Party of China|party]] began to mobilize the population to engage in mass \"patriotic health campaigns\" aimed at improving the low level of environmental [[sanitation]] and hygiene and attacking certain diseases. One of the best examples of this approach was the mass assaults on the \"[[Great sparrow campaign|four pests]]\"\u2014[[rat]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[mosquito]]es\u2014and on [[schistosoma]]-carrying [[snail]]s. Particular efforts were devoted in the health campaigns to improving [[water quality]] through such measures as deep-[[water well|well]] construction and human-[[Sewage treatment|waste treatment]]. Only in the larger cities had human waste been centrally disposed of. In the countryside, where \"[[night soil]]\" has always been collected and applied to the fields as fertilizer, it was a major source of disease. Since the 1950s, rudimentary treatments such as storage in pits, [[compost]]ing, and mixture with chemicals have been implemented. As a result of preventive efforts, such epidemic diseases as [[cholera]], [[bubonic plague]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[Group A streptococcal infection|scarlet fever]] have almost been eradicated. The mass mobilization approach proved particularly successful in the fight against [[syphilis]], which was reportedly eliminated by the 1960s. The incidence of other infectious and parasitic diseases was reduced and controlled.\n\nPolitical turmoil and famine following the failure of the [[Great Leap Forward]] led to the starvation of 20 million people in China. Beginning in 1961 the recovery had more moderate policies inaugurated by President [[Liu Shaoqi]] ended starvation and improved nutrition. The coming of the [[Cultural Revolution]] weakened epidemic control, causing a rebound in epidemic diseases and malnutrition in some areas.\n\nWith the cultural revolution (1964-1976), Mao Zedong introduced a new approach to public health, especially in rural areas.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Daqing|last2=Unschuld|first2=Paul U|date=November 2008|title=China's barefoot doctor: past, present, and future|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|issue=9653|pages=1865\u20131867|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61355-0|pmid=18930539|issn=0140-6736}}</ref> Known as \"rural cooperative medical systems\", these structures provided subsidized health care to rural residents.<ref name=\":0\" /> One aspect of this system was barefoot doctors, who received some training and then delivered primary care medicine to those who needed it.<ref name=\":0\" />  Barefoot doctors were a good contribution to primary health systems in China during the Cultural Revolution.

(2005), individual towns were now responsible for ensuring that people were receiving adequate health care, which caused disparities between wealthier and poorer regions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, the decollectivization of agriculture resulted in a decreased desire on the part of the rural populations to support the collective welfare system, of which health care was a part. In 1984 surveys showed that only 40 to 45 percent of the rural population was covered by an organized cooperative medical system, as compared with 80 to 90 percent in 1979.\n\nThis shift entailed a number of important consequences for rural health care. The lack of financial resources for the cooperatives resulted in a decrease in the number of barefoot doctors, which meant that health education and primary and home care suffered and that in some villages sanitation and water supplies were checked less frequently. Also, the failure of the cooperative health care system limited the funds available for continuing education for barefoot doctors, thereby hindering their ability to provide adequate preventive and curative services. The costs of medical treatment increased, deterring some patients from obtaining necessary medical attention. If the patients could not pay for services received, then the financial responsibility fell on the hospitals and commune health centers, in some cases creating large debts.\n\nConsequently, in the post-[[Mao Zedong|Mao]] era of modernization, the rural areas were forced to adapt to a changing health care environment. Many barefoot doctors went into private practice, operating on a fee-for-service basis and charging for medication. But soon farmers demanded better medical services as their incomes increased, bypassing the barefoot doctors and going straight to the commune health centers or county hospitals. A number of barefoot doctors left the medical profession after discovering that they could earn a better living from farming, and their services were not replaced. The leaders of brigades, through which local health care was administered, also found farming to be more lucrative than their salaried positions, and many of them left their jobs. Many of the cooperative medical programs collapsed. Farmers in some brigades established voluntary health-insurance programs but had difficulty organizing and administering them.\n\nTheir income for many basic medical services limited by regulations, Chinese grassroots health care providers has supported themselves by charging for giving injections and selling medicines. This has led to a serious problem of disease spread through health care as patients received too many injections and injections by unsterilized needles. Corruption and disregard for the rights of patients have become serious problems in the Chinese health care system.\n\nThe Chinese economist, Yang Fan, wrote in 2001 that lip service being given to the old socialist health care system and deliberately ignoring and failing to regulate the actual private health care system is a serious failing of the Chinese health care system. \"The old argument that \"health is a kind of welfare to save lives and assist the injured\" is so far removed from reality that things are really more like its opposite. The welfare health system supported by public funds essentially exists in name only.  People have to pay for most medical services on their own.  Considering health to be still a \"welfare activity\" has for some time been a major obstacle to the development of proper physician - patient relationship and to the law applicable to that relationship.\"<ref>[http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/healthcare-corruption.html \"What Limits to Corruption in Health Care?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212071501/http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/healthcare-corruption.html |date=12 February 2007 }} in April 2001 Viewpoint Voice of China translated on the U.S. Embassy Beijing website.

Though it has uplifted a huge number of people out of poverty, many social issues still remain unsolved. One of them is malnutrition among rural children in China. The problem has diminished but still remains a pertinent national issue.  In a survey done in 1998, the stunting rate among children in China was 22 percent and was as high as 46 percent in poor provinces.<ref>Park, A. and Wang, S., 2001. \"China\u2019s Poverty Statistics.\" China Economic Review\n12:384\u201398</ref><ref>Park, A. and Zhang, L., 2000. \"Mother\u2019s Education and Child Health in China\u2019s Poor Areas.\" Mimeo, University of Michigan Department of Economics</ref> This shows the huge disparity between urban and rural areas. In 2002, Svedberg found that stunting rate in rural areas of China was 15 percent, reflecting that a substantial number of children still suffer from malnutrition.<ref>Svedberg, P. (2006) \"Declining child malnutrition: a reassessment\", International\nJournal of Epidemiology, Vol. 35, No. 5, pp. 1336-46</ref> Another study by Chen shows that malnutrition has dropped from 1990 to 1995 but regional differences are still huge, particularly in rural areas.<ref>Chen, C. 2000. \"Fat Intake and Nutritional Status of Children in China.\" American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 72(Supplement):1368S\u201372S</ref>\n\nIn a recent report by The Rural Education Action Project on children in rural China, many were found to be suffering from basic health problems. 34% have iron deficiency anaemia and 40 percent are infected with intestinal worms.<ref>The Rural Education Action Project - REAP, http://reap.stanford.edu/ - a group of researchers from the Freeman Spogli Institute and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2008 \u2013 retrieved from www.ccap.org.cn/uploadfile/2011/0111/20110111054129822.doc on 11 February 2011</ref> Many of these children do not have proper or sufficient nutrition. Often, this causes them not being able to fully reap the benefits of education, which can be a ticket out of poverty.\n\nOne possible reason for poor nutrition in rural areas is that agricultural produce can fetch a decent price, and thus is often sold rather than kept for personal consumption. Rural families would not consume eggs that their hen lay but will sell it in the market for about 20 yuan per kilogram.<ref name=\"ChinaDaily\">{{cite news |title=West China county improves rural children health with free eggs |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-12/07/content_7279010.htm |accessdate=11 February 2011 |work=China Daily |date=7 December 2008}}</ref> The money will then be spent on books or food like instant noodles which lack nutrition value compared to an egg. A girl named Wang Jing in China has a bowl of pork only once every five to six weeks, compared to urban children who have a vast array of food chains to choose from.\n\nA survey conducted by China's Ministry of Health showed the kind of food consumed by rural households. 30 percent consume meat less than once a month. 23 percent consume rice or egg less than once a month.\n\nIn a 2008 Report on Chinese Children Nutrition and Health Conditions, West China still has 7.6 million poor children who were shorter and weigh lesser than urban children. These rural children were also shorter by 4 centimetres and 0.6 kilograms lighter than World Health Organisation standards.<ref name=\"ChinaDaily\" /> It can be concluded that children in West China still lack quality nutrition.\n\n====Epidemiological studies====\nThe most comprehensive epidemiological study of nutrition ever conducted was the [[China-Oxford-Cornell Study on Dietary, Lifestyle and Disease Mortality Characteristics in 65 Rural Chinese Counties]], known as the \"China Project\", which began in 1983.<ref>Brody, Jane E.

As of 2012, sanitary facilities were available to 69% of the Chinese people and 71% of water in China is piped, yet it is still difficult preserving drinking water that is affordable and efficient at a communal level. Additionally, water in both urban and rural areas of China are still vulnerable to disease, pollution, and contamination, with rural areas at higher risk of sewage contamination.<ref>http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/factsheets/watsan/en/</ref>\n\nThe lack of sanitation in multiple areas of China has affected many student for decades.

The role of WHO China is to provide support for the government's health programs, working closely with the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]] and other partners within the government, as well as with [[UN agencies]] and other organizations.\n\nChina's government with WHO assistance and support has strengthened [[public health]] in the nation. The current [[Five-Year Plans of the People's Republic of China|Five Year Plan]] incorporates public health in a significant way. The government has acknowledged that even as millions upon millions of citizens are prospering amid the country's [[economic boom]], millions of others are lagging behind, with healthcare many cannot afford. The challenge for China is to strengthen its health care system across the spectrum, to reduce the disparities and create a more equitable situation regarding access to health care services for the population at large.\n\nAt the same time, in an ever-interconnected world, China has embraced its responsibility to global public health, including the strengthening of surveillance systems aimed at swiftly identifying and tackling the threat of infectious diseases such as [[SARS]] and [[avian influenza]]. Another major challenge is the epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS]], a key priority for China.\n\nThe staff of the WHO Office in China are working with their national counterparts in the following areas:\n\n* [[healthcare system|Healthcare systems development]]\n* [[Immunization]]\n* [[Tuberculosis control]]\n* [[HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS control]]\n* [[Maternal health]] and [[child health]]\n* [[Injury prevention]]\n* [[Avian influenza|Avian influenza control]]\n* [[Food safety]]\n* [[Tobacco control]]\n* [[Non-communicable disease|Non-communicable diseases control]]\n* [[Environmental health|Environment]] and [[health]]\n* [[Communicable diseases]] [[disease surveillance|surveillance]] and [[emergency response|response]]\n\nIn addition, WHO technical experts in specialty areas can be made available on a short-term basis, when requested by the Chinese government. China is an active, contributing member of WHO, and has made valuable contributions to global and regional health policy. Technical experts from China have contributed to WHO through their membership on various WHO technical expert advisory committees and groups.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Healthcare in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chc.org.cn/ China Health Care Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190713211003/http://www.cpma.org.cn/ Chinese Preventive Medicine Association]\n*[http://www.who.int/countries/chn/en/ China Profile] by World Health Organization ([http://www.wpro.who.int/china WHO Office in China])\n*[http://www.moh.gov.cn/ Chinese Ministry of Health]\n*[http://www.chinamedicalboard.org/ China Medical Board]\n\n===Resources===\n\n*[http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/15/3/269 \"Critical health literacy: a case study from China in schistosomiasis control\"]\n*[http://www.china.org.cn/e-white/children/c-3.htm Children's Healthcare in China]\n*[http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/destinationChina.aspx Health Information for Travelers to China] U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081012044311/http://www.brookings.edu/events/2007/0806_china.aspx China's Healthcare System: Improving Quality of Insurance, Service, and Personnel] ''Reforming China\u2019s Healthcare System'' Roundtable series held by the [[Brookings-Tsinghua Center]] at [[Tsinghua University]]\n*[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123116 The Current State of Public Health in China] ''Annual Review of Public Health''  Vol. 25: 327-339 (Volume publication date April 2004)\n*[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPREGTOPHEANUT/Resources/publichealth,09-13-04.pdf A Critical Review of Public Health in China] August 2004 paper\n\n{{Health in the People's Republic of China|state=expanded}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Asia topic|Health in}}\n{{Public health}}\n\n[[Category:Death in China]]\n[[Category:Health in China| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Health in [[Mainland China]]|Hong Kong|Health in Hong Kong|Macau|Health in Macau|Taiwan|Health in Taiwan}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Jiuzhou Hospital, Panzhou, Guizhou, China.jpg|thumb|Jiuzhou Hospital in Guizhou, China]]\nBeginning in 1905, the Chinese government established its first Department of Health.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Youngsub|date=2018|title=The Turning Point of China\u2019s Rural Public Health during the Cultural Revolution Period: Barefoot Doctors: A Narrative|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124148/|journal=Iranian Journal of Public Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> With a more centralized body to manage health care, the Chinese Nationalist Party attempted to move toward Western method of healthcare delivery up until 1949.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, China's health system has undergone a number of changes since the Chinese Communist Revolution and subsequent declaration of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1949.<ref name=\":4\" /> From 1949 until 1976, [[Mao Zedong]] focused efforts on increasing primary care quality and accessibility and moved to improve rural health care with the dawn of the cultural revolution.<ref name=\":4\" /> When [[Deng Xiaoping]] came to power, the Chinese government moved to a more privatized healthcare system.<ref name=\":4\" /> By 2003, after the SARS outbreak, China began to attempt another healthcare system restructuring and began devoting more resources to providing medical care.<ref name=\":4\" /> With the changing healthcare system and China's economic development, typical health conditions among the Chinese population began to shift from [[infectious diseases]] to chronic conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=David|last2=Hsiao|first2=William|date=2005-09-15|title=Privatization and Its Discontents \u2014 The Evolving Chinese Health Care System|url=https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMhpr051133|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=353|issue=11|pages=1165\u20131170|doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr051133|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16162889}}</ref> Still, many health conditions afflict China for various reasons.

At that time the [[Communist Party of China|party]] began to mobilize the population to engage in mass \"patriotic health campaigns\" aimed at improving the low level of environmental [[sanitation]] and hygiene and attacking certain diseases. One of the best examples of this approach was the mass assaults on the \"[[Great sparrow campaign|four pests]]\"\u2014[[rat]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[mosquito]]es\u2014and on [[schistosoma]]-carrying [[snail]]s. Particular efforts were devoted in the health campaigns to improving [[water quality]] through such measures as deep-[[water well|well]] construction and human-[[Sewage treatment|waste treatment]]. Only in the larger cities had human waste been centrally disposed of. In the countryside, where \"[[night soil]]\" has always been collected and applied to the fields as fertilizer, it was a major source of disease. Since the 1950s, rudimentary treatments such as storage in pits, [[compost]]ing, and mixture with chemicals have been implemented. As a result of preventive efforts, such epidemic diseases as [[cholera]], [[bubonic plague]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[Group A streptococcal infection|scarlet fever]] have almost been eradicated. The mass mobilization approach proved particularly successful in the fight against [[syphilis]], which was reportedly eliminated by the 1960s. The incidence of other infectious and parasitic diseases was reduced and controlled.\n\nPolitical turmoil and famine following the failure of the [[Great Leap Forward]] led to the starvation of 20 million people in China. Beginning in 1961 the recovery had more moderate policies inaugurated by President [[Liu Shaoqi]] ended starvation and improved nutrition. The coming of the [[Cultural Revolution]] weakened epidemic control, causing a rebound in epidemic diseases and malnutrition in some areas.\n\nWith the cultural revolution (1964-1976), Mao Zedong introduced a new approach to public health, especially in rural areas.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Daqing|last2=Unschuld|first2=Paul U|date=November 2008|title=China's barefoot doctor: past, present, and future|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|issue=9653|pages=1865\u20131867|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61355-0|pmid=18930539|issn=0140-6736}}</ref> Known as \"rural cooperative medical systems\", these structures provided subsidized health care to rural residents.<ref name=\":0\" /> One aspect of this system was barefoot doctors, who received some training and then delivered primary care medicine to those who needed it.<ref name=\":0\" />  Barefoot doctors were a good contribution to primary health systems in China during the Cultural Revolution.

(2005), individual towns were now responsible for ensuring that people were receiving adequate health care, which caused disparities between wealthier and poorer regions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, the decollectivization of agriculture resulted in a decreased desire on the part of the rural populations to support the collective welfare system, of which health care was a part. In 1984 surveys showed that only 40 to 45 percent of the rural population was covered by an organized cooperative medical system, as compared with 80 to 90 percent in 1979.\n\nThis shift entailed a number of important consequences for rural health care. The lack of financial resources for the cooperatives resulted in a decrease in the number of barefoot doctors, which meant that health education and primary and home care suffered and that in some villages sanitation and water supplies were checked less frequently. Also, the failure of the cooperative health care system limited the funds available for continuing education for barefoot doctors, thereby hindering their ability to provide adequate preventive and curative services. The costs of medical treatment increased, deterring some patients from obtaining necessary medical attention. If the patients could not pay for services received, then the financial responsibility fell on the hospitals and commune health centers, in some cases creating large debts.\n\nConsequently, in the post-[[Mao Zedong|Mao]] era of modernization, the rural areas were forced to adapt to a changing health care environment. Many barefoot doctors went into private practice, operating on a fee-for-service basis and charging for medication. But soon farmers demanded better medical services as their incomes increased, bypassing the barefoot doctors and going straight to the commune health centers or county hospitals. A number of barefoot doctors left the medical profession after discovering that they could earn a better living from farming, and their services were not replaced. The leaders of brigades, through which local health care was administered, also found farming to be more lucrative than their salaried positions, and many of them left their jobs. Many of the cooperative medical programs collapsed. Farmers in some brigades established voluntary health-insurance programs but had difficulty organizing and administering them.\n\nTheir income for many basic medical services limited by regulations, Chinese grassroots health care providers has supported themselves by charging for giving injections and selling medicines. This has led to a serious problem of disease spread through health care as patients received too many injections and injections by unsterilized needles. Corruption and disregard for the rights of patients have become serious problems in the Chinese health care system.\n\nThe Chinese economist, Yang Fan, wrote in 2001 that lip service being given to the old socialist health care system and deliberately ignoring and failing to regulate the actual private health care system is a serious failing of the Chinese health care system. \"The old argument that \"health is a kind of welfare to save lives and assist the injured\" is so far removed from reality that things are really more like its opposite. The welfare health system supported by public funds essentially exists in name only.  People have to pay for most medical services on their own.  Considering health to be still a \"welfare activity\" has for some time been a major obstacle to the development of proper physician - patient relationship and to the law applicable to that relationship.\"<ref>[http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/healthcare-corruption.html \"What Limits to Corruption in Health Care?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212071501/http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/healthcare-corruption.html |date=12 February 2007 }} in April 2001 Viewpoint Voice of China translated on the U.S. Embassy Beijing website.

From 1950 to 2012, life expectancy nearly doubled (41.6-75.1). Total Fertility Rate changed from 5.3 to 1.7 which mainly caused by [[One-child policy]]. Infant Mortality rate and Under-5 mortality rate went down sharply. Though there is no data from 1963 to 1967, we can see the trend. The gap between IMR and U5MR became smaller and smaller, which indicates health in children has been promoted.\nMaternal Mortality Ratio isn't shown in the graph due to having insufficient data, but it did go down from 164.5(1980) to 26.5(2011).\n\n=== One-Child Policy ===\n[[File:China 1982 happy family with one child.jpg|thumb|A poster from 1982 showing a Chinese family with one child]]\nCreated in 1979, under Deng Xiaoping, the One-Child Policy incentivized families to have children later and to only have one child or risk penalization.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34667551 Explainer: What was China's one-child policy? - BBC News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[One-child policy|One-Child Policy]] was a program created by the Chinese government as a reaction to the increasing population during the 1970s, that was thought to have negatively impacted China's economic growth.

For instance, favoring males over female children lead to many forced abortions, [[infanticide]] and abandoned female children which led to an imbalance of men to women in China.<ref>[https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/chinas-one-child-policy/ The one-child policy in China - Centre for Public Impact (CPI)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Additionally, birth rates and rate of natural increase decreased as a result of the One-Child Policy.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/managing_population_rev3.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Case study: China|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>  Other consequences of the One-Child Policy include difficulties accessing education and employment as a result of being an undocumented birth.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" />\n\nIn terms of positive outcomes, as Zeng and Hesketh (2016) explain, the Chinese government cites the decreased [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] resulting from the one-child policy as a determining factor in China's rapidly increasing [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref name=\":6\" /> However, Zeng and Hesketh (2016) as well as Zhang (2017) also mention that other scholars argue China's fertility rate would have decreased as the country became more and more developed, regardless of whether the one-child policy had been in place or not.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Junsen|date=February 2017|title=The Evolution of China\u2019s One-Child Policy and Its Effects on Family Outcomes|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jep.31.1.141|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=141\u2013160|doi=10.1257/jep.31.1.141|issn=0895-3309}}</ref> Zhang (2017) notes that one predicted positive outcome of having less children was that families would invest more money and other resources in the children they did have, leading to a healthier and more successful population.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, follow-up studies on this claim have examined child education outcomes and found that the effects of the one-child policy on [[education]] rates was \"not statistically significant\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Dependency Ratio ===\nChina's [[dependency ratio]] is unfavorable because of the policy and its elderly population (65+) will outgrow the working aged people.

By the mid-1980s, some Chinese physicians recognized [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] as a serious health threat but considered it to be a \"foreign problem\". As of mid-1987 only two Chinese citizens had died from AIDS and monitoring of foreigners had begun. Following a 1987 regional [[World Health Organization]] meeting, the Chinese government announced it would join the global fight against AIDS, which would involve quarantine inspection of people entering China from abroad, medical supervision of people vulnerable to AIDS, and establishment of AIDS laboratories in coastal cities. Within China, the rapid increase in venereal disease, prostitution and drug addiction, internal migration since the 1980s and poorly supervised plasma collection practices, especially by the Henan provincial authorities, created conditions for a serious outbreak of HIV in the early 1990s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021214033216/http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/english/sandt/hivartic.html July 2001 compendium, U.S. Embassy Beijing website Recent Chinese Reports on HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases].

Projections are for about 10 million cases by 2010 if nothing is done. Effective preventive measures have become a priority at the highest levels of the government, but progress is slow. A promising pilot program exists in [[Gejiu]] partially funded by international donors.\n\n===Tuberculosis===\n{{main|Tuberculosis in China}}\n[[File:Mycobacterium tuberculosis.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Scanning electron micrograph of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'']]\n[[Tuberculosis]] is a major [[public health]] problem in China, which has the world's second largest [[tuberculosis epidemic]] (after [[India]]). Progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and [[multidrug-resistant]] tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system.

In 2003, daily per capita caloric intake was 2,940 (vegetable products 78%, animal products 22%); 125% of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] recommended minimum requirement.\n\n===Malnutrition among rural children===\n{{See also|Zhejiang Xinhua Compassion Education Foundation}}\nChina has been developing rapidly for the past 30 years. Though it has uplifted a huge number of people out of poverty, many social issues still remain unsolved. One of them is malnutrition among rural children in China. The problem has diminished but still remains a pertinent national issue.  In a survey done in 1998, the stunting rate among children in China was 22 percent and was as high as 46 percent in poor provinces.<ref>Park, A. and Wang, S., 2001. \"China\u2019s Poverty Statistics.\" China Economic Review\n12:384\u201398</ref><ref>Park, A. and Zhang, L., 2000. \"Mother\u2019s Education and Child Health in China\u2019s Poor Areas.\" Mimeo, University of Michigan Department of Economics</ref> This shows the huge disparity between urban and rural areas. In 2002, Svedberg found that stunting rate in rural areas of China was 15 percent, reflecting that a substantial number of children still suffer from malnutrition.<ref>Svedberg, P. (2006) \"Declining child malnutrition: a reassessment\", International\nJournal of Epidemiology, Vol. 35, No. 5, pp. 1336-46</ref> Another study by Chen shows that malnutrition has dropped from 1990 to 1995 but regional differences are still huge, particularly in rural areas.<ref>Chen, C. 2000. \"Fat Intake and Nutritional Status of Children in China.\" American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 72(Supplement):1368S\u201372S</ref>\n\nIn a recent report by The Rural Education Action Project on children in rural China, many were found to be suffering from basic health problems. 34% have iron deficiency anaemia and 40 percent are infected with intestinal worms.<ref>The Rural Education Action Project - REAP, http://reap.stanford.edu/ - a group of researchers from the Freeman Spogli Institute and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2008 \u2013 retrieved from www.ccap.org.cn/uploadfile/2011/0111/20110111054129822.doc on 11 February 2011</ref> Many of these children do not have proper or sufficient nutrition. Often, this causes them not being able to fully reap the benefits of education, which can be a ticket out of poverty.\n\nOne possible reason for poor nutrition in rural areas is that agricultural produce can fetch a decent price, and thus is often sold rather than kept for personal consumption. Rural families would not consume eggs that their hen lay but will sell it in the market for about 20 yuan per kilogram.<ref name=\"ChinaDaily\">{{cite news |title=West China county improves rural children health with free eggs |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-12/07/content_7279010.htm |accessdate=11 February 2011 |work=China Daily |date=7 December 2008}}</ref> The money will then be spent on books or food like instant noodles which lack nutrition value compared to an egg. A girl named Wang Jing in China has a bowl of pork only once every five to six weeks, compared to urban children who have a vast array of food chains to choose from.\n\nA survey conducted by China's Ministry of Health showed the kind of food consumed by rural households. 30 percent consume meat less than once a month. 23 percent consume rice or egg less than once a month.\n\nIn a 2008 Report on Chinese Children Nutrition and Health Conditions, West China still has 7.6 million poor children who were shorter and weigh lesser than urban children. These rural children were also shorter by 4 centimetres and 0.6 kilograms lighter than World Health Organisation standards.<ref name=\"ChinaDaily\" /> It can be concluded that children in West China still lack quality nutrition.\n\n====Epidemiological studies====\nThe most comprehensive epidemiological study of nutrition ever conducted was the [[China-Oxford-Cornell Study on Dietary, Lifestyle and Disease Mortality Characteristics in 65 Rural Chinese Counties]], known as the \"China Project\", which began in 1983.<ref>Brody, Jane E.

As of 2012, sanitary facilities were available to 69% of the Chinese people and 71% of water in China is piped, yet it is still difficult preserving drinking water that is affordable and efficient at a communal level.

The role of WHO China is to provide support for the government's health programs, working closely with the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]] and other partners within the government, as well as with [[UN agencies]] and other organizations.\n\nChina's government with WHO assistance and support has strengthened [[public health]] in the nation. The current [[Five-Year Plans of the People's Republic of China|Five Year Plan]] incorporates public health in a significant way. The government has acknowledged that even as millions upon millions of citizens are prospering amid the country's [[economic boom]], millions of others are lagging behind, with healthcare many cannot afford. The challenge for China is to strengthen its health care system across the spectrum, to reduce the disparities and create a more equitable situation regarding access to health care services for the population at large.\n\nAt the same time, in an ever-interconnected world, China has embraced its responsibility to global public health, including the strengthening of surveillance systems aimed at swiftly identifying and tackling the threat of infectious diseases such as [[SARS]] and [[avian influenza]].

But in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed was China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany was particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey, with such views existing despite Germany's success exporting to China.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\nDespite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations felt that China acted unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes.

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese. The Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish.

But in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed was China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany was particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey, with such views existing despite Germany's success exporting to China.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\nDespite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations felt that China acted unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes.

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

Its motives range from the desire of the Chinese to dominate Manila, to their desire to abort the Spaniards' moves which seemed to lead to their elimination. The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese. The Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish. The Chinese supplied the Moros with weapons and joined them in directly fighting against the Spanish during the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]. Spain also upheld a plan to conquer China, but it never materialized.<ref>Samuel Hawley.

However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, \"[[tax per head|head taxes]]\" were implemented to curtail immigration from China. In 1907, a riot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses. In 1923, the federal government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]]'', commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting further Chinese immigration except under \"special circumstances\". The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which [[Chinese Canadian]]s were given the right to vote. Restrictions would continue to exist on immigration from Asia until 1967, when all racial restrictions on [[immigration to Canada]] were repealed, and Canada adopted the current points based immigration system.

After the Chan Sow Lin station, the lines split toward their respective termini. The Kelana Jaya Line starts in [[Gombak LRT station|Gombak]] in the north, passing through the city centre, and terminating at [[Putra Heights LRT station|Putra Heights]] station which is also the southern terminus of the Sri Petaling Line, serving as an interchange between the two lines.\n\nThe third LRT system, the Bandar Utama-Klang Line (also known as the {{KLRT lines|11}}) is planned to be opened in 2024.

station|Sentul Timur]] station to [[Chan Sow Lin station|Chan Sow Lin]] station and are therefore, all stations on this route act as interchange stations between both the lines. After the Chan Sow Lin station, the lines split toward their respective termini. The Kelana Jaya Line starts in [[Gombak LRT station|Gombak]] in the north, passing through the city centre, and terminating at [[Putra Heights LRT station|Putra Heights]] station which is also the southern terminus of the Sri Petaling Line, serving as an interchange between the two lines.\n\nThe third LRT system, the Bandar Utama-Klang Line (also known as the {{KLRT lines|11}}) is planned to be opened in 2024. It will be the first rail transit line in the [[Klang Valley Integrated Transit System]] which will be situated completely outside the borders of [[Kuala Lumpur]].[[File:LRT Ampang Line.png|alt=|thumb|This is the '''new stations numbering''' of the {{Rint|my|3}} [[Ampang line|Ampang Line]], which can be found on the Rapid KL's official website [https://www.myrapid.com.my/traveling-with-us/how-to-travel-with-us/rapid-kl/monorail-and-lrts here].]]\n[[File:LRT Sri Petaling Line.png|alt=|thumb|This is the stations numbering of {{Rint|my|4}} [[Sri Petaling Line]], which can be found on Rapid KL's official website [https://www.myrapid.com.my/traveling-with-us/how-to-travel-with-us/rapid-kl/monorail-and-lrts here].]]\n[[File:LRT Kelana Jaya Line.png|alt=|thumb|This is the stations numbering of {{Rint|my|5}} [[Kelana Jaya line|Kelana Jaya Line]], which can be found on Rapid KL's official website [https://www.myrapid.com.my/traveling-with-us/how-to-travel-with-us/rapid-kl/monorail-and-lrts here].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!'''Code'''\n!'''Station Name'''\n!Interchanges/\nConnections\n!District/City\n!State/Territory\n|- bgcolor=\"#{{KLRT color|3}}\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |'''[[Ampang Line|<span style=\"color:white;\">3 -
