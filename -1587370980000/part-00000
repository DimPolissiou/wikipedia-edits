In the film, Forrest is a philanthropist and a war veteran, businessman, and college football player who bears witness to various significant occurrences in the 20th century. He exudes a [[compassion|compassionate]], optimistic, and tenacious attitude in the face of countless setbacks and strives to help every person he meets despite his strong [[naivety]]. Throughout his life, he maintains a sincere [[love]] for his childhood friend Jennifer Curran, who eventually becomes his wife. [[Tom Hanks]] portrayed the character in the film and earned an [[Academy Award]] for his performance, while [[Michael Conner Humphreys]] portrayed Forrest as a child. \n\nIn 2008, Forrest Gump was named the 20th greatest movie character of all time by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=20 \"100 greatest movie characters\"] on ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHej ruben\n===Early years===\nForrest was born near the small town of Greenbow, [[Alabama]], on June 6, 1944. His father was absent during his life, and his mother said he was \"on vacation\". His mother named Forrest after their ancestor [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], a [[Scotch-Irish American]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ah-nathanforrest.html|title=Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forest|publisher=}}</ref> and a noted [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general in the [[American Civil War]] and the first [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. She intended his name to be a reminder that \"sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense\".\n\nForrest was born with strong legs but a crooked [[Vertebral column|spine]]. He was forced to wear [[brace (orthopaedic)|leg braces]] which made walking difficult and running nearly impossible. He also had a relatively low [[intelligence quotient|I.Q.]] of 75, which nearly prevented him from being accepted into public school. (His mother managed to get the principal to reconsider by letting him [[Sexual intercourse|sleep with]] her.) Despite his physical and mental challenges, Forrest's mother told him not to let anyone tell him he was different, telling him \"stupid is as stupid does\".\n\nForrest and his mother lived in a large house just outside the town of Greenbow. They made money by renting out rooms to travelers. One of their guests was a young [[Elvis Presley]]. Forrest liked dancing to Elvis' music and his leg braces gave him a unique dancing style that would inspire Elvis's \"hip dancing\", for his song \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\".\n\nOn the bus ride on Forrest's first day of school, Forrest met Jenny Curran and was instantly taken by her. \"I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life,\" he would later say of her, \"she was like an angel.\" The two became close friends, often playing around a large nearby tree. Forrest described their relationship saying, \"Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.\" Jenny was one of the few people besides his mother to accept Forrest as he was, helping him learn to read and stand up to bullies who harassed him. However, Jenny's home life was not nearly as happy as Forrest's: her mother had died when she was five and her father was an abusive alcoholic who molested and beat his children (until Jenny was taken away to live with her grandmother), and Forrest's friendship offered her an escape.\n\nOne day, a group of bullies was throwing rocks at Forrest, and one of them cut his forehead. Jenny told Forrest, \"Run Forrest run!\", which he did, only to prompt the bullies to chase him on their bikes. As Forrest struggled to run, his leg braces broke apart. Once he was free of them, Forrest was able to run incredibly fast. Forrest would never wear leg braces again, and was able to run anywhere he wanted to after that.\n\n===College===\nForrest and Jenny remained close friends all the way through high school, though he remained a target for bullies. One day, while running from some bullies, he interrupted the local high school's football practice by running across the field faster than all the players. This feat caught the attention of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] head football coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]], who was at the practice scouting [[American football|football players]]. After his incredible running ability impressed the coach, Forrest received a football scholarship to the [[University of Alabama]], where his speed helped them win several games. He played for five years and wore jersey number 44, which is believed to be a reference to his birth year. He was later named to the [[All-America]]n team and got to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]]. When asked by the President how he felt, Forrest (having drunk about fifteen [[Dr. Pepper]]s) gave an honest answer: \"I gotta pee.\"\n\nForrest was also present at the University when it was [[desegregation|desegregated]] and observed Governor [[George Wallace]]'s [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]], denouncing the desegregation. While several citizens jeered the black students entering the campus, Forrest, not entirely understanding the situation, simply walked up to [[Vivian Malone Jones|Vivian Malone]] and handed her a book she dropped, saying simply \"Ma'am? You dropped your book...ma'am?\" before following her and [[James Hood]] into school, causing his coaches to watch the incident in disbelief. Forrest later spends time with Jenny in her college dormitory during a rainy day after she had gotten abused by another college boy.\n\n===In the Army===\nAt his college graduation in 1967, Forrest was approached by an army recruiter who asked if he'd \"...given any thought to his future\". Soon after, Forrest would join the [[United States Department of the Army|United States Army]]. On the bus going to boot camp, Forrest met Benjamin Buford Blue, a young black man from [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama]], who went by the nickname \"Bubba\". Bubba told Forrest about his family history of cooking [[shrimp]] and how he had planned to buy his own [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping boat]] after getting out of the army. Bubba explains to Forrest that he loves all kinds of shrimp, and makes a long list of different types, with Forrest being the only one to really listen to him.\n\nForrest did well in the army as he followed orders well without distraction; for example, he set a new [[Company (military unit)|company]] record for assembling his [[M14 rifle]] with his drill sergeant, who regularly singled him out as an example for the other recruits, replying he would be an Army General. Meanwhile, while Jenny was having multiple relationships with different men, having been kicked out of school for wearing her school sweater to pose in ''[[Playboy]]'', she had gotten work singing in the nude at a strip club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] under the stage name 'Bobbie Dylan'. Forrest goes to visit her at the club, and gets into a fight with some patrons who are harassing her during her performance. During an argument that takes place shortly after, Forrest tells Jenny that he loves her, but Jenny replies that he \"doesn't know what love is\". Jenny is angry, but later becomes concerned when he tells her he was being deployed to [[Vietnam]] to serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. Jenny tells him not to try being brave if he was ever in trouble and to just run away instead.\n\nWhile in Vietnam, and assigned to [[47th Infantry Regiment (United States)|company A, 2/47th Infantry, 3rd Brigade]], [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]],<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/trivia</ref> Forrest and Bubba meet their platoon leader Lieutenant Dan Taylor, whom Forrest would refer to as \"Lieutenant Dan\". While on patrol, Bubba proposed that he and Forrest go into the shrimping business together after their time in the army was finished, and Forrest agreed.\n\nAfter several uneventful months, their platoon was ambushed by the [[Viet Cong]] and several soldiers were wounded and killed. In the confusion, Forrest initially was ordered to retreat, and was separated from the rest of his platoon, but after becoming concerned for Bubba, he ran back to look for him. Forrest then found Lieutenant Dan and several other wounded soldiers and carried them to safety before continuing to look for Bubba. Forrest finally found Bubba badly wounded and managed to carry him away from the combat area before it was hit with [[napalm]] from an air strike. Sadly, Bubba died of complications from his wounds soon after; his last words were \"I wanna go home.\"\n\nForrest himself was shot in the [[buttocks]] during the firefight and recovered in an army medical center in [[Saigon]]. Lieutenant Dan was in the bed next to his, having lost his legs because of his injuries. Lieutenant Dan later became angry at Forrest for cheating him out of his destiny to die in battle with honor (as several of his ancestors had) and rendering him crippled.\n\n===Washington, D.C.===\nForrest later receives the [[Medal of Honor]] for his bravery in Vietnam. When being awarded, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] asked where he was hit and when Forrest told him, the President whispered in his ear, saying he'd like to see it someday. Forrest promptly lowered his trousers and turned to show him his wound (while on national TV). President Johnson simply smiles and walks away.\n\nShortly thereafter, Forrest went out sightseeing in Washington, D.C. and accidentally found himself among a group of veterans attending an anti-war rally led by [[Abbie Hoffman]]. While making a speech at the rally that was rudely cut off by a policeman, he was reunited with Jenny, who had since become a [[hippie]]. Forrest was less enamored with her new boyfriend Wesley, the president of the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and beat him up after he saw him hit Jenny during an argument at a [[Black Panther Party]] gathering. Forrest and Jenny stayed up all night while Jenny told Forrest of her travels. Before they went their separate ways again in the morning, Forrest gave Jenny his Medal of Honor, saying \"I got it just by doing what you told me to do,\" since Jenny told him to just run away instead of being brave in combat.\n\n===Ping Pong and New York City===\nIn 1969, Forrest joined the Army Special Services, where he entertained wounded military veterans with his Ping-Pong skills. His exceptional skills earned him a place in the All-American Ping Pong team, with whom he traveled to China during the [[Ping Pong Diplomacy]] period of the early 1970s. Upon his return, Forrest was a national celebrity, \"famous-er even than [[Captain Kangaroo]]\", and was invited to New York City by [[Dick Cavett]] to appear on [[The Dick Cavett Show]], where [[John Lennon]] was also a guest at the time. Hearing Forrest talking about the Chinese having \"no possessions\" and \"no religion\" during his interview with Dick would eventually inspire John Lennon to write the song \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\".\n\nSoon after, Forrest reunites and stays with Lieutenant Dan, his platoon leader from Vietnam and now using a wheelchair, over the winter holidays. Dan has since became an alcoholic who has lost all faith in God, and was dismayed that such an \"imbecile\" like Forrest could earn the Medal of Honor and humiliate himself on national television. During a New Year's Eve celebration in 1971, Forrest persuades Lieutenant Dan to join him in the shrimping business as his first mate, in an effort to fulfill his promise made to Bubba earlier in Vietnam. Dan later invites two prostitutes, Carla and Lenore, to his New Year's Day party, both of whom he eventually kicked out of his apartment for insulting Forrest when Forrest rejected their advances. Forrest apologizes to Dan for ruining his party, to which Dan replied by simply wishing Forrest Happy New Year.\n\nIn June 1972, Forrest was invited with the US Ping Pong team to the White House, where he meets President [[Richard Nixon]], who offers him a room to stay in at Watergate Hotel. That night, Forrest was awakened by a group of people with flashlights breaking into an unlit office. Mistaking it for a power outage, Forrest calls security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] to inform him about the break-in, inadvertently initiating the [[Watergate Scandal]] and leading to Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974. In that same year, Forrest was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of Sergeant.\n\n===Shrimping Boat Captain===\nUpon his return in August 1974, Forrest finds his Greenbow house filled with memorabilia capitalizing on his fame as a ping-pong player in China. At his mother's insistence, Forrest made $25,000 endorsing a brand of ping-pong paddles, and used most of the money to travel to Bubba's hometown of Bayou La Batre and purchase a boat. When someone pointed out it was bad luck to have a boat without a name, Forrest names his boat after Jenny, which he calls, \"The most beautiful name in the whole wide world.\" Unbeknownst to Forrest, Jenny had descended into a life of drugs, burglary and sexual promiscuity at this point, but an event in which she nearly slips and falls off a balcony as she \"contemplates\" suicide while high on drugs in a Los Angeles apartment shakes her to her core.\n\nLater Forrest was visited by Lieutenant Dan who, just as he said he would do on New Year's Eve of 1971, had come to be Forrest's first mate. For several weeks, the two had no luck catching shrimp. However, things changed when the area was hit by [[Hurricane Carmen]]. Forrest's boat was the only one left standing and they found themselves with a monopoly of shrimp. Under the name [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], they soon became very wealthy. Apparently having faced his demons during the storm, Lieutenant Dan thanked Forrest for saving his life in Vietnam, and Forrest assumes that Dan (without actually saying so) made peace with God.\n\n===Home in Alabama===\nForrest returned home to Greenbow in September 1975 when he learned his mother was dying of cancer. After her death, Forrest stays and leaves his shrimping industry in the hands of Lieutenant Dan and retired to mowing and cutting grass and lawns, as he apparently enjoys doing it. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Dan participated in a substantial investment into what Forrest says to be \"some kind of fruit company\". In reality, the company was the fledgling [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. With the money he got from the Apple Computer investment, Forrest spent them on renovating the church he frequents, establishing a medical center at Bubba's hometown and gave Bubba's family Bubba's share of the investment money that is enough for them to never work again.\n\nJenny returned to Greenbow and moves in with Forrest. The two spent time together catching up, and Forrest later describes it as \"the happiest time of [his] life again\".  One day, they happen to walk past the now abandoned house that had belonged to Jenny's father. She stares transfixed for a moment, and then starts throwing every rock she can find at it, before collapsing in despair, and now Forrest truly understands the ordeal she had been through as a child. Another night, July 4, 1976, Forrest asked Jenny to marry him, but she turns him down, saying \"You don't want to marry me.\" Forrest replies with, \"Why don't you love me Jenny? I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.\" After this exchange, Jenny comes to Forrest's bedroom, tells him she loves him, and the two make love. Wanting to restart on her own, Jenny hails a cab very early the next morning and leaves before he wakes up.\n\n===Running===\nForrest's new-found loneliness leads him to take a run \"for no particular reason\". At first, he decides to run to the end of the road, then across town, then across the county, then all the way to the Mississippi border. Eventually, he criss-crosses the country several times over a span of three years. Forrest attracts media coverage, and eventually, dozens of followers initiating and inspiring what would become the [[Running boom of the 1970s|jogging craze]] of 1978\u201381. Meanwhile, Jenny has taken a job as a waitress in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and sees news coverage of Forrest's run on television. During the run, he inspires the phrase \"[[Shit happens]]\" to a bumper-sticker salesman after stepping in a pile of dog droppings. He also uses a yellow T-shirt provided to him by a shirt designer to wipe off his face after being splattered by mud from a big rig. In the process, he forms the iconic \"[[Smiley|Smiley face]]\" logo and tells the man \"Have a nice day.\" One day, while running in the [[Western United States]], Forrest suddenly stops; his followers all stop and listen on in anticipation, expecting him to offer words of wisdom, but instead he simply announces that he's tired, then turns around and walks back to Alabama, leaving his followers dumbfounded at his sudden decision.\n\n===Back to the present===\nBack to the present (the \"present\" in the film being 1981, as seen from a car and on a bus, and televised footage of [[Reagan assassination attempt|Ronald Reagan's escape from assassination]]), Forrest tells his latest companion on the bench, an elderly woman, that he had recently received a letter from Jenny asking him to come see her. When told Forrest's destination, the old lady informs him that it is only 5 to 6 blocks away. Thanking her, Forrest sets off on foot towards Jenny's home.\n\nForrest and Jenny are happy to see each other. However, before they can do much catching up, Forrest is introduced to Jenny's young son, a bright young boy whom she named Forrest after him. Forrest at first thinks she met another man named Forrest, until she explains \"You're his daddy, Forrest.\" Forrest's fearful inquiry as to Little Forrest's intelligence leads Jenny to quickly assert that he is completely normal. Forrest learns that Jenny is sick from an unknown virus (implied to be either HIV or Hepatitis C, as both were unknown diseases at that time) which has no known cure. He invites her and Little Forrest to come home and stay with him. She asks him to marry her and he accepts.\n\nForrest and Jenny's wedding is a quiet, intimate ceremony attended only by a handful of family and friends. Among the attendees is Lieutenant Dan, who has titanium prosthetic legs, (claiming to be made of the same material as the Space Shuttle), with his Vietnamese fianc\u00e9e Susan. It is the only time Jenny and Dan meet. Forrest, Jenny and Little Forrest only have a year together as a family before Jenny would die on a Saturday. Before she dies, she asked Forrest what it was like in Vietnam. He responded by saying that it was nice, and when it stopped raining, it would be quiet and peaceful. He also states that while running in Oregon, it looked as if there were two skies and two mountains (since there was a lake in front of the mountain). Forrest also states that while running in the desert, when the sun was rising, it was the most beautiful sight ever.\n\nJenny responds by saying that she wished she was there with him. Forrest smiles and says, \"You were there with me\". Forrest has her buried under the tree where they played as children, then buys her childhood home (where her father had abused her) and has it bulldozed. Though he misses Jenny terribly, Forrest becomes a good father to Little Forrest.\n\nVisiting Jenny's grave one day in 1982, he reflects on the idea of fate and destiny, wondering if his mother was right about people having their own destiny, or if  Lieutenant Dan was right about description of life as floating around accidentally like on a breeze. Forrest eventually decides \"maybe it's both, maybe both are happening at the same time.\" He leaves Jenny a letter from Little Forrest and tells her \"If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.\"\n\nForrest is last seen outside his home, sitting where he and his mother sat waiting for the bus, seeing Little Forrest off on his bus ride to school, telling him that he loves him and that he will be waiting for him.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\n{{original research section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Forrest Gump brick.jpg|thumb|Forrest Gump brick in front of the Lucas Theater in Savannah, Georgia, USA]]\nThe portrayal of Forrest in the original novel differs from how he was portrayed in the film. In the novel, Forrest is shown to be somewhat cynical and abrasive, while in the film, he is more placid and na\u00efve. The novel also describes him as being a savant with extraordinary talent in numerical calculation (as shown when he states the exact amount of time in years, months, days and hours that he spent running across the country). Other changes from the novel to the film include the deaths of Forrest's mother and his wife, Jenny, neither of whom died in the book. Whilst the film has him running around the country for over three long years, the novel sends him rocketing into space and later crash-landing in New Guinea and being captured by a tribe of cannibals.\n\nThe novel also provides additional backstory on his father. It is revealed that his father was a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] who worked for [[United Fruit Company]]. He was killed when a crate of bananas being loaded off of a boat fell on top of him, crushing him to death. Forrest goes on a number of different adventures including being an [[astronaut]], playing the harmonica in a band called the Cracked Eggs, becoming a professional wrestler (\"The Dunce\") and running for the [[United States Senate]] (with the campaign slogan \"We Got to Pee\").\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Forrest Gump}}\n{{Forbes Fictional 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gump, Forrest}}\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Drama film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disability]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional players of American football]]\n[[Category:Fictional janitors]]\n[[Category:Fictional sea captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional musicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional fishers]]\n[[Category:Fictional privates]]\n[[Category:Fictional military sergeants]]\n[[Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of bullies]]\n[[Category:Fictional Medal of Honor recipients]]\n[[Category:Fictional runners]]\n[[Category:Fictional professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Fictional table tennis players]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Military humor]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}\n{{In-universe|date=May 2011}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour = blue\n| name = Forrest Gump\n| series = [[Forrest Gump]]\n| image = Forest Gump Character.jpg\n| caption = Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump in the eponymous film\n| gender = Male\n| occupation =  Philanthropist<br/> [[Ping-pong]] player (formerly)<br/> [[Shrimping]] boat captain (formerly)<br/> [[Vietnam War]] sergeant (formerly)<br /> College football player (formerly)<br/>\n| family = Mrs. Gump (mother)<br/>''(deceased)''<br>Unnamed father ''(deceased)\n| spouse = Jennifer \"Jenny\" Gump (nee Curran)<br/>''(deceased)'' \n| children = Forrest Gump, Jr.\n| portrayer = [[Tom Hanks]]<br> (adult)<br/> [[Michael Conner Humphreys]]<br> (child)\n| first   = [[Forrest Gump (novel)|Forrest Gump (1986 Novel)]]\n| creator = '''Novel character'''<br/>[[Winston Groom]]<br/>'''Film character'''<br/>[[Eric Roth]]\n}}\n\n'''Forrest Alexander Gump''' is a fictional character and the protagonist of the 1986 [[Forrest Gump (novel)|novel]] by [[Winston Groom]], [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s 1994 [[Forrest Gump|film of the same name]], and ''[[Gump and Co.]]'', the written sequel to Groom's novel.

Sadly, Bubba died of complications from his wounds soon after; his last words were \"I wanna go home.\"\n\nForrest himself was shot in the [[buttocks]] during the firefight and recovered in an army medical center in [[Saigon]]. Lieutenant Dan was in the bed next to his, having lost his legs because of his injuries. Lieutenant Dan later became angry at Forrest for cheating him out of his destiny to die in battle with honor (as several of his ancestors had) and rendering him crippled.\n\n===Washington, D.C.===\nForrest later receives the [[Medal of Honor]] for his bravery in Vietnam. When being awarded, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] asked where he was hit and when Forrest told him, the President whispered in his ear, saying he'd like to see it someday. Forrest promptly lowered his trousers and turned to show him his wound (while on national TV). President Johnson simply smiles and walks away.\n\nShortly thereafter, Forrest went out sightseeing in Washington, D.C. and accidentally found himself among a group of veterans attending an anti-war rally led by [[Abbie Hoffman]]. While making a speech at the rally that was rudely cut off by a policeman, he was reunited with Jenny, who had since become a [[hippie]]. Forrest was less enamored with her new boyfriend Wesley, the president of the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and beat him up after he saw him hit Jenny during an argument at a [[Black Panther Party]] gathering. Forrest and Jenny stayed up all night while Jenny told Forrest of her travels. Before they went their separate ways again in the morning, Forrest gave Jenny his Medal of Honor, saying \"I got it just by doing what you told me to do,\" since Jenny told him to just run away instead of being brave in combat.\n\n===Ping Pong and New York City===\nIn 1969, Forrest joined the Army Special Services, where he entertained wounded military veterans with his Ping-Pong skills. His exceptional skills earned him a place in the All-American Ping Pong team, with whom he traveled to China during the [[Ping Pong Diplomacy]] period of the early 1970s. Upon his return, Forrest was a national celebrity, \"famous-er even than [[Captain Kangaroo]]\", and was invited to New York City by [[Dick Cavett]] to appear on [[The Dick Cavett Show]], where [[John Lennon]] was also a guest at the time. Hearing Forrest talking about the Chinese having \"no possessions\" and \"no religion\" during his interview with Dick would eventually inspire John Lennon to write the song \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\".\n\nSoon after, Forrest reunites and stays with Lieutenant Dan, his platoon leader from Vietnam and now using a wheelchair, over the winter holidays. Dan has since became an alcoholic who has lost all faith in God, and was dismayed that such an \"imbecile\" like Forrest could earn the Medal of Honor and humiliate himself on national television. During a New Year's Eve celebration in 1971, Forrest persuades Lieutenant Dan to join him in the shrimping business as his first mate, in an effort to fulfill his promise made to Bubba earlier in Vietnam. Dan later invites two prostitutes, Carla and Lenore, to his New Year's Day party, both of whom he eventually kicked out of his apartment for insulting Forrest when Forrest rejected their advances. Forrest apologizes to Dan for ruining his party, to which Dan replied by simply wishing Forrest Happy New Year.\n\nIn June 1972, Forrest was invited with the US Ping Pong team to the White House, where he meets President [[Richard Nixon]], who offers him a room to stay in at Watergate Hotel. That night, Forrest was awakened by a group of people with flashlights breaking into an unlit office. Mistaking it for a power outage, Forrest calls security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] to inform him about the break-in, inadvertently initiating the [[Watergate Scandal]] and leading to Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974. In that same year, Forrest was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of Sergeant.\n\n===Shrimping Boat Captain===\nUpon his return in August 1974, Forrest finds his Greenbow house filled with memorabilia capitalizing on his fame as a ping-pong player in China. At his mother's insistence, Forrest made $25,000 endorsing a brand of ping-pong paddles, and used most of the money to travel to Bubba's hometown of Bayou La Batre and purchase a boat. When someone pointed out it was bad luck to have a boat without a name, Forrest names his boat after Jenny, which he calls, \"The most beautiful name in the whole wide world.\" Unbeknownst to Forrest, Jenny had descended into a life of drugs, burglary and sexual promiscuity at this point, but an event in which she nearly slips and falls off a balcony as she \"contemplates\" suicide while high on drugs in a Los Angeles apartment shakes her to her core.\n\nLater Forrest was visited by Lieutenant Dan who, just as he said he would do on New Year's Eve of 1971, had come to be Forrest's first mate. For several weeks, the two had no luck catching shrimp. However, things changed when the area was hit by [[Hurricane Carmen]]. Forrest's boat was the only one left standing and they found themselves with a monopoly of shrimp. Under the name [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], they soon became very wealthy. Apparently having faced his demons during the storm, Lieutenant Dan thanked Forrest for saving his life in Vietnam, and Forrest assumes that Dan (without actually saying so) made peace with God.\n\n===Home in Alabama===\nForrest returned home to Greenbow in September 1975 when he learned his mother was dying of cancer. After her death, Forrest stays and leaves his shrimping industry in the hands of Lieutenant Dan and retired to mowing and cutting grass and lawns, as he apparently enjoys doing it. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Dan participated in a substantial investment into what Forrest says to be \"some kind of fruit company\". In reality, the company was the fledgling [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. With the money he got from the Apple Computer investment, Forrest spent them on renovating the church he frequents, establishing a medical center at Bubba's hometown and gave Bubba's family Bubba's share of the investment money that is enough for them to never work again.\n\nJenny returned to Greenbow and moves in with Forrest. The two spent time together catching up, and Forrest later describes it as \"the happiest time of [his] life again\".  One day, they happen to walk past the now abandoned house that had belonged to Jenny's father. She stares transfixed for a moment, and then starts throwing every rock she can find at it, before collapsing in despair, and now Forrest truly understands the ordeal she had been through as a child. Another night, July 4, 1976, Forrest asked Jenny to marry him, but she turns him down, saying \"You don't want to marry me.\" Forrest replies with, \"Why don't you love me Jenny? I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.\" After this exchange, Jenny comes to Forrest's bedroom, tells him she loves him, and the two make love. Wanting to restart on her own, Jenny hails a cab very early the next morning and leaves before he wakes up.\n\n===Running===\nForrest's new-found loneliness leads him to take a run \"for no particular reason\". At first, he decides to run to the end of the road, then across town, then across the county, then all the way to the Mississippi border. Eventually, he criss-crosses the country several times over a span of three years. Forrest attracts media coverage, and eventually, dozens of followers initiating and inspiring what would become the [[Running boom of the 1970s|jogging craze]] of 1978\u201381. Meanwhile, Jenny has taken a job as a waitress in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and sees news coverage of Forrest's run on television. During the run, he inspires the phrase \"[[Shit happens]]\" to a bumper-sticker salesman after stepping in a pile of dog droppings. He also uses a yellow T-shirt provided to him by a shirt designer to wipe off his face after being splattered by mud from a big rig. In the process, he forms the iconic \"[[Smiley|Smiley face]]\" logo and tells the man \"Have a nice day.\" One day, while running in the [[Western United States]], Forrest suddenly stops; his followers all stop and listen on in anticipation, expecting him to offer words of wisdom, but instead he simply announces that he's tired, then turns around and walks back to Alabama, leaving his followers dumbfounded at his sudden decision.\n\n===Back to the present===\nBack to the present (the \"present\" in the film being 1981, as seen from a car and on a bus, and televised footage of [[Reagan assassination attempt|Ronald Reagan's escape from assassination]]), Forrest tells his latest companion on the bench, an elderly woman, that he had recently received a letter from Jenny asking him to come see her. When told Forrest's destination, the old lady informs him that it is only 5 to 6 blocks away. Thanking her, Forrest sets off on foot towards Jenny's home.\n\nForrest and Jenny are happy to see each other. However, before they can do much catching up, Forrest is introduced to Jenny's young son, a bright young boy whom she named Forrest after him. Forrest at first thinks she met another man named Forrest, until she explains \"You're his daddy, Forrest.\" Forrest's fearful inquiry as to Little Forrest's intelligence leads Jenny to quickly assert that he is completely normal. Forrest learns that Jenny is sick from an unknown virus (implied to be either HIV or Hepatitis C, as both were unknown diseases at that time) which has no known cure. He invites her and Little Forrest to come home and stay with him. She asks him to marry her and he accepts.\n\nForrest and Jenny's wedding is a quiet, intimate ceremony attended only by a handful of family and friends. Among the attendees is Lieutenant Dan, who has titanium prosthetic legs, (claiming to be made of the same material as the Space Shuttle), with his Vietnamese fianc\u00e9e Susan. It is the only time Jenny and Dan meet. Forrest, Jenny and Little Forrest only have a year together as a family before Jenny would die on a Saturday. Before she dies, she asked Forrest what it was like in Vietnam. He responded by saying that it was nice, and when it stopped raining, it would be quiet and peaceful. He also states that while running in Oregon, it looked as if there were two skies and two mountains (since there was a lake in front of the mountain). Forrest also states that while running in the desert, when the sun was rising, it was the most beautiful sight ever.\n\nJenny responds by saying that she wished she was there with him. Forrest smiles and says, \"You were there with me\". Forrest has her buried under the tree where they played as children, then buys her childhood home (where her father had abused her) and has it bulldozed. Though he misses Jenny terribly, Forrest becomes a good father to Little Forrest.\n\nVisiting Jenny's grave one day in 1982, he reflects on the idea of fate and destiny, wondering if his mother was right about people having their own destiny, or if  Lieutenant Dan was right about description of life as floating around accidentally like on a breeze. Forrest eventually decides \"maybe it's both, maybe both are happening at the same time.\" He leaves Jenny a letter from Little Forrest and tells her \"If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.\"\n\nForrest is last seen outside his home, sitting where he and his mother sat waiting for the bus, seeing Little Forrest off on his bus ride to school, telling him that he loves him and that he will be waiting for him.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\n{{original research section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Forrest Gump brick.jpg|thumb|Forrest Gump brick in front of the Lucas Theater in Savannah, Georgia, USA]]\nThe portrayal of Forrest in the original novel differs from how he was portrayed in the film. In the novel, Forrest is shown to be somewhat cynical and abrasive, while in the film, he is more placid and na\u00efve. The novel also describes him as being a savant with extraordinary talent in numerical calculation (as shown when he states the exact amount of time in years, months, days and hours that he spent running across the country). Other changes from the novel to the film include the deaths of Forrest's mother and his wife, Jenny, neither of whom died in the book. Whilst the film has him running around the country for over three long years, the novel sends him rocketing into space and later crash-landing in New Guinea and being captured by a tribe of cannibals.\n\nThe novel also provides additional backstory on his father. It is revealed that his father was a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] who worked for [[United Fruit Company]]. He was killed when a crate of bananas being loaded off of a boat fell on top of him, crushing him to death. Forrest goes on a number of different adventures including being an [[astronaut]], playing the harmonica in a band called the Cracked Eggs, becoming a professional wrestler (\"The Dunce\") and running for the [[United States Senate]] (with the campaign slogan \"We Got to Pee\").\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Forrest Gump}}\n{{Forbes Fictional 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gump, Forrest}}\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Drama film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disability]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional players of American football]]\n[[Category:Fictional janitors]]\n[[Category:Fictional sea captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional musicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional fishers]]\n[[Category:Fictional privates]]\n[[Category:Fictional military sergeants]]\n[[Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of bullies]]\n[[Category:Fictional Medal of Honor recipients]]\n[[Category:Fictional runners]]\n[[Category:Fictional professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Fictional table tennis players]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Military humor]]\n", "name_user": "109.205.217.16", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFictional character biography)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(character)"}

He also discusses a culture that views womanhood as having the ability to give birth. As such, he claims that this harms Erica's ability to be perceived as a woman.

Community programmes include the annual Safe City awards including the Community Initiative Award, the Constable Peter Ball Memorial Youth Award and the Community Kids Award.\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe percentage of residents born overseas (39.4%) is greater than both the national (27%) and metropolitan (31.3%) average.  11.3% of residents were born in England; 3% in New Zealand, and significant smaller percentages from Malaysia, India and Scotland. 14% of residents speak a language other than English at home. Unemployment (3.4%) is lower than the regional average (3.7%) and socio-economic disadvantage less than the City of Gosnells as whole. Weekly household incomes are characterised by a lower proportion of both low and higher income households compared with the Perth average. There are no major differences between the religious affiliation of Thornlie and the Perth region as a whole. The dominant religion is Catholicism (22.4%) followed by Anglicanism (19.5%), Islam (4.6%) and Buddhism (3.5%). Since 2001 there has been a mild decline in the number of Catholics and Anglicans and an increase in the number of Muslims, by 2002 Thornlie had the highest population of Muslims in Perth.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title=Muslim minorities in the West : visible and invisible / edited by Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad & Jane I.

Whilst the Radburn principles flavoured many other post-war developments across Australia including the Perth suburbs of [[City Beach, Western Australia|City Beach]] and [[Karawara, Western Australia|Karawara]], it remains one of the few suburbs that has not undergone a sustained process of 'de-Radburnisation' since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellwood|first=Constance|title=\"I wish I was anywhere but here\": \"Structure of address\" in the badlands|journal=Transformations|date=September 2006|issue=13|url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_13/article_07.shtml}}</ref> From a heritage perspective Crestwood is a highly significant link to a major twentieth century urban design movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freestone|first=Robert|title=Urban Nation: Australia's Planning Heritage|year=2010|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|pages=195}}</ref>\n\nCrestwood was based on the ideas of [[Paul Ritter]], Perth's first and somewhat controversial city planner.<ref>{{cite news|last=MacTiernan|first=A|title=Paul Ritter \u2014Condolence|url=http://parliament.wa.gov.au/Hansard%5Chansard.nsf/0/1708644d3ba7e423482578be002a7a35/$FILE/A38%20S1%2020100617%20p4097c-4097c.pdf|newspaper=Hansard|date=17 June 2010}}</ref> Ritter had spent many years advocating the idea that \"it takes a village to raise a child\". One of his lectures on creating innovative urban environments to meet the needs of family and community life captured the imagination of property developer Ron Sloan. Together Sloan, Paul Ritter and planner Hugh Reynolds designed a residential estate according to a strict design brief.\n\nCrestwood was to be equally efficient and economical as a conventional subdivision, with the same density of homes ({{convert|3.3|/acre|/ha|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}}), but 8% additional open space. Every house was to face a park and roads were to be designed to limit the speed of vehicles. There was to be passive surveillance of recreational areas, and pedestrian traffic through the estate was to be separated from vehicular. Each house was individually designed, some through a design competition organised by the Institute of Architects.\n\nOriginally, Crestwood was intended to be built to about five times the size that was eventually constructed. It was to be built around a large pool complex with administration buildings and a recreational area. However, the collapse of land values in the early 1970s led to slow takeup of the allotments and significant losses for Sloan.<ref>{{Cite news|last=De Poloni|first=Glenn|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-23/crestwood-estate-50-years-as-perfect-radburn-neighbourhood/11981830|title=Crestwood defies odds to celebrate 50 years as the first \u2018perfect\u2019 Radburn neighbourhood in the world|date=23 February 2020|work=ABC News|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>The subdivision never progressed as envisioned and the land was used in the 1980s and 1990s for two more conventional subdivisions, Forest Lakes and Castle Glen Estates.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Thornlie Leisure Centre 07 SMC.jpg|Thornlie Leisure Centre\nImage:Thornlie Library 07 SMC.jpg|Thornlie Library<ref>[http://www.gosnells.wa.gov.au/scripts/viewarticle.asp?NID=9414 Thornlie Library] Retrieved 2007-04-15.</ref>\nImage:Tom_Bateman_Reserve_SMC.jpg|Tom Bateman Reserve\nImage:Baseball ground, Thornlie, Perth, WA SMC.jpg|Baseball Park\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n\n* [http://www.gosnells.wa.gov.au/ City of Gosnells official website]\n* [http://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/r.jsp?RegionSummary&region=506041137&dataset=ABS_NRP9_ASGS&geoconcept=REGION&datasetASGS=ABS_NRP9_ASGS&datasetLGA=ABS_NRP9_LGA&regionLGA=REGION&regionASGS=REGION Australian Bureau of Statistics Thornlie (SA2)]\n\n{{City of Gosnells suburbs}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Suburbs in the City of Gosnells]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=March 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox Australian place\n| type                     = suburb \n| name                     = Thornlie\n| city                     = [[Perth]]\n| state                    = wa\n| image                    = Thornlie Square 07 SMC.jpg \n| caption                  = Thornlie Square shopping centre\n| pop                      = 23,153\n| pop_year                 = {{CensusAU|2016}}\n| pop_footnotes            = <ref name=abs>{{Census 2016 AUS|id=SSC51437|name=Thornlie (State Suburb)|quick=on|accessdate=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n| postcode                 = 6108\n| lga                      = City of Gosnells\n| alternative_location_map = Australia Western Australia metropolitan Perth\n| coordinates              = {{Coord|32.058|S|115.958|E|display=inline,title}}\n| area                     = 11.6\n| est                      = 1956\n| stategov                 = [[Electoral district of Gosnells|Gosnells]], [[Electoral district of Cannington|Cannington]], [[Electoral district of Southern River|Southern River]]\n| fedgov                   = [[Division of Burt|Burt]]\n| near-nw                  = [[Langford, Western Australia|Langford]]\n| near-n                   = [[Kenwick, Western Australia|Kenwick]]\n| near-ne                  = [[Maddington, Western Australia|Maddington]]\n| near-e                   = [[Gosnells, Western Australia|Gosnells]]\n| near-w                   = [[Parkwood, Western Australia|Parkwood]]\n| near-sw                  = [[Canning Vale, Western Australia|Canning Vale]]\n| near-s                   = [[Southern River, Western Australia|Southern River]]\n| near-se                  = [[Huntingdale, Western Australia|Huntingdale]]\n| dist1                    = 18\n| dir1                     = SSE\n| location1                = the [[Perth#Central business district|Perth CBD]]\n}}\n\n'''Thornlie''' is a large residential [[list of Perth suburbs|suburb]] of [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], located 18 kilometres south-east of the city's [[Perth#Central business district|central business district]].

Unemployment (3.4%) is lower than the regional average (3.7%) and socio-economic disadvantage less than the City of Gosnells as whole. Weekly household incomes are characterised by a lower proportion of both low and higher income households compared with the Perth average. There are no major differences between the religious affiliation of Thornlie and the Perth region as a whole. The dominant religion is Catholicism (22.4%) followed by Anglicanism (19.5%), Islam (4.6%) and Buddhism (3.5%). Since 2001 there has been a mild decline in the number of Catholics and Anglicans and an increase in the number of Muslims, by 2002 Thornlie had the highest population of Muslims in Perth.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title=Muslim minorities in the West : visible and invisible / edited by Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad & Jane I.

One of his lectures on creating innovative urban environments to meet the needs of family and community life captured the imagination of property developer Ron Sloan. Together Sloan, Paul Ritter and planner Hugh Reynolds designed a residential estate according to a strict design brief.\n\nCrestwood was to be equally efficient and economical as a conventional subdivision, with the same density of homes ({{convert|3.3|/acre|/ha|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}}), but 8% additional open space. Every house was to face a park and roads were to be designed to limit the speed of vehicles. There was to be passive surveillance of recreational areas, and pedestrian traffic through the estate was to be separated from vehicular. Each house was individually designed, some through a design competition organised by the Institute of Architects.\n\nOriginally, Crestwood was intended to be built to about five times the size that was eventually constructed. It was to be built around a large pool complex with administration buildings and a recreational area. However, the collapse of land values in the early 1970s led to slow takeup of the allotments and significant losses for Sloan.<ref>{{Cite news|last=De Poloni|first=Glenn|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-23/crestwood-estate-50-years-as-perfect-radburn-neighbourhood/11981830|title=Crestwood defies odds to celebrate 50 years as the first \u2018perfect\u2019 Radburn neighbourhood in the world|date=23 February 2020|work=ABC News|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>The subdivision never progressed as envisioned and the land was used in the 1980s and 1990s for two more conventional subdivisions, Forest Lakes and Castle Glen Estates.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Thornlie Leisure Centre 07 SMC.jpg|Thornlie Leisure Centre\nImage:Thornlie Library 07 SMC.jpg|Thornlie Library<ref>[http://www.gosnells.wa.gov.au/scripts/viewarticle.asp?NID=9414 Thornlie Library] Retrieved 2007-04-15.</ref>\nImage:Tom_Bateman_Reserve_SMC.jpg|Tom Bateman Reserve\nImage:Baseball ground, Thornlie, Perth, WA SMC.jpg|Baseball Park\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n\n* [http://www.gosnells.wa.gov.au/ City of Gosnells official website]\n* [http://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/r.jsp?RegionSummary&region=506041137&dataset=ABS_NRP9_ASGS&geoconcept=REGION&datasetASGS=ABS_NRP9_ASGS&datasetLGA=ABS_NRP9_LGA&regionLGA=REGION&regionASGS=REGION Australian Bureau of Statistics Thornlie (SA2)]\n\n{{City of Gosnells suburbs}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Suburbs in the City of Gosnells]]\n", "name_user": "Kenwick", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornlie,_Western_Australia"}

The case is named after the [[Persian language|Persian]] phrase ''tam\u00e1m shud'', meaning \"ended\" or \"finished,\" which was printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the [[Besom pocket|fob pocket]] of the man's trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'', authored by 12th-century poet [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]].

Entitled \"Body found on Beach\", it read:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nA body, believed to be of E.C. Johnson, about 45, of Arthur St, Payneham, was found on Somerton Beach, opposite the Crippled Children's Home yesterday morning. The discovery was made by Mr J. Lyons, of Whyte Rd, Somerton.

The case is named after the [[Persian language|Persian]] phrase ''tam\u00e1m shud'', meaning \"ended\" or \"finished,\" which was printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the [[Besom pocket|fob pocket]] of the man's trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'', authored by 12th-century poet [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]. ''Tam\u00e1m'' was misspelt as ''Tam\u00e1n'' in many early reports, and this error has often been repeated, leading to confusion about the name in the media.{{refn|group=\"note\"|While the words that end ''[[The Rubaiyat]]'' are \"Tam\u00e1m Shud\" ({{lang|fa|\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0634\u062f}}), it has often been referred to as \"Taman Shud\" in the media, because of a spelling error in early newspaper coverage or police reports which has persisted.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In [[Persian language|Persian]], {{lang|fa|[[wikt:\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645#Persian|\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645]]}} ''tam\u00e1m'' is a noun that means \"the end\" and {{lang|fa|[[wikt:\u0634\u062f#Persian|\u0634\u062f]]}} ''shud'' is an auxiliary verb indicating past tense, so ''tamam shud'' means \"ended\" or \"finished\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abbott |first1=Derek |title=List of facts on the Taman Shud Case that are often misreported |url=https://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/wiki/index.php/List_of_facts_on_the_Taman_Shud_Case_that_are_often_misreported |accessdate=19 November 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nFollowing a public appeal by police, the book from which the page had been torn was located.

Public interest in the case remains significant for several reasons: the death occurred at a time of heightened international tensions following the beginning of the [[Cold War]]; the apparent involvement of a secret code; the possible use of an undetectable poison; and the inability of authorities to identify the dead man.\n\nIn addition to intense public interest in Australia during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Tam\u00e1m Shud case also attracted international attention.

Byrd began his career in 1952 as member of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/get-on-up/|title=Get On Up True Story vs. Movie - Real James Brown, Bobby Byrd|website=HistoryvsHollywood.com|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to [[The Famous Flames]]. Byrd was the actual founder of The Flames and is credited with the discovery of [[James Brown]]. He also claims responsibility for writing most of James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] posthumously in 2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]'s Pioneer Award. Byrd helped to inspire the musical aspirations of James Brown, who launched his career with Byrd.\n\n==Early life and career==\nByrd was born in [[Toccoa, Georgia]], to a religiously devout family, where they were respected members of the church congregation and active in their neighborhood there.<ref>Cliff White: ''You Know He Got Soul'', Polygram sleevenotes (1995).</ref> Byrd started being active in his local church choir with the group, the Zioneers, later making a name for himself as member of the Gospel Starlighters,<ref name=\"auto\"/> which included his sister Sarah. At a time when church elders disapproved of secular singing, the band members would leave their home state and perform in South Carolina as the R&B group the Avons, eventually they left gospel behind and went on as the Avons. The original group consisted of Byrd, who played piano, organ and sang lead vocals; and Nafloyd Scott, Fred Pulliam and Doyle Oglesby.\n\n==Meeting James Brown and the formation of The Famous Flames==\n{{main|The Famous Flames}}\nIn 1952 Bobby Byrd formed and sang with a gospel group called the Gospel Starlighters. During a friendly baseball match at a juvenile prison, he met a young [[James Brown]] who was serving time there on robbery charges. Byrd befriended him and arranged for Byrd's family to oversee Brown's parole.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/14/AR2007091402400.html |title=Bobby Byrd, 73; Musician Credited in Igniting Career of James Brown |website=Washingtonpost.com |date= September 15, 2007|accessdate=2013-01-04 |first=Adam |last=Bernstein}}</ref> This began a personal and professional association that lasted until 1973.\n\nAlthough Byrd would eventually have over twenty years as a solo performer, it is his association with [[James Brown]] for which he is chiefly remembered. Contrary to belief, the group had already changed its name to the Flames when Brown asked Byrd for a spot in the group, with Brown first settling as a drummer. Eventually Brown was driven to perform as lead singer, as he felt lead vocalists got more attention from women. Byrd recognized early that Brown was unique and that it would be impossible to control him: \"I didn't need him in competition, I needed him with me, that's why I worked so hard to get him over to my group.\" <ref>Cliff White: ''You Know He Got Soul'', Polygram sleevenotes (1995)</ref> In 1956, Clint Brantley signed on as the group's manager. With Johnny Terry and Nash Knox on board, the group became \"The Famous Flames\" and won a deal with [[Ralph Bass]]' [[Federal Records|Federal]] label, which was a subsidiary of [[Syd Nathan]]'s [[King Records (USA)|King]] Records,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/king/kingstory.html|title=King/Federal/DeLuxe Story|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> in February 1956. Their first record, \"[[Please, Please, Please]]\", which Byrd said he wrote with Johnny Terry, featured a lead vocal by [[James Brown]] and was issued with the billing, \"James Brown and the Famous Flames\", which did not go well with the rest of the group. After three sessions, the original Flames broke up.\n\nThe Flames without Brown changed their name to Byrd's Drops of Joy. However, they found little success; when Brown approached them to reform the Flames they agreed. At this point, The Famous Flames ceased being a vocal/instrumental group, and became a straight vocal group, since Brown had begun to employ the old J.C. Davis outfit as his road band. Original Flames members Bobby Byrd and Johnny Terry returned, and new Flames members [[Bobby Bennett (The Famous Flames)|Bobby Bennett]] and [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth]] were added. Along with Brown, these four men comprised the longest-lasting lineup of The Famous Flames. Original Flames guitarist Nafloyd Scott also returned and was added to the band. The rest of the original Flames faded into obscurity.\n\nWith this lineup the group would have a series of hits between 1959 and 1964 and participated on many of the albums that helped to bring R&B to a crossover audience, including the landmark million-selling 1963 live album, ''[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]]''. Byrd and the Famous Flames also performed together on a few episodes of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', made a brief appearance in the film, ''[[Ski Party]]'' and upstaged headliners [[The Rolling Stones]] on the landmark 1964 rock concert/motion picture, ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]''. Byrd (and fellow Famous Flame [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth|Lloyd Stallworth]]) were credited as songwriters on the Flames hit, \"[[Lost Someone]],\" though Brown was the only member who sang on the recording. Its success led Brown to record more songs on his own but the majority of his early hits were as a member of the Famous Flames including songs such as \"[[Try Me (James Brown song)|Try Me]]\", \"[[I'll Go Crazy (James Brown song)|I'll Go Crazy]]\", \"[[Bewildered]]\", \"[[Think (The \"5\" Royales song)|Think]]\", \"[[Baby You're Right]]\", \"[[I Don't Mind (James Brown song)|I Don't Mind]]\", \"[[This Old Heart]]\",  \"[[Shout and Shimmy]]\", and \"[[Oh Baby Don't You Weep]]\". As was the case with some recordings, the Famous Flames were often not credited on album covers though ironically enough on recordings in which Brown appeared by himself, the group was credited, leaving fans to erroneously believe the Famous Flames were actually Brown's backing band, instead of the [[List of vocal groups|singing group]] that they actually were. The group continued performing together until 1968 when they left over monetary issues. The last Flames-associated recording to be released was the pre-funk soul hit, \"[[Licking Stick - Licking Stick]]\", to which Byrd contributed vocals without the other members, who had departed before Byrd did that summer.\n\n==Solo career and continual work with Brown==\nAfter two years away, Byrd reunited with Brown in 1970. He hired, on the spot and without rehearsal, [[Bootsy Collins]], Bootsy's brother [[Catfish Collins|Catfish]], and their band to fill in for Brown's former band after they left him before a gig. After that performance, Byrd and Brown brought the band to a studio session where they recorded the famous funk hit, \"[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-brown-mn0000128099|title=James Brown &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen The Famous Flames were still together, Byrd and Brown co-formed the production company, Fair Deal, to distribute The Famous Flames' recordings \u2013 and Brown's own solo recordings \u2013 to mainstream markets after years solely on the [[rhythm and blues]] circuit. This led to both Byrd and Brown's signing solo deals with [[Smash Records]]. In 1964, Byrd recorded his first solo hit, \"Baby, Baby, Baby\" with [[Anna King (singer)|Anna King]]. A year later he had a bigger R&B hit with \"We Are in Love\", which reached #14. Later in the late 1960s, as Byrd and Brown together began working under the yet-to-be-named genre of [[funk]], Byrd had a funky song \"I Need Help (I Can't Do It Alone)\"(1970).\n\nIn 1971, when Brown signed with [[Polydor Records]], he and Byrd formed the label [[People Records]], and issued several records by other artists, including Byrd himself, who recorded the funk hit, \"[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]\"(1971). Byrd appeared onstage with Brown from 1970 until leaving his band again in 1973 due to a combination of issues, including uncredited compositions on some Brown hits, Brown's issues with singer [[Vicki Anderson]], whom Byrd eventually married and remained with until his death, and wanting to start a family with Anderson. Though he remained in contact with Brown following this final split, this departure ended Byrd's 21-year professional association with Brown, who now went by the nickname \"Godfather of Soul\", after composing the soundtrack to the film, ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]'' (1973). Without Byrd's help, however, Brown began struggling with production of the music on People and soon began experiencing financial troubles. Byrd recorded funky song \"Back From The Dead\" in 1975.\n\nLate 1980s, rare groove boom and James Brown boom were coming. In 1993, Byrd recorded a solo album, ''On the Move'', on the German record Label, Soulciety Records. After a few more live performances, Byrd decided to retire in 1996, though he occasionally re-emerged sometimes with the assistance of Brown: following Brown's parole from drug and weapons charges in 1991, he hired Byrd to join him on stage for his pay-per-view 1992 concert. Byrd would occasionally perform with Brown in some venues. They would also collaborate on the song \"Killing Is Out, School Is In\" from Brown's final studio album, 2002's ''[[The Next Step (James Brown album)|The Next Step]]''. At his funeral in December 2006, Byrd sung \"Sex Machine\" with Brown's other band mates paying homage to his late estranged friend and former performing partner.\n\nIn 2003, a few years before his death, Bobby, his wife Vicki, and Famous Flames Bobby Bennett and Lloyd Stallworth, sued lead singer James Brown and Universal Music for non-payment of royalties, stating that monies that rightfully belong to them for numerous Famous Flames hits, and Byrd's hit \"I Know You Got Soul\", which was sampled by numerous rappers, including [[Eric B. & Rakim]], were sent by Universal to James Brown instead, who allegedly kept them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/doowopcafe/message/12245 |title=Yahoo!

However, rapper Jay-Z, who sampled Byrd's song \"I'm Not to Blame\" for his recording, \"U Don't Know\", on his 2001 multi million-selling ''[[The Blueprint]]'', paid Byrd 65% of the royalties for the song, allowing Byrd and his family to secure a mortgage for their home, which was worth about $250,000.\n\n==Personal life==\nAfter splitting from Brown in 1973, Byrd and [[Vicki Anderson]], who left Brown's band at the same time as Byrd, got married.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&sa=N&biw=800&bih=485&tbm=isch&tbnid=T4s8EapkhXVdiM:&imgrefurl=http://davidcorio.com/photos/438-bobby-byrd-vicki-anderson-london-uk-july-16-1987&docid=jJW0DrRHm9oWBM&imgurl=http://davidcorio.com/system/images/438/slideshow/bobby-byrd-vicki-anderson-02.jpg%253F1313249134&w=380&h=254&ei=-wjsT-CcDOHq2AWMxOHSAQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=102&vpy=153&dur=2058&hovh=183&hovw=275&tx=255&ty=75&sig=100011542216889892090&page=1&tbnh=134&tbnw=199&start=0&ndsp=8&ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:76 |title=Google Image Result|website=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://supersoulsound.com/jbsuperfan/?p=1755 |title=Bobby Byrd and Vicki Anderson publicity photos &#124; The James Brown SuperFan Club |website=Supersoulsound.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> Byrd had three children with his first wife Gail, in [[Toccoa, Georgia]]; two sons, Walda and Orrin Byrd, and one daughter, Ruthie Byrd.

Byrd raised Anderson's daughter [[Carleen Anderson|Carleen]], sons Bartlett Anderson, James Byrd and Anthony Byrd, and shared a daughter, Keisha Byrd. The couple remained married throughout Byrd's lifetime. Though he had moved to Cincinnati after the Famous Flames signed with Federal/King, Byrd retained residences in Georgia and after leaving Brown, settled at [[Loganville, Georgia|Loganville]] for the remainder of his life.\n\n===Death===\nBobby Byrd died on September 12, 2007, of cancer; he was 73 years old.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049294/james-brown-colleague-bobby-byrd-dies-at-73 |title=James Brown Colleague Bobby Byrd Dies at 73 |magazine=Billboard |date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Isaac |first=Mike |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/09/soul-great-bobby-byrd-dead-at-73.html |title=Soul great Bobby Byrd dead at 73 |publisher=Paste magazine |date=September 13, 2007|accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/gallery/entertainment/music/bobbybyrd0912/gxH5/#2311946 |title=Bobby Byrd, James Brown collaborator, dead at 73 |website=Accessatlanta.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nNumerous songs in [[hip hop music]] have [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] Byrd-associated songs such as \"[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]\", \"[[Think (About It)]]\", \"[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]\", \"[[Soul Power]]\", \"[[Make It Funky]]\" and \"I'm Not to Blame\". Byrd's music has had a lasting influence on numerous soul, R&B, and hip hop artists.\n\nFor years following his departure from Brown, musical critics have neglected to mention about Byrd's contribution to James Brown's career, including Brown's solo credit for \"Please, Please, Please\" in 1956. It was,actually, not a solo recording,but a recording by The Famous Flames. It was,in fact Bobby Byrd and The Famous Flames who launched Brown's career, not the other way around. Indeed, the majority of Brown's early recordings between 1956 and 1962 were not Brown solo recordings, but as a member of the Famous Flames, which made his 1986 solo induction to the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] controversial, as his first official solo recording was the cover of the instrumental R&B standard, \"[[Night Train (Forrest, Simpkins, and Washington song)|Night Train]]\". Though the late 1961 recording, \"[[Lost Someone]]\", was sung by Brown alone, the song was credited as a Famous Flames recording and featured Bobby Byrd and fellow Flames member [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth|Lloyd Stallworth]] as co-writers, and Byrd also played organ on the recording.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=lost+someone+james+brown&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje5efX5urjAhURGKwKHetWC3cQ_AUIEigC&biw=1120&bih=605&dpr=1.5#imgrc=FywjZfHhSwOPqM|title=lost someone james brown - Google Search|website=Google.com|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Famous Flames were a [[List of vocal groups|vocal group]]. Brown's backing band was a separate group known as the James Brown Orchestra (later known as The J.B.s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJXITLhrzJw|title=James Brown Interview 1982|first=|last='00s Grits & Soul|date=December 26, 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nThe early songs, most of which Byrd participated with the exception of \"Try Me\", featured Byrd and contributed to establishing Brown's career before he finally became a full-fledged solo artist with the release of \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" in 1965. Though Brown asserted himself as the full-fledged leader, he was still just a member of the Flames until that group left him in 1968. In addition, it was Byrd who later saved Brown's career numerous times, starting with him returning to the Famous Flames at Brown's request after the group's initial breakup in 1957, helping him to coach the re-formed group, re-joining them at that point, and later hiring Bootsy and Phelps Collins to back Brown up in 1970 for funky song \"Sex Machine\". In the Famous Flames' Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, Byrd is regarded as \"one of the more important auxiliary figures in the career of a major artist in music history.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/bio/ |title=The Famous Flames Biography | publisher = Rock & Roll Hall of Fame & Museum |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, Byrd's songs \"I Know You Got Soul\" and \"Hot Pants\" were featured on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack|soundtrack]], playing on fictional radio station [[Master Sounds 98.3]]. In September 2005 his song \"Try It Again\" appeared on the soundtrack of ''[[Indigo Prophecy]].'\n\nByrd was portrayed by actor [[Nelsan Ellis]] in the 2014 James Brown bio film ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getonupmovie.com/ |title=Get on Up |website=Getonupmovie.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref>\n\n==Induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and initial controversy==\nIn 1986 [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] officials announced that James Brown would be included in a list of the first nine musicians to be inducted by the organization.  Due to his contributions to the industry and his influence on the R&B, Soul, and Funk Music genres, it was only fitting that Brown would be part of this initial group.  However, James Brown did not meet the Hall of Fame's criteria for induction at that time which required an artist to have released their first single as a solo artist at least 25 years prior to induction.  Brown's first solo release in 1965 was only 21 years before, although Brown had been active in the industry and released songs as part of The Famous Flames prior to 1965. For Brown to be inducted by the organization in 1986, inclusion of the ''other'' members of The Famous Flames was required. It is not known why this oversight occurred, but it has been surmised that the organization felt Brown's solo work warranted his induction at the Hall of Fame's initial ceremonies.\n\nBrown's inclusion as a solo artist without the other Flames members was met with criticism but was not amended until recently.<ref>John Petkovic, [http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/the_famous_flames_james_brown.html \"The Famous Flames: James Brown was their leader, but they were R&B legends, too (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2012)\"], ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', April 6, 2012.</ref> In late 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame formed a special committee to discuss several pioneering groups they felt deserved to be inducted, but were initially excluded in error, due to the impact of their lead singers, who were incorrectly inducted as solo artists.  This committee's decision led to the induction of The Famous Flames and its members. This was an amending gesture which did not require nomination or voting, under the premise that they should have been inducted with Brown back in 1986, since, according to Rock Hall CEO [[Terry Stewart]], Brown's first solo recording missed the 25-year criterion for performing musicians. Byrd, Stallworth (c. 2001), and Terry had long been deceased by this point, and Bobby Bennett, the Flames' only surviving member, accepted the honor on behalf of the group in Cleveland, on April 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/the_famous_flames_james_brown.html |title=The Famous Flames: James Brown was their leader, but they were R&B legends, too (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2012) |website=Cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/bio/ |title=The Famous Flames Biography &#124;

Byrd began his career in 1952 as member of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/get-on-up/|title=Get On Up True Story vs. Movie - Real James Brown, Bobby Byrd|website=HistoryvsHollywood.com|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to [[The Famous Flames]]. Byrd was the actual founder of The Flames and is credited with the discovery of [[James Brown]]. He also claims responsibility for writing most of James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] posthumously in 2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]'s Pioneer Award. Byrd helped to inspire the musical aspirations of James Brown, who launched his career with Byrd.\n\n==Early life and career==\nByrd was born in [[Toccoa, Georgia]], to a religiously devout family, where they were respected members of the church congregation and active in their neighborhood there.<ref>Cliff White: ''You Know He Got Soul'', Polygram sleevenotes (1995).</ref> Byrd started being active in his local church choir with the group, the Zioneers, later making a name for himself as member of the Gospel Starlighters,<ref name=\"auto\"/> which included his sister Sarah. At a time when church elders disapproved of secular singing, the band members would leave their home state and perform in South Carolina as the R&B group the Avons, eventually they left gospel behind and went on as the Avons. The original group consisted of Byrd, who played piano, organ and sang lead vocals; and Nafloyd Scott, Fred Pulliam and Doyle Oglesby.\n\n==Meeting James Brown and the formation of The Famous Flames==\n{{main|The Famous Flames}}\nIn 1952 Bobby Byrd formed and sang with a gospel group called the Gospel Starlighters. During a friendly baseball match at a juvenile prison, he met a young [[James Brown]] who was serving time there on robbery charges. Byrd befriended him and arranged for Byrd's family to oversee Brown's parole.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/14/AR2007091402400.html |title=Bobby Byrd, 73; Musician Credited in Igniting Career of James Brown |website=Washingtonpost.com |date= September 15, 2007|accessdate=2013-01-04 |first=Adam |last=Bernstein}}</ref> This began a personal and professional association that lasted until 1973.\n\nAlthough Byrd would eventually have over twenty years as a solo performer, it is his association with [[James Brown]] for which he is chiefly remembered. Contrary to belief, the group had already changed its name to the Flames when Brown asked Byrd for a spot in the group, with Brown first settling as a drummer. Eventually Brown was driven to perform as lead singer, as he felt lead vocalists got more attention from women. Byrd recognized early that Brown was unique and that it would be impossible to control him: \"I didn't need him in competition, I needed him with me, that's why I worked so hard to get him over to my group.\" <ref>Cliff White: ''You Know He Got Soul'', Polygram sleevenotes (1995)</ref> In 1956, Clint Brantley signed on as the group's manager. With Johnny Terry and Nash Knox on board, the group became \"The Famous Flames\" and won a deal with [[Ralph Bass]]' [[Federal Records|Federal]] label, which was a subsidiary of [[Syd Nathan]]'s [[King Records (USA)|King]] Records,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/king/kingstory.html|title=King/Federal/DeLuxe Story|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> in February 1956. Their first record, \"[[Please, Please, Please]]\", which Byrd said he wrote with Johnny Terry, featured a lead vocal by [[James Brown]] and was issued with the billing, \"James Brown and the Famous Flames\", which did not go well with the rest of the group. After three sessions, the original Flames broke up.\n\nThe Flames without Brown changed their name to Byrd's Drops of Joy. However, they found little success; when Brown approached them to reform the Flames they agreed. At this point, The Famous Flames ceased being a vocal/instrumental group, and became a straight vocal group, since Brown had begun to employ the old J.C. Davis outfit as his road band. Original Flames members Bobby Byrd and Johnny Terry returned, and new Flames members [[Bobby Bennett (The Famous Flames)|Bobby Bennett]] and [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth]] were added. Along with Brown, these four men comprised the longest-lasting lineup of The Famous Flames. Original Flames guitarist Nafloyd Scott also returned and was added to the band. The rest of the original Flames faded into obscurity.\n\nWith this lineup the group would have a series of hits between 1959 and 1964 and participated on many of the albums that helped to bring R&B to a crossover audience, including the landmark million-selling 1963 live album, ''[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]]''. Byrd and the Famous Flames also performed together on a few episodes of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', made a brief appearance in the film, ''[[Ski Party]]'' and upstaged headliners [[The Rolling Stones]] on the landmark 1964 rock concert/motion picture, ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]''. Byrd (and fellow Famous Flame [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth|Lloyd Stallworth]]) were credited as songwriters on the Flames hit, \"[[Lost Someone]],\" though Brown was the only member who sang on the recording. Its success led Brown to record more songs on his own but the majority of his early hits were as a member of the Famous Flames including songs such as \"[[Try Me (James Brown song)|Try Me]]\", \"[[I'll Go Crazy (James Brown song)|I'll Go Crazy]]\", \"[[Bewildered]]\", \"[[Think (The \"5\" Royales song)|Think]]\", \"[[Baby You're Right]]\", \"[[I Don't Mind (James Brown song)|I Don't Mind]]\", \"[[This Old Heart]]\",  \"[[Shout and Shimmy]]\", and \"[[Oh Baby Don't You Weep]]\". As was the case with some recordings, the Famous Flames were often not credited on album covers though ironically enough on recordings in which Brown appeared by himself, the group was credited, leaving fans to erroneously believe the Famous Flames were actually Brown's backing band, instead of the [[List of vocal groups|singing group]] that they actually were. The group continued performing together until 1968 when they left over monetary issues. The last Flames-associated recording to be released was the pre-funk soul hit, \"[[Licking Stick - Licking Stick]]\", to which Byrd contributed vocals without the other members, who had departed before Byrd did that summer.\n\n==Solo career and continual work with Brown==\nAfter two years away, Byrd reunited with Brown in 1970. He hired, on the spot and without rehearsal, [[Bootsy Collins]], Bootsy's brother [[Catfish Collins|Catfish]], and their band to fill in for Brown's former band after they left him before a gig. After that performance, Byrd and Brown brought the band to a studio session where they recorded the famous funk hit, \"[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-brown-mn0000128099|title=James Brown &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen The Famous Flames were still together, Byrd and Brown co-formed the production company, Fair Deal, to distribute The Famous Flames' recordings \u2013 and Brown's own solo recordings \u2013 to mainstream markets after years solely on the [[rhythm and blues]] circuit. This led to both Byrd and Brown's signing solo deals with [[Smash Records]]. In 1964, Byrd recorded his first solo hit, \"Baby, Baby, Baby\" with [[Anna King (singer)|Anna King]]. A year later he had a bigger R&B hit with \"We Are in Love\", which reached #14. Later in the late 1960s, as Byrd and Brown together began working under the yet-to-be-named genre of [[funk]], Byrd had a funky song \"I Need Help (I Can't Do It Alone)\"(1970).\n\nIn 1971, when Brown signed with [[Polydor Records]], he and Byrd formed the label [[People Records]], and issued several records by other artists, including Byrd himself, who recorded the funk hit, \"[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]\"(1971). Byrd appeared onstage with Brown from 1970 until leaving his band again in 1973 due to a combination of issues, including uncredited compositions on some Brown hits, Brown's issues with singer [[Vicki Anderson]], whom Byrd eventually married and remained with until his death, and wanting to start a family with Anderson. Though he remained in contact with Brown following this final split, this departure ended Byrd's 21-year professional association with Brown, who now went by the nickname \"Godfather of Soul\", after composing the soundtrack to the film, ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]'' (1973). Without Byrd's help, however, Brown began struggling with production of the music on People and soon began experiencing financial troubles. Byrd recorded funky song \"Back From The Dead\" in 1975.\n\nLate 1980s, rare groove boom and James Brown boom were coming. In 1993, Byrd recorded a solo album, ''On the Move'', on the German record Label, Soulciety Records. After a few more live performances, Byrd decided to retire in 1996, though he occasionally re-emerged sometimes with the assistance of Brown: following Brown's parole from drug and weapons charges in 1991, he hired Byrd to join him on stage for his pay-per-view 1992 concert. Byrd would occasionally perform with Brown in some venues. They would also collaborate on the song \"Killing Is Out, School Is In\" from Brown's final studio album, 2002's ''[[The Next Step (James Brown album)|The Next Step]]''. At his funeral in December 2006, Byrd sung \"Sex Machine\" with Brown's other band mates paying homage to his late estranged friend and former performing partner.\n\nIn 2003, a few years before his death, Bobby, his wife Vicki, and Famous Flames Bobby Bennett and Lloyd Stallworth, sued lead singer James Brown and Universal Music for non-payment of royalties, stating that monies that rightfully belong to them for numerous Famous Flames hits, and Byrd's hit \"I Know You Got Soul\", which was sampled by numerous rappers, including [[Eric B. & Rakim]], were sent by Universal to James Brown instead, who allegedly kept them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/doowopcafe/message/12245 |title=Yahoo!

However, rapper Jay-Z, who sampled Byrd's song \"I'm Not to Blame\" for his recording, \"U Don't Know\", on his 2001 multi million-selling ''[[The Blueprint]]'', paid Byrd 65% of the royalties for the song, allowing Byrd and his family to secure a mortgage for their home, which was worth about $250,000.\n\n==Personal life==\nAfter splitting from Brown in 1973, Byrd and [[Vicki Anderson]], who left Brown's band at the same time as Byrd, got married.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&sa=N&biw=800&bih=485&tbm=isch&tbnid=T4s8EapkhXVdiM:&imgrefurl=http://davidcorio.com/photos/438-bobby-byrd-vicki-anderson-london-uk-july-16-1987&docid=jJW0DrRHm9oWBM&imgurl=http://davidcorio.com/system/images/438/slideshow/bobby-byrd-vicki-anderson-02.jpg%253F1313249134&w=380&h=254&ei=-wjsT-CcDOHq2AWMxOHSAQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=102&vpy=153&dur=2058&hovh=183&hovw=275&tx=255&ty=75&sig=100011542216889892090&page=1&tbnh=134&tbnw=199&start=0&ndsp=8&ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:76 |title=Google Image Result|website=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://supersoulsound.com/jbsuperfan/?p=1755 |title=Bobby Byrd and Vicki Anderson publicity photos &#124; The James Brown SuperFan Club |website=Supersoulsound.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> Byrd had three children with his first wife Gail, in [[Toccoa, Georgia]]; two sons, Walda and Orrin Byrd, and one daughter, Ruthie Byrd.

Byrd's music has had a lasting influence on numerous soul, R&B, and hip hop artists.\n\nFor years following his departure from Brown, musical critics have neglected to mention about Byrd's contribution to James Brown's career, including Brown's solo credit for \"Please, Please, Please\" in 1956. It was,actually, not a solo recording,but a recording by The Famous Flames. It was,in fact Bobby Byrd and The Famous Flames who launched Brown's career, not the other way around. Indeed, the majority of Brown's early recordings between 1956 and 1962 were not Brown solo recordings, but as a member of the Famous Flames, which made his 1986 solo induction to the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] controversial, as his first official solo recording was the cover of the instrumental R&B standard, \"[[Night Train (Forrest, Simpkins, and Washington song)|Night Train]]\". Though the late 1961 recording, \"[[Lost Someone]]\", was sung by Brown alone, the song was credited as a Famous Flames recording and featured Bobby Byrd and fellow Flames member Lloyd Stallworth as co-writers, and Byrd also played organ on the recording.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=lost+someone+james+brown&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje5efX5urjAhURGKwKHetWC3cQ_AUIEigC&biw=1120&bih=605&dpr=1.5#imgrc=FywjZfHhSwOPqM|title=lost someone james brown - Google Search|website=Google.com|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Famous Flames were a [[List of vocal groups|vocal group]]. Brown's backing band was a separate group known as the James Brown Orchestra (later known as The J.B.s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJXITLhrzJw|title=James Brown Interview 1982|first=|last='00s Grits & Soul|date=December 26, 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nThe early songs, most of which Byrd participated with the exception of \"Try Me\", featured Byrd and contributed to establishing Brown's career before he finally became a full-fledged solo artist with the release of \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" in 1965. Though Brown asserted himself as the full-fledged leader, he was still just a member of the Flames until that group left him in 1968. In addition, it was Byrd who later saved Brown's career numerous times, starting with him returning to the Famous Flames at Brown's request after the group's initial breakup in 1957, helping him to coach the re-formed group, re-joining them at that point, and later hiring Bootsy and Phelps Collins to back Brown up in 1970 for funky song \"Sex Machine\". In the Famous Flames' Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, Byrd is regarded as \"one of the more important auxiliary figures in the career of a major artist in music history.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/bio/ |title=The Famous Flames Biography | publisher = Rock & Roll Hall of Fame & Museum |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, Byrd's songs \"I Know You Got Soul\" and \"Hot Pants\" were featured on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack|soundtrack]], playing on fictional radio station [[Master Sounds 98.3]]. In September 2005 his song \"Try It Again\" appeared on the soundtrack of ''[[Indigo Prophecy]].'\n\nByrd was portrayed by actor [[Nelsan Ellis]] in the 2014 James Brown bio film ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getonupmovie.com/ |title=Get on Up |website=Getonupmovie.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref>\n\n==Induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and initial controversy==\nIn 1986 [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] officials announced that James Brown would be included in a list of the first nine musicians to be inducted by the organization.  Due to his contributions to the industry and his influence on the R&B, Soul, and Funk Music genres, it was only fitting that Brown would be part of this initial group.  However, James Brown did not meet the Hall of Fame's criteria for induction at that time which required an artist to have released their first single as a solo artist at least 25 years prior to induction.  Brown's first solo release in 1965 was only 21 years before, although Brown had been active in the industry and released songs as part of The Famous Flames prior to 1965. For Brown to be inducted by the organization in 1986, inclusion of the ''other'' members of The Famous Flames was required. It is not known why this oversight occurred, but it has been surmised that the organization felt Brown's solo work warranted his induction at the Hall of Fame's initial ceremonies.\n\nBrown's inclusion as a solo artist without the other Flames members was met with criticism but was not amended until recently.<ref>John Petkovic, [http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/the_famous_flames_james_brown.html \"The Famous Flames: James Brown was their leader, but they were R&B legends, too (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2012)\"], ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', April 6, 2012.</ref> In late 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame formed a special committee to discuss several pioneering groups they felt deserved to be inducted, but were initially excluded in error, due to the impact of their lead singers, who were incorrectly inducted as solo artists.  This committee's decision led to the induction of The Famous Flames and its members. This was an amending gesture which did not require nomination or voting, under the premise that they should have been inducted with Brown back in 1986, since, according to Rock Hall CEO [[Terry Stewart]], Brown's first solo recording missed the 25-year criterion for performing musicians. Byrd, Stallworth (c. 2001), and Terry had long been deceased by this point, and Bobby Bennett, the Flames' only surviving member, accepted the honor on behalf of the group in Cleveland, on April 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/the_famous_flames_james_brown.html |title=The Famous Flames: James Brown was their leader, but they were R&B legends, too (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2012) |website=Cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/bio/ |title=The Famous Flames Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |website=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDTJaDUaoVM |title=2012 Hall of Fame Inductee Bobby Bennett of The Famous Flames |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=April 18, 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> Less than one year after the induction, Bennett himself died on January 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Rock |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/9308_remembering-bobby-bennett-the-famous-flames-dies/ |title=Remembering Bobby Bennett of the Famous Flames &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |website=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Bobby Byrd was nominated for a second induction into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]]  as a member of [[The J.B.'s]], a group which he actually discovered in 1970 to replace the Original James Brown Band, who left Brown in 1970 (as the Famous Flames left him in 1968) due to salary disputes.<ref>[https://rockhall.com/inductees/nominees/2016-the-JBs/ The J.B.'s], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Byrd/+wiki Bobby Byrd, James Brown, and ''The Famous Flames'' from ''Last FM'']\n* [http://jb-escape.sakura.ne.jp/jbfamily/byrd/byrdep.html Bobby Byrd Discography]\n*[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2484991.ece ''The Times'' Obituary for Bobby Byrd]\n*{{musicbrainz artist|id=ed3af6a3-1db0-48e3-bb39-2730b22cf8d9|name=Bobby Byrd}}\n*[http://www.gyaszhir.hu/book.php?id=21572 Bobby Byrd \u2013 Condolence book (Hungarian)]\n*[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bobby-byrd-1934-2007-113281/ Bobby Byrd eulogy from '' Rolling Stone''] .\n*[http://www.futurerocklegends.com/artist.php?artist_id=Bobby_Byrd Bobby Byrd page on ''Future Rock Legends'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120511072123/http://www.futurerocklegends.com//artist.php?artist_id=The_Famous_Flames The Famous Flames' page on ''Future Rock Legends]\n* [http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Bobby%20Byrd.html ''Bobby Byrd'' page on the ''\"Soul Walking U.K.\"'' website]\n*[http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/ ''The Famous Flames'' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction site- inducted 2012]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/thefamousflamesbysandibennett The Official ''Facebook'' page of ''The Famous Flames'']\n{{James Brown}}\n{{2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Byrd, Bobby}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:2007 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American choreographers]]\n[[Category:American choreographers]]\n[[Category:African-American male dancers]]\n[[Category:African-American dancers]]\n[[Category:American male dancers]]\n[[Category:African-American pianists]]\n[[Category:African-American record producers]]\n[[Category:American record producers]]\n[[Category:American baritones]]\n[[Category:American funk keyboardists]]\n[[Category:American funk singers]]\n[[Category:American organists]]\n[[Category:Male organists]]\n[[Category:American soul keyboardists]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:James Brown Orchestra members]]\n[[Category:James Brown vocalists]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Singers from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:The Famous Flames members]]\n[[Category:The J.B.'s members]]\n[[Category:People from Loganville, Georgia]]\n[[Category:People from Toccoa, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Rhythm and blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Smash Records artists]]\n[[Category:American rhythm and blues singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American basses]]\n[[Category:King Records artists]]\n[[Category:American male pianists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American keyboardists]]\n", "name_user": "Willgee", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegacy:Added link to Wikipedia article on Baby Lloyd Stallworth of The Famous Flames.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Byrd"}

It aired in [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]] during the years 2004\u20132006. This was a highly successful show of its time. It revolved around the practice of \"[[Nadi astrology]]\", a very popular belief in [[Tamil Nadu]] and widely practiced around [[Vaitheeswaran Koil]] area near [[Chidambaram]].The last episode was aired on Sunday, 23 July 2006 at 7.30pm. This serial was also dubbed in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and was telecasted in [[ETV Network|ETV]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around a young journalist Somu, working for Neithal Magazine in Chennai. The company's chief editor, Kumaraguru is like Somu's philosopher. He guides Somu like his own son. Kumaraguru has a daughter, named Thulasi, who is seen acting differently and making origami. Somu and his friend Padmarajan go around Chennai, interviewing people, on a title on previous birth. Once, they meet a beggar and homeless man who says that everything is a line. Somu gets too confused, when the man says he would see an accident on his way back. When the accident really happens, Somu freaks out. The accident claimed a young man's life and a water tanker lorry was the cause of it. To avenge his anger, Somu tarnishes all tanker lorries around Chennai for their reckless driving.\n\nAarthi, a young girl working in Chennai Meteorological Department, is Somu's childhood friend. She is a very talkative girl. Her father is Thillairajan, who is a doctor and he easily believes in all things. Aarthi deduces that Somu would get angry at 4pm the next day, and sure enough he does as his article about the tanker lorry is not published as expected. Kumaraguru says to Somu that he is hasty in everything and need patience. Somu realized that the victim of the accident is getting married soon. He together with Padmarajan, got to the victim's fianc\u00e9e home, only with his father-in-law's identity. The man happened to be a Tamil teacher (Tamil vathiyar). But when Somu and Padmarajan go there, they realize that the man and his daughter had both died. Somu finds the home ransacked and that someone has taken the guy's fingerprint.\n\nWhen Somu confines in Kumaraguru, he tells Somu about Nadi Josiyam. Nadi Josiyam is a type of method to find our future through astrology, with the help of the person's thumb impression and some palm-leaf manuscripts. Somu goes and meets a nadi josiyar, with the accident victim's thumb print. The nadi josiyar, Ponnambalam, refuses to further read it as the man is dead. On Somu's request to trust nadi josiyam, the nadi josiyar asks him to take a living man's fingerprint and see him tomorrow. Somu then takes the finger print of the beggar. The beggar then dies after fainting on the road side. The next day, together with Aarthi, Somu goes to meet Ponnambalam to find him dead. Aarthi finds that someone took his fingerprint. She does too and they go to meet another nadi josiyar, Anbarasu. Anbarasu tells Somu that someone came with the man's fingerprint and took away the manuscript.\n\nMeanwhile, an NRI from America, Akash, comes to Chidambaram to visit his grandmother. He works in a company that provides bio metric security systems. Aarthi's meteorological department had requested the company to provide security systems to their company. Akash has a strong American accent, which makes his Tamil to sound very different. He stays with his grandmother for his holidays, when his cousin Abhirami comes to stay there as well. Abhirami's aunt, who by right should have been married to Akash's father, is suffering from Leukemia. Akash quickly gets interested in Nadi Josiyam after meeting their neighbour, Nadi Josiyar Mani. Akash's grandmother Visalakshi gives him an old manuscript done by her father-in-law, to Akash which excites him. Visalakshi soon regrets her act when the boy gets too interested in it.\n\nMeanwhile, Aarthi sends her sister Archana's barathanatiyam dance instructor to Somu's office for an interview, much to Somu's annoyance. Irritated, he asks the man to go home and that he would meet him there the next day. But when he goes there with Padmarajan, the instructor, Natesan Sharma, dies after falling down from his flat. Somu sees that his thumbprint is taken as well and also sees a church father there. AC Adiyapatham investigates all these cases, including Tamil Vathiyar's and starts suspecting Somu, as he is seen at all crime scenes.\n\nAkash brings the manuscript that, he and his grandmother thought to be his, to Mani. Mani then says that the manuscript belongs to someone called Someshwaran. When he confines in his grandmother, he realizes that he has no relatives named Someshwaran and that there is only one retarded 10-year-old boy called Somu, in that street. Visalakshi asks Akash to leave all the things about manuscripts. His grandmother then hides the manuscript but Abhirami gives it to him secretly and he leaves for Chennai.\n\nSomu and Akash's colleague, Ismail gets into a quarrel when Ismail accidentally damages bike. Somu then goes to Ismail's office, when Akash is also, to get compensation. He later finds Ismail dead in the toilet, with the church father being the last one to leave it. AC Adiyapatham then tries to arrest Somu as he is seen there. Kumaraguru brings Somu to his guesthouse, on Chennai's outskirts. Meanwhile, Thillairajan blindly starts trusting a astrologer who tells him that he would not see Aarthi again. Fearing that something would happen to Aarthi, he locks her inside their home and plans to get Somu and Aarthi married. Aarthi, in the name of helping Somu, escapes from her home, only to be kidnapped by an unknown person. In between all these, a guy called Manohar also dies. All the suspicion falls on Somu who flees.\n\nAkash goes to Somu's home in the name of being Somu's friend but encounter Padmarajan and Somu's junior Chaaya there. They both realize that Akash is not Somu's friend and Akash goes back to Chidambaram. Meanwhile, Aarthi's case is being investigated by the same AC Adiyapatham. Adiyapatham suspects Somu to be the kidnapper as well. On the other hand, Somu starts to investigate on his own after realizing that all the people who have died so far, are people whom he have met.\n\nAarthi is injected with the blood of an AIDs patient, and her health starts deteriorating due to the HIV Virus. Somu is on the run. Meanwhile, Akash and Abhirami, without their knowledge of their grandmother, tries to find out about Somu with the help of Mani, and Akash's computer knowledge(Binary Code). Somu finds out that a guy, who have a white scar on the back of his neck, has been committing the murders, as well as Aarthi's abduction.\n\nThillairajan, goes on his own ways to find a manuscript related to Aarthi, in the means of finding her. Somu is on the run, Aarthi is dying, Thillairajan is lost in the love for his daughter and AC Adiyapatham is trying to crack the code, while murders continues to take place. Again, all of the victims are known by Somu. Thillairajan comes to Chidambaram as Chidambaram is most famous for its ragasiyam(secret) and nadi josiyam. He meets Mani who has the relevant manuscript to deduce Aarthi's life. But it turns out to be someone else's. But with Akash's help, they find Aarthi's real manuscript and Thillairajan gets heartbroken to find that Aarthi has AIDs.\n\nAfter sometime, Somu comes to Chidambaram with the help of some transgender people who rescued him. He stays very near to Akash's home. One day, the young boy Somu suddenly dies in Mani's residence. AC Adiyapatham investigates it Mani shifts to Visalakshi's home as his house is under investigation.\n\nAarthi is found outside her house by her mother, and is bed-ridden. Thillairajan is no where to be found. His assistant Doctor Mangaiyarkarasi takes care of Aarthi by visiting her home frequently. Kumaraguru, Thulasi and her husband Vishnu visit Aarthi. Thulasi accidentally blurts out that Aarthi have AIDs as she was in the same condition years ago. It is shown that Thulasi is a scientist in Germany who was finding cure for HIV. As her theory was rejected, she injected herself with HIV Virus to prove it. The virus is arrested in her body, similar to Aarthi, and that is why, she is always talking in a weird way. Soon, somehow, Somu is cleared of all charges and returns to Chennai. Before that, he reads some important files in Aarthi's computer and realizes that he had known everyone that has been killed, including the tanker lorry victim. In fact, that was not an accident and was a planned murder after all. The guy's name is actually Pazhani. Aarthi knows who is the reason behind it but is unable to communicate with Somu. Yet, she starts to recover.\n\nAC Adiyapatham finds out the main culprit and the whole gang, much to Akash and Somu's shock. It is revealed to be Kumaraguru. Not only him but also, Padmarajan, Anbarasu, Mangaiyarkarasi, Prabhu(Somu's friend and studio owner) and Arumugam(the man with the white scar). Kumaraguru reveals that he used Somu to divert the police's suspicion, and he didn't murder anyone. And that too, Arumugam isnonly responsible for taking the victim's fingerprints. Still, Adiyapatham is skeptical about it. The whole lot is then arrested.\n\nAfter sometime, Akash comes face to face with Abhirami's aunt, Kamakshi, the lady who was supposed to marry his father. He gets angry and reveals the truth about his life in America. His father and mother had a love marriage and even after Akash was born, Kamakshi sent letter to his father. When his mother found out, she left them and moved on with another man. Depressed, his father drank a lot and died as a result of that. Visalakshi hears this and heartbroken that Akash hid it from her, doesn't talk to him after that.\n\nSome others, including Mani comes and confess to the police that they are murderers, with Mani having accidentally killing Somu, his illegitimate son. A young girl Devi, also admits that she poisoned her father. It then slowly comes to light that Kumaraguru and his gang do not have any connection with the murders. Kumaraguru is released afterwards. Somu then finds out that the manuscripts of the dead consists of a medicine that cures AIDs. This was the reason that Arumugam, had been taking the fingerprints of the dead. Kumaraguru wanted to cure his daughter. The last manuscript that belongs to someone called Somu has the last ingredient but Kumaraguru finds out that the young boy Somu's one doesn't have the ingredient. It is after all, in his junior Somu's manuscript. Akash goes with Kumaraguru to help him with the 'binary code' found in Somu's manuscript. He decodes it as Thillai Tazhu, a type of plant. When Kumaraguru refuses to share it with Somu and tries to kill Akash, he flees the place with the manuscript. Afterwards, Adiyapatham dies after consuming the medicine when Kumaraguru does want to trade the secret with him. Kumaraguru returns and has a quarrel with Somu, who refuses to give his manuscript. Thillairajan loses his eye sight after the juice of the leaf drops into his eyes.\n\nKumaraguru comes back to request help from Somu, when he realizes that they are missing the second ingredient. Abhirami's father also realizes that the manuscripts have a cure for leukemia. When no one is looking, Kamakshi, to kill the pain and herself, drinks the incomplete medicine. Her leukemia is cured much to everyone's surprise. Somu gives the manuscript to Kumaraguru, after realising that it is indeed a medicine, but is incomplete. Late that night, Thillairajan asks Somu to read his manuscript in a hope to find the ingredient. Akash is still confident that it is binary code but Somu is skeptical about it. He decodes it and Thillairajan realizes that it is the blood of a relative.\n\nHe drips his blood under the moonlight which turns into something in golden colour. Here Aarthi's medicine is ready. But Kumaraguru hesitates to give blood as he has a fear of blood. When Vishnu forces him, Kumaraguru pushes him angering Thulasi. She kills her own father and her medicine is ready after his blood drops on the incomplete one.\n\nIn an epilogue, it is shown that Thulasi is cured and returns to Germany with Vishnu and is awarded for the cure for HIV. Aarthi, after consuming the medicine is cured as well and gets married to Somu and they have two children. Thillairajan's eyes sight is lost forever. Somu realizes that Kumaraguru had always seen him as a son and he had left Neithal Magazine in Somu's name. Akash gets married to Abhirami and stays in Chidambaram. He comes across Kumaraguru's pendrive and with details in it, starts predicting the future of earth, such as robots taking over humans in the year 2050. Years later, Visalakshi dies after completing a number of rounds in the temple, as predicted by her father-in-law, not even talking to Akash once. Abhirami comes across Chaaya's letter for Somu, that she had given Akash on her visit to Chidambaram. It is not said what is in the letter and when Aarthi makes a fuss about it, Somu thinks about what sin he made in his previous birth(his first interview question at the beginning of the show). It is known that in their previous birth, Somu was a rich landlord and had cheated Aarthi who happened to be his girlfriend. Aarthi vowed to stay with Somu 7 births and the current life is their second birth. This was told by Mani to Akash while Mani was reading Somu's manuscript. As the Aarthi scolds Somu and with Somu thinking about it, the show ends.\n\n==Trivia==\nIt can be noted here that most of the male characters are named after the different names of Lord [[Shiva]] who is one of the primary deities of [[Hinduism]] and the deity of the [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram Natarajar Temple]] where there is a belief of [[Chidambara Rahasiyam]] after which this show is named.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Krishna (TV actor)|Krishna]] as Someshwaran \"Somu\"\n* Ranjith as Akash\n* Swarna as Aarthi (Somu's Friend)\n*[[Y.

It aired in [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]] during the years 2004\u20132006. This was a highly successful show of its time. It revolved around the practice of \"[[Nadi astrology]]\", a very popular belief in [[Tamil Nadu]] and widely practiced around [[Vaitheeswaran Koil]] area near [[Chidambaram]].The last episode was aired on Sunday, 23 July 2006 at 7.30pm. This serial was also dubbed in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and was telecasted in [[ETV]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around a young journalist Somu, working for Neithal Magazine in Chennai. The company's chief editor, Kumaraguru is like Somu's philosopher. He guides Somu like his own son. Kumaraguru has a daughter, named Thulasi, who is seen acting differently and making origami. Somu and his friend Padmarajan go around Chennai, interviewing people, on a title on previous birth. Once, they meet a beggar and homeless man who says that everything is a line. Somu gets too confused, when the man says he would see an accident on his way back. When the accident really happens, Somu freaks out. The accident claimed a young man's life and a water tanker lorry was the cause of it. To avenge his anger, Somu tarnishes all tanker lorries around Chennai for their reckless driving.\n\nAarthi, a young girl working in Chennai Meteorological Department, is Somu's childhood friend. She is a very talkative girl. Her father is Thillairajan, who is a doctor and he easily believes in all things. Aarthi deduces that Somu would get angry at 4pm the next day, and sure enough he does as his article about the tanker lorry is not published as expected. Kumaraguru says to Somu that he is hasty in everything and need patience. Somu realized that the victim of the accident is getting married soon. He together with Padmarajan, got to the victim's fianc\u00e9e home, only with his father-in-law's identity. The man happened to be a Tamil teacher (Tamil vathiyar). But when Somu and Padmarajan go there, they realize that the man and his daughter had both died. Somu finds the home ransacked and that someone has taken the guy's fingerprint.\n\nWhen Somu confines in Kumaraguru, he tells Somu about Nadi Josiyam. Nadi Josiyam is a type of method to find our future through astrology, with the help of the person's thumb impression and some palm-leaf manuscripts. Somu goes and meets a nadi josiyar, with the accident victim's thumb print. The nadi josiyar, Ponnambalam, refuses to further read it as the man is dead. On Somu's request to trust nadi josiyam, the nadi josiyar asks him to take a living man's fingerprint and see him tomorrow. Somu then takes the finger print of the beggar. The beggar then dies after fainting on the road side. The next day, together with Aarthi, Somu goes to meet Ponnambalam to find him dead. Aarthi finds that someone took his fingerprint. She does too and they go to meet another nadi josiyar, Anbarasu. Anbarasu tells Somu that someone came with the man's fingerprint and took away the manuscript.\n\nMeanwhile, an NRI from America, Akash, comes to Chidambaram to visit his grandmother. He works in a company that provides bio metric security systems. Aarthi's meteorological department had requested the company to provide security systems to their company. Akash has a strong American accent, which makes his Tamil to sound very different. He stays with his grandmother for his holidays, when his cousin Abhirami comes to stay there as well. Abhirami's aunt, who by right should have been married to Akash's father, is suffering from Leukemia. Akash quickly gets interested in Nadi Josiyam after meeting their neighbour, Nadi Josiyar Mani. Akash's grandmother Visalakshi gives him an old manuscript done by her father-in-law, to Akash which excites him. Visalakshi soon regrets her act when the boy gets too interested in it.\n\nMeanwhile, Aarthi sends her sister Archana's barathanatiyam dance instructor to Somu's office for an interview, much to Somu's annoyance. Irritated, he asks the man to go home and that he would meet him there the next day. But when he goes there with Padmarajan, the instructor, Natesan Sharma, dies after falling down from his flat. Somu sees that his thumbprint is taken as well and also sees a church father there. AC Adiyapatham investigates all these cases, including Tamil Vathiyar's and starts suspecting Somu, as he is seen at all crime scenes.\n\nAkash brings the manuscript that, he and his grandmother thought to be his, to Mani. Mani then says that the manuscript belongs to someone called Someshwaran. When he confines in his grandmother, he realizes that he has no relatives named Someshwaran and that there is only one retarded 10-year-old boy called Somu, in that street. Visalakshi asks Akash to leave all the things about manuscripts. His grandmother then hides the manuscript but Abhirami gives it to him secretly and he leaves for Chennai.\n\nSomu and Akash's colleague, Ismail gets into a quarrel when Ismail accidentally damages bike. Somu then goes to Ismail's office, when Akash is also, to get compensation. He later finds Ismail dead in the toilet, with the church father being the last one to leave it. AC Adiyapatham then tries to arrest Somu as he is seen there. Kumaraguru brings Somu to his guesthouse, on Chennai's outskirts. Meanwhile, Thillairajan blindly starts trusting a astrologer who tells him that he would not see Aarthi again. Fearing that something would happen to Aarthi, he locks her inside their home and plans to get Somu and Aarthi married. Aarthi, in the name of helping Somu, escapes from her home, only to be kidnapped by an unknown person. In between all these, a guy called Manohar also dies. All the suspicion falls on Somu who flees.\n\nAkash goes to Somu's home in the name of being Somu's friend but encounter Padmarajan and Somu's junior Chaaya there. They both realize that Akash is not Somu's friend and Akash goes back to Chidambaram. Meanwhile, Aarthi's case is being investigated by the same AC Adiyapatham. Adiyapatham suspects Somu to be the kidnapper as well. On the other hand, Somu starts to investigate on his own after realizing that all the people who have died so far, are people whom he have met.\n\nAarthi is injected with the blood of an AIDs patient, and her health starts deteriorating due to the HIV Virus. Somu is on the run. Meanwhile, Akash and Abhirami, without their knowledge of their grandmother, tries to find out about Somu with the help of Mani, and Akash's computer knowledge(Binary Code). Somu finds out that a guy, who have a white scar on the back of his neck, has been committing the murders, as well as Aarthi's abduction.\n\nThillairajan, goes on his own ways to find a manuscript related to Aarthi, in the means of finding her. Somu is on the run, Aarthi is dying, Thillairajan is lost in the love for his daughter and AC Adiyapatham is trying to crack the code, while murders continues to take place. Again, all of the victims are known by Somu. Thillairajan comes to Chidambaram as Chidambaram is most famous for its ragasiyam(secret) and nadi josiyam. He meets Mani who has the relevant manuscript to deduce Aarthi's life. But it turns out to be someone else's. But with Akash's help, they find Aarthi's real manuscript and Thillairajan gets heartbroken to find that Aarthi has AIDs.\n\nAfter sometime, Somu comes to Chidambaram with the help of some transgender people who rescued him. He stays very near to Akash's home. One day, the young boy Somu suddenly dies in Mani's residence. AC Adiyapatham investigates it Mani shifts to Visalakshi's home as his house is under investigation.\n\nAarthi is found outside her house by her mother, and is bed-ridden. Thillairajan is no where to be found. His assistant Doctor Mangaiyarkarasi takes care of Aarthi by visiting her home frequently. Kumaraguru, Thulasi and her husband Vishnu visit Aarthi. Thulasi accidentally blurts out that Aarthi have AIDs as she was in the same condition years ago. It is shown that Thulasi is a scientist in Germany who was finding cure for HIV. As her theory was rejected, she injected herself with HIV Virus to prove it. The virus is arrested in her body, similar to Aarthi, and that is why, she is always talking in a weird way. Soon, somehow, Somu is cleared of all charges and returns to Chennai. Before that, he reads some important files in Aarthi's computer and realizes that he had known everyone that has been killed, including the tanker lorry victim. In fact, that was not an accident and was a planned murder after all. The guy's name is actually Pazhani. Aarthi knows who is the reason behind it but is unable to communicate with Somu. Yet, she starts to recover.\n\nAC Adiyapatham finds out the main culprit and the whole gang, much to Akash and Somu's shock. It is revealed to be Kumaraguru. Not only him but also, Padmarajan, Anbarasu, Mangaiyarkarasi, Prabhu(Somu's friend and studio owner) and Arumugam(the man with the white scar). Kumaraguru reveals that he used Somu to divert the police's suspicion, and he didn't murder anyone. And that too, Arumugam isnonly responsible for taking the victim's fingerprints. Still, Adiyapatham is skeptical about it. The whole lot is then arrested.\n\nAfter sometime, Akash comes face to face with Abhirami's aunt, Kamakshi, the lady who was supposed to marry his father. He gets angry and reveals the truth about his life in America. His father and mother had a love marriage and even after Akash was born, Kamakshi sent letter to his father. When his mother found out, she left them and moved on with another man. Depressed, his father drank a lot and died as a result of that. Visalakshi hears this and heartbroken that Akash hid it from her, doesn't talk to him after that.\n\nSome others, including Mani comes and confess to the police that they are murderers, with Mani having accidentally killing Somu, his illegitimate son. A young girl Devi, also admits that she poisoned her father. It then slowly comes to light that Kumaraguru and his gang do not have any connection with the murders. Kumaraguru is released afterwards. Somu then finds out that the manuscripts of the dead consists of a medicine that cures AIDs. This was the reason that Arumugam, had been taking the fingerprints of the dead. Kumaraguru wanted to cure his daughter. The last manuscript that belongs to someone called Somu has the last ingredient but Kumaraguru finds out that the young boy Somu's one doesn't have the ingredient. It is after all, in his junior Somu's manuscript. Akash goes with Kumaraguru to help him with the 'binary code' found in Somu's manuscript. He decodes it as Thillai Tazhu, a type of plant. When Kumaraguru refuses to share it with Somu and tries to kill Akash, he flees the place with the manuscript. Afterwards, Adiyapatham dies after consuming the medicine when Kumaraguru does want to trade the secret with him. Kumaraguru returns and has a quarrel with Somu, who refuses to give his manuscript. Thillairajan loses his eye sight after the juice of the leaf drops into his eyes.\n\nKumaraguru comes back to request help from Somu, when he realizes that they are missing the second ingredient. Abhirami's father also realizes that the manuscripts have a cure for leukemia. When no one is looking, Kamakshi, to kill the pain and herself, drinks the incomplete medicine. Her leukemia is cured much to everyone's surprise. Somu gives the manuscript to Kumaraguru, after realising that it is indeed a medicine, but is incomplete.

All forms of the deity stem from a [[Common Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deunraz}} (meaning ''thunder''). \n\nThor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the [[recorded history]] of the [[Germanic peoples]], from the [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] of regions of {{lang|la|[[Germania]]|italic=no}}, to the tribal expansions of the [[Migration Period]], to his high popularity during the [[Viking Age]], when, in the face of the process of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], emblems of his hammer, {{lang|is|[[Mj\u00f6lnir]]|italic=no}}, were worn and [[Norse paganism|Norse pagan]] [[personal name]]s containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.\n\nDue to the nature of the Germanic corpus, narratives featuring Thor are only attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout [[Norse mythology]]. Norse mythology, largely recorded in [[Iceland]] from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, provides numerous tales featuring the god. In these sources, Thor bears at least [[List of names of Thor|fifteen names]], is the husband of the golden-haired goddess {{lang|non|[[Sif]]|italic=no}}, is the lover of the {{lang|non|[[j\u00f6tunn]] [[J\u00e1rnsaxa]]|italic=no}}, and is generally described as fierce eyed, [[red hair]]ed and red bearded.<ref name=\"HAIR-COLOR\">On the red beard and the use of \"Redbeard\" as an epithet for Thor, see [[Hilda Ellis Davidson|H.R.

Thor is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week [[Thursday]] bears his name (modern English ''Thursday'' derives from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u00de\u016bnresd\u00e6g}}, '\u00deunor's day'), and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, particularly in Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]].\n\n==Name==\nOld Norse {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} ({{script|Runr|{{lang|non|\u16a6\u16a2\u16b1|italic=no}}}}), Old English {{lang|ang|\u00f0unor}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Donar}}, [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|thunar}}, and [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|thuner}} are [[Cognate|cognates]] within the [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] branch. They descend from the [[Proto-Germanic]] masculine noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00feunraz}} 'thunder',<ref name=\"OREL-429\">Orel (2003:429).</ref> and ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for 'thunder' ''*(s)tenh\u2082-'', with another cognate in the Celtic god [[Taranis]] (''*Torano'')''.''<ref>Matasovi\u0107 (2009:384).</ref>\n\nThe name of the god is the origin of the weekday name ''[[Thursday]]''. By employing a practice known as {{lang|la|[[Interpretatio_graeca#Interpretatio_germanica|interpretatio germanica]]}} during the [[Roman Empire period]], the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar, and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own. Latin {{lang|la|dies Iovis}} ('day of Jupiter') was converted into Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deonares dagaz}} (\"Thor's day\"), from which stems modern English \"Thursday\" and all other Germanic weekday cognates.<ref name=\"SIMEK333\">Simek (2007:333).</ref>\n\nBeginning in the [[Viking Age]], [[personal name]]s containing the [[theonym]] {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}} are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}}-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.<ref name=\"SIMEK321\">Simek (2007:321).</ref>\n\n==Historical attestations==\n===Roman era===\n[[File:Hermannsweg02.jpg|thumb|The [[Teutoburg Forest]] in northwestern Germany]]\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is frequently referred to \u2013 via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) \u2013 as either the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (also known as ''Jove'') or the [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] [[god]] [[Hercules]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late first-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind\" and adds that a portion of the {{lang|la|Suebi|italic=no}} also venerate \"[[Isis]]\".<ref name=\"BIRLEY42\">Birley (1999:42).</ref> In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god [[Odin]] as \"[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]\", Thor as \"Hercules\", and the god {{lang|non|[[T\u00fdr]]|italic=no}} as \"[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]\", and the identity of the [[Isis]] of the Suebi has been debated. In Thor's case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor's hammer and Hercules' club.<ref name=\"BIRLEY107\">Birley (1999:107).</ref> In his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', Tacitus again refers to the veneration of \"Hercules\" by the Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river [[Weser]] (in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]) as dedicated to him.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42 and 106\u2014107).</ref>\n\nIn Germanic areas occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd and 3rd century AD have been found with Latin inscriptions referring to \"Hercules\", and so in reality, with varying levels of likelihood, refer to Thor by way of {{lang|la|interpretatio romana}}.<ref name=\"SIMEK140-142\">Simek (2007:140\u2014142).</ref>\n\n===Post-Roman era{{anchor|Post-Roman_era}}===\n{{redirect|Donar}}\n[[File:Bonifacius by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|[[Boniface]] bears his crucifix after felling Thor's Oak in ''Bonifacius'' (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]\nThe first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the [[Migration Period]], where a piece of jewelry (a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]), the [[Nordendorf fibula]], dating from the 7th century AD and found in [[Bavaria]], bears an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription that contains the name {{lang|goh|\u00deonar}}, i.e. {{lang|goh|Donar}}, the southern Germanic form of Thor's name.<ref name=\"SIMEK235-236\">Simek (2007:235\u2014236).</ref>\n\nAccording to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary [[Saint Boniface]] felled an [[oak tree]] dedicated to \"Jove\" in the 8th century, the [[Donar's Oak]] in the region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].<ref name=SIMEK238>Simek (2007:238) and Robinson (1916:63).</ref>\n\nAround the second half of the 8th century, [[Old English]] mentions of a figure named {{lang|ang|Thunor}} ({{lang|ang|\u00deunor}}) are recorded, a figure who likely refers to a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Saxon]] version of the god. In relation, {{lang|ang|Thunor}} is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss ''Jupiter'', the god may be referenced in the poem ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]'', where the thunder strikes the devil with a \"fiery axe\", and the Old English expression {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} (\"thunder ride\") may refer to the god's thunderous, goat-led chariot.<ref name=\"TURVILLE99\">Turville-Petre (1964:99)</ref><ref name=\"THUNOR\">See North (1998:238\u2014241) for {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} and tales regarding {{lang|ang|Thunor}}, see ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (1910:608) regarding usage of {{lang|ang|Thunor}} as an Old English gloss for ''Jupiter'' and {{lang|ang|[[T\u00fdr|Tiw]]}} employed as a gloss for ''Mars''.</ref>\n\nA 9th-century AD codex from [[Mainz]], Germany, known as the ''[[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]'', records the name of three Old Saxon gods, {{lang|osx|UU\u00f4den}} (Old Saxon \"[[Wodan]]\"), {{lang|osx|[[Seaxn\u0113at|Saxn\u00f4te]]}}, and {{lang|osx|Thunaer}}, by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally [[christianization of the Germanic peoples|converting to Christianity]].<ref name=\"SIMEK276\">Simek (2007:276).</ref>\n\nThe [[Kentish royal legend]], probably 11th-century, contains the story of a villainous reeve of [[Ecgberht of Kent]] called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as {{lang|ang|\u00feunores hl\u00e6we}} (Old English 'Thunor's mound').

Writing in the 19th century, scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] records various phrases surviving into Germanic languages that refer to the god, such as the Norwegian {{lang|no|Thorsvarme}} (\"Thor's warmth\") for lightning and the Swedish {{lang|sv|godgubben \u00e5far}} (\"The good old (fellow) is taking a ride\") as well as the word {{wikt-lang|sv|tord\u00f6n}} (\"Thor's rumble\" or \"Thor's thunder\") when it thunders.

In connection, the lack of trolls and ettins in modern Scandinavia is explained as a result of the \"accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes\".<ref name=\"LINDOW89\">See Lindow (1978:89), but noted as early as Thorpe (1851:154) who states, \"The dread entertained by the Trolls for thunder dates from the time of paganism, Thor, the god of thunder, being the deadly foe of their race.\"</ref>\n\nIn the Netherlands, [[The Sagas of Veluwe]] has a story called ''Ontstaan van het Uddeler- en Bleeke meer'' which features Thor and that he fights giants.<ref>Weggelaar, Eva.

The place name {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rslundr}} is recorded with particular frequency in [[Denmark]] (and has direct cognates in Norse settlements in [[Ireland]], such as {{lang|ga|Coill Tomair}}), whereas {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rshof}} appears particularly often in southern [[Norway]].<ref name=\"SIMEK321\"/> {{lang|sv|[[Tors\u00f6]]|italic=no}} (''Thor's Island'') appears on the Swedish west coast. Thor also appears in many placenames in [[Uppland]].\n\nIn [[English placenames]], Old English {{lang|ang|Thunor}} (in contrast with the Old Norse form of the name, later introduced to the [[Danelaw]]) left comparatively few traces. Examples include [[Thundersley]], from *{{lang|ang|Thunores hl\u00e6w}} and ''Thurstable'' (Old English \"Thunor's pillar\").<ref name=\"SIMEK321\"/> F. M. Stenton noted that such placenames were apparently restricted to Saxon and Jutish territory and not found in Anglian areas.<ref name=\"TURVILLE99\"/><ref>[[Frank Stenton|Stenton, Frank]] (1941). \"The Historical Bearing of Place-Name Studies: Anglo-Saxon Heathenism\".

(Compare [[Thunderstone (folklore)|Thunderstones]].) Similarly, [[meteorites]] may be considered memorials to Thor in folk tradition due to their sheer weight. On the Swedish island of [[Gotland]], a species of beetle (''Scarab\u00e6us stercorarius'') was named after the god; the {{lang|is|Thorbagge}}. When the beetle is found turned upside down and one flips it over, Thor's favor may be gained. In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization, where the insect came to be known as {{lang|is|Thordedjefvul}} or {{lang|is|Thordyfvel}} (both meaning \"Thor-devil\").<ref name=\"THORPE-1851-51-54\">Thorpe (1851:51\u201454).</ref>\n\n==Origin, theories, and interpretations==\nThor closely resembles other Indo-European deities associated with the thunder: the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] [[Taranis]],<ref>De Vries (1957:111).</ref><ref name=\"SIMEK322\">Simek (2007:322).</ref> the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]] {{lang|lt|[[Perk\u016bnas]]|italic=no}}, the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] [[Perun]],<ref>Turville-Petre (1964:96\u201397).</ref> and particularly the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Indra]]|italic=no}}, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the {{lang|sa-Latn|[[vajra]]|italic=no}} are obvious parallels.

This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a [[storm god]] in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with {{lang|non|Sif|italic=no}} of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of [[hieros gamos|divine marriage]] between [[sky deity|sky god]] and [[earth goddess]], when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSON-II-72\">Davidson (1975:72).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli 011.jpg|thumb|''[[Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent]]'' (1790) by [[Henry Fuseli]]]]\n[[File:Thor-aalborg-bicycle-head-badge.jpg|thumb|An early 20th century Danish bicycle [[head badge]] depicting Thor]]\nIn modern times, Thor continues to be referred to in art and fiction.

Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]].\n\n==Name==\nOld Norse {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} ({{script|Runr|{{lang|non|\u16a6\u16a2\u16b1|italic=no}}}}), Old English {{lang|ang|\u00f0unor}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Donar}}, [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|thunar}}, and [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|thuner}} are [[Cognate|cognates]] within the [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] branch. They descend from the [[Proto-Germanic]] masculine noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00feunraz}} 'thunder',<ref name=\"OREL-429\">Orel (2003:429).</ref> and ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for 'thunder' ''*(s)tenh\u2082-'', with another cognate in the Celtic god [[Taranis]] (''*Torano'')''.''<ref>Matasovi\u0107 (2009:384).</ref>\n\nThe name of the god is the origin of the weekday name ''[[Thursday]]''. By employing a practice known as {{lang|la|[[Interpretatio_graeca#Interpretatio_germanica|interpretatio germanica]]}} during the [[Roman Empire period]], the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar, and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own. Latin {{lang|la|dies Iovis}} ('day of Jupiter') was converted into Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deonares dagaz}} (\"Thor's day\"), from which stems modern English \"Thursday\" and all other Germanic weekday cognates.<ref name=\"SIMEK333\">Simek (2007:333).</ref>\n\nBeginning in the [[Viking Age]], [[personal name]]s containing the [[theonym]] {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}} are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}}-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.<ref name=\"SIMEK321\">Simek (2007:321).</ref>\n\n==Historical attestations==\n===Roman era===\n[[File:Hermannsweg02.jpg|thumb|The [[Teutoburg Forest]] in northwestern Germany]]\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is frequently referred to \u2013 via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) \u2013 as either the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (also known as ''Jove'') or the [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] [[god]] [[Hercules]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late first-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims.

In Thor's case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor's hammer and Hercules' club.<ref name=\"BIRLEY107\">Birley (1999:107).</ref> In his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', Tacitus again refers to the veneration of \"Hercules\" by the Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river [[Weser]] (in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]) as dedicated to him.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42 and 106\u2014107).</ref>\n\nIn Germanic areas occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd and 3rd century AD have been found with Latin inscriptions referring to \"Hercules\", and so in reality, with varying levels of likelihood, refer to Thor by way of {{lang|la|interpretatio romana}}.<ref name=\"SIMEK140-142\">Simek (2007:140\u2014142).</ref>\n\n===Post-Roman era{{anchor|Post-Roman_era}}===\n{{redirect|Donar}}\n[[File:Bonifacius by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|[[Boniface]] bears his crucifix after felling Thor's Oak in ''Bonifacius'' (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]\nThe first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the [[Migration Period]], where a piece of jewelry (a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]), the [[Nordendorf fibula]], dating from the 7th century AD and found in [[Bavaria]], bears an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription that contains the name {{lang|goh|\u00deonar}}, i.e. {{lang|goh|Donar}}, the southern Germanic form of Thor's name.<ref name=\"SIMEK235-236\">Simek (2007:235\u2014236).</ref>\n\nAccording to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary [[Saint Boniface]] felled an [[oak tree]] dedicated to \"Jove\" in the 8th century, the [[Donar's Oak]] in the region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].<ref name=SIMEK238>Simek (2007:238) and Robinson (1916:63).</ref>\n\nAround the second half of the 8th century, [[Old English]] mentions of a figure named {{lang|ang|Thunor}} ({{lang|ang|\u00deunor}}) are recorded, a figure who likely refers to a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Saxon]] version of the god.

In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization, where the insect came to be known as {{lang|is|Thordedjefvul}} or {{lang|is|Thordyfvel}} (both meaning \"Thor-devil\").<ref name=\"THORPE-1851-51-54\">Thorpe (1851:51\u201454).</ref>\n\n==Origin, theories, and interpretations==\nThor closely resembles other Indo-European deities associated with the thunder: the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] [[Taranis]],<ref>De Vries (1957:111).</ref><ref name=\"SIMEK322\">Simek (2007:322).</ref> the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]] {{lang|lt|[[Perk\u016bnas]]|italic=no}}, the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] [[Perun]],<ref>Turville-Petre (1964:96\u201397).</ref> and particularly the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Indra]]|italic=no}}, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the {{lang|sa-Latn|[[vajra]]|italic=no}} are obvious parallels.

For {{lang|fr|Dum\u00e9zil|italic=no}}, this is the preservation by peasants of only the side-effect of the god's atmospheric battles: the fertilizing rain.<ref>Dum\u00e9zil (1973:71\u201372).</ref> Others have emphasized Thor's close connection to humanity, in all its concerns.<ref>De Vries (1957:152\u201353)</ref> Scholar [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] summarizes:\n<blockquote>\nThe cult of Thor was linked up with men's habitation and possessions, and with well-being of the family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a [[storm god]] in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with {{lang|non|Sif|italic=no}} of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of [[hieros gamos|divine marriage]] between [[sky deity|sky god]] and [[earth goddess]], when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSON-II-72\">Davidson (1975:72).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli 011.jpg|thumb|''[[Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent]]'' (1790) by [[Henry Fuseli]]]]\n[[File:Thor-aalborg-bicycle-head-badge.jpg|thumb|An early 20th century Danish bicycle [[head badge]] depicting Thor]]\nIn modern times, Thor continues to be referred to in art and fiction.
