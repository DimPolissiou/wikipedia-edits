Based on [[DC Comics]] characters, the film stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent countercultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]].

In these early films Tim's jobs were diverse. While [[Hopalong Cassidy]] was always the foreman of the Bar 20 Ranch, Tim played a cowboy, a Treasury agent, a Texas Ranger, or a number of other occupations.

Martin played Chito Jose Gonzales Bustamente Rafferty, a character created by writer Jack Wagner for the [[Bombardier (film)|1943 film ''Bombardier'']] and who had appeared in some [[Robert Mitchum]] westerns before being put into Tim Holt films. Stempel:\n<blockquote>The chemistry between Holt and Martin was immediate. Tim was entertained by Chito's constant pursuit of the ladies, which gave Holt a variety of reactions to play: amusement, surprise, slight irritation, bafflement at the hopelessness of Chito's attempted conquests. Unlike Hopalong Cassidy's young sidekick Lucky, who just mooned after girls, Chito was active, which was a lot more interesting to watch, especially with Tim's reactions. Chito was not just a lovesick fool, but also ready for action. As he explained his name, his mother was Spanish, and the Spanish is for loving, and his father was Irish, which is for fighting. Chito performed the crucial functions of a B western movie sidekick: he was somebody with whom the hero could discuss the plot, and he provided some comedy relief. In the 47-52 series, the comic relief is verbal rather than visual, and often a part of the story. The directors can shoot both Chito's flirting and Tim's reaction in one shot. Unlike other B westerns, such as those Holts with Cliff Edwards, the movie does not have to stop while the comic does his routine. It makes for much smoother flowing films.<ref name=\"stempel\"/></blockquote>\nIn 1948 Tim Holt also featured as the hero of a series of comic books<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westernclippings.com/comics/timholt_comicbookcowboys.shtml|title=Tim Holt - Comic Book Cowboys, by Boyd Magers|first=Donna|last=Magers|website=www.westernclippings.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever that year ''[[Brothers in the Saddle]]'' (1948) recorded a loss of $35,000<ref name=\"stempel\"/> as the growth of TV and decline in cinema audiences started to cut into Holt's market.\n\n===Later Movies===\nDore Schary left RKO in 1948 and the new management was not keen to cast Holt in anything other than Westerns: ''[[Rustlers (1949 film)|Rustlers]]'' (1949), ''[[Stagecoach Kid]]'' (1949), ''[[Masked Raiders]]'' (1949), ''[[The Mysterious Desperado]]'' (1949) and ''[[Riders of the Range (1949 film)|Riders of the Range]]'' (1949).

Martin played Chito Jose Gonzales Bustamente Rafferty, a character created by writer Jack Wagner for the [[Bombardier (film)|1943 film ''Bombardier'']] and who had appeared in some [[Robert Mitchum]] westerns before being put into Tim Holt films. Stempel:\n<blockquote>The chemistry between Holt and Martin was immediate. Tim was entertained by Chito's constant pursuit of the ladies, which gave Holt a variety of reactions to play: amusement, surprise, slight irritation, bafflement at the hopelessness of Chito's attempted conquests. Unlike Hopalong Cassidy's young sidekick Lucky, who just mooned after girls, Chito was active, which was a lot more interesting to watch, especially with Tim's reactions. Chito was not just a lovesick fool, but also ready for action. As he explained his name, his mother was Spanish, and the Spanish is for loving, and his father was Irish, which is for fighting. Chito performed the crucial functions of a B western movie sidekick: he was somebody with whom the hero could discuss the plot, and he provided some comedy relief. In the 47-52 series, the comic relief is verbal rather than visual, and often a part of the story. The directors can shoot both Chito's flirting and Tim's reaction in one shot. Unlike other B westerns, such as those Holts with Cliff Edwards, the movie does not have to stop while the comic does his routine. It makes for much smoother flowing films.<ref name=\"stempel\"/></blockquote>\nIn 1948 Tim Holt also featured as the hero of a series of comic books<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westernclippings.com/comics/timholt_comicbookcowboys.shtml|title=Tim Holt - Comic Book Cowboys, by Boyd Magers|first=Donna|last=Magers|website=www.westernclippings.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever that year ''[[Brothers in the Saddle]]'' (1948) recorded a loss of $35,000<ref name=\"stempel\"/> as the growth of TV and decline in cinema audiences started to cut into Holt's market.\n\n===Later Movies===\nDore Schary left RKO in 1948 and the new management was not keen to cast Holt in anything other than Westerns: ''[[Rustlers (1949 film)|Rustlers]]'' (1949), ''[[Stagecoach Kid]]'' (1949), ''[[Masked Raiders]]'' (1949), ''[[The Mysterious Desperado]]'' (1949) and ''[[Riders of the Range (1949 film)|Riders of the Range]]'' (1949).

[[Jon Faine]] expressed dismay at the High Court decision in a piece for the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], writing: \"Bizarre. One witness swears on oath: this is what happened to me at this place on this day. Other witnesses say: I do not know what happened on that day but that is not what usually happens \u2013 and that creates a doubt and voids the conviction.

Paul Kelly wrote for the Australian \"The High Court\u2019s repeated use of the word 'rational' in its judgment is revealing in its logic \u2014 that Pell was treated in an irrational way by the justice system. This is polite judicial language. Let\u2019s call it for what it was: a sentiment in parts of the community that Pell\u2019s trial had a meaning transcending guilt or innocence \u2014 that he must be punished for the church\u2019s crimes in the name of its hundreds of victims. This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system. The difference is that it was right-of-centre in the Sunshine State and it is left-of-centre here in Victoria.[...] I don\u2019t think Aborigines were treated as prejudicially by even the worst of 19th-century judges.\"<ref name=\"travesty\">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/travesty-of-justice-trusted-institutions-fail-pell-public/news-story/04a4dabedeb056f5c6d83d37fed07f01 Travesty of justice: \u2018trusted\u2019 institutions fail Pell, public]; The Australian; 11 April 2020</ref>\n\nThe Victoria Police have been criticised for failing to properly test the accusations against Pell by interviewing relevant witnesses prior to laying charges. They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic? [...][The dissenting Judge Weinberg] said: 'I would have thought any prosecutor would be wary of bringing a charge of this gravity against anyone, based upon the implausible notion that a sexual assault of this kind would take place in public and in the presence of numerous potential witnesses.' In short, the Victorian DPP should never have brought Pell to trial on this incident.\"<ref name=\"travesty\"/>\n\n===April 2020 police investigation===\nOn 14 April 2020 it was reported that Pell was under a secret investigation by Victorian police regarding a separate allegation of child sexual abuse committed in [[Ballarat]] in the 1970s.

Let\u2019s call it for what it was: a sentiment in parts of the community that Pell\u2019s trial had a meaning transcending guilt or innocence \u2014 that he must be punished for the church\u2019s crimes in the name of its hundreds of victims. This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system.

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic? [...][The dissenting Judge Weinberg] said: 'I would have thought any prosecutor would be wary of bringing a charge of this gravity against anyone, based upon the implausible notion that a sexual assault of this kind would take place in public and in the presence of numerous potential witnesses.'

She was the first [[Black people|Black]] woman to enlist, and the only documented to serve in the United States Army posing as a man.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWPL8OrbbacC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Cathy Williams: From Slave to Female Buffalo Soldier|last=Tucker|first=Phillip Thomas|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=9780811703406|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWilliams was born in Independence, Missouri, to a free man and a woman in slavery, making her legal status also that of a slave. During her adolescence, Williams worked as a house slave on the Johnson plantation on the outskirts of Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1861 Union forces occupied Jefferson City in the early stages of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. At that time, captured slaves were officially designated by the Union as \"contraband,\" and many were forced to serve in military support roles such as cooks, laundresses, or nurses.\n\n==American Civil War==\nIt is possible that Cathay Williams was present at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] and the [[Red River Campaign]]. There is no evidence, however, that supports any claims to her service in the Civil War, although a soldier named \"Finis Cathay\" did enlist in the 32nd Missouri Infantry as early as 1862 and participated in most of the major campaigns in the west, including the Siege of Vicksburg and Sherman's March to the Sea, before helping to force Joseph E. Johnston's last Confederate army into surrender in North Carolina. This unit's history parallels many of the wartime stories told of Cathay Williams, including its presence in Washington, D.C., at the final Grand Review on May 24, 1865.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-soldiers-detail.htm?soldierId=044C118C-DC7A-DF11-BF36-B8AC6F5D926A|title=Soldier Details - Cathay, Finis E|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n==U.S. Army service==\nDespite the prohibition against women serving in the military, Cathay Williams enlisted in the United States Regular Army under the false name of \"William Cathay\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots - A Biographical Dictionary of Military Women|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32708-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=482\u2013483}}</ref> on November 15, 1866, at [[St. Louis, Missouri]], for a three-year engagement, passing herself off as a man. She was assigned to the [[38th Infantry Regiment (United States)|38th United States Infantry Regiment]] after she passed a cursory medical examination.<ref name=\":0\" /> Only two others are known to have been privy to the deception, her cousin and a friend, both of whom were fellow soldiers in her regiment.\n\nShortly after her enlistment, Williams contracted smallpox, was hospitalized and rejoined her unit, which by then was posted in [[New Mexico]]. Possibly due to the effects of smallpox, the New Mexico heat, or the cumulative effects of years of marching, her body began to show signs of strain. She was frequently hospitalized. The post surgeon finally discovered she was a woman, and informed the post commander. She was discharged from the Army by her commanding officer, Captain Charles E. Clarke, on October 14, 1868.\n\n==Post-military service years==\nCathay Williams went to work as a cook at [[Fort Union, New Mexico]], and later moved to [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Williams married, but it ended disastrously when her husband stole her money and a team of horses. Williams had him arrested. She next moved to [[Trinidad, Colorado]], where she made her living as a seamstress. She may also have owned a boarding house. It was at this time that Williams' story first became public. A reporter from St. Louis heard rumors of an African-American woman who had served in the army, and came to interview her. Her life and military service narrative was published in ''The St. Louis Daily Times'' on January 2, 1876.\n\n[[File:Cathay Williams Pension 002.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Army Pension records for Cathay Williams]]\n\nIn late 1889 or early 1890, Cathay Williams entered a local hospital where she remained for some time, and in June 1891, applied for a disability pension based on her military service. The nature of her illness and disability are unknown.  There was precedent for granting a pension to female soldiers. [[Deborah Sampson]] in 1816, [[Anna Maria Lane]], and Mary Hayes McCauley (better known as [[Molly Pitcher]]) had been granted pensions for their service in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Declining health and death==\nIn September 1893, a doctor employed by the [[Pension Bureau|U.S. Pension Bureau]] examined Cathay Williams. Despite the fact that she suffered from [[neuralgia]] and [[diabetes]], she had all her toes amputated, and could only walk with a crutch, the doctor decided she did not qualify for disability payments. Her application was rejected.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kwrf0SAM0hQC&lpg=PA33&ots=W0Jkx63pl2&dq=%22Female%20Buffalo%20Soldier%22%20by%20William%20Jennings&pg=PA33#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Voices of the Buffalo Soldier: Records, reports, and recollections of military life and service in the West''].

Her simple grave marker would have been made of wood and deteriorated long ago.

She was the first [[Black people|Black]] woman to enlist, and the only documented to serve in the United States Army posing as a man.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWPL8OrbbacC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Cathy Williams: From Slave to Female Buffalo Soldier|last=Tucker|first=Phillip Thomas|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=9780811703406|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWilliams was born in Independence, Missouri, to a free man and a woman in slavery, making her legal status also that of a slave. During her adolescence, Williams worked as a house slave on the Johnson plantation on the outskirts of Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1861 Union forces occupied Jefferson City in the early stages of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. At that time, captured slaves were officially designated by the Union as \"contraband,\" and many were forced to serve in military support roles such as cooks, laundresses, or nurses.\n\n==American Civil War==\nIt is possible that Cathay Williams was present at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] and the [[Red River Campaign]]. There is no evidence, however, that supports any claims to her service in the Civil War, although a soldier named \"Finis Cathay\" did enlist in the 32nd Missouri Infantry as early as 1862 and participated in most of the major campaigns in the west, including the Siege of Vicksburg and Sherman's March to the Sea, before helping to force Joseph E. Johnston's last Confederate army into surrender in North Carolina. This unit's history parallels many of the wartime stories told of Cathay Williams, including its presence in Washington, D.C., at the final Grand Review on May 24, 1865.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-soldiers-detail.htm?soldierId=044C118C-DC7A-DF11-BF36-B8AC6F5D926A|title=Soldier Details - Cathay, Finis E|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n==U.S. Army service==\nDespite the prohibition against women serving in the military, Cathay Williams enlisted in the United States Regular Army under the false name of \"William Cathay\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots - A Biographical Dictionary of Military Women|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32708-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=482\u2013483}}</ref> on November 15, 1866, at [[St. Louis, Missouri]], for a three-year engagement, passing herself off as a man. She was assigned to the [[38th Infantry Regiment (United States)|38th United States Infantry Regiment]] after she passed a cursory medical examination.<ref name=\":0\" /> Only two others are known to have been privy to the deception, her cousin and a friend, both of whom were fellow soldiers in her regiment.\n\nShortly after her enlistment, Williams contracted smallpox, was hospitalized and rejoined her unit, which by then was posted in [[New Mexico]]. Possibly due to the effects of smallpox, the New Mexico heat, or the cumulative effects of years of marching, her body began to show signs of strain. She was frequently hospitalized. The post surgeon finally discovered she was a woman, and informed the post commander. She was discharged from the Army by her commanding officer, Captain Charles E. Clarke, on October 14, 1868.\n\n==Post-military service years==\nCathay Williams went to work as a cook at [[Fort Union, New Mexico]], and later moved to [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Williams married, but it ended disastrously when her husband stole her money and a team of horses. Williams had him arrested. She next moved to [[Trinidad, Colorado]], where she made her living as a seamstress. She may also have owned a boarding house. It was at this time that Williams' story first became public. A reporter from St. Louis heard rumors of an African-American woman who had served in the army, and came to interview her. Her life and military service narrative was published in ''The St. Louis Daily Times'' on January 2, 1876.\n\n[[File:Cathay Williams Pension 002.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Army Pension records for Cathay Williams]]\n\nIn late 1889 or early 1890, Cathay Williams entered a local hospital where she remained for some time, and in June 1891, applied for a disability pension based on her military service. The nature of her illness and disability are unknown.  There was precedent for granting a pension to female soldiers. [[Deborah Sampson]] in 1816, [[Anna Maria Lane]], and Mary Hayes McCauley (better known as [[Molly Pitcher]]) had been granted pensions for their service in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Declining health and death==\nIn September 1893, a doctor employed by the [[Pension Bureau|U.S. Pension Bureau]] examined Cathay Williams. Despite the fact that she suffered from [[neuralgia]] and [[diabetes]], she had all her toes amputated, and could only walk with a crutch, the doctor decided she did not qualify for disability payments. Her application was rejected.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kwrf0SAM0hQC&lpg=PA33&ots=W0Jkx63pl2&dq=%22Female%20Buffalo%20Soldier%22%20by%20William%20Jennings&pg=PA33#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Voices of the Buffalo Soldier: Records, reports, and recollections of military life and service in the West''].

For the original four colleges, which were founded simultaneously in 1957, the processional order reflects the order in which the original buildings were constructed. For McMurtry and Duncan, which were constructed and opened simultaneously in August 2009, the processional order reflects the order in which the founding gifts were made.\n\nThe colleges are often classified by geographical location: Jones, Brown, Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan are the '''North colleges'''; Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, Wiess, Lovett, and Sid Richardson are the '''South colleges'''.\n\n== History of the college system ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe residential college system was instated in 1957 by converting East, South, West, and North Halls into the men's colleges of Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, and Wiess, respectively.<ref name=\"rice.edu\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.rice.edu/sallyport/2007/fall/features/WhatsyourCollege.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023110645/http://www.rice.edu/sallyport/2007/fall/features/WhatsyourCollege.html |archive-date=2009-10-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jones, the first residential college built on campus for that purpose, was constructed the same year and became the singular women's college.

To cope with increasing enrollment,<ref>[http://www.professor.rice.edu/professor/Enrollment-Total_Full_and_Part-Time.asp?SnID=2 Total enrollment '96-'08]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan colleges were constructed in the period between 2001 and 2009. Today, when undergraduates are asked where they are from, many respond with the name of their college, not their home state. This is a testament to the centrality of the residential college system to the social life on the Rice campus.\n\n==Common characteristics==\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nEach college except Sid Richardson is built around a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], which serves as the central court of the college.\n\nEach college building includes three principal structures:\n\n* A residential building, where on-campus members of the college live.  In addition to student rooms in various configurations, the building includes at least two apartments for resident associates.  Resident associates are typically junior faculty members; their role is to serve as mentors and counselors to the students of the college.\n* A house, usually immediately adjacent to the residential building, in which the college Magister or Magisters live.  A Magister is typically a tenured or other senior faculty member who lives at the college with his or her spouse, providing leadership and guidance to the college as a whole and to individual students. (Historically the term Master was reserved for faculty members, while a non-faculty spouse held the title Co-Master. Today, both spouses are known as Magisters.)\n* A commons, where college members (including on-campus and off-campus students, Magisters, resident associates, and non-resident associates from the faculty and the community) take their meals and conduct other activities of college life, including study groups, lectures, theatrical productions, and parties. In addition to a large multi-purpose dining hall, each commons typically includes an administrative office, a private dining room for small group meetings, and other specialized areas.\n\nEach college has a unique architectural style, and as a result there are a great number of different room configurations, with varying levels of modernity and condition.\n\nEach college is also connected to a dining hall, known as a servery. Martel, Jones, and Brown colleges are served by the North Servery, while McMurtry and Duncan are served by the West Servery. In the South, Hanszen and Wiess colleges are served by the South Servery, and Will Rice and Lovett Colleges are served by the Seibel Servery. Baker and Sid Richardson each have their own servery, called college kitchens.\n\n=== Magisters and Resident Associates ===\n\nEach of the residential colleges at Rice has two College Magisters,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2017/04/master-title-changed-to-magister|title='Master' title changed to 'Magister'|work=The Rice Thresher|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> a faculty member and his or her spouse. The Magisters reside in a home adjacent to the college, and help cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual interests among the students, as well as support an effective system of self-government. They administer the college and serve as liaisons between the students of the college and Rice.\n\nResident Associates (RAs) are Rice faculty or staff members who reside on campus with students. While each college has many associates, the RAs are selected to live on campus at the college to interact more extensively with the students. They live in apartment suites at the colleges, regularly attend meals with students, and are generally active members of student life. McMurtry College and Duncan College, due to their population size, also have Head Resident Fellows, who are meant to ease communication between RAs, the Magisters, and the students.\n\nTwo of the longest-serving resident associates in Rice history are Dr. Gilbert Cuthbertson, professor of political science and resident associate at Will Rice College, and [[William L. Wilson (Rice University)|Dr. Bill Wilson]], professor of electrical engineering and resident associate at Wiess College.\n\n=== Governance ===\nEach college is in charge of an annual budget in excess of $50,000 and elects a government from its students to administer the college and the budget. The college governments can exert control over everything from event organization to upgrades to the college facilities. Governing documents for many of the colleges can be found online.<ref>[http://willrice.org/whitepaper/constitution-final-0409v1.pdf Will Rice Constitution]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jones.rice.edu/files/constitution.pdf |title=Jones Constitution |access-date=2009-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510134440/http://jones.rice.edu/files/constitution.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.brown.rice.edu/govt/policies?id=1&print=1 Brown Constitution]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovett.rice.edu/docs/government.pdf|title=Rice University -- Web Services|work=Rice.edu|access-date=March 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605000548/http://www.lovett.rice.edu/docs/government.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-05|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sidrichardson.net/node/41|title=Sid Richardson Constitution|author=|date=|work=SidRichardson.net|access-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.martel.rice.edu/parliament.cfm?doc_id=9425 |title=Martel Constitution |access-date=2009-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912051239/http://martel.rice.edu/parliament.cfm?doc_id=9425 |archive-date=2007-09-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Singular student presidents and chief justices are university mandated features of each college's government. Additional members vary per college, but typically include Treasurer, Secretary, and a plurality of representatives from each class. The executive officers, such as the President, Treasurer, and Secretary, form the Executive council, and the representatives combine with the council to form the college government, known by names such as Cabinet or Parliament, depending on the college.

He served as the Rice Institute's first chairman on the Board of Trustees from June 24, 1891, until his death in 1941.  He is known for having helped unravel the conspiracy surrounding the murder of the millionaire, who was chloroformed by his butler, Charles F. Jones, on September 23, 1900. The suspicious death of the Rice founder was concocted by Albert T. Patrick, a New York attorney, who forged a will naming himself the primary beneficiary to the large fortune, enlisting the Butler's help. Captain Baker, however, began an intensive investigation into the death of his employer, discovering the forgery, and returning the foundation to what would become Rice University.<ref name=\"Baker College\">{{cite web|title=Baker College|url=http://bakercollege.net/about.html|accessdate=21 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109165927/http://bakercollege.net/about.html|archivedate=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the university's original on-campus housing for male students, a dormitory (South Hall, now part of Will Rice College) and a dining room, library and residential tower (now part of Baker College) were built in 1912 by Cram, Goodhue, & Ferguson of Boston, Massachusetts, at the cost of $137,544.52. The now-Baker commons\u2014with beautiful engraved oak beams and the high vaulted ceilings of Elizabethan design\u2014served as the university's central dining hall for 43 years. East Hall, which contained dormitories and is now referred to as the \"Old Wing\" of Baker, was completed in summer 1915 (and West Hall (the \"Old Wing\" of Hanszen College) was completed in 1916).<ref name=\"ricehistoricalsociety.org\">http://ricehistoricalsociety.org/images/cornerstones/wrc06723.pdf</ref> These buildings remained virtually unchanged until the residential college system was instated in 1957. The [[neoclassical architecture]] of the former East Hall was joined by a new two-story brick-colored wing, the design of which was shared with equivalent new sections being constructed at Will Rice and Hanszen colleges, in preparation for becoming residential colleges. A house for Baker's Magister was also added. Baker was thus established as one of the five original colleges at Rice in the fall of 1957. In 1973, Baker and Hanszen became the first [[co-educational|co-ed]] colleges at Rice. To include upperclass women, a lottery was held for Jones and Brown women to transfer into Baker.\n\nBaker's colors are traditionally red, silver, and black, and the college associates itself with the [[devil]] and [[hell]] in its Beer Bike themes and college cheers, with the most popular cheer being \"Baker, hell yeah!\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Baker College Traditions |url=http://bakercollege.net/about_traditions.html |accessdate=2011-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627065544/http://bakercollege.net/about_traditions.html |archivedate=2011-06-27 }}</ref> The crest was selected, by popular vote, in 1958.

The wing was designed by noted post-modern architect [[Michael Graves]].\n\nIn the early days, the culture of the all-female Jones College was quite conservative.<ref name=\"Community\"/>  At meals, each table had a hostess, and dinner was served family style. Strict rules were enforced by house mothers when men from the south colleges visited the female students. The students even had to abide by a strict curfew - 11 p.m. on weekdays and 2 a.m. on weekends.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn the 1970s, Jones began phasing out many of the strictest rules, and in the fall of 1980 Jones became co-ed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Male students from the south colleges were given the chance to apply for transfer to Jones. Lovett, another Rice residential college, went co-ed the same year, so many of the new Jones residents were former Lovett residents. Jones women who disagreed with the decision to go co-ed were allowed to transfer to Brown College, which remained all-female until 1987. In 2001, construction began on the new Jones Commons and Jones Central. The new Jones Commons opened for use in March 2002.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Jones Central opened in August 2002. During the same time, Jones lost its parking lot to the newly constructed Martel College.\n\nJones' [[Students' union|student government]] is set up as a Cabinet comprising the Executive Officers, elected representatives from each floor, and one elected off-campus representative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jones.rice.edu/page/cabinet |title=Jones College - Cabinet |publisher=Jones College, Rice University |accessdate=2009-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330221400/http://jones.rice.edu/page/cabinet |archivedate=2009-03-30 }}</ref> The Cabinet meets bi-weekly.\n\nJones is a college with an indoor setup which has two lounges on every floor.

Founded in 1965 as an all-women's college, Brown became co-ed in 1987.\n\nThe history of Brown dates back to the early sixties, when Jones College was the only all women's college on campus.<ref name=\"Brown_history\">http://www.brown.rice.edu/about/history.php</ref> This caused such a severe housing shortage that some Rice women were housed in the dorms of nearby [[Texas Women's University]]. Through the generous $1 million donation of [[George R. Brown]] and his wife Alice Pratt Brown, a new women's residential college was established in the memory of their sister-in-law, Margarett Root Brown. Up until her death in 1985, Alice Pratt Brown was an active patron of the college, giving the college much of the furniture and art in the first floor lobbies and private dining room.\n\n[[File:BrownCollege.jpg|thumb|left|The old wing of Brown College]]\nIn the beginning, Brown College was filled primarily with women who had volunteered to leave Jones in order to start a new college. Brown had a housemother who lived in the [[Resident assistant|resident associate]]\u2019s apartment and required all women to check in and out of the building at night and on weekends. The first Master of Brown was [[Frank Vandiver]], who later became president of [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]]. In 1966 he resigned from Brown because of a \u201cscandal\u201d \u2013 the members of Brown voted to drink alcohol in their own rooms (provided they were of legal drinking age). Vandiver resigned because he considered it inappropriate behavior for young ladies.<ref name=\"Brown_history\"/>\n\nBrown was the last single-sex female college after Jones went co-ed in 1980; male members were first accepted into Brown in 1987.<ref name=\"Brown_history\"/> However, the community bathrooms on all floors remained coed {{dubious|date=November 2009}} until 1994, when the bathrooms were remodeled and separate facilities for men and women were built on each floor. Brown's main tower consists of mainly of double rooms whose residents share community bathrooms. Each floor also has one single room without a bathroom, as well as a double room with a bathroom, referred to as a suite. The new 4-story wing at Brown opened in 2002.<ref name=\"Expansion\"/> The new wing houses 56 additional students, making Brown the largest residential college on campus (it was previously the smallest) until the opening of McMurtry and Duncan. The new wing is made up of four-person suite, and each suite has four small single rooms, a large common room, and a private bathroom.<ref name=\"Brown_history\"/> Besides rooms, Brown offers other facilities. For instance, Brown's basement houses a communal laundry room and music practice rooms. Brown's first floor, referred to as \"Vator Lobby\" in reference to its use as an elevator lobby, contains a communal kitchen, a computer lab, couches, and amenities such as a projector and pool tables.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== Lovett College ==\n\n{{Infobox residential college\n| name = Lovett College\n| shield =\n| established = 1968\n| namesake = [[Edgar Odell Lovett]]\n| magisters = Dr. Michael Gustin and Denise Klein\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.students.rice.edu/students/College_Masters.asp|title=College Masters : Rice University|author=|date=|work=Rice.edu|access-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n| president = Chloe Oani\n| chief_justice = Laura Yordan\n| membership = 375 (approximate)\n| mascot = Stag\n<!-- | demonym = Lovetteer -->\n| colors = Navy Blue {{Color box|#000080|border=darkgray}} Yellow {{Color box|#FFEF00|border=darkgray}}\n| location = 6310 Main St., [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| homepage = [http://www.lovett.rice.edu/ lovett.rice.edu]\n}}\n[[File:Lovett.jpg|left|thumb|The residential building of Lovett College]]\n\n'''Edgar Odell Lovett College''' is the seventh-founded residential college, named after the university's first president.<ref name=\"Architecture\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwent |first1=J. |first2=G. |last2=Omid |year=2005 |title=Rice University College Prowler Off The Record |publisher=College Prowler, Inc.  |isbn=1-59658-107-7}}</ref>  Lovett opened in 1969 as an all-male college, becoming co-ed in 1980 when members of the college exchanged places with the female members of Jones College.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Lovett's first class mostly comprised volunteers from other colleges.

The majority of the rooms in the residential building are two-person suites, connected in pairs by a shared bathroom. Lovett House is a full two-story home in which the masters reside. The masters often host dessert at their house for special occasions, as well as private Central Committee meetings. The Lovett basement contains a number of facilities for use by the college members, as well as storage space for the various committees. The basement has a game room with various gaming tables, a movie room with couches and a projector, a kitchen, computer room, music room, weight room, and other spaces. The Wiener Hole is Lovett's public study space. It contains the Lovett test file, which contains records of previous tests in various classes. Lyle's, named for former Lovett resident associate Lyle Angene and also known as the Lovett Undergrounds, is a combination bar and performance space located in Lovett's basement. Lyle's is equipped with a sound system, stage, and lights, as well as bar equipment, including a [[kegerator]]. Seating for more than two hundred people can be moved into the space for performances.

Martel is an open, four-sided shape. Each side of the shape forms a wing of the college. The wings terminate on the side closest to North Servery in a five-story rotunda, a spiral staircase enclosed within a stack of rounded floors, providing the college with its sundeck, where many events are held. The easternmost wing contains common areas, the game room, a kitchen, and the TV room. The rotunda leads into the Commons, a cathedral-like room with a high ceiling that serves as a cafeteria, meeting room, and auditorium, among other functions.<ref name=\"Expansion\"/> The college also includes two apartments for Martel's resident associates and a neighboring house for the College Magisters and their family. Nearly every room at Martel is suite style, and is either referred to as a hex, or a quad. There are two kinds of hexes, sally port and corner hexes. Corner hexes have 6 single rooms and sallyport hexes have 3 double rooms. Every suite at martel has a private bathroom. Rooming is overseen by the Vice President. Martel is also the only college to feature a [[Sally Port|sally port]] in its construction; newly matriculated students traditionally walk through it passing a torch between themselves as the final step to becoming new Martelians.\n\nAlumni include [[Chris Boswell]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] kicker, [[Jason Colwick]], 2009 NCAA pole vault champion, Andrew Chifari, [[Starbucks]] most expensive drink record breaker,<ref>{{cite web | title = New Starbucks Free Drink Record Set With $54 Sexagintuple Vanilla Bean Mocha Frappuccino  | work = Consumerist | publisher = [[Consumer Reports]]| url = http://consumerist.com/2014/05/27/new-starbucks-free-drink-record-set-with-54-sexagintuple-vanilla-bean-mocha-frappuccino/ | accessdate = June 25, 2014}}</ref> Mithun Mansinghani, the Oklahoma Solicitor General,<ref>{{cite web | title = Alva native appointed to Attorney General's staff | publisher = Alva Review-Courier | url = http://www.alvareviewcourier.com/story/2017/03/19/local/alva-native-appointed-to-attorney-generals-staff/10864.html | accessdate = November 7, 2017}}</ref> and [[Morris Almond]], a professional basketball player.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jason Colwick Profile  | work = Official Website of Rice Athletics | publisher = [[Rice University]]| url = http://riceowls.cstv.com/sports/m-track/mtt/colwick_jason00.html | accessdate = March 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | last = Manfull | first = Megan | title = Owls athletics: Ryan Berry & Jason Colwick | work = [[Houston Chronicle]] | date = March 13, 2009| url = http://blogs.chron.com/owls/2009/03/owls_baseball_ryan_berry_take.html | accessdate = March 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Smooth Shooter|url=http://news.rice.edu/2006/11/16/smooth-shooter/|work=Rice News|publisher=Rice University News & Media|accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n== McMurtry College ==\n{{Infobox residential college\n| name = McMurtry College\n| shield =\n| established = 2009\n| namesake = Burt and Deedee McMurtry\n| magisters =  Margaret Beier, Chris Stickney<ref>{{cite web|title=College Masters|url=http://www.students.rice.edu/students/College_Masters.asp|website=Rice University|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n| president =  Joyce Chen\n| chief_justice = Augi Liebster \n| membership = 420 (approximate)\n| mascot = Lion\n<!-- | demonym = Murts -->\n| colors = Royal Purple {{Color box|#2A0054|border=darkgray}} Silver {{color box|#C0C0C0}}\n| location = 1605 Rice Blvd., [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| homepage = [http://mcmurtry.rice.edu mcmurtry.rice.edu]\n}}\n\n'''Burt and Deedee McMurtry College''' is the tenth college founded as part of Rice's residential college system.<ref name=\"11th\"/> McMurtry College was named after Burt and Deedee McMurtry, graduates of the Rice class of 1956.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Record $32 million pledged to Rice, Student residences are just one cause to benefit from alumni couple's gift \n |work=Houston Chronicle \n |date=June 17, 2006 \n |first=Todd \n |last=Ackerman \n |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Record-32-million-pledged-to-Rice-1911588.php \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZfFxNIHn?url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Record-32-million-pledged-to-Rice-1911588.php \n |archivedate=June 30, 2015 \n |accessdate=June 29, 2015 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref> Burt McMurtry was part of the student-faculty committee that evaluated the need for and eventually instituted the college system at Rice University, beginning in 1957 with the original five colleges.

During the Spring 2009 Beer Bike, McMurtry was christened in the ''Thresher'' newspaper as the \"Mongol College\", as it had not been finished at the time yet it was involved in pranks during Willy Week, and it could not be pranked by any other college as McMurtry wasn't complete. This was due to O-Week coordinators and advisers and co-advisers of McMurtry (chosen a semester ahead) showing their spirit for the upcoming new college. McMurtry has been assuming much of this \"Mongol\" culture by referring to the round commons as \"Yurt,\" a name that also references the fact that due to construction delays caused by Hurricane Ike, McMurtry was forced to use a tent as its commons for weeks until the actual commons was completed. McMurtry is also known as the banana college, and the fruit is used as a popular symbol by students, including in college cheers like \"McMurtry is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.\"\n\nThe building was designed by [[Hopkins Architects]], a leading English firm specializing in sustainable architecture. It offers 324 beds for student housing. The college is constructed as a single, squared-off horseshoe-shaped wing surrounding a central quad, rising to a height of five stories. The college has double and single rooms that open directly out onto interior hallways, in contrast to the exterior hallways at Martel and Wiess, which were previously the two most recently renovated colleges. Common showers are located around the stairwells at each \"elbow\" in the building, and fully functional pod bathrooms are located in each double bedroom. The first floor contains study rooms, a game room, music room, other amenities, and the only circular commons on campus.\n\nMcMurtry College is across from Duncan Hall and the Inner Loop road. Duncan College is immediately north of it, connected to McMurtry by West Servery, which is parallel to Abercrombie Engineering Laboratory. It is also identical to Duncan College. The pair are commonly referred to as McDuncan.{{clear right}}\n\n== Duncan College ==\n\n{{Infobox residential college\n| name = Duncan College\n| shield =\n| shield_size = 100px\n| established = 2009\n| namesake = Anne and Charles Duncan\n| magisters =  Caleb and Brandy McDaniel\n| president =  Louis Cole\n| chief_justice = Byron Benjamin Harris\n| membership = 420\n| motto = Classis et Germanitas (Team and Family)\n<!-- | demonym = Duncaroo -->\n| colors = Forest Green {{Color box|#014421|border=darkgray}} Ivory {{Color box|#FFFDD0|border=darkgray}} Gold {{Color box|#D4AF37|border=darkgray}} \n| location = 1601 Rice Blvd., [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| homepage = [http://duncan.rice.edu duncan.rice.edu]\n}}\n\n'''Anne and Charles Duncan College''' is the eleventh college founded as part of Rice's residential college system.<ref name=\"11th\">{{Cite web | title = Duncan College to be Rice\u2019s 11th Residential College | work = The Collegiate Way: Residential Colleges & the Renewal of University Life | author = R.

The college was conceived jointly with the adjacent McMurtry College as part of Rice's Vision for the 2nd century, which includes plans to increase the size of the student body by 30%.<ref name=\"professor.rice.edu\"/> Duncan opened its doors on August 16, 2009, right in time for O-Week 2009, which saw the arrival of the first Duncan freshman class. Due to renovations in Baker College and in order to help the new college adapt to the university, Baker College students lived in Duncan with the first freshman class. This led to the joint name of \"BaDunc\" for sporting and other events. Duncan began to operate by itself beginning in fall 2010 with a new freshman class, a returning sophomore class, and upperclassmen consisting of students from other colleges who accepted invitations to transfer. The college's first Masters, Marnie Hylton and Luis Duno-Gottberg, remained with Duncan for several years, and the final constitution went through its final stages before approval. It has also chosen its colors as forest green, white, and gold. It chose government officials, RAs, and a College Coordinator in the spring of 2010, and the crest was revealed during the fall 2010 semester at the dedication ceremony.\n\nDue to the request and contribution of Anne and Charles Duncan, Duncan College is one of the \"greenest\" buildings on Rice campus, as well as the entire city of Houston. Like nearby McMurtry College, the five-story building was designed by [[Hopkins Architects]] of London and offers 324 beds for student housing. The building is the first gold-level [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) facility at Rice and the first LEED student residential-housing in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Duncan to receive LEED gold status |work = The Rice Thresher | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | url = http://the.ricethresher.org/news/2007/10/05/duncan_leed_gold#header }}</ref> The facility is designed to retain water for irrigation purposes and has motion detector lights which will turn on or off according to the flow of people. The building will decrease energy consumption by up to 25% as well as cut back on water usage. Air conditioners power off when windows are opened.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Rice announces $30M gift, plans for 'greenest' building yet | work = News and Media Relations, Rice University | date = 2007-08-21 | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | url = http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&ID=9881&SnID=37427}}</ref>\n\n[[File:WR FLAG AS MY BLANKET.jpg|left|thumb| One of Duncan's favorite traditions is stealing Will Rice's flag.  Below is the flag draped across the bed of a certain Duncan lad in the Spring of 2016.]]\n\nDuncan College has also established a Monday night tradition, known as \"Monday Night Lights.\" When a few students went down to play ping-pong one night, they noticed that the ping pong table they had played on actually belonged to Baker College, who took its table back. Instead of going to bed, they made a makeshift table in the quad out of extra tables and using toilet paper as the net. People noticed the table and came down to the quad join in, watch and even play acoustic instruments. Monday Night Lights is now a monthly event. Other traditions include \"Duncing\" people in the DuncTank outside the commons on their birthdays, temporarily borrowing prized artifacts from other colleges including Will Rice's flag and Jones' trampoline, and a once a semester Nerf Gun capture the flag game throughout the building called Donnybrook.\n\nArchitecturally, Duncan has the same features as McMurtry with minor differences emphasized in order to establish its uniqueness. For example, Duncan Commons is rectangular in shape, contrasting the round McMurtry Commons. Also, Duncan quad has different features from McMurtry, such as a fountain by the Commons, smaller trees, and walkways that go across the quad. The interior, however, is virtually the same, as both colleges contain mostly doubles in the hallways and single rooms in the corners, with doubles having a pod bathroom inside and singles sharing common bathrooms. Both also have green roofs and fifth floor doubles and suites that open to the outside. The interior hallways of both Duncan and McMurtry were designed as contrasts to the other two most recently built residential colleges, Martel and Wiess, which have exterior hallways. The pair of McMurtry and Duncan are commonly referred to as McDuncan.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Texas}}\n* [http://students.rice.edu/students/Colleges.asp Residential College homepage]\n* [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~program/beerbike/ About Beer Bike]\n* [http://beerbike.com/ Beer Bike History and Statistics]\n* [http://www.rice.edu/fondren/woodson/archives/willricecollege.html Will Rice College at the Woodson Research Center]\n* [http://www.edesigns-graphics.com/wiess/index.html Photographic study of Old Wiess]\n\n{{Rice University}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Residential Colleges Of Rice University}}\n[[Category:Rice University]]\n[[Category:University and college dormitories in the United States]]\n[[Category:Lists of university and college buildings in the United States|Rice University residential colleges]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:Rice University seal.png|thumb|right|200px|The academic seal of Rice University]] -->\n[[Rice University]] contains '''eleven [[residential colleges]]''' which function as the primary housing, dining, and social organizations for undergraduate students.

Today, when undergraduates are asked where they are from, many respond with the name of their college, not their home state. This is a testament to the centrality of the residential college system to the social life on the Rice campus.\n\n==Common characteristics==\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nEach college except Sid Richardson is built around a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], which serves as the central court of the college.\n\nEach college building includes three principal structures:\n\n* A residential building, where on-campus members of the college live.  In addition to student rooms in various configurations, the building includes at least two apartments for resident associates.  Resident associates are typically junior faculty members; their role is to serve as mentors and counselors to the students of the college.\n* A house, usually immediately adjacent to the residential building, in which the college Magister or Magisters live.  A Magister is typically a tenured or other senior faculty member who lives at the college with his or her spouse, providing leadership and guidance to the college as a whole and to individual students. (Historically the term Master was reserved for faculty members, while a non-faculty spouse held the title Co-Master. Today, both spouses are known as Magisters.)\n* A commons, where college members (including on-campus and off-campus students, Magisters, resident associates, and non-resident associates from the faculty and the community) take their meals and conduct other activities of college life, including study groups, lectures, theatrical productions, and parties. In addition to a large multi-purpose dining hall, each commons typically includes an administrative office, a private dining room for small group meetings, and other specialized areas.\n\nEach college has a unique architectural style, and as a result there are a great number of different room configurations, with varying levels of modernity and condition.\n\nEach college is also connected to a dining hall, known as a servery. Martel, Jones, and Brown colleges are served by the North Servery, while McMurtry and Duncan are served by the West Servery. In the South, Hanszen and Wiess colleges are served by the South Servery, and Will Rice and Lovett Colleges are served by the Seibel Servery. Baker and Sid Richardson each have their own servery, called college kitchens.\n\n=== Magisters and Resident Associates ===\n\nEach of the residential colleges at Rice has two College Magisters,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2017/04/master-title-changed-to-magister|title='Master' title changed to 'Magister'|work=The Rice Thresher|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> a faculty member and his or her spouse. The Magisters reside in a home adjacent to the college, and help cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual interests among the students, as well as support an effective system of self-government. They administer the college and serve as liaisons between the students of the college and Rice.\n\nResident Associates (RAs) are Rice faculty or staff members who reside on campus with students. While each college has many associates, the RAs are selected to live on campus at the college to interact more extensively with the students. They live in apartment suites at the colleges, regularly attend meals with students, and are generally active members of student life. McMurtry College and Duncan College, due to their population size, also have Head Resident Fellows, who are meant to ease communication between RAs, the Magisters, and the students.\n\nTwo of the longest-serving resident associates in Rice history are Dr. Gilbert Cuthbertson, professor of political science and resident associate at Will Rice College, and [[William L. Wilson (Rice University)|Dr. Bill Wilson]], professor of electrical engineering and resident associate at Wiess College.\n\n=== Governance ===\nEach college is in charge of an annual budget in excess of $50,000 and elects a government from its students to administer the college and the budget. The college governments can exert control over everything from event organization to upgrades to the college facilities. Governing documents for many of the colleges can be found online.<ref>[http://willrice.org/whitepaper/constitution-final-0409v1.pdf Will Rice Constitution]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jones.rice.edu/files/constitution.pdf |title=Jones Constitution |access-date=2009-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510134440/http://jones.rice.edu/files/constitution.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.brown.rice.edu/govt/policies?id=1&print=1 Brown Constitution]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovett.rice.edu/docs/government.pdf|title=Rice University -- Web Services|work=Rice.edu|access-date=March 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605000548/http://www.lovett.rice.edu/docs/government.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-05|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sidrichardson.net/node/41|title=Sid Richardson Constitution|author=|date=|work=SidRichardson.net|access-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.martel.rice.edu/parliament.cfm?doc_id=9425 |title=Martel Constitution |access-date=2009-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912051239/http://martel.rice.edu/parliament.cfm?doc_id=9425 |archive-date=2007-09-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Singular student presidents and chief justices are university mandated features of each college's government. Additional members vary per college, but typically include Treasurer, Secretary, and a plurality of representatives from each class. The executive officers, such as the President, Treasurer, and Secretary, form the Executive council, and the representatives combine with the council to form the college government, known by names such as Cabinet or Parliament, depending on the college. These councils meet weekly to dispense with business related to the organizational and social functioning of the college. The meetings are akin to town hall meetings and typically include refreshments; they also serve as a forum for members of the various clubs, theater groups, and intramural sporting clubs to announce and advertise upcoming events. In addition, each college elects and sends one senator to represent the college at the Student Association.\n\n=== Traditions ===\n{{see also|Traditions and student life at Rice University}}\n\nThe traditional campus-wide [[Beer Bike]] competition is the largest annual student event held on Rice campus and the source of many rivalries and traditions among the residential colleges.<ref name=\"Roll\">{{cite news|title=Letting the good times roll at Rice: Beer Bike's 50th bash |website=Houston Chronicle |date=April 14, 2007 |page=1 |last=Viren |first=Sarah}}</ref> In recent years, a tradition has emerged wherein the Sid Richardson men's team intentionally disqualify themselves using any of a variety of means, most recently with a fire extinguisher-powered \"rocket bike.\" Sid Richardson has been disqualified in at least one race each year since 2000, with the exception of 2003 and 2007 when the biking was replaced with running due to inclement weather. On the other end of this spectrum, Will Rice is known as the most competitive of the residential colleges and the only one to ever \"sweep\" (win the mens, women, and alumni race).

He served as the Rice Institute's first chairman on the Board of Trustees from June 24, 1891, until his death in 1941.  He is known for having helped unravel the conspiracy surrounding the murder of the millionaire, who was chloroformed by his butler, Charles F. Jones, on September 23, 1900. The suspicious death of the Rice founder was concocted by Albert T.

Captain Baker, however, began an intensive investigation into the death of his employer, discovering the forgery, and returning the foundation to what would become Rice University.<ref name=\"Baker College\">{{cite web|title=Baker College|url=http://bakercollege.net/about.html|accessdate=21 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109165927/http://bakercollege.net/about.html|archivedate=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the university's original on-campus housing for male students, a dormitory (South Hall, now part of Will Rice College) and a dining room, library and residential tower (now part of Baker College) were built in 1912 by Cram, Goodhue, & Ferguson of Boston, Massachusetts, at the cost of $137,544.52. The now-Baker commons\u2014with beautiful engraved oak beams and the high vaulted ceilings of Elizabethan design\u2014served as the university's central dining hall for 43 years. East Hall, which contained dormitories and is now referred to as the \"Old Wing\" of Baker, was completed in summer 1915 (and West Hall (the \"Old Wing\" of Hanszen College) was completed in 1916).<ref name=\"ricehistoricalsociety.org\">http://ricehistoricalsociety.org/images/cornerstones/wrc06723.pdf</ref> These buildings remained virtually unchanged until the residential college system was instated in 1957. The [[neoclassical architecture]] of the former East Hall was joined by a new two-story brick-colored wing, the design of which was shared with equivalent new sections being constructed at Will Rice and Hanszen colleges, in preparation for becoming residential colleges. A house for Baker's Magister was also added. Baker was thus established as one of the five original colleges at Rice in the fall of 1957. In 1973, Baker and Hanszen became the first [[co-educational|co-ed]] colleges at Rice. To include upperclass women, a lottery was held for Jones and Brown women to transfer into Baker.\n\nBaker's colors are traditionally red, silver, and black, and the college associates itself with the [[devil]] and [[hell]] in its Beer Bike themes and college cheers, with the most popular cheer being \"Baker, hell yeah!\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Baker College Traditions |url=http://bakercollege.net/about_traditions.html |accessdate=2011-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627065544/http://bakercollege.net/about_traditions.html |archivedate=2011-06-27 }}</ref> The crest was selected, by popular vote, in 1958.

Some of the biggest social traditions include Baker Christmas in September, the annual Christmas Tree brought home by the freshmen after their camping trip, the Baker Shakespearean play, and of course Baker 13.\n\nIn 2009, construction began on a new residential wing. A portion of the former New Section was renovated and turned over to Lovett College. Baker's new wing is located between the Old Section and the Inner Loop road, and brought with it renovations to Baker's kitchen and the college coordinator's office. It was officially opened back to Baker students in the fall semester of 2010, who returned after a year of co-living with students from Duncan College. \n{{clear right}}\n\n== Will Rice College ==\n{{Infobox residential college\n| name = Will Rice College\n| image = Will_Rice_College.jpg\n| caption = Will Rice College, with Old Dorm (1912) at left, the commons building at center, and the quadrangle and New Dorm (2009) at right.\n| shield =\n| shield_size = 200px \n| established = {{start date|1957}}\n| namesake = William Marsh Rice, Jr.\n| magisters = Matthew Bennett, Rebekah Bennett\n| president = Juliette Richert\n| chief_justice = Jake Lesher\n| membership = 400 (approximate) \n| mascot = Phoenix\n<!-- | demonym = Will Ricer -->\n| colors = Rust {{Color box|#800000|border=darkgray}} Gold {{Color box|#FFBF00|border=darkgray}}\n| location = 6330 Main Street, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| homepage = [http://willrice.rice.edu willrice.rice.edu]\n}}\n'''William Marsh Rice Jr. College''', commonly known as Will Rice, is named for William M.

Founded in 1965 as an all-women's college, Brown became co-ed in 1987.\n\nThe history of Brown dates back to the early sixties, when Jones College was the only all women's college on campus.<ref name=\"Brown_history\">http://www.brown.rice.edu/about/history.php</ref> This caused such a severe housing shortage that some Rice women were housed in the dorms of nearby [[Texas Women's University]]. Through the generous $1 million donation of [[George R. Brown]] and his wife Alice Pratt Brown, a new women's residential college was established in the memory of their sister-in-law, Margarett Root Brown. Up until her death in 1985, Alice Pratt Brown was an active patron of the college, giving the college much of the furniture and art in the first floor lobbies and private dining room.\n\n[[File:BrownCollege.jpg|thumb|left|The old wing of Brown College]]\nIn the beginning, Brown College was filled primarily with women who had volunteered to leave Jones in order to start a new college. Brown had a housemother who lived in the [[Resident assistant|resident associate]]\u2019s apartment and required all women to check in and out of the building at night and on weekends. The first Master of Brown was [[Frank Vandiver]], who later became president of [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]]. In 1966 he resigned from Brown because of a \u201cscandal\u201d \u2013 the members of Brown voted to drink alcohol in their own rooms (provided they were of legal drinking age). Vandiver resigned because he considered it inappropriate behavior for young ladies.<ref name=\"Brown_history\"/>\n\nBrown was the last single-sex female college after Jones went co-ed in 1980; male members were first accepted into Brown in 1987.<ref name=\"Brown_history\"/> However, the community bathrooms on all floors remained coed {{dubious|date=November 2009}} until 1994, when the bathrooms were remodeled and separate facilities for men and women were built on each floor. Brown's main tower consists of mainly of double rooms whose residents share community bathrooms. Each floor also has one single room without a bathroom, as well as a double room with a bathroom, referred to as a suite. The new 4-story wing at Brown opened in 2002.<ref name=\"Expansion\"/> The new wing houses 56 additional students, making Brown the largest residential college on campus (it was previously the smallest) until the opening of McMurtry and Duncan. The new wing is made up of four-person suite, and each suite has four small single rooms, a large common room, and a private bathroom.<ref name=\"Brown_history\"/> Besides rooms, Brown offers other facilities. For instance, Brown's basement houses a communal laundry room and music practice rooms. Brown's first floor, referred to as \"Vator Lobby\" in reference to its use as an elevator lobby, contains a communal kitchen, a computer lab, couches, and amenities such as a projector and pool tables.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== Lovett College ==\n\n{{Infobox residential college\n| name = Lovett College\n| shield =\n| established = 1968\n| namesake = [[Edgar Odell Lovett]]\n| magisters = Dr. Michael Gustin and Denise Klein\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.students.rice.edu/students/College_Masters.asp|title=College Masters : Rice University|author=|date=|work=Rice.edu|access-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n| president = Chloe Oani\n| chief_justice = Laura Yordan\n| membership = 375 (approximate)\n| mascot = Stag\n<!-- | demonym = Lovetteer -->\n| colors = Navy Blue {{Color box|#000080|border=darkgray}} Yellow {{Color box|#FFEF00|border=darkgray}}\n| location = 6310 Main St., [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| homepage = [http://www.lovett.rice.edu/ lovett.rice.edu]\n}}\n[[File:Lovett.jpg|left|thumb|The residential building of Lovett College]]\n\n'''Edgar Odell Lovett College''' is the seventh-founded residential college, named after the university's first president.<ref name=\"Architecture\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwent |first1=J. |first2=G. |last2=Omid |year=2005 |title=Rice University College Prowler Off The Record |publisher=College Prowler, Inc.  |isbn=1-59658-107-7}}</ref>  Lovett opened in 1969 as an all-male college, becoming co-ed in 1980 when members of the college exchanged places with the female members of Jones College.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Lovett's first class mostly comprised volunteers from other colleges.

The majority of the rooms in the residential building are two-person suites, connected in pairs by a shared bathroom. Lovett House is a full two-story home in which the masters reside. The masters often host dessert at their house for special occasions, as well as private Central Committee meetings. The Lovett basement contains a number of facilities for use by the college members, as well as storage space for the various committees. The basement has a game room with various gaming tables, a movie room with couches and a projector, a kitchen, computer room, music room, weight room, and other spaces. The Wiener Hole is Lovett's public study space. It contains the Lovett test file, which contains records of previous tests in various classes. Lyle's, named for former Lovett resident associate Lyle Angene and also known as the Lovett Undergrounds, is a combination bar and performance space located in Lovett's basement. Lyle's is equipped with a sound system, stage, and lights, as well as bar equipment, including a [[kegerator]]. Seating for more than two hundred people can be moved into the space for performances.

Orc Raids are held twice every year - once during the Orientation Week in August before the start of the Fall semester and a second time during Willy Week in the Spring semester. Sidizens dress up by smearing themselves with black paint, wearing black clothes and carrying around torches with doll heads.

Elected officials include President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Treasurer, Secretary, Chief Justice, and Class Representatives (4 per class).\n\n[[Michael Graves]], architect of Martel College, designed the four-story, {{convert|134000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Images of Martel College, Rice University by Michael Graves| work = Digital Imaging Project, Bluffton University | author = Mary Ann Sullivan | accessdate = 2009-03-29 | url = http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/texas/houston/ricemartel/graves.html}}</ref>  Formed around a central quadrangle, Graves's design follows the style of the 1910 general plan of Boston architect [[Ralph Adams Cram]] for the Rice campus. Martel is an open, four-sided shape. Each side of the shape forms a wing of the college. The wings terminate on the side closest to North Servery in a five-story rotunda, a spiral staircase enclosed within a stack of rounded floors, providing the college with its sundeck, where many events are held. The easternmost wing contains common areas, the game room, a kitchen, and the TV room. The rotunda leads into the Commons, a cathedral-like room with a high ceiling that serves as a cafeteria, meeting room, and auditorium, among other functions.<ref name=\"Expansion\"/> The college also includes two apartments for Martel's resident associates and a neighboring house for the College Magisters and their family. Nearly every room at Martel is suite style, and is either referred to as a hex, or a quad. There are two kinds of hexes, sally port and corner hexes. Corner hexes have 6 single rooms and sallyport hexes have 3 double rooms. Every suite at martel has a private bathroom. Rooming is overseen by the Vice President. Martel is also the only college to feature a [[Sally Port|sally port]] in its construction; newly matriculated students traditionally walk through it passing a torch between themselves as the final step to becoming new Martelians.\n\nAlumni include [[Chris Boswell]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] kicker, [[Jason Colwick]], 2009 NCAA pole vault champion, Andrew Chifari, [[Starbucks]] most expensive drink record breaker,<ref>{{cite web | title = New Starbucks Free Drink Record Set With $54 Sexagintuple Vanilla Bean Mocha Frappuccino  | work = Consumerist | publisher = [[Consumer Reports]]| url = http://consumerist.com/2014/05/27/new-starbucks-free-drink-record-set-with-54-sexagintuple-vanilla-bean-mocha-frappuccino/ | accessdate = June 25, 2014}}</ref> Mithun Mansinghani, the Oklahoma Solicitor General,<ref>{{cite web | title = Alva native appointed to Attorney General's staff | publisher = Alva Review-Courier | url = http://www.alvareviewcourier.com/story/2017/03/19/local/alva-native-appointed-to-attorney-generals-staff/10864.html | accessdate = November 7, 2017}}</ref> and [[Morris Almond]], a professional basketball player.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jason Colwick Profile  | work = Official Website of Rice Athletics | publisher = [[Rice University]]| url = http://riceowls.cstv.com/sports/m-track/mtt/colwick_jason00.html | accessdate = March 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | last = Manfull | first = Megan | title = Owls athletics: Ryan Berry & Jason Colwick | work = [[Houston Chronicle]] | date = March 13, 2009| url = http://blogs.chron.com/owls/2009/03/owls_baseball_ryan_berry_take.html | accessdate = March 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Smooth Shooter|url=http://news.rice.edu/2006/11/16/smooth-shooter/|work=Rice News|publisher=Rice University News & Media|accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n== McMurtry College ==\n{{Infobox residential college\n| name = McMurtry College\n| shield =\n| established = 2009\n| namesake = Burt and Deedee McMurtry\n| magisters =  Margaret Beier, Chris Stickney<ref>{{cite web|title=College Masters|url=http://www.students.rice.edu/students/College_Masters.asp|website=Rice University|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n| president =  Joyce Chen\n| chief_justice = Augi Liebster \n| membership = 420 (approximate)\n| mascot = Lion\n<!-- | demonym = Murts -->\n| colors = Royal Purple {{Color box|#2A0054|border=darkgray}} Silver {{color box|#C0C0C0}}\n| location = 1605 Rice Blvd., [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| homepage = [http://mcmurtry.rice.edu mcmurtry.rice.edu]\n}}\n\n'''Burt and Deedee McMurtry College''' is the tenth college founded as part of Rice's residential college system.<ref name=\"11th\"/> McMurtry College was named after Burt and Deedee McMurtry, graduates of the Rice class of 1956.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Record $32 million pledged to Rice, Student residences are just one cause to benefit from alumni couple's gift \n |work=Houston Chronicle \n |date=June 17, 2006 \n |first=Todd \n |last=Ackerman \n |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Record-32-million-pledged-to-Rice-1911588.php \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZfFxNIHn?url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Record-32-million-pledged-to-Rice-1911588.php \n |archivedate=June 30, 2015 \n |accessdate=June 29, 2015 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref> Burt McMurtry was part of the student-faculty committee that evaluated the need for and eventually instituted the college system at Rice University, beginning in 1957 with the original five colleges.

During the Spring 2009 Beer Bike, McMurtry was christened in the ''Thresher'' newspaper as the \"Mongol College\", as it had not been finished at the time yet it was involved in pranks during Willy Week, and it could not be pranked by any other college as McMurtry wasn't complete. This was due to O-Week coordinators and advisers and co-advisers of McMurtry (chosen a semester ahead) showing their spirit for the upcoming new college. McMurtry has been assuming much of this \"Mongol\" culture by referring to the round commons as \"Yurt,\" a name that also references the fact that due to construction delays caused by Hurricane Ike, McMurtry was forced to use a tent as its commons for weeks until the actual commons was completed. McMurtry is also known as the banana college, and the fruit is used as a popular symbol by students, including in college cheers like \"McMurtry is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.\"\n\nThe building was designed by [[Hopkins Architects]], a leading English firm specializing in sustainable architecture. It offers 324 beds for student housing. The college is constructed as a single, squared-off horseshoe-shaped wing surrounding a central quad, rising to a height of five stories. The college has double and single rooms that open directly out onto interior hallways, in contrast to the exterior hallways at Martel and Wiess, which were previously the two most recently renovated colleges. Common showers are located around the stairwells at each \"elbow\" in the building, and fully functional pod bathrooms are located in each double bedroom. The first floor contains study rooms, a game room, music room, other amenities, and the only circular commons on campus.\n\nMcMurtry College is across from Duncan Hall and the Inner Loop road. Duncan College is immediately north of it, connected to McMurtry by West Servery, which is parallel to Abercrombie Engineering Laboratory. It is also identical to Duncan College. The pair are commonly referred to as McDuncan.{{clear right}}\n\n== Duncan College ==\n\n{{Infobox residential college\n| name = Duncan College\n| shield =\n| shield_size = 100px\n| established = 2009\n| namesake = Anne and Charles Duncan\n| magisters =  Caleb and Brandy McDaniel\n| president =  Louis Cole\n| chief_justice = Byron Benjamin Harris\n| membership = 420\n| motto = Classis et Germanitas (Team and Family)\n<!-- | demonym = Duncaroo -->\n| colors = Forest Green {{Color box|#014421|border=darkgray}} Ivory {{Color box|#FFFDD0|border=darkgray}} Gold {{Color box|#D4AF37|border=darkgray}} \n| location = 1601 Rice Blvd., [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| homepage = [http://duncan.rice.edu duncan.rice.edu]\n}}\n\n'''Anne and Charles Duncan College''' is the eleventh college founded as part of Rice's residential college system.<ref name=\"11th\">{{Cite web | title = Duncan College to be Rice\u2019s 11th Residential College | work = The Collegiate Way: Residential Colleges & the Renewal of University Life | author = R.

The college was conceived jointly with the adjacent McMurtry College as part of Rice's Vision for the 2nd century, which includes plans to increase the size of the student body by 30%.<ref name=\"professor.rice.edu\"/> Duncan opened its doors on August 16, 2009, right in time for O-Week 2009, which saw the arrival of the first Duncan freshman class. Due to renovations in Baker College and in order to help the new college adapt to the university, Baker College students lived in Duncan with the first freshman class. This led to the joint name of \"BaDunc\" for sporting and other events. Duncan began to operate by itself beginning in fall 2010 with a new freshman class, a returning sophomore class, and upperclassmen consisting of students from other colleges who accepted invitations to transfer. The college's first Masters, Marnie Hylton and Luis Duno-Gottberg, remained with Duncan for several years, and the final constitution went through its final stages before approval. It has also chosen its colors as forest green, white, and gold. It chose government officials, RAs, and a College Coordinator in the spring of 2010, and the crest was revealed during the fall 2010 semester at the dedication ceremony.\n\nDue to the request and contribution of Anne and Charles Duncan, Duncan College is one of the \"greenest\" buildings on Rice campus, as well as the entire city of Houston. Like nearby McMurtry College, the five-story building was designed by [[Hopkins Architects]] of London and offers 324 beds for student housing. The building is the first gold-level [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) facility at Rice and the first LEED student residential-housing in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Duncan to receive LEED gold status |work = The Rice Thresher | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | url = http://the.ricethresher.org/news/2007/10/05/duncan_leed_gold#header }}</ref> The facility is designed to retain water for irrigation purposes and has motion detector lights which will turn on or off according to the flow of people. The building will decrease energy consumption by up to 25% as well as cut back on water usage. Air conditioners power off when windows are opened.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Rice announces $30M gift, plans for 'greenest' building yet | work = News and Media Relations, Rice University | date = 2007-08-21 | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | url = http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&ID=9881&SnID=37427}}</ref>\n\n[[File:WR FLAG AS MY BLANKET.jpg|left|thumb| One of Duncan's favorite traditions is stealing Will Rice's flag.  Below is the flag draped across the bed of a certain Duncan lad in the Spring of 2016.]]\n\nDuncan College has also established a Monday night tradition, known as \"Monday Night Lights.\" When a few students went down to play ping-pong one night, they noticed that the ping pong table they had played on actually belonged to Baker College, who took its table back. Instead of going to bed, they made a makeshift table in the quad out of extra tables and using toilet paper as the net. People noticed the table and came down to the quad join in, watch and even play acoustic instruments. Monday Night Lights is now a monthly event. Other traditions include \"Duncing\" people in the DuncTank outside the commons on their birthdays, temporarily borrowing prized artifacts from other colleges including Will Rice's flag and Jones' trampoline, and a once a semester Nerf Gun capture the flag game throughout the building called Donnybrook.\n\nArchitecturally, Duncan has the same features as McMurtry with minor differences emphasized in order to establish its uniqueness. For example, Duncan Commons is rectangular in shape, contrasting the round McMurtry Commons. Also, Duncan quad has different features from McMurtry, such as a fountain by the Commons, smaller trees, and walkways that go across the quad. The interior, however, is virtually the same, as both colleges contain mostly doubles in the hallways and single rooms in the corners, with doubles having a pod bathroom inside and singles sharing common bathrooms. Both also have green roofs and fifth floor doubles and suites that open to the outside. The interior hallways of both Duncan and McMurtry were designed as contrasts to the other two most recently built residential colleges, Martel and Wiess, which have exterior hallways. The pair of McMurtry and Duncan are commonly referred to as McDuncan.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Texas}}\n* [http://students.rice.edu/students/Colleges.asp Residential College homepage]\n* [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~program/beerbike/ About Beer Bike]\n* [http://beerbike.com/ Beer Bike History and Statistics]\n* [http://www.rice.edu/fondren/woodson/archives/willricecollege.html Will Rice College at the Woodson Research Center]\n* [http://www.edesigns-graphics.com/wiess/index.html Photographic study of Old Wiess]\n\n{{Rice University}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Residential Colleges Of Rice University}}\n[[Category:Rice University]]\n[[Category:University and college dormitories in the United States]]\n[[Category:Lists of university and college buildings in the United States|Rice University residential colleges]]\n", "name_user": "Rpopat1999", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWill Rice College:changed president and cj", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_colleges_of_Rice_University"}
