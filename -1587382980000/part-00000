He befriends two other \"misfits\" - ZhenZhen, a runaway from China, and Dariush, a teen from a rich but bankrupt family. While the campers are canoeing Dariush wanders off with Alex and find another young teen, Gabriel, a juvenile delinquent. While heading back to camp they witness incoming alien ships invading the valley, and also discover the camp has evacuated - all except for Conrad, a camp counselor. Suddenly, an escape pod from the International Space Station crashes into the place with a dying astronaut inside, who gives Alex a key that needs to get to NASA station JPL, deemed the only way to destroy the aliens. An alien appears with its \"dog\" and kills the astronaut, but Alex and his friends manage to fend it off and escape the camp.\n\nThey make their way to the Sheriff's Office and discover and inmate, Lou, who has been left behind. Alex decides to release him before the group continues on their way to JPL. The group is found by some Marines who take the key and put the children on a bus to take them to safety. However, aliens attack and kill the soldiers, so the group takes the key back and continues on their way to JPL. After stopping to rest for the night, they are attacked by a gang of masked individuals led by Lou. He agrees to let the teens go if Alex gives him the key. Alex refuses and right before Lou attacks him, the alien from the camp attacks them and Lou is killed, but the teens manage to escape.\n\nThe teens finally make it to JPL after being attacked by the alien for the third time, only to find that the doctor who needs the key is dead. The teens are able to make radio contact with a general who explains that the key can be used to destroy the alien mothership in orbit via a [[Cold War]] defense project named Excalibur. Zhenzhen goes into the basement to start the generators while Alex goes on the roof to the communication tower. Dariush and Gabriel stay in the command center of JPL to insert the key into the systems. Alex is attacked on the roof by the alien while Zhenzhen is attacked in the basement by an alien dog but manages to lock it in the basement and get back to the command room to help Gabriel, who cannot read the numbers, insert the launch key since Dariush passed out from blood loss due to an injury.\n\nAfter successfully inserting the launch keys, the General warns Zhenzhen, Dariush, and Gabriel to get out of the building because JPL is not safe and there are two units on the way to get them. In the meantime, Alex has managed to lure the alien into a highly flammable engine test room and burns the alien. With the building burning to the ground, Alex relives the traumatic events leading to his father's death. However, he moves past them and is able to escape just in time.

He befriends two other \"misfits\" - ZhenZhen, a runaway from China, and Dariush, a teen from a rich but bankrupt family. While the campers are canoeing Dariush wanders off with Alex and find another young teen, Gabriel, a juvenile delinquent. While heading back to camp they witness incoming alien ships invading the valley, and also discover the camp has evacuated - all except for Conrad, a camp counselor. Suddenly, an escape pod from the International Space Station crashes into the place with a dying astronaut inside, who gives Alex a key that needs to get to NASA station JPL, deemed the only way to destroy the aliens. An alien appears with its \"dog\" and kills the astronaut, but Alex and his friends manage to fend it off and escape the camp.\n\nThey make their way to the Sheriff's Office and discover and inmate, Lou, who has been left behind. Alex decides to release him before the group continues on their way to JPL. The group is found by some Marines who take the key and put the children on a bus to take them to safety. However, aliens attack and kill the the soldiers, so the group takes the key back and continues on their way to JPL. After stopping to rest for the night, they are attacked by a gang of masked individuals led by Lou. He agrees to let the teens go if Alex gives him the key. Alex refuses and right before Lou attacks him, the alien from the camp attacks them and Lou is killed, but the teens manage to escape.\n\nThe teens finally make it to JPL after being attacked by the alien for the third time, only to find that the doctor who needs the key is dead. The teens are able to make radio contact with a general who explains that the key can be used to destroy the alien mothership in orbit via a [[Cold War]] defense project named Excalibur. Zhenzhen goes into the basement to start the generators while Alex goes on the roof to the communication tower. Dariush and Gabriel stay in the command center of JPL to insert the key into the systems. Alex is attacked on the roof by the alien while Zhenzhen is attacked in the basement by an alien dog but manages to lock it in the basement and get back to the command room to help Gabriel, who cannot read the numbers, insert the launch key since Dariush passed out from blood loss due to an injury.\n\nAfter successfully inserting the launch keys, the General warns Zhenzhen, Dariush, and Gabriel to get out of the building because JPL is not safe and there are two units on the way to get them. In the meantime, Alex has managed to lure the alien into a highly flammable engine test room and burns the alien. With the building burning to the ground, Alex relives the traumatic events leading to his father's death. However, he moves past them and is able to escape just in time. The group of teens watch from the ground as the alien mothership is blown up in the atmosphere. Alex is reunited with his mother and the children are deemed as heroes. Pictures show the teens being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, being awarded crowns and sashes, and riding in parades throughout America.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jack Gore (actor)|Jack Gore]] as Alex\n* Miya Cech as ZhenZhen\n*[[Benjamin Flores Jr.]] as Dariush\n*Alessio Scalzotto as Gabriel\n*[[King Bach|Andrew Bachelor]] as Logan\n*[[Annabeth Gish]] as Grace\n*[[Scott MacArthur]] as Lou\n*Dean Jagger as Captain Hawking\n*[[Michael Beach]] as General Khoury\n*[[Lynn Collins]] as Major Collins\n*David Theune as Head Counselor\n*[[Tony Cavalero]] as Conrad\n*Carl McDowell as Carl\n*Punam Patel as Angeline\n*[[Jason Rogel]] as Customs Official\n*[[Chris Wylde]] as Uncle Chris\n*[[Rudy Mancuso]] as Wes\n*Amanda Cerny as Lucy\n*[[Allan Graf]] as Taxi Driver\n*Cameron Fuller as Young Soldier\n*Richard Gore as Alex's dad\n*[[Peter Parros]] as Dariush's dad\n*Annie Cavalero as Zip Line Counselor\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2018, it was reported that [[McG]] would direct ''Rim of the World'' for [[Netflix]] from a screenplay by [[Zack Stentz]].

Stretford borders [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] to the east, [[Urmston]] to the west, Salford to the north, and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] to the south. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] bisects the town.\n\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Lancashire]], in the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural village, known locally as Porkhampton due to the large number of pigs produced for the Manchester market. It was also an extensive market-gardening area, producing more than {{convert|500|LT|sigfig=3}} of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the [[Trafford Park]] industrial estate, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century. By 2001 less than one per cent of Stretford's population was employed in agriculture.\n\nStretford has been the home of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United Football Club]] since 1910, and of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] since 1864. Notable residents have included the industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire [[John Rylands]], the [[suffragette]] [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], the painter [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Morrissey]], [[Joy Division]] frontman [[Ian Curtis]] and [[Jay Kay]] of [[Jamiroquai]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the name Stretford is \"street\" ([[Old English]] ''str\u00e6t'') on a ford across the [[River Mersey]].{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|Gelling|Richards|1970|p=177|ps=none}} The principal road through Stretford, the [[A56 road|A56 Chester Road]], follows the line of the old [[Roman road]] from [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) to [[Mamucium]] ([[Manchester]]), crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge, built at the location of the ancient ford.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\nThe earliest evidence of human occupation around Stretford comes from [[Neolithic]] stone axes found in the area, dating from about 2000&nbsp;BC. Stretford was part of the land occupied by the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Brigantes]] tribe before and during the Roman occupation, and lay on their border with the [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] on the southern side of the Mersey.{{sfnp|Bayliss|1996|p=6|ps=none}} By 1212, there were two [[manorialism|manors]] in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by [[Hamon de Massey|Hamon de Mascy]], while the land in the north, closer to the [[River Irwell]], was held by Henry de Trafford.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=12|ps=none}} In about 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, since when the two manors descended together.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\n\nThe de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land, much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels. Although there is known to have been a papermill operating in 1765, the area remained largely rural until the early 20th-century development of [[Trafford Park]] in the Old Trafford district north of the town.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=13|ps=none}} Until then Stretford \"remained in the background of daily life in England\",{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}} except for a brief cameo role during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], when Crossford Bridge was destroyed to prevent a crossing by [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s army during its abortive advance on London; the bridge was quickly rebuilt.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}}\n\nUntil the 1820s one of Stretford's main cottage industries was the hand-weaving of cotton.

Stretford borders [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] to the east, [[Urmston]] to the west, Salford to the north, and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] to the south. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] bisects the town.\n\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Lancashire]], in the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural village, known locally as Porkhampton due to the large number of pigs produced for the Manchester market. It was also an extensive market-gardening area, producing more than {{convert|500|LT|sigfig=3}} of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the [[Trafford Park]] industrial estate, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century. By 2001 less than one per cent of Stretford's population was employed in agriculture.\n\nStretford has been the home of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United Football Club]] since 1910, and of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] since 1864. Notable residents have included the industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire [[John Rylands]], the [[suffragette]] [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], the painter [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Morrissey]], [[Joy Division]] frontman [[Ian Curtis]] and [[Jay Kay]] of [[Jamiroquai]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the name Stretford is \"street\" ([[Old English]] ''str\u00e6t'') on a ford across the [[River Mersey]].{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|Gelling|Richards|1970|p=177|ps=none}} The principal road through Stretford, the [[A56 road|A56 Chester Road]], follows the line of the old [[Roman road]] from [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) to [[Mamucium]] ([[Manchester]]), crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge, built at the location of the ancient ford.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\nThe earliest evidence of human occupation around Stretford comes from [[Neolithic]] stone axes found in the area, dating from about 2000&nbsp;BC. Stretford was part of the land occupied by the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Brigantes]] tribe before and during the Roman occupation, and lay on their border with the [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] on the southern side of the Mersey.{{sfnp|Bayliss|1996|p=6|ps=none}} By 1212, there were two [[manorialism|manors]] in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by [[Hamon de Massey|Hamon de Mascy]], while the land in the north, closer to the [[River Irwell]], was held by Henry de Trafford.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=12|ps=none}} In about 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, since when the two manors descended together.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\n\nThe de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land, much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels. Although there is known to have been a papermill operating in 1765, the area remained largely rural until the early 20th-century development of [[Trafford Park]] in the Old Trafford district north of the town.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=13|ps=none}} Until then Stretford \"remained in the background of daily life in England\",{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}} except for a brief cameo role during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], when Crossford Bridge was destroyed to prevent a crossing by [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s army during its abortive advance on London; the bridge was quickly rebuilt.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}}\n\nUntil the 1820s one of Stretford's main cottage industries was the hand-weaving of cotton. There were reported at one time to have been 302&nbsp;handlooms operating in Stretford, providing employment for 780 workers, but by 1826 only four were still in use, as the mechanised cotton mills of nearby Manchester replaced handlooms.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=38|ps=none}} As Manchester continued to grow, it offered a good and easily accessible market for Stretford's agricultural products, in particular [[rhubarb]], once known locally as Stretford beef.{{sfnp|Massey|1976|pp=39, 57|ps=none}} By 1836 [[market gardening]] had become so extensive around Stretford that one writer described it as the \"garden of Lancashire\";{{sfnp|Scola|1992|p=97|ps=none}} in 1845 more than 500&nbsp;tons of vegetables were being produced for the Manchester market each week.{{sfnp|Scola|1992|p=105|ps=none}} Stretford also became well known for its pig market and the production of [[black pudding]]s, leading to the village being given the nickname of Porkhampton. A local dish, known as Stretford goose, was made from pork stuffed with sage and onions. During the 1830s, between 800 and 1,000 pigs a week were being slaughtered for the Manchester market.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nSituated on the border with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=23|ps=none}} Large recreation areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist [[John Dalton]], because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution.{{r|RBHS}} In 1857, the gardens hosted the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester 1857, a City of Industry |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/whats-on/art-treasures-in-detail/manchester-1857/ |access-date=16 January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of \u00a338,000 to house the 16,000&nbsp;exhibits.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=107|ps=none}} The gardens were also chosen as a site for the [[Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Manchester 1887|Royal Jubilee Exhibition]] of 1887, celebrating [[Queen Victoria]]'s 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than six&nbsp;months and was attended by more than 4.75&nbsp;million visitors.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|pp=107\u2013110|ps=none}} The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928.<ref>{{cite web |title=White City Track |publisher=UK Running Track Directory |url=http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=manchester-wc |access-date=9 January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track.

It is located in Singha Durbar Plaza, Kathmandu, Nepal. On October 31, 2019 the [[Stock market|equity market]] capitalization of the companies listed on NEPSE was approximately US$12.779 billion.\n\nThe basic objective of NEPSE is to impart free marketability and liquidity to the government and corporate securities by facilitating transactions in its [[Trading room|trading floor]] through member, market intermediaries, such as broker, [[market maker]]s etc. NEPSE opened its trading floor on 13 January 1994. As on April 4, 2013, the number of listed companies is 334, which includes Commercial Banks, Hydro Power Companies, Insurance Companies and Finance Companies among others.<ref>http://www.nepalstock.com/listedcompany.php</ref>  The Exchange has 50 registered brokers as of April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nepalstock.com/brokers}}</ref> The NEPSE Index is primary all equity market index of NEPSE. There are  245 companies listed on stock exchange, till the date(as on 01-11-2019).\n\nIt is regulated by the Securities Board of Nepal.<ref>http://www.sebon.gov.np</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of [[Capital market|securities market]] began with the flotation of shares by Biratnagar Jute Mills Ltd. and Nepal Bank Ltd. in 1937. Introduction of the Company Act in 1964, the first issuance of [[Government bond|Government Bond]] in 1964 and the establishment of Securities Exchange Center Ltd. in 1976 were other significant development relating to capital markets.\n\nSecurities Exchange Center was established with an objective of facilitating and promoting the growth of capital markets. Before conversion into stock exchange it was the only capital markets institution undertaking the job of brokering, underwriting, managing public issue, market making for government bonds and other [[financial services]]. Nepal Government, under a program initiated to reform capital markets, converted Securities Exchange Center into Nepal Stock Exchange in 1993.\n\n==Structure==\nThe current paid-up capital of NEPSE is approximately USD 4.5 million. Government of Nepal, Nepal Rastra Bank, Rastriya Banijya Bank (former, Nepal Industrial Development Corporation) and other securities businessperson (brokers) are the shareholders of NEPSE. The following table shows the percentage of shareholdings by the respective shareholders on the capital structure:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! S.No !! Owners !! Ownership(%)\n|-\n| 1 || Government of Nepal || 58.65\n|-\n| 2 || Nepal Rastra Bank || 34.6\n|-\n| 3 || Rastriya Banijya Bank || 6.12\n|-\n| 4 || Members(Brokers) || 0.62\n|}\n\n==Members==\nMembers are permitted to act as intermediaries in buying and selling of government bonds and listed corporate securities. At present, there are 50 member brokers who operate on the trading floor as per the Securities Act, 2007, rules and by-law\n\n<br />\n\n== Types of Sub Indices ==\nSubindex/indces of Nepse are categorise \n\n# Banking \n# Development bank \n# Finance \n# Microfinace \n# Manufacturing And Processing\n# Hydro Power\n# Non Life Insurance\n# Life Insurance\n# Hotels\n# Mutual Fund\n# Other\n\nNepse start trading at the secondary market from 100 points on Jan. 1994.

Mutual funds\n\n<br />\n\n==Trading System==\nNEPSE operates on the \u2018NEPSE Automated Trading System \u2018(NATS), a fully screen based automated trading system, which adopts the principle of an order driven market. Purchase & Sell of Physical as well as dematerialized securities is done through NATS.\n\n==Market Timings==\nTrading on equities takes place on all days of week (except Saturdays and holidays declared by exchange in advance). On Friday only [[odd lot]] trading is done.\n\nThe market timings of the equities are:-\nMarket Open: - 11:00 AM\nMarket Close: - 15:00 PM\n\nOdd Lot Trading is done on Fridays.

The exchange may also extend, advance or reduce trading hours when it deems fit necessary.\n\n==Index-based Circuit Breakers==\nThe index-based circuit breaker system applies at 3 stages of the NEPSE index movement of 4%, 5% and 6%.These circuit breakers when triggered bring about a [[trading halt]] in all securities.\n\nIn case of 4% movement either way, there would be a market halt for 15 minutes if the movement takes place during first hour of trading i.e. 12:00 PM. In case this movement takes after 12:00 PM there will be no trading halt at this level and market shall continue trading.\n\nIn case of 5% movement either way, there would be a market halt for half an hour if the movement takes place before 13:00 PM. In case this movement takes after 13:00 PM there will be no trading halt at this level and market shall continue trading.\n\nIn case of 6% movement in either way, trading shall be halted for the remainder of the day.

{"title_page": "Gugging", "text_new": "{{short description|Psychiatric institution near Vienna, Austria}}\n[[File:Haus der K\u00fcnstler vom Osten.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The building in 2010]]\nThe '''Maria Gugging Psychiatric Clinic''', known as '''Gugging''', is a [[psychiatric institution]] located on the outskirts of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].<ref>http://www.gugging.at/en/besucherinfo/kontakt-anreise</ref> Several of its patients became known for their [[Outsider Art]], and were referred to as the '''Gugging Artists'''. Today, the artist/patients live in a dedicated [[art therapy]] center at Gugging, known as the Art / Brut Center Gugging. In stark contrast, Gugging has a darkened history during the time of the Nazi Regime, when hundreds of mental patients were murdered or abused as part of the [[Aktion T4|Nazi Regime Euthanasia Program]].\n\n==History during the Nazi regime==\nHistorian Herwig Czech told the Austrian Press Agency that Gugging was the scene \u201cof some of the most barbarous medical crimes committed in Austria\u201d during the Nazi Regime.  Approximately 400 patients were killed by Doctor Emil Gelny by poisoning and electric shock.  Rudolf Lonauer was the attending doctor for 112 deaths and typically murdered his patients - mainly women - with an overdose of drugs. Patients also died from lethal injection, malnutrition, and infectious diseases.  New research has also shown that between November 1940 and May 1941 a total of 675 people were taken from the clinic to the euthanasia center at [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre|Hartheim]] castle near [[Linz]], where they were gassed.  Of these, 116 were children and teenagers between the ages of four and 17.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nazis killed hundreds at Austrian mental hospital|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20141125/nazis-killed-hundreds-at-austrian-mental-hospital|website=The Local|publisher=The Local|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref>  \n\nBy 1940, rumors of euthanasia at Hartheim began to spread.  Anna W\u00f6dl, a nurse and the mother of a disabled child living at Gugging, attempted to save the life of her son by petitioning against his relocation to Hartheim.  She was assured that he would not go to Hartheim, but was instead taken to another children's institution, [[Am Spiegelgrund]], where he died soon after he arrived.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alfred W\u00f6dl|url=http://www.t4-denkmal.de/eng/Alfred-Woedl|website=The Memorial Page of Victims of Nazi Euthanasia Programs|publisher=Germany National Memorial|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==The Gugging Artists==\nIn the late 1950s, [[psychiatrist]] [[Leo Navratil]] (1921-2006), of the Maria Gugging Psychiatric Clinic, had his patients produce drawings for diagnostic purposes. The following year he discovered artistically talented individuals in his ward - a finding that was confirmed by [[Jean Dubuffet]], the French artist who coined the term Art Brut (also known as [[Outsider Art]]). Navratil's first book ''Schizophrenie und Kunst'' (''Schizophrenia and Art'') was published in 1965. Attracted to the clinic by this work, many Viennese artists visited Gugging. In 1970 the first exhibition of the \"Gugging Artists\" took place in a Vienna gallery. Thereafter, the \"Gugging Artists\" were frequently presented in galleries and museums.\n\n==House of Artists==\n[[File:Vojo al muzeo.JPG|thumb|Tiled art in the clinic grounds]]\nThe \"Center for Art and Psychotherapy\" was founded by Navratil in 1981. He invited artistically talented patients to live in the house, which serves as living space, studio, gallery and meeting place. With the founder's retirement in 1986, Johann Feilacher became his successor. Feilacher stressed the role that art played at Gugging and went on to change its name to the \"House of Artists\" ({{lang-de|Haus der K\u00fcnstler}}). Within Europe, the House of Artists is regarded as a model for psychiatric reforms based on [[art therapy]] as a means to reintegrate clients into society.\n\nPresently, a [[cultural center]] is located next to the House of Artists. It is known as the \"Art / Brut Center\", and consists of a museum, a gallery and a public studio. The museum contains the works of the Gugging artists, and also hosts traveling Art Brut exhibitions, which include artists such as [[Martin Ramirez]] and [[Adolf W\u00f6lfli]]. The museum building also hosts a public studio that is open to all, but is mainly used by individuals who have undergone or are receiving psychiatric treatment.

Today, the artist/patients live in a dedicated [[art therapy]] center at Gugging, known as the Art / Brut Center Gugging. In stark contrast, Gugging has a darkened history during the time of the Nazi Regime, when hundreds of mental patients were murdered or abused as part of the [[Aktion T4|Nazi Regime Euthanasia Program]].\n\n==History during the Nazi regime==\nHistorian Herwig Czech told the Austrian Press Agency that Gugging was the scene \u201cof some of the most barbarous medical crimes committed in Austria\u201d during the Nazi Regime.  Approximately 400 patients were killed by Doctor Emil Gelny by poisoning and electric shock.  Rudolf Lonauer was the attending doctor for 112 deaths and typically murdered his patients - mainly women - with an overdose of drugs. Patients also died from lethal injection, malnutrition, and infectious diseases.  New research has also shown that between November 1940 and May 1941 a total of 675 people were taken from the clinic to the euthanasia center at [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre|Hartheim]] castle near [[Linz]], where they were gassed.  Of these, 116 were children and teenagers between the ages of four and 17.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nazis killed hundreds at Austrian mental hospital|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20141125/nazis-killed-hundreds-at-austrian-mental-hospital|website=The Local|publisher=The Local|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref>  \n\nBy 1940, rumors of euthanasia at Hartheim began to spread.  Anna W\u00f6dl, a nurse and the mother of a disabled child living at Gugging, attempted to save the life of her son by petitioning against his relocation to Hartheim.  She was assured that he would not go to Hartheim, but was instead taken to another children's institution, [[Am Spiegelgrund]], where he died soon after he arrived.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alfred W\u00f6dl|url=http://www.t4-denkmal.de/eng/Alfred-Woedl|website=The Memorial Page of Victims of Nazi Euthanasia Programs|publisher=Germany National Memorial|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==The Gugging Artists==\nIn the late 1950s, [[psychiatrist]] [[Leo Navratil]] (1921-2006), of the Maria Gugging Psychiatric Clinic, had his patients produce drawings for diagnostic purposes. The following year he discovered artistically talented individuals in his ward - a finding that was confirmed by [[Jean Dubuffet]], the French artist who coined the term Art Brut (also known as [[Outsider Art]]). Navratil's first book ''Schizophrenie und Kunst'' (''Schizophrenia and Art'') was published in 1965. Attracted to the clinic by this work, many Viennese artists visited Gugging. In 1970 the first exhibition of the \"Gugging Artists\" took place in a Vienna gallery. Thereafter, the \"Gugging Artists\" were frequently presented in galleries and museums.\n\n==House of Artists==\n[[File:Vojo al muzeo.JPG|thumb|Tiled art in the clinic grounds]]\nThe \"Center for Art and Psychotherapy\" was founded by Navratil in 1981. He invited artistically talented patients to live in the house, which serves as living space, studio, gallery and meeting place. With the founder's retirement in 1986, Johann Feilacher became his successor. Feilacher stressed the role that art played at Gugging and went on to change its name to the \"House of Artists\" ({{lang-de|Haus der K\u00fcnstler}}). Within Europe, the House of Artists is regarded as a model for psychiatric reforms based on [[art therapy]] as a means to reintegrate clients into society.\n\nPresently, a [[cultural center]] is located next to the House of Artists. It is known as the \"Art / Brut Center\", and consists of a museum, a gallery and a public studio. The museum contains the works of the Gugging artists, and also hosts traveling Art Brut exhibitions, which include artists such as [[Martin Ramirez]] and [[Adolf W\u00f6lfli]]. The museum building also hosts a public studio that is open to all, but is mainly used by individuals who have undergone or are receiving psychiatric treatment. Together the museum, the gallery, the \"House of Artists\" and the public studio, are known as the Art / Brut Center Gugging. \n\n==In popular culture== \nIn early 1994 [[David Bowie]] and [[Brian Eno]] visited the Gugging psychiatric hospital to interview and photograph the celebrated artist-patients famous for their \"Outsider Art\". <ref name=nytb>{{citation | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/moody-bowie.html | title=Returning to the Sound of Those Golden Years | first=Rick | last=Moody | date=10 September 1995 | accessdate=29 October 2013 | journal=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> Artistic materials favored by the Gugging's residents had a powerful influence on production strategies in the studio <ref name=nytb /> during the Bowie / Eno collaboration.
