Walking plows could loosen up earth, then two horse scrapers called [[Fresno scraper|fresnos]] could grade the low places. These projects could be undertaken by pioneer settlers who wished to work to help pay homestead taxes.  Two horse teams were replaced by fours horse teams and larger scrapers. Crawler tractors eventually replaced horse teams to pull larger scrapers and graders. <blockquote>No. 9 was surveyed in 1929 and graded in 1930-31. These roads were first gravelled in 1930-31 and 1933. This made for safer driving in rainy weather, but very dusty in dry weather. Sometimes these clouds of dust were the cause of accidents on the highways. Next these roads were re-built for oiled surfaces - No. 9 to the lakes in 1956, and south of town in 1964-65....The oiled surface reduced the dust hazard, but kept breaking up under heavy loads...When potash was discovered...better surfacing was requited.  So the highway were once again built up to make them wider, and No. 9 got heavy-duty paving to withstand the heavy loads.

C is in the middle of the root note row.]]\nThe '''Stradella Bass System''' (sometimes called{{by whom?}} ''standard bass'') is a [[button (control)|buttonboard]] layout equipped on the bass side of many [[accordion]]s, which uses columns of buttons arranged in a [[circle of fifths]]; this places the principal major chords of a key (I, IV and V) in three adjacent columns. In a typical layout, as pictured, each column contains, in order, the following bass notes or preset chords (the C row is used as an example):\n* Bass note that is a [[major third]] above the root note (\"counter-bass\"): the note E\n* Bass [[root (chord)|root note]]: the note C (used as an example)\n* [[major chord]]: C major, the notes C, E, G\n* [[minor chord]]: c minor, the notes C, Eb, G\n* [[Seventh chord#The dominant seventh|dominant seventh chord]] (typically a three-note voicing  the fifth omitted): C7, the notes C, E, Bb\n* [[diminished seventh chord]](typically a three-note voicing  the fifth omitted): c diminished, the notes C, Eb, A\n\nThe diminished seventh row is a source of confusion. Nominally, the diminished chord in the \"C\" row is \"c diminished\". However, with the omitted fifth, listeners often hear the notes C, Eb, A as an \"a diminished\" triad (in root position, it consists of the notes A, C and Eb).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is from [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]], a town and commune of the Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese in the Province of Pavia in the northern Italian region of Lombardy, once an important center for the production of accordions. \n\n==Layout==\n\nThe following chart shows a common 120-button Stradella layout.\n\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|center|750px]]\n\nEach bass note, and each pitch in a chord, is usually sounded simultaneously in multiple octaves.

(Repeated chords are usually only labeled on the first instance.)\n\nWithin this convention, the written [[octave]] for bass notes is arbitrary, as the Stradella system does not have buttons for higher and lower octaves.\n\nAn example:\n\n{{col-float}}\nAs written:\n\n:<score>\n{\n\\clef bass\n\\time 4/4\nc4 c'^\"M\" e,-- c' g, g <c c'>2\n}\n</score>\n{{col-float-break}}\nAs sounded, with one possible octave voicing:\n\n:<score>\n{\n\\clef bass\n\\time 4/4\n<c, c c'>4 <c' e' g> <e, e e'> <c' e' g> <g, g> <d'g b> <c, c c' e' g>2\n}\n</score>\n{{col-float-end}}\n\nBass notes to be played on the major third (counterbass) row are indicated by repurposed \"[[tenuto]]\" lines below the notes (as in the E bass note in the example above), or underlined note names or numbers.\n\nSingle-note bass lines are often labeled \"B.S.\" (bass solo or ''bassi soli''), especially when they extend above the middle of the staff.\n\n==Fingering==\nAs with the piano, fingers are numbered 2 to 5, starting with the index finger, mirroring right-hand fingering. As a rule, the thumb, numbered 1, is not used. \n\nPatterns can be played identically in any desired key, changing only the starting position; this is because unlike a piano keyboard, the Stradella layout does not distinguish between \"white notes\" and \"black notes\".

C is in the middle of the root note row.]]\nThe '''Stradella Bass System''' (sometimes called ''standard bass'') is a [[button (control)|buttonboard]] layout equipped on the bass side of many [[accordion]]s, which uses columns of buttons arranged in a [[circle of fifths]]; this places the principal major chords of a key (I, IV and V) in three adjacent columns. In a typical layout, as pictured, each column contains, in order, the following bass notes or preset chords (the C row is used as an example):\n* Bass note that is a [[major third]] above the root note (\"counter-bass\"): the note E\n* Bass [[root (chord)|root note]]: the note C (used as an example)\n* [[major chord]]: C major, the notes C, E, G\n* [[minor chord]]: c minor, the notes C, Eb, G\n* [[Seventh chord#The dominant seventh|dominant seventh chord]] (typically a three-note voicing  the fifth omitted): C7, the notes C, E, Bb\n* [[diminished seventh chord]](typically a three-note voicing  the fifth omitted): c diminished, the notes C, Eb, A\n\nThe diminished seventh row is a source of confusion. Nominally, the diminished chord in the \"C\" row is \"c diminished\". However, with the omitted fifth, listeners often hear the notes C, Eb, A as an \"a diminished\" triad (in root position, it consists of the notes A, C and Eb).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is from [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]], a town and commune of the Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese in the Province of Pavia in the northern Italian region of Lombardy, once an important center for the production of accordions. \n\n==Layout==\n\nThe following chart shows a common 120-button Stradella layout.\n\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|center|750px]]\n\nEach bass note, and each pitch in a chord, is usually sounded simultaneously in multiple octaves.

Perhaps his grandson, Sancho II, is meant.

He had been a Canon of the Cathedral of Compostella, and under the patronage of Bishop [[Diego Gelmirez]], a Cluniac, he was said to have been a co-author of the ''[[Historia Compostellana]]''.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 57, 68.</ref> In 1103-1104 he was sent to Rome on an embassy for the Church of Compostella, and obtained a bull granting numerous privileges, one of which was the right of the Bishop of Compostella to name Cardinals of Compostella. Hugo became a Cardinal.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 58.</ref> In 1109 he was Archdeacon of Compostella, but at the time of his election to the diocese of Porto and not yet ordained. He was ordained a priest on the day before Passion Sunday, and was consecrated a bishop on 23 March 1113 by Archbishop [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Mauricio Burdino]] of Braga, another Cluniac.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 59.</ref> As Bishop of Porto he secured from [[Pope Paschal II]], by a bull granted on 15 August 1115, exemption of his diocese from the supervisory control of the Archbishop of Braga.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 297-299. Burdinus became an antipope of the Emperor V in Rome on 8 March 1118.</ref> He greatly enlarged his diocese and the cathedral patrimony increased by the donations he secured; thus, in 1120, he received from D. [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]] jurisdiction over the City of Porto with all the rents and dues thereof.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 64, 299.</ref> Bishop Hugo was present at the Council of Compostella in 1114, the Council of Sagunto in 1121 (under the presidency of Cardinal Boso, the papal Legate), and the Synod of Compostella in 1122.<ref>Thomas (da Cunha) ''Historia ecclesiae Lusitaniae'' III, p. 30.</ref>\n\nJohn Peculiar was promoted to [[Braga]] (1138), his nephew, Pedro Rabaldis, succeeding at Porto. Next came D. [[Pedro Pit\u00f5es]] (1145 to 1152 or 1155), D. Pedro S\u00e9nior (d. 1172), and D. Fern\u00e3o Martins (d. 1185). Martinho Pires instituted a chapter and was promoted to Braga in 1189 or 1190. Martinho Rodrigues ruled from 1191 to 1235. He quarreled with the chapter over their share of the rents of the see. Later on, fresh disagreements arose in which King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] intervened against the bishop, who was deprived of his goods and had to flee, but was restored by the king when Innocent III espoused the bishop's cause. Another quarrel soon arouse between prelate and king, and the bishop was imprisoned; but he escaped and fled to Rome, and in 1209 the king, feeling the approach of death, made peace with him. His successor, Pedro Salvadores, figured prominently in the questions between the clergy and King [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who refused to ecclesiastics the right of purchasing or inheriting land. Portugal fell into anarchy, in which the clergy's rights were violated and their persons outraged, though they themselves were not guiltless. Finally, Pope Innocent IV committed the reform of abuses to [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], brother of [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] who lost his crown.\n\nUnder Bishop Julian (1247\u201360) the jurisdiction difficulty became aggravated. A settlement was effected at the Cortes of [[Leiria]] (1254), which the bishop refused to ratify, but he had to give way. When King Afonso III determined (1265) that all rights and properties usurped during the disorders of Sancho's reign should revert to the Crown, nearly all the bishops, including the Bishop of Porto, then D. Vicente, protested; and seven went to Rome for relief, leaving Portugal under an interdict. When the king was dying, in 1278, he promised restitution. Vicente (d. 1296) was one of the negotiators of the [[Concordat of Forty Articles|Concordat of 1289]] and the supplementary Accord of Eleven Articles. He was succeeded by Sancho Pires, who ruled until 1300. Geraldo Domingues resigned in 1308 to act as counsellor of the King's daughter Constan\u00e7a, future Queen of Castile. Tredulo was bishop for two and a half years. The Minorite Frei Est\u00eav\u00e3o was succeeded in 1313 by his nephew Fernando Ramires. Both uncle and nephew quarrelled with King Denis and left the realm.\n\nOwing to the hostility of the citizens, Bishop Gomes lived mostly outside his diocese. When Pedro Afonso became bishop in 1343, he had a quarrel over jurisdiction and, like his predecessor, departed, leaving the diocese under interdict. Six years later he returned, but again the monarch began to encroach, and it was not until 1354 that the bishop secured recognition of his rights. His successor was Afonso Pires. Eg\u00eddio is probably the bishop represented in the old Chronicles as being threatened with scourging by King Pedro for having lived in sin with a citizen's wife The accusation was probably groundless, but Eg\u00eddio left the city, which for twelve years had no bishop.\n\nOther bishops were: John de Zambuja, or Est\u00eav\u00e3o; and Gil, who in 1406 sold the episcopal rights over Oporto to the Crown for an annual money payment, reduced in the reign of D. Manuel to 120 silver marks; Fernando Guerra, who in 1425 was created Archbishop of Braga; and Vasco. Ant\u00e3o Martins de Chaves, who succeeded Vasco in 1430, was sent by the pope to Constantinople to induce the Greek emperor to attend the Council of Basle. He succeeded, and as a reward was made cardinal. He died in 1447. Succeeding incumbents were: Durando; Gon\u00e7alves de \u00d3bidos; Luis Pires (1454\u201364), a negotiator of the Concordat of 1455 and a reforming prelate; Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo (1465\u20131494), a benefactor of the cathedral and chapter, as was his successor Diego de Sousa, afterwards Archbishop of Braga and executor of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The see was then held by two brothers in succession, Diogo da Costa (1505-7) and D. Pedro da Costa (1511\u201339), who restored the bishop's palace and enriched the capitular revenues from his own purse; Belchior Beliago; and the Carmelite Frei Baltazar Limpo (1538\u201352), the fiftieth bishop. He held a diocesan synod in 1540.\n\nIn the time of Rodrigo Pinheiro, a learned humanist, Porto was visited by St. [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda|Francis Borgia]] and the [[Jesuits]] established themselves in the city. Aires da Silva, ex-rector of Coimbra University, after ruling four years, fell in the [[battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in 1578 with King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o]]. Sim\u00e3o Pereira was followed by the Franciscan Frei Marcos de Lisboa, chronicler of his order. He added to the cathedral and convoked a diocesan synod in 1585. In 1591 another ex-rector of Coimbra, Jer\u00f3nimo de Menezes, became bishop; he was succeeded by the Benedictine Frei Gon\u00e7alo de Morais, a zealous defender of the rights of the Church. He built a new sacristy and chancel in the cathedral. In 1618 Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, author of the history of the Bishops of Oporto, was appointed. His \"Catalogo\" describes the state of the cathedral and enumerates the parishes of the diocese with their population and income in 1623 and is the earliest account we possess. His successor was Frei Jo\u00e3o de Valadares, transferred from the See of Miranda. Gaspar do Rego da Fonseca held the see four years (1635\u201339). King [[Philip III of Portugal|Philip III]] named Francisco Pereira Pinto, but the revolution in 1640 prevented his taking possession; moreover he never received his bulls of consecration and installation from [[Pope Urban VIII]], and therefore he could not be consecrated or installed as bishop.<ref>Gauchat, IV, p. 286, note 7.</ref> The diocese was considered vacant until 1670, being ruled by administrators appointed by the Chapter of the Cathedral (Vicars capitular). In 1641 King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] chose D. Sebasti\u00e3o C\u00e9sar de Menezes as bishop, but the pope, influenced by Spain, would neither recognize the new King of Portugal nor confirm his nominations. Next came Frei Pedro de Menezes; Nicolau Monteiro took possession in 1671; and Fernando Correia de Lacerda in 1673, who was succeeded by Jo\u00e3o de Sousa. Frei Jos\u00e9 Saldanha (1697\u20131708), famed for his austerity, never relinquished his Franciscan habit, a contrast to his successor Tom\u00e1s de Almeida, who in 1716 became the first Patriarch of Lisbon. The see remained vacant until 1739, and, though Frei John Maria was then elected, he never obtained confirmation. In the same year Frei Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca, formerly Commissary General of the Franciscans, became bishop. Several European States selected him as arbiter of their differences. He contributed to the canonization of a number of saints, and founded and restored many convents and hospitals.\n\nNext in order were: Frei Ant\u00f3nio de T\u00e1vora (d. 1766), Frei Aleixo de Miranda Henriques, Frei Jo\u00e3o Rafael de Mendon\u00e7a (1771-3), and Louren\u00e7o Correia de S\u00e1 Benevides (1796-8). Frei Antonio de Castro became Patriarch of Lisbon in 1814, being followed at Porto by Jo\u00e3o Avelar. Frei Manuel de Santa In\u00eas, though elected, never obtained confirmation, but some years after his death, relations between Portugal and the Holy See were re-established by a concordat and Jer\u00f3nimo da Costa Rebelo became bishop in 1843. From 1854 to 1859 the see was held by Ant\u00f3nio da Fonseca Moniz; on his death it remained vacant until 1862, when Jo\u00e3o de Castro e Moura, who had been a missionary in China, was appointed (d.1868). The see was again vacant until the confirmation of Am\u00e9rico Ferreira dos Santos Silva in 1871. This prelate was obliged to combat the growing Liberalism of his flock and the Protestant propaganda in Porto A popular lawyer named Mesquita started a campaign against him, because the bishop refused to dismiss some priests, reputed reactionary, who served the Aguardente Chapel; getting himself elected judge of the Brotherhood of the Temple, he provoked a great platform agitation with the result that the chapel was secularized and became a school under the patronage of the Marquis of Pombal Association. In 1879 Am\u00e9rico was created cardinal and on his death the present (1911) Bishop, Ant\u00f3nio Barroso, an ex-missionary, was transferred from the [[see of Mylapore]] to that of Porto.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11260a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article]</ref>\n\n===Cathedral===\nThe [[Cathedral of Porto|Porto Cathedral]] was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven.

He had been a Canon of the Cathedral of Compostella, and under the patronage of Bishop [[Diego Gelmirez]], a Cluniac, he was said to have been a co-author of the ''[[Historia Compostellana]]''.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 57, 68.</ref> In 1103-1104 he was sent to Rome on an embassy for the Church of Compostella, and obtained a bull granting numerous privileges, one of which was the right of the Bishop of Compostella to name Cardinals of Compostella. Hugo became a Cardinal.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 58.</ref> In 1109 he was Archdeacon of Compostella, but at the time of his election to the diocese of Porto although not ordained. He was ordained a priest on the day before Passion Sunday, and was consecrated a bishop on 23 March 1113 by Archbishop [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Mauricio Burdino]] of Braga, another Cluniac.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 59.</ref> As Bishop of Porto he secured from [[Pope Paschal II]], by a bull granted on 15 August 1115, exemption of his diocese from the supervisory control of the Archbishop of Braga.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 297-299. Burdinus became an antipope of the Emperor V in Rome on 8 March 1118.</ref> He greatly enlarged his diocese and the cathedral patrimony increased by the donations he secured; thus, in 1120, he received from D. [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]] jurisdiction over the City of Porto with all the rents and dues thereof.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 64, 299.</ref> Bishop Hugo was present at the Council of Compostella in 1114, the Council of Sagunto in 1121 (under the presidency of Cardinal Boso, the papal Legate), and the Synod of Compostella in 1122.<ref>Thomas (da Cunha) ''Historia ecclesiae Lusitaniae'' III, p. 30.</ref>\n\nJohn Peculiar was promoted to [[Braga]] (1138), his nephew, Pedro Rabaldis, succeeding at Porto. Next came D. [[Pedro Pit\u00f5es]] (1145 to 1152 or 1155), D. Pedro S\u00e9nior (d. 1172), and D. Fern\u00e3o Martins (d. 1185). Martinho Pires instituted a chapter, was promoted to Braga, 1189 or 1190. Martinho Rodrigues ruled from 1191 to 1235. He quarrelled with the chapter over their share of the rents of the see. Later on, fresh disagreements arose in which King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] intervened against the bishop, who was deprived of his goods and had to flee, but was restored by the king when Innocent III espoused the bishop's cause. Another quarrel soon arouse between prelate and king, and the bishop was imprisoned; but he escaped and fled to Rome, and in 1209 the king, feeling the approach of death, made peace with him. His successor, Pedro Salvadores, figured prominently in the questions between the clergy and King [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who refused to ecclesiastics the right of purchasing or inheriting land. Portugal fell into anarchy, in which the clergy's rights were violated and their persons outraged, though they themselves were not guiltless. Finally, Pope Innocent IV committed the reform of abuses to [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], brother of [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who lost his crown.\n\nUnder Bishop Julian (1247\u201360) the jurisdiction difficulty became aggravated. A settlement was effected at the Cortes of [[Leiria]] (1254), which the bishop refused to ratify, but he had to give way. When King Afonso III determined (1265) that all rights and properties usurped during the disorders of Sancho's reign should revert to the Crown, nearly all the bishops, including the Bishop of Porto, then D. Vicente, protested; and seven went to Rome for relief, leaving Portugal under an interdict. When the king was dying, in 1278, he promised restitution. Vicente (d. 1296) was one of the negotiators of the [[Concordat of Forty Articles|Concordat of 1289]] and the supplementary Accord of Eleven Articles. He was succeeded by Sancho Pires, who ruled until 1300. Geraldo Domingues resigned in 1308 to act as counsellor of the King's daughter Constan\u00e7a, future Queen of Castile. Tredulo was bishop for two and a half years. The Minorite Frei Est\u00eav\u00e3o was succeeded in 1313 by his nephew Fernando Ramires. Both uncle and nephew quarrelled with King Denis and left the realm.\n\nOwing to the hostility of the citizens, Bishop Gomes lived mostly outside his diocese. When Pedro Afonso became bishop in 1343, he had a quarrel over jurisdiction and, like his predecessor, departed, leaving the diocese under interdict. Six years later he returned, but again the monarch began to encroach, and it was not until 1354 that the bishop secured recognition of his rights. His successor was Afonso Pires. Eg\u00eddio is probably the bishop represented in the old Chronicles as being threatened with scourging by King Pedro for having lived in sin with a citizen's wife The accusation was probably groundless, but Eg\u00eddio left the city, which for twelve years had no bishop.\n\nOther bishops were: John de Zambuja, or Est\u00eav\u00e3o; and Gil, who in 1406 sold the episcopal rights over Oporto to the Crown for an annual money payment, reduced in the reign of D. Manuel to 120 silver marks; Fernando Guerra, who in 1425 was created Archbishop of Braga; Vasco. \u2014 Ant\u00e3o Martins de Chaves, who succeeded Vasco in 1430, was sent by the pope to Constantinople to induce the Greek emperor to attend the Council of Basle. He succeeded, and as a reward was made cardinal. He died in 1447. Succeeding incumbents were: Durando; Gon\u00e7alves de \u00d3bidos; Luis Pires (1454\u201364), a negotiator of the Concordat of 1455 and a reforming prelate; Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo (1465\u20131494), a benefactor of the cathedral and chapter, as was his successor Diego de Sousa, afterwards Archbishop of Braga and executor of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The see was then held by two brothers in succession, Diogo da Costa (1505-7) and D. Pedro da Costa (1511\u201339), who restored the bishop's palace and enriched the capitular revenues from his own purse; Belchior Beliago; and the Carmelite Frei Baltazar Limpo (1538\u201352), the fiftieth bishop. He held a diocesan synod in 1540.\n\nIn the time of Rodrigo Pinheiro, a learned humanist, Porto was visited by St. Francis Borgia and the Jesuits established themselves in the city. Aires da Silva, ex-rector of Coimbra University, after ruling four years, fell in the [[battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in 1578 with King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o]]. Sim\u00e3o Pereira was followed by the Franciscan Frei Marcos de Lisboa, chronicler of his order. He added to the cathedral and convoked a diocesan synod in 1585. In 1591 another ex-rector of Coimbra, Jer\u00f3nimo de Menezes, became bishop; he was succeeded by the Benedictine Frei Gon\u00e7alo de Morais, a zealous defender of the rights of the Church. He built a new sacristy and chancel in the cathedral. In 1618 Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, author of the history of the Bishops of Oporto, was appointed. His \"Catalogo\" describes the state of the cathedral and enumerates the parishes of the diocese with their population and income in 1623 and is the earliest account we possess. His successor was Frei Jo\u00e3o de Valadares, transferred from the See of Miranda. Gaspar do Rego da Fonseca, who held the see four years (1635\u201339). King [[Philip III of Portugal|Philip III]] named Francisco Pereira Pinto, but the revolution in 1640 prevented his taking possession; moreover he never received his bulls of consecration and installation from [[Pope Urban VIII]], and therefore he could not be consecrated or installed as bishop.<ref>Gauchat, IV, p. 286, note 7.</ref> The diocese was considered vacant until 1670, being ruled by administrators appointed by the Chapter of the Cathedral (Vicars capitular). In 1641 King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] chose D. Sebasti\u00e3o C\u00e9sar de Menezes as bishop, but the pope, influenced by Spain, would neither recognize the new King of Portugal nor confirm his nominations. Next came Frei Pedro de Menezes; Nicolau Monteiro took possession in 1671, Fernando Correia de Lacerda, in 1673, who was succeeded by Jo\u00e3o de Sousa. Frei Jos\u00e9 Saldanha (1697\u20131708), famed for his austerity, never relinquished his Franciscan habit, a contrast to his successor Tom\u00e1s de Almeida, who in 1716 became the first Patriarch of Lisbon. The see remained vacant until 1739, and, though Frei John Maria was then elected, he never obtained confirmation. In the same year Frei Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca, formerly Commissary General of the Franciscans, became bishop. Several European States selected him as arbiter of their differences. He contributed to the canonization of a number of saints. He founded and restored many convents and hospitals.\n\nNext in order were: Frei Ant\u00f3nio de T\u00e1vora (d. 1766), Frei Aleixo de Miranda Henriques, Frei Jo\u00e3o Rafael de Mendon\u00e7a (1771-3), and Louren\u00e7o Correia de S\u00e1 Benevides (1796-8). Frei Antonio de Castro became Patriarch of Lisbon in 1814, being followed at Porto by Jo\u00e3o Avelar. Frei Manuel de Santa In\u00eas, though elected, never obtained confirmation, but some years after his death, relations between Portugal and the Holy See were re-established by a concordat and Jer\u00f3nimo da Costa Rebelo became bishop in 1843. From 1854 to 1859 the see was held by Ant\u00f3nio da Fonseca Moniz; on his death it remained vacant until 1862, when Jo\u00e3o de Castro e Moura, who had been a missionary in China, was appointed (d.1868). The see was again vacant until the confirmation of Am\u00e9rico Ferreira dos Santos Silva in 1871. This prelate was obliged to combat the growing Liberalism of his flock and the Protestant propaganda in Porto A popular lawyer named Mesquita started a campaign against him, because the bishop refused to dismiss some priests, reputed reactionary, who served the Aguardente Chapel; getting himself elected judge of the Brotherhood of the Temple, he provoked a great platform agitation with the result that the chapel was secularized and became a school under the patronage of the Marquis of Pombal Association. In 1879 Am\u00e9rico was created cardinal and on his death the present (1911) Bishop, Ant\u00f3nio Barroso, an ex-missionary, was transferred from the [[see of Mylapore]] to that of Porto.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11260a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article]</ref>\n\n===Cathedral===\nThe [[Cathedral of Porto|Porto Cathedral]] was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven.
