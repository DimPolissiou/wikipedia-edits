Hegg]]]]\nOne prominent resident of early Skagway was [[William Moore (steamship captain)|William \"Billy\" Moore]], a former steamboat captain. As a member of an 1887 boundary survey expedition, he had made the first recorded investigation of the pass over the [[Coast Mountains]], which later became known as White Pass. He believed that gold lay in the Klondike because it had been found in similar mountain ranges in [[South America]], [[Mexico]], [[California]], and [[British Columbia]]. In 1887, he and his son, J. Bernard \"Ben\" Moore, claimed a 160-acre (650,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) homestead at the mouth of the [[Skagway River]] in Alaska. Moore settled in this area because he believed it provided the most direct route to the potential [[Gold mining|goldfield]]s. They built a log cabin, a sawmill, and a wharf in anticipation of future gold [[Prospecting|prospectors]] passing through.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe boundary between Canada and the United States along the [[Alaska Panhandle]] was only vaguely defined then (see [[Alaska boundary dispute]]). There were overlapping land claims from the United States' purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 and British claims along the coast. Canada requested a survey after British Columbia united with it in 1871, but the idea was rejected by the United States as being too costly, given the area's remoteness, sparse settlement, and limited economic or strategic interest.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[File:Kirmses advertisement Skagway 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Gold Rush-era advertisements made on one of the mountains forming the eastern wall of the valley]]\nThe [[Klondike gold rush]] changed everything. In 1896, [[gold]] was found in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] region of [[Canada]]'s [[Yukon Territory]]. On July 29, 1897, the steamer [[Queen (steamship)|''Queen'']] docked at Moore's wharf with the first boat load of prospectors. More ships brought thousands of hopeful miners into the new town and prepared for the 500-mile journey to the gold fields in Canada. Moore was overrun by lot jumping prospectors and had his land stolen from him and sold to others.<ref>''Skaguay News'', summer edition, 2008, pg. 16.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n[[File:Cementerio de la fiebre del oro, Skagway, Alaska, Estados Unidos, 2017-08-26, DD 42-44 PAN.jpg|thumb|Gold Rush Cemetery]]\nThe population of the general area increased enormously and reached 30,000, composed largely of American prospectors. Some realized how difficult the trek ahead would be en route to the gold fields, and chose to stay behind to supply goods and services to miners. Within weeks, stores, saloons, and offices lined the muddy streets of Skagway. The population was estimated at 8,000 residents during the spring of 1898 with approximately 1,000 prospective miners passing through town each week. By June 1898, with a population between 8,000 and 10,000, Skagway was the largest city in Alaska.<ref name=\"alaskatrekker\">{{cite web|url=http://alaskatrekker.com/skagway.htm|title=Skagway Alaska|work=Alaska Trekker|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDue to the sudden influx of visitors to Skagway, some town residents began offering miners transportation services to aid them in their journeys to the Yukon, often at highly inflated rates. A group of miners upset with the treatment organized a town council to help protect their interests. But as the members of the council moved north to try their own hands at mining, control of the town reverted to the more unscrupulous, most notably [[Soapy Smith|Jefferson Randolph \"Soapy\" Smith]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Jeff.

Smith was a sophisticated swindler who liked to think of himself as a kind and generous benefactor to the needy. He was gracious to some, giving money to widows and halting lynchings, while simultaneously operating a ring of thieves who swindled prospectors with cards, dice, and the [[shell game]]. His telegraph office charged five dollars to send a message anywhere in the world. Consequently, unknowing prospectors sent news to their families back home without realizing there was no telegraph service to or from Skagway until 1901.<ref>Collier's Weekly, 11/09/1901</ref> Smith also controlled a comprehensive spy network, a private militia called the Skaguay Military Company, the town newspaper, the Deputy U.S. Marshal's office and an array of thieves and [[Confidence trick|con-men]] who roamed about the town. Smith was shot and killed by Frank Reid and Jesse Murphy on July 8, 1898, in the famed [[Shootout on Juneau Wharf]]. Smith managed to return fire&nbsp;\u2014 some accounts claim the two men fired their weapons simultaneously&nbsp;\u2014 and Frank Reid died from his wounds twelve days later.

Others disembarked at nearby [[Dyea, Alaska|Dyea]], northwest of Skagway, and crossed northward on the [[Chilkoot Pass]], an existing Tlingit trade route to reach the lakes. The Dyea route fell out of favor when larger ships began to arrive, as its harbor was too shallow for them except at high tide. Officials in Canada began requiring that each prospector entering Canada on the north side of the White Pass bring with him one [[ton]] (909&nbsp;kg) of supplies, to ensure that he did not starve during the winter. This placed a large burden on the prospectors and the pack animals climbing the steep pass.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1898, a 14-mile, steam-operated [[aerial tramway]] was constructed up the Skagway side of the White Pass, easing the burden of those prospectors who could afford the fee to use it. The [[Chilkoot Trail tramways]] also began to operate in the Chilkoot Pass above Dyea. In 1896, before the Klondike gold rush had begun, a group of investors saw an opportunity for a railroad over that route. It was not until May 1898 that the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] began laying [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow gauge railroad]] tracks in Skagway. The railroad depot was constructed between September and December 1898. This destroyed the viability of Dyea, as Skagway had both the deep-water port and the railroad. Construction of [[McCabe College]], the first school in Alaska to offer a college preparatory high school curriculum, began in 1899. The school was completed in 1900.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nBy 1899, the stream of gold-seekers had diminished and Skagway's economy began to collapse. By 1900, when the railroad was completed, the gold rush was nearly over. In 1900, Skagway was incorporated as the first city in the Alaska Territory. Much of the history of Skagway was saved by early residents such as [[Martin Itjen]], who ran a tour bus around the historical town. He was responsible for saving and maintaining the gold- rush cemetery from complete loss. He purchased Soapy Smith's saloon (Jeff Smith's Parlor) from going the way of the wrecking ball, and placed many early artifacts of the city's early history inside and opened Skagway's first museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/jeffsmithsparlor.htm|title=Jeff.

This allows access to the [[Continental United States|lower 48]], [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], the [[Yukon]], northern [[British Columbia]], and the [[Alaska Highway]]. This also makes Skagway an important port-of-call for the [[Alaska Marine Highway]] &mdash; Alaska's ferry system &mdash; and serves as the northern terminus of the important and heavily used Lynn Canal corridor. (The other Southeast Alaskan communities with road access are [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] and [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]].)\n\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] is a railway that formerly linked [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], [[Yukon]] in Canada to Skagway, the railway's southernmost terminus. Today, trains travel several times a week from May through September from Skagway to the small community of [[Carcross]], approximately 45 miles south/southwest of Whitehorse. There, passengers (mostly tourists) can make connections via bus to Whitehorse.\n\nThe [[Skagway Airport]] receives service from two bush carriers: Alaska Seaplanes, and Air Excursions.\n\n{{see also|List of Airports in the Municipality of Skagway Borough}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Local radio and newspapers===\nSkagway is served by its local semimonthly newspaper, ''[[The Skagway News]],'' as well as regional public radio station [[KHNS]], which has its principal studios in nearby [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] but also has studios and programs based in Skagway.

Hegg]]]]\nOne prominent resident of early Skagway was [[William Moore (steamship captain)|William \"Billy\" Moore]], a former steamboat captain. As a member of an 1887 boundary survey expedition, he had made the first recorded investigation of the pass over the [[Coast Mountains]], which later became known as White Pass. He believed that gold lay in the Klondike because it had been found in similar mountain ranges in [[South America]], [[Mexico]], [[California]], and [[British Columbia]]. In 1887, he and his son, J. Bernard \"Ben\" Moore, claimed a 160-acre (650,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) homestead at the mouth of the [[Skagway River]] in Alaska. Moore settled in this area because he believed it provided the most direct route to the potential [[Gold mining|goldfield]]s. They built a log cabin, a sawmill, and a wharf in anticipation of future gold [[Prospecting|prospectors]] passing through.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe boundary between Canada and the United States along the [[Alaska Panhandle]] was only vaguely defined then (see [[Alaska boundary dispute]]). There were overlapping land claims from the United States' purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 and British claims along the coast. Canada requested a survey after British Columbia united with it in 1871, but the idea was rejected by the United States as being too costly, given the area's remoteness, sparse settlement, and limited economic or strategic interest.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[File:Kirmses advertisement Skagway 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Gold Rush-era advertisements made on one of the mountains forming the eastern wall of the valley]]\nThe [[Klondike gold rush]] changed everything. In 1896, [[gold]] was found in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] region of [[Canada]]'s [[Yukon Territory]]. On July 29, 1897, the steamer [[Queen (steamship)|''Queen'']] docked at Moore's wharf with the first boat load of prospectors. More ships brought thousands of hopeful miners into the new town and prepared for the 500-mile journey to the gold fields in Canada. Moore was overrun by lot jumping prospectors and had his land stolen from him and sold to others.<ref>''Skaguay News'', summer edition, 2008, pg. 16.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n[[File:Cementerio de la fiebre del oro, Skagway, Alaska, Estados Unidos, 2017-08-26, DD 42-44 PAN.jpg|thumb|Gold Rush Cemetery]]\nThe population of the general area increased enormously and reached 30,000, composed largely of American prospectors. Some realized how difficult the trek ahead would be en route to the gold fields, and chose to stay behind to supply goods and services to miners. Within weeks, stores, saloons, and offices lined the muddy streets of Skagway. The population was estimated at 8,000 residents during the spring of 1898 with approximately 1,000 prospective miners passing through town each week. By June 1898, with a population between 8,000 and 10,000, Skagway was the largest city in Alaska.<ref name=\"alaskatrekker\">{{cite web|url=http://alaskatrekker.com/skagway.htm|title=Skagway Alaska|work=Alaska Trekker|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDue to the sudden influx of visitors to Skagway, some town residents began offering miners transportation services to aid them in their journeys to the Yukon, often at highly inflated rates. A group of miners upset with the treatment organized a town council to help protect their interests. But as the members of the council moved north to try their own hands at mining, control of the town reverted to the more unscrupulous, most notably [[Soapy Smith|Jefferson Randolph \"Soapy\" Smith]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Jeff.

Smith was a sophisticated swindler who liked to think of himself as a kind and generous benefactor to the needy. He was gracious to some, giving money to widows and halting lynchings, while simultaneously operating a ring of thieves who swindled prospectors with cards, dice, and the [[shell game]]. His telegraph office charged five dollars to send a message anywhere in the world. Consequently, unknowing prospectors sent news to their families back home without realizing there was no telegraph service to or from Skagway until 1901.<ref>Collier's Weekly, 11/09/1901</ref> Smith also controlled a comprehensive spy network, a private militia called the Skaguay Military Company, the town newspaper, the Deputy U.S. Marshal's office and an array of thieves and [[Confidence trick|con-men]] who roamed about the town. Smith was shot and killed by Frank Reid and Jesse Murphy on July 8, 1898, in the famed [[Shootout on Juneau Wharf]]. Smith managed to return fire&nbsp;\u2014 some accounts claim the two men fired their weapons simultaneously&nbsp;\u2014 and Frank Reid died from his wounds twelve days later. Jesse Murphy is accredited as the man responsible for killing Smith.<ref>Smith, Jeff, ''Alias Soapy Smith: The Life and Death of a Scoundrel'', Juneau, Alaska: Klondike Research, 2009; {{ISBN|0-9819743-0-9}}</ref>\n\nSmith and Reid are now interred at the Klondike Gold Rush Cemetery, also known as \"Skagway's [[Boot Hill]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southeasttours.com/skagway_sightseeing_tours_yukon_skagway_alaska_tour_info.php|title=Skagway Spectacular Sightseeing Tours, Skagway Tours, Skagway Alaska Tours, Skagway Tour, Skagway Train Ride, White Pass, White Pass Railroad Train Ride, AK|work=southeasttours.com|accessdate=July 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908074259/http://www.southeasttours.com/skagway_sightseeing_tours_yukon_skagway_alaska_tour_info.php|archive-date=September 8, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe prospectors' journey began for many when they climbed the mountains over the [[White Pass]] above Skagway and onward across the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]] to [[Bennett Lake]], or one of its neighboring lakes, where they built barges and floated down the [[Yukon River]] to the gold fields around [[Dawson City]]. Others disembarked at nearby [[Dyea, Alaska|Dyea]], northwest of Skagway, and crossed northward on the [[Chilkoot Pass]], an existing Tlingit trade route to reach the lakes. The Dyea route fell out of favor when larger ships began to arrive, as its harbor was too shallow for them except at high tide. Officials in Canada began requiring that each prospector entering Canada on the north side of the White Pass bring with him one [[ton]] (909&nbsp;kg) of supplies, to ensure that he did not starve during the winter. This placed a large burden on the prospectors and the pack animals climbing the steep pass.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1898, a 14-mile, steam-operated [[aerial tramway]] was constructed up the Skagway side of the White Pass, easing the burden of those prospectors who could afford the fee to use it. The [[Chilkoot Trail tramways]] also began to operate in the Chilkoot Pass above Dyea. In 1896, before the Klondike gold rush had begun, a group of investors saw an opportunity for a railroad over that route. It was not until May 1898 that the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] began laying [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow gauge railroad]] tracks in Skagway. The railroad depot was constructed between September and December 1898. This destroyed the viability of Dyea, as Skagway had both the deep-water port and the railroad. Construction of [[McCabe College]], the first school in Alaska to offer a college preparatory high school curriculum, began in 1899. The school was completed in 1900.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nBy 1899, the stream of gold-seekers had diminished and Skagway's economy began to collapse. By 1900, when the railroad was completed, the gold rush was nearly over. In 1900, Skagway was incorporated as the first city in the Alaska Territory. Much of the history of Skagway was saved by early residents such as [[Martin Itjen]], who ran a tour bus around the historical town. He was responsible for saving and maintaining the gold- rush cemetery from complete loss. He purchased Soapy Smith's saloon (Jeff Smith's Parlor) from going the way of the wrecking ball, and placed many early artifacts of the city's early history inside and opened Skagway's first museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/jeffsmithsparlor.htm|title=Jeff.

This allows access to the [[Continental United States|lower 48]], [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], the [[Yukon]], northern [[British Columbia]], and the [[Alaska Highway]]. This also makes Skagway an important port-of-call for the [[Alaska Marine Highway]] &mdash; Alaska's ferry system &mdash; and serves as the northern terminus of the important and heavily used Lynn Canal corridor. (The other Southeast Alaskan communities with road access are [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] and [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]].)\n\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] is a railway that formerly linked [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], [[Yukon]] in Canada to Skagway, the railway's southernmost terminus. Today, trains travel several times a week from May through September from Skagway to the small community of [[Carcross]], approximately 45 miles south/southwest of Whitehorse. There, passengers (mostly tourists) can make connections via bus to Whitehorse.\n\nThe [[Skagway Airport]] receives service from two bush carriers: Alaska Seaplanes, and Air Excursions.\n\n{{see also|List of Airports in the Municipality of Skagway Borough}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Local radio and newspapers===\nSkagway is served by its local semimonthly newspaper, ''[[The Skagway News]],'' as well as regional public radio station [[KHNS]], which has its principal studios in nearby [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] but also has studios and programs based in Skagway.

Since X-rays penetrate most objects, there is no need to specially prepare them for X-ray microscopy observations.\n\nUnlike visible [[light]], X-rays do not reflect or refract easily, and they are invisible to the human eye. Therefore, an X-ray microscope exposes film or uses a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) detector to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. It is a contrast imaging technology using the difference in absorption of soft X-rays in the [[water window]] region (wavelengths: 2.34-4.4&nbsp;nm, energies: 280-530&nbsp;eV) by the carbon atom (main element composing the living cell) and the oxygen atom (main element for water).\n\n[[Microfocus X-ray]] also achieves high magnification by projection. A microfocus X-ray tube produces X-rays from an extremely small focal spot (5&nbsp;\u00b5m down to 0.1&nbsp;\u00b5m). The X-rays are in the more conventional X-ray range (20 to 300 kV), and they are not re-focused.\n\n== Invention and Development ==\nThe history of X-ray microscopy can be traced back to the early 20th century. After the German physicist [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen|R\u00f6ntgen]] discovered X-rays in 1895, scientists soon illuminated an object using an X-ray point source and captured the shadow images of the object with a resolution of several microns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Malsch|first=Friedrich|date=1939-12-01|title=Erzeugung stark vergr\u00f6\u00dferter R\u00f6ntgen-Schattenbilder|journal=Naturwissenschaften|language=de|volume=27|issue=51|pages=854\u2013855|doi=10.1007/BF01489432|bibcode=1939NW.....27..854M|issn=1432-1904}}</ref> In 1918, Einstein pointed out that the [[refractive index]] for X rays in most mediums should be just slightly less than 1,<ref>{{Citation|last=Senn|first=E.|chapter=Grunds\u00e4tzliche \u00dcberlegungen zur physikalischen Diagnostik und Therapie von Muskelschmerzen|date=1989|pages=668\u2013674|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540514374|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-83864-4_129|title=Verhandlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Innere Medizin|volume=95}}</ref> which means refractive optical parts would be difficult to use for X-ray applications.\n\nEarly X-ray microscopes by [[Paul Kirkpatrick]] and [[Albert Baez]] used [[angle of incidence (optics)|grazing incidence]] reflective [[X-ray optics]] to focus the X-rays, which grazed X-rays off [[parabolic reflector|parabolic]] curved mirrors at a very high [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. An alternative method of focusing X-rays is to use a tiny [[Fresnel]] [[zone plate]] of concentric gold or nickel rings on a [[silicon dioxide]] substrate. Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]] produced some of the first usable X-ray images with his apparatus in the late 1940s.\n[[File:Hohlraum irradiation on NOVA laser.jpg|thumb|right|Indirect drive laser [[inertial confinement fusion]] uses a \"hohlraum\" which is irradiated with laser beam cones from either side on its inner surface to bathe a fusion microcapsule inside with smooth high intensity X-rays. The highest energy X-rays which penetrate the hohlraum can be visualized using an X-ray microscope such as here, where X-radiation is represented in orange/red.]]\n\nIn the 1950s [[Sterling Newberry]] produced a shadow X-ray microscope which placed the specimen between the source and a target plate, this became the basis for the first commercial X-ray microscopes from the [[General Electric Company]].\n\nAfter a silent period in the 1960s, X-ray microscopy regained people's attention in the 1970s.

However, as new synchrotron source-based microscopes were built in many groups, people realized that it was difficult to perform such experiments due to insufficient technological capabilities at that time, such as poor coherent illuminations, poor quality x-ray optical elements, and user-unfriendly light sources.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kirz|first=J|last2=Jacobsen|first2=C|date=2009-09-01|title=The history and future of X-ray microscopy|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume=186|issue=1|pages=012001|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/186/1/012001|issn=1742-6596|bibcode=2009JPhCS.186a2001K}}</ref>\n\nEntering the 1990s, new instruments and new light-sources greatly fueled the improvement of X-ray microscopy. Microscopy methods including tomography, cryo, and cryo-tomography were successfully demonstrated. With rapid development, X-ray microscopy found new applications in soil science, geochemistry, polymer sciences, and magnetism. The hardware was also miniaturized so that researchers could perform experiments in their own laboratories.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nExtremely high intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays for X-ray phase-contrast microscopy, from a focal spot about 10&nbsp;um x 10&nbsp;um, may be obtained with a non-synchrotron X-ray source which uses a focused electron beam and a liquid metal anode.

XM-1 uses an X-ray lens to focus X-rays on a CCD, in a manner similar to an optical microscope. XM-1 held the world record in spatial resolution with Fresnel zone plates down to 15&nbsp;nm and is able to combine high spatial resolution with a sub-100ps time resolution to study e.g. ultrafast spin dynamics. In July 2012, a group at [[DESY]] claimed a record spatial resolution of 10&nbsp;nm, by using the hard X-ray scanning microscope at PETRA III.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120628180429/http://hasylab.desy.de/news__events/announcements/coherent_x_ray_scanning_microscopy_at_petra_iii_reached_10_nm_resolution_june_2012/index_eng.html Coherent X-Ray scanning microscopy at PETRA III reached 10 nm resolution (June 2012)]. Hasylab.desy.de. Retrieved on 2015-12-14.</ref>\n\nThe ALS is also home to the world's first soft x-ray microscope designed for biological and biomedical research. This new instrument, XM-2 was designed and built by scientists from the National Center for X-ray Tomography. XM-2 is capable of producing 3-dimensional [[X-ray microtomography|tomograms]] of cells.\n\n=== Liquid metal anode X-ray source ===\n\nExtremely high intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays (gallium K-alpha line) for X-ray phase-contrast microscopy, from a focal spot about 10&nbsp;um x 10&nbsp;um, may be obtained with an X-ray source which uses a liquid metal [[galinstan]] anode. This was demonstratred in 2003.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/> The metal flows from a nozzle downward at a high rate of speed and the high intensity electron source is focused upon it. The rapid flow of metal carries current, but the physical flow prevents a great deal of anode heating (due to forced-convective heat removal), and the high boiling point of galinstan inhibits vaporization of the anode. The technique has been used to image mouse brain in three dimensions at a voxel size of about one cubic micrometer.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/srep42847|pmid = 28240235|pmc = 5327439|bibcode = 2017NatSR...742847T|title = Three-dimensional mouse brain cytoarchitecture revealed by laboratory-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography|year = 2017|last1 = T\u00f6pperwien|first1 = Mareike|last2 = Krenkel|first2 = Martin|last3 = Vincenz|first3 = Daniel|last4 = St\u00f6ber|first4 = Franziska|last5 = Oelschlegel|first5 = Anja M.|last6 = Goldschmidt|first6 = J\u00fcrgen|last7 = Salditt|first7 = Tim|journal = Scientific Reports|volume = 7|pages = 42847}}</ref>\n\n=== Detection devices ===\n{{Main|X-ray detector}}\n\n==Scanning Transmission==\nSources of soft X-rays suitable for microscopy, such as [[synchrotron]] radiation sources, have fairly low brightness of the required wavelengths, so an alternative method of image formation is scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy. Here the X-rays are focused to a point and the sample is mechanically scanned through the produced focal spot. At each point the transmitted X-rays are recorded using a detector such as a [[proportional counter]] or an [[avalanche photodiode]]. This type of Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope (STXM) was first developed by researchers at Stony Brook University and was employed at the [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].\n\n==Resolution==\nThe resolution of X-ray microscopy lies between that of the optical microscope and the [[electron microscope]]. It has an advantage over conventional electron microscopy in that it can view biological samples in their natural state. Electron microscopy is widely used to obtain images with nanometer to sub-Angstrom level resolution but the relatively thick living cell cannot be observed as the sample has to be chemically fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, then sliced ultra thin. However, it should be mentioned that [[cryo-electron microscopy]] allows the observation of biological specimens in their hydrated natural state, albeit embedded in water ice. Until now, resolutions of 30 nanometer are possible using the Fresnel zone plate lens which forms the image using the soft x-rays emitted from a synchrotron. Recently, the use of soft x-rays emitted from laser-produced plasmas rather than synchrotron radiation is becoming more popular.\n\n==Analysis==\nAdditionally, X-rays cause [[fluorescence]] in most materials, and these emissions can be analyzed to determine the [[chemical element]]s of an imaged object. Another use is to generate [[diffraction]] patterns, a process used in [[X-ray crystallography]]. By analyzing the internal reflections of a diffraction pattern (usually with a computer program), the three-dimensional structure of a [[crystal]] can be determined down to the placement of individual atoms within its molecules. X-ray microscopes are sometimes used for these analyses because the samples are too small to be analyzed in any other way.\n\n== Biological Applications ==\nOne early applications of X-ray microscopy in biology was contact imaging, pioneered by [[P Goby|Goby]] in 1913. In this technique, [[Soft X-rays|soft x-rays]] irradiate a specimen and expose the x-ray sensitive emulsions beneath it. Then, magnified tomographic images of the emulsions, which correspond to the x-ray opacity maps of the specimen, are recorded using a light microscope or an electron microscope. A unique advantage that X-ray contact imaging offered over electron microscopy was the ability to image wet biological materials. Thus, it was used to study the micro and nanoscale structures of plants, insects, and human cells. However, several factors, including emulsion distortions, poor illumination conditions, and low resolutions of ways to examine the emulsions, limit the resolution of contacting imaging. Electron damage of the emulsions and diffraction effects can also result in artifacts in the final images.<ref>{{Cite book|title=X-ray Microscopy : Instrumentation and Biological Applications|last=Cheng, Ping-chin.|date=1987|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|others=Jan, Gwo-jen.|isbn=9783642728815|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851741568}}</ref>\n\nX-ray microscopy has its unique advantages in terms of nanoscale resolution and high penetration ability, both of which are needed in biological studies.

Since X-rays penetrate most objects, there is no need to specially prepare them for X-ray microscopy observations.\n\nUnlike visible [[light]], X-rays do not reflect or refract easily, and they are invisible to the human eye. Therefore, an X-ray microscope exposes film or uses a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) detector to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. It is a contrast imaging technology using the difference in absorption of soft X-rays in the [[water window]] region (wavelengths: 2.34-4.4&nbsp;nm, energies: 280-530&nbsp;eV) by the carbon atom (main element composing the living cell) and the oxygen atom (main element for water).\n\n[[Microfocus X-ray]] also achieves high magnification by projection. A microfocus X-ray tube produces X-rays from an extremely small focal spot (5&nbsp;\u00b5m down to 0.1&nbsp;\u00b5m). The X-rays are in the more conventional X-ray range (20 to 300 kV), and they are not re-focused.\n\n== Invention and Development ==\nThe history of X-ray microscopy can be traced back to the early 20th century. After the German physicist [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen|R\u00f6ntgen]] discovered X-rays in 1895, scientists soon illuminated an object using an X-ray point source and captured the shadow images of the object with a resolution of several microns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Malsch|first=Friedrich|date=1939-12-01|title=Erzeugung stark vergr\u00f6\u00dferter R\u00f6ntgen-Schattenbilder|journal=Naturwissenschaften|language=de|volume=27|issue=51|pages=854\u2013855|doi=10.1007/BF01489432|bibcode=1939NW.....27..854M|issn=1432-1904}}</ref> In 1918, Einstein pointed out that the [[refractive index]] for X rays in most mediums should be just slightly less than 1,<ref>{{Citation|last=Senn|first=E.|chapter=Grunds\u00e4tzliche \u00dcberlegungen zur physikalischen Diagnostik und Therapie von Muskelschmerzen|date=1989|pages=668\u2013674|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540514374|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-83864-4_129|title=Verhandlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Innere Medizin|volume=95}}</ref> which means refractive optical parts would be difficult to use for X-ray applications.\n\nEarly X-ray microscopes by [[Paul Kirkpatrick]] and [[Albert Baez]] used [[angle of incidence (optics)|grazing incidence]] reflective [[X-ray optics]] to focus the X-rays, which grazed X-rays off [[parabolic reflector|parabolic]] curved mirrors at a very high [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. An alternative method of focusing X-rays is to use a tiny [[Fresnel]] [[zone plate]] of concentric gold or nickel rings on a [[silicon dioxide]] substrate. Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]] produced some of the first usable X-ray images with his apparatus in the late 1940s.\n[[File:Hohlraum irradiation on NOVA laser.jpg|thumb|right|Indirect drive laser [[inertial confinement fusion]] uses a \"hohlraum\" which is irradiated with laser beam cones from either side on its inner surface to bathe a fusion microcapsule inside with smooth high intensity X-rays. The highest energy X-rays which penetrate the hohlraum can be visualized using an X-ray microscope such as here, where X-radiation is represented in orange/red.]]\n\nIn the 1950s [[Sterling Newberry]] produced a shadow X-ray microscope which placed the specimen between the source and a target plate, this became the basis for the first commercial X-ray microscopes from the [[General Electric Company]].\n\nAfter a silent period in the 1960s, X-ray microscopy regained people's attention in the 1970s.

Microscopy methods including tomography, cryo, and cryo-tomography were successfully demonstrated. With rapid development, X-ray microscopy found new applications in soil science, geochemistry, polymer sciences, and magnetism.

XM-1 uses an X-ray lens to focus X-rays on a CCD, in a manner similar to an optical microscope. XM-1 held the world record in spatial resolution with Fresnel zone plates down to 15&nbsp;nm and is able to combine high spatial resolution with a sub-100ps time resolution to study e.g. ultrafast spin dynamics. In July 2012, a group at [[DESY]] claimed a record spatial resolution of 10&nbsp;nm, by using the hard X-ray scanning microscope at PETRA III.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120628180429/http://hasylab.desy.de/news__events/announcements/coherent_x_ray_scanning_microscopy_at_petra_iii_reached_10_nm_resolution_june_2012/index_eng.html Coherent X-Ray scanning microscopy at PETRA III reached 10 nm resolution (June 2012)].

This new instrument, XM-2 was designed and built by scientists from the National Center for X-ray Tomography. XM-2 is capable of producing 3-dimensional [[X-ray microtomography|tomograms]] of cells.\n\n=== Liquid metal anode X-ray source ===\n\nExtremely high intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays (gallium K-alpha line) for X-ray phase-contrast microscopy, from a focal spot about 10&nbsp;um x 10&nbsp;um, may be obtained with an X-ray source which uses a liquid metal [[galinstan]] anode. This was demonstratred in 2003.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/> The metal flows from a nozzle downward at a high rate of speed and the high intensity electron source is focused upon it. The rapid flow of metal carries current, but the physical flow prevents a great deal of anode heating (due to forced-convective heat removal), and the high boiling point of galinstan inhibits vaporization of the anode. The technique has been used to image mouse brain in three dimensions at a voxel size of about one cubic micrometer.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/srep42847|pmid = 28240235|pmc = 5327439|bibcode = 2017NatSR...742847T|title = Three-dimensional mouse brain cytoarchitecture revealed by laboratory-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography|year = 2017|last1 = T\u00f6pperwien|first1 = Mareike|last2 = Krenkel|first2 = Martin|last3 = Vincenz|first3 = Daniel|last4 = St\u00f6ber|first4 = Franziska|last5 = Oelschlegel|first5 = Anja M.|last6 = Goldschmidt|first6 = J\u00fcrgen|last7 = Salditt|first7 = Tim|journal = Scientific Reports|volume = 7|pages = 42847}}</ref>\n\n=== Detection devices ===\n{{Main|X-ray detector}}\n\n==Scanning Transmission==\nSources of soft X-rays suitable for microscopy, such as [[synchrotron]] radiation sources, have fairly low brightness of the required wavelengths, so an alternative method of image formation is scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy. Here the X-rays are focused to a point and the sample is mechanically scanned through the produced focal spot. At each point the transmitted X-rays are recorded using a detector such as a [[proportional counter]] or an [[avalanche photodiode]]. This type of Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope (STXM) was first developed by researchers at Stony Brook University and was employed at the [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].\n\n==Resolution==\nThe resolution of X-ray microscopy lies between that of the optical microscope and the [[electron microscope]]. It has an advantage over conventional electron microscopy in that it can view biological samples in their natural state. Electron microscopy is widely used to obtain images with nanometer to sub-Angstrom level resolution but the relatively thick living cell cannot be observed as the sample has to be chemically fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, then sliced ultra thin. However, it should be mentioned that [[cryo-electron microscopy]] allows the observation of biological specimens in their hydrated natural state, albeit embedded in water ice. Until now, resolutions of 30 nanometer are possible using the Fresnel zone plate lens which forms the image using the soft x-rays emitted from a synchrotron. Recently, the use of soft x-rays emitted from laser-produced plasmas rather than synchrotron radiation is becoming more popular.\n\n==Analysis==\nAdditionally, X-rays cause [[fluorescence]] in most materials, and these emissions can be analyzed to determine the [[chemical element]]s of an imaged object. Another use is to generate [[diffraction]] patterns, a process used in [[X-ray crystallography]]. By analyzing the internal reflections of a diffraction pattern (usually with a computer program), the three-dimensional structure of a [[crystal]] can be determined down to the placement of individual atoms within its molecules. X-ray microscopes are sometimes used for these analyses because the samples are too small to be analyzed in any other way.\n\n== Biological Applications ==\nOne early applications of X-ray microscopy in biology was contact imaging, pioneered by [[P Goby|Goby]] in 1913. In this technique, [[Soft X-rays|soft x-rays]] irradiate a specimen and expose the x-ray sensitive emulsions beneath it. Then, magnified tomographic images of the emulsions, which correspond to the x-ray opacity maps of the specimen, are recorded using a light microscope or an electron microscope. A unique advantage that X-ray contact imaging offered over electron microscopy was the ability to image wet biological materials. Thus, it was used to study the micro and nanoscale structures of plants, insects, and human cells. However, several factors, including emulsion distortions, poor illumination conditions, and low resolutions of ways to examine the emulsions, limit the resolution of contacting imaging. Electron damage of the emulsions and diffraction effects can also result in artifacts in the final images.<ref>{{Cite book|title=X-ray Microscopy : Instrumentation and Biological Applications|last=Cheng, Ping-chin.|date=1987|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|others=Jan, Gwo-jen.|isbn=9783642728815|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851741568}}</ref>\n\nX-ray microscopy has its unique advantages in terms of nanoscale resolution and high penetration ability, both of which are needed in biological studies.

The Father is a veteran and Aleksei attends military school to study medicine. They have lived alone for years in their own private world. Sometimes they seem like brothers. Sometimes even like lovers. Despite knowing that all sons must one day live their own lives, Aleksei is conflicted. The father knows he should accept a better job in another city, perhaps search for a new wife.\n\nThe film begins by showing The Father comforting his son Aleksei, who just has a nightmare. Following in his father's path, Aleksei attends military school. He likes sports, tends to be irresponsible and has problems with his girlfriend, who is jealous of Aleksei's close relationship with his father. Eventually she breaks up with him. During the weekend, Fyodor comes visiting the Father, who served with his own father in the army, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the latter. Fyodor revealed to Aleksei that he also visited the previous night, but The Father did not tell Aleksei about it.

The Father is a veteran and Aleksei attends military school to study medicine. They have lived alone for years in their own private world. Sometimes they seem like brothers. Sometimes even like lovers. Despite knowing that all sons must one day live their own lives, Aleksei is conflicted. The father knows he should accept a better job in another city, perhaps search for a new wife.\n\nThe film begins by showing The Father comforting his son Aleksei, who just has a nightmare. Following in his father's path, Aleksei attends military school. He likes sports, tends to be irresponsible and has problems with his girlfriend, who is jealous of Aleksei's close relationship with his father. Eventually she breaks up with him. During the weekend, Fyodor comes visiting the Father, who served with his own father in the army, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the latter. Fyodor revealed to Aleksei that he also visited the previous night, but The Father did not tell Aleksei about it. Aleksei showed Fyodor around the city and went for a tram ride, and Fyodor decides to go to the train station alone and parts with Aleksei. Afterward, Aleksei goes visiting his ex-girlfriend at her place, telling her that he had a dream about them having a baby together.

Other signals (such as sound or vibration) can be converted to voltages and displayed.\n\nOscilloscopes display the change of an electrical signal over time, with voltage and time as the Y- and X-axes, respectively, on a calibrated scale. The [[waveform]] can then be analyzed for properties such as [[amplitude]], [[frequency]], [[rise time]], time interval, [[distortion]], and others. Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly. Originally, calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument.<ref name=Kul03>{{Citation\n |last= Kularatna\n |first= Nihal\n |title= Digital and Analogue Instrumentation: Testing and Measurement\n |chapter= Fundamentals of Oscilloscopes <!-- chapter 5 -->\n |pages= 165\u2013208\n |publisher= Institution of Engineering and Technology\n |year= 2003\n |isbn= 978-0-85296-999-1\n |doi= }}</ref>\n\nThe oscilloscope can be adjusted so that repetitive signals can be observed as a continuous shape on the screen. A storage oscilloscope can capture a single event and display it continuously, so the user can observe events that would otherwise appear too briefly to see directly.\n\nOscilloscopes are used in the sciences, medicine, engineering, automotive and the telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an [[electrocardiogram]].\n\nEarly oscilloscopes used [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) as their display element (hence they were commonly referred to as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal processing. Storage oscilloscopes used special storage CRTs to maintain a steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with [[thin panel display]]s, fast [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and [[digital signal processors]]. DSOs without integrated displays (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose [[digital computer]] to process and display waveforms.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Oscilloscope history}}\nThe [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube was known in 1897, and in 1899 [[Jonathan Zenneck]] equipped it with beam-forming plates and a magnetic field for sweeping the trace.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marton |first1=L. |title=Advances in electronics and electron physics |chapter=Ferdinand Braun: Forgotten Forefather |volume=50 |publisher=Academic Press |year=1980 |page=252 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27c1WOjCBX4C&lpg=PA252&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-12-014650-5 |editor-last=Suesskind |editor-first=Charles |quote=occurs first in a pair of later papers by Zenneck (1899a,b) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503063825/http://books.google.com/books?id=27c1WOjCBX4C&lpg=PA252&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false |archivedate=2014-05-03 }}</ref> Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements as early as the 1920s, but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters. [[Vladimir K. Zworykin|V.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Zworykin]] described a permanently sealed, high-vacuum cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and reproducible component allowed [[General Radio]] to manufacture an oscilloscope that was usable outside a laboratory setting.<ref name=Kul03/>\nAfter [[World War&nbsp;II]] surplus electronic parts became the basis of revival of [[Heathkit#Founding|Heathkit Corporation]], and a $50 oscilloscope kit made from such parts was a first market success.\n\n==Features and uses==\n[[Image:WTPC Oscilloscope-1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Basic Oscilloscope Front Panel Image.|Basic oscilloscope]]\n\n===Description===\nThe basic oscilloscope, as shown in the illustration, is typically divided into four sections: the display, vertical controls, horizontal controls and trigger controls. The display is usually a [[Cathode Ray Tube|CRT]] (historically) or [[LCD]] panel laid out with horizontal and vertical reference lines called the ''graticule''. [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays also have controls for focus, intensity, and beam finder.\n\nThe vertical section controls the amplitude of the displayed signal. This section has a volts-per-division (Volts/Div) selector knob, an AC/DC/Ground selector switch, and the vertical (primary) input for the instrument. Additionally, this section is typically equipped with the vertical beam position knob.\n\nThe horizontal section controls the time base or \"sweep\" of the instrument. The primary control is the Seconds-per-Division (Sec/Div) selector switch. Also included is a horizontal input for plotting dual X-Y axis signals. The horizontal beam position knob is generally located in this section.\n\nThe trigger section controls the start event of the sweep. The trigger can be set to automatically restart after each sweep, or can be configured to respond to an internal or external event. The principal controls of this section are the source and coupling selector switches, and an external trigger input (EXT Input) and level adjustment.\n\nIn addition to the basic instrument, most oscilloscopes are supplied with a probe as shown. The probe connects to any input on the instrument and typically has a resistor of ten times the oscilloscope's input impedance. This results in a .1&nbsp;(\u201110X) attenuation factor; this helps to isolate the capacitive load presented by the probe cable from the signal being measured. Some probes have a switch allowing the operator to bypass the resistor when appropriate.<ref name=Kul03/>\n\n====Size and portability====\nMost modern oscilloscopes are lightweight, portable instruments compact enough for a single person to carry. In addition to portable units, the market offers a number of miniature battery-powered instruments for field service applications. Laboratory grade oscilloscopes, especially older units that use [[vacuum tube]]s, are generally bench-top devices or are mounted on dedicated carts. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be [[rack-mounted]] or permanently mounted into a custom instrument housing.\n\n====Inputs====\nThe signal to be measured is fed to one of the input connectors, which is usually a coaxial connector such as a [[BNC connector|BNC]] or [[UHF connector|UHF type]]. [[Binding post]]s or [[banana plug]]s may be used for lower frequencies.\nIf the signal source has its own coaxial connector, then a simple [[coaxial cable]] is used; otherwise, a specialized cable called a \"[[Test probe|scope probe]]\", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an open wire test lead for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.\nGeneral-purpose oscilloscopes usually present an input impedance of 1 [[Ohm|megohm]] in parallel with a small but known capacitance such as 20 picofarads.<ref>The 20 picofarad value is typical for scope bandwidths around 100&nbsp;MHz; for example, a 200&nbsp;MHz Tektronix 7A26 input impedance is 1M and 22 pF. ({{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1983|p=271}}; see also {{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1998|p=503}}, \"typical high Z 10X passive probe model\".) Lower bandwidth scopes used higher capacitances; the 1&nbsp;MHz Tektronix 7A22 input impedance is 1M and 47 pF. {{Harv|Tektronix|1983|pp=272\u2013273}} Higher bandwidth scopes use smaller capacitances. The 500&nbsp;MHz Tektronix TDS510A input impedance is 1M and 10 pF. {{Harv|Tektronix|1998|p=78}}</ref> This allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes.<ref>Probes are designed for a specific input impedance. They have compensation adjustments with a limited range, so they often cannot be used on different input impedances.</ref> Scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50\u2011ohm inputs. These must be either connected directly to a 50\u2011ohm signal source or used with Z<sub>0</sub> or active probes.\n\nLess-frequently-used inputs include one (or two) for triggering the sweep, horizontal deflection for X\u2011Y mode displays, and trace brightening/darkening, sometimes called ''z'\u2011axis inputs.\n\n====Probes====\n{{Main|Test probe#Oscilloscope probes}}\n\nOpen wire test leads (flying leads) are likely to pick up interference, so they are not suitable for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded cable (i.e.,&nbsp;coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50&nbsp;ohm cable has about 90&nbsp;pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe loads a circuit with a capacitance of about 110&nbsp;pF and a resistance of 1&nbsp;megohm.\n\nTo minimize loading, attenuator probes (e.g.,&nbsp;10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9&nbsp;megohm series resistor shunted by a low-value capacitor to make an RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9&nbsp;megohm series resistor is shunted by a 12.2&nbsp;pF capacitor for a time constant of 110&nbsp;microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90&nbsp;pF in parallel with the scope input of 20&nbsp;pF and 1&nbsp;megohm (total capacitance 110&nbsp;pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, there is an adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of ''R'' is much less than the reactance of ''C''), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Wedlock|Roberge|1969}}</ref>\n\nThe result is a frequency compensated probe for modest frequencies. It presents a load of about 10&nbsp;megohms shunted by 12&nbsp;pF. Such a probe is an improvement, but does not work well when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit times or less (transit time is typically 5&nbsp;ns).{{clarify|date=January 2019}} In that time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and reflections from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe causes ringing.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kobbe|Polits|1959}}</ref> The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are other adjustments for completing the compensation.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1983|p=426}}; Tek claims 300&nbsp;MHz resistive coax at 30&nbsp;pF per meter; schematic has 5 adjustments.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Zeidlhack|White|1970}}</ref>\n\nProbes with 10:1 attenuation are by far the most common; for large signals (and slightly-less capacitive loading), 100:1 probes may be used. There are also probes that contain switches to select 10:1 or direct (1:1) ratios, but the latter setting has significant capacitance (tens of pF) at the probe tip, because the whole cable's capacitance is then directly connected.\n\nMost oscilloscopes provide for probe attenuation factors, displaying the effective sensitivity at the probe tip. Historically, some auto-sensing circuitry used indicator lamps behind translucent windows in the panel to illuminate different parts of the sensitivity scale. To do so, the probe connectors (modified BNCs) had an extra contact to define the probe's attenuation. (A certain value of resistor, connected to ground, \"encodes\" the attenuation.) Because probes wear out, and because the auto-sensing circuitry is not compatible between different oscilloscope makes, auto-sensing probe scaling is not foolproof. Likewise, manually setting the probe attenuation is prone to user error. Setting the probe scaling incorrectly is a common error, and throws the reading off by a factor of 10.\n\nSpecial [[high voltage probe]]s form compensated attenuators with the oscilloscope input. These have a large probe body, and some require partly filling a canister surrounding the series resistor with volatile liquid fluorocarbon to displace air. The oscilloscope end has a box with several waveform-trimming adjustments. For safety, a barrier disc keeps the user's fingers away from the point being examined. Maximum voltage is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition, until the probe tip is in contact. Until then, a tiny arc charges the probe tip, and its capacitance holds the voltage (open circuit). As the voltage continues to climb, another tiny arc charges the tip further.)\n\nThere are also current probes, with cores that surround the conductor carrying current to be examined. One type has a hole for the conductor, and requires that the wire be passed through the hole for semi-permanent or permanent mounting. However, other types, used for temporary testing, have a two-part core that can be clamped around a wire. Inside the probe, a coil wound around the core provides a current into an appropriate load, and the voltage across that load is proportional to current. This type of probe only senses AC.\n\nA more-sophisticated probe includes a magnetic flux sensor ([[Hall effect]] sensor) in the magnetic circuit. The probe connects to an amplifier, which feeds (low frequency) current into the coil to cancel the sensed field; the magnitude of the current provides the low-frequency part of the current waveform, right down to DC. The coil still picks up high frequencies. There is a combining network akin to a loudspeaker crossover .\n\n===Front panel controls===\n\n====Focus control====\nThis control adjusts CRT focus to obtain the sharpest, most-detailed trace. In practice, focus must be adjusted slightly when observing very different signals, so it must be an external control. The control varies the voltage applied to a focusing anode within the CRT. Flat-panel displays do not need this control.\n\n====Intensity control====\nThis adjusts trace brightness. Slow traces on CRT oscilloscopes need less, and fast ones, especially if not often repeated, require more brightness. On flat panels, however, trace brightness is essentially independent of sweep speed, because the internal signal processing effectively synthesizes the display from the digitized data.\n\n====Astigmatism====\nThis control may instead be called \"shape\" or \"spot shape\". It adjusts the voltage on the last CRT anode (immediately next to the Y deflection plates). For a circular spot, the final anode must be at the same potential as both of the Y-plates (for a centred spot the Y-plate voltages must be the same). If the anode is made more positive, the spot becomes elliptical in the X-plane as the more negative Y-plates will repel the beam. If the anode is made more negative, the spot becomes elliptical in the Y-plane as the more positive Y-plates will attract the beam. This control may be absent from simpler oscilloscope designs or may even be an internal control. It is not necessary with flat panel displays.\n\n====Beam finder====\nModern oscilloscopes have direct-coupled deflection amplifiers, which means the trace could be deflected off-screen. They also might have their beam blanked without the operator knowing it. To help in restoring a visible display, the beam finder circuit overrides any blanking and limits the beam deflected to the visible portion of the screen. Beam-finder circuits often distort the trace while activated.\n\n====Graticule====\nThe graticule is a grid of lines that serve as reference marks for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1&nbsp;cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2&nbsp;mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. One expects to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.\n\nOn old and lower-cost CRT oscilloscopes the graticule is a sheet of plastic, often with light-diffusing markings and concealed lamps at the edge of the graticule. The lamps had a brightness control. Higher-cost instruments have the graticule marked on the inside face of the CRT, to eliminate [[parallax error]]s; better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings. (Diffusing markings appear bright.) Digital oscilloscopes, however, generate the graticule markings on the display in the same way as the trace.\n\nExternal graticules also protect the glass face of the CRT from accidental impact. Some CRT oscilloscopes with internal graticules have an unmarked tinted sheet plastic light filter to enhance trace contrast; this also serves to protect the faceplate of the CRT.\n\nAccuracy and resolution of measurements using a graticule is relatively limited; better instruments sometimes have movable bright markers on the trace. These permit internal circuits to make more refined measurements.\n\nBoth calibrated vertical sensitivity and calibrated horizontal time are set in {{nowrap|1 \u2013 2 \u2013 5 \u2013 10}} steps. This leads, however, to some awkward interpretations of minor divisions.\n\nDigital oscilloscopes generate the graticule digitally. The scale, spacing, etc., of the graticule can therefore be varied, and accuracy of readings may be improved.\n\n====Timebase controls====\n[[File:CROtperdivisionincrease.gif|thumb|Computer model of the impact of increasing the timebase time/division]]\n\nThese select the horizontal speed of the CRT's spot as it creates the trace; this process is commonly referred to as the sweep. In all but the least-costly modern oscilloscopes, the sweep speed is selectable and calibrated in units of time per major graticule division. Quite a wide range of sweep speeds is generally provided, from seconds to as fast as picoseconds (in the fastest) per division. Usually, a continuously-variable control (often a knob in front of the calibrated selector knob) offers uncalibrated speeds, typically slower than calibrated. This control provides a range somewhat greater than the calibrated steps, making any speed between the steps available.\n\n====Holdoff control====\nSome higher-end analog oscilloscopes have a holdoff control. This sets a time after a trigger during which the sweep circuit cannot be triggered again. It helps provide a stable display of a repetitive events in which some triggers would create confusing displays. It is usually set to minimum, because a longer time decreases the number of sweeps per second, resulting in a dimmer trace. See [[#Holdoff|Holdoff]] for a more detailed description.\n\n====Vertical sensitivity, coupling, and polarity controls====\nTo accommodate a wide range of input amplitudes, a switch selects calibrated sensitivity of the vertical deflection. Another control, often in front of the calibrated-selector knob, offers a continuously-variable sensitivity over a limited range from calibrated to less-sensitive settings.\n\nOften the observed signal is offset by a steady component, and only the changes are of interest. An input coupling switch in the \"AC\" position connects a capacitor in series with the input. This passes only the changes (provided they are not too slow (\"slow\" would mean visible{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}). However, when the signal has a fixed offset of interest, or changes quite slowly, the user will usually prefer \"DC\" coupling, which bypasses any such capacitor. Most oscilloscopes offer the DC input option. For convenience, to see where zero volts input currently shows on the screen, many oscilloscopes have a third switch position (usually labeled \"GND\" for ground) that disconnects the input and grounds it. Often, in this case, the user centers the trace with the vertical position control.\n\nBetter oscilloscopes have a polarity selector. Normally, a positive input moves the trace upward; the polarity selector offers an \"inverting\" option, in which a positive-going signal deflects the trace downward.\n\n====Horizontal sensitivity control====\nThis control is found only on more elaborate oscilloscopes; it offers adjustable sensitivity for external horizontal inputs. It is only active when the instrument is in X-Y mode, i.e. the internal horizontal sweep is turned off.\n\n====Vertical position control====\n[[File:CROyoffset.gif|thumb|Computer model of vertical position ''y'' offset varying in a sine way]] The vertical position control moves the whole displayed trace up and down. It is used to set the no-input trace exactly on the center line of the graticule, but also permits offsetting vertically by a limited amount. With direct coupling, adjustment of this control can compensate for a limited DC component of an input.\n\n====Horizontal position control====\n[[File:CROxoffset.gif|thumb|Computer model of horizontal position control from ''x'' offset increasing]] The horizontal position control moves the display sidewise. It usually sets the left end of the trace at the left edge of the graticule, but it can displace the whole trace when desired. This control also moves the X-Y mode traces sidewise in some instruments, and can compensate for a limited DC component as for vertical position.\n\n====Dual-trace controls====\n''* (Please see Dual and Multiple-trace Oscilloscopes, below.)''\n\n[[File:CROdual.gif|thumb|Dual-trace controls {{nowrap|1=green trace = ''y'' = 30 sin(0.1''t'') + 0.5}} {{nowrap|1=teal trace = ''y'' = 30 sin(0.3''t'')}}]] Each input channel usually has its own set of sensitivity, coupling, and position controls, though some four-trace oscilloscopes have only minimal controls for their third and fourth channels.\n\nDual-trace oscilloscopes have a mode switch to select either channel alone, both channels, or (in some) an X\u2011Y display, which uses the second channel for X deflection. When both channels are displayed, the type of channel switching can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon timebase setting. If manually selectable, channel switching can be free-running (asynchronous), or between consecutive sweeps. Some Philips dual-trace analog oscilloscopes had a fast analog multiplier, and provided a display of the product of the input channels.\n\nMultiple-trace oscilloscopes have a switch for each channel to enable or disable display of the channel's trace.\n\n====Delayed-sweep controls====\n''* (Please see Delayed sweep, below.)''\n\nThese include controls for the delayed-sweep timebase, which is calibrated, and often also variable. The slowest speed is several steps faster than the slowest main sweep speed, though the fastest is generally the same. A calibrated multiturn delay time control offers wide range, high resolution delay settings; it spans the full duration of the main sweep, and its reading corresponds to graticule divisions (but with much finer precision). Its accuracy is also superior to that of the display.<!-- jeh-rv it ought to be, but nothing inherently dictates this -->\n\nA switch selects display modes: Main sweep only, with a brightened region showing when the delayed sweep is advancing, delayed sweep only, or (on some) a combination mode.\n\nGood CRT oscilloscopes include a delayed-sweep intensity control, to allow for the dimmer trace of a much-faster delayed sweep which nevertheless occurs only once per main sweep. Such oscilloscopes also are likely to have a trace separation control for multiplexed display of both the main and delayed sweeps together.<!-- jeh-rv - this is not necessary on a digital scope, as there is not really a trace that's moving faster -->\n\n====Sweep trigger controls====\n''* (Please see Triggered Sweep, below.)''\n\nA switch selects the trigger source. It can be an external input, one of the vertical channels of a dual or multiple-trace oscilloscope, or the AC line (mains) frequency. Another switch enables or disables auto trigger mode, or selects single sweep, if provided in the oscilloscope. Either a spring-return switch position or a pushbutton arms single sweeps.\n\nA trigger level control varies the voltage required to generate a trigger, and the slope switch selects positive-going or negative-going polarity at the selected trigger level.\n\n===Basic types of sweep===\n\n====Triggered sweep====\n[[Image:Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Type 465 [[Tektronix]] oscilloscope. This was a popular analog oscilloscope, portable, and is a representative example.]]\nTo display events with unchanging or slowly (visibly) changing waveforms, but occurring at times that may not be evenly spaced, modern oscilloscopes have triggered sweeps. Compared to older, simpler oscilloscopes with continuously-running sweep oscillators, triggered-sweep oscilloscopes are markedly more versatile.<!-- jeh-rv - continuous-sweep 'scopes are all but gone from the market. -->\n\nA triggered sweep starts at a selected point on the signal, providing a stable display. In this way, triggering allows the display of periodic signals such as sine waves and square waves, as well as nonperiodic signals such as single pulses, or pulses that do not recur at a fixed rate.\n\nWith triggered sweeps, the scope blanks the beam and starts to reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme right side of the screen. For a period of time, called ''holdoff'', (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative\u2014trigger polarity).\n\nIn some cases, variable holdoff time can be useful to make the sweep ignore interfering triggers that occur before the events to be observed. In the case of repetitive, but complex waveforms, variable holdoff can provide a stable display that could not otherwise be achieved.\n\n====Holdoff====\n''Trigger holdoff'' defines a certain period following a trigger during which the sweep cannot be triggered again. This makes it easier to establish a stable view of a [[waveform]] with multiple edges, which would otherwise cause additional triggers.<ref name=triggerholdoff>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=David|title=Oscilloscope Trigger Holdoff Tutorial|url=http://www.eevblog.com/2011/03/30/eevblog-159-oscilloscope-trigger-holdoff-tutorial/|publisher=EEVblog|accessdate=30 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128160235/http://www.eevblog.com/2011/03/30/eevblog-159-oscilloscope-trigger-holdoff-tutorial/|archivedate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=====Example=====\nImagine the following repeating waveform:<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Waveform.gif|400px]]<br />\nThe green line is the waveform, the red vertical partial line represents the location of the trigger, and the yellow line represents the trigger level. If the scope was simply set to trigger on every rising edge, this waveform would cause three triggers for each cycle:<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Trigger1.gif|200px]]<br />\n[[Image:Trigger2.gif|200px]]<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Trigger3.gif|200px]]<br />\nAssuming the signal is fairly high [[frequency]], the scope would probably look something like this:<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Alltriggers.gif|200px]]<br />\nOn an actual scope, each trigger would be the same channel, so all would be the same color.\n\nIt is desirable for the scope to only trigger on one edge per cycle, so it is necessary to set the holdoff at slightly less than the period of the waveform. This prevents triggering from occurring more than once per cycle, but still lets it trigger on the first edge of the next cycle.\n\n====Automatic sweep mode====\nTriggered sweeps can display a blank screen if there are no triggers. To avoid this, these sweeps include a timing circuit that generates free-running triggers so a trace is always visible. This is referred to as \"auto sweep\" or \"automatic sweep\" in the controls. Once triggers arrive, the timer stops providing pseudo-triggers. The user will usually disable automatic sweep when observing low repetition rates.\n\n====Recurrent sweeps====\nIf the input signal is periodic, the sweep repetition rate can be adjusted to display a few cycles of the waveform. Early (tube) oscilloscopes and lowest-cost oscilloscopes have sweep oscillators that run continuously, and are uncalibrated. Such oscilloscopes are very simple, comparatively inexpensive, and were useful in radio servicing and some TV servicing. Measuring voltage or time is possible, but only with extra equipment, and is quite inconvenient. They are primarily qualitative instruments.\n\nThey have a few (widely spaced) frequency ranges, and relatively wide-range continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.\n\n====Single sweeps====\nSome oscilloscopes offer these. The user manually arms the sweep circuit (typically by a pushbutton or equivalent). \"Armed\" means it's ready to respond to a trigger. Once the sweep completes, it resets, and does not sweep again until re-armed. This mode, combined with an oscilloscope camera, captures single-shot events.\n\nTypes of trigger include:\n* ''external trigger'', a pulse from an external source connected to a dedicated input on the scope.\n* ''edge trigger'', an edge detector that generates a pulse when the input signal crosses a specified threshold voltage in a specified direction. These are the most common types of triggers; the level control sets the threshold voltage, and the slope control selects the direction (negative or positive-going). (The first sentence of the description also applies to the inputs to some digital logic circuits; those inputs have fixed threshold and polarity response.)\n* ''video trigger'', a circuit that extracts synchronizing pulses from [[video]] formats such as [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]] and triggers the timebase on every line, a specified line, every field, or every frame. This circuit is typically found in a [[waveform monitor]] device, though some better oscilloscopes include this function.\n* ''delayed trigger'', which waits a specified time after an edge trigger before starting the sweep. As described under delayed sweeps, a trigger delay circuit (typically the main sweep) extends this delay to a known and adjustable interval. In this way, the operator can examine a particular pulse in a long train of pulses.\n\nSome recent designs of oscilloscopes include more sophisticated triggering schemes; these are described toward the end of this article.\n\n====Delayed sweeps====\nMore sophisticated analog oscilloscopes contain a second timebase for a delayed sweep. A delayed sweep provides a very detailed look at some small selected portion of the main timebase. The main timebase serves as a controllable delay, after which the delayed timebase starts. This can start when the delay expires, or can be triggered (only) after the delay expires. Ordinarily, the delayed timebase is set for a faster sweep, sometimes much faster, such as 1000:1. At extreme ratios, jitter in the delays on consecutive main sweeps degrades the display, but delayed-sweep triggers can overcome this.\n\nThe display shows the vertical signal in one of several modes: the main timebase, or the delayed timebase only, or a combination thereof. When the delayed sweep is active, the main sweep trace brightens while the delayed sweep is advancing. In one combination mode, provided only on some oscilloscopes, the trace changes from the main sweep to the delayed sweep once the delayed sweep starts, though less of the delayed fast sweep is visible for longer delays. Another combination mode multiplexes (alternates) the main and delayed sweeps so that both appear at once; a trace separation control displaces them. DSOs can display waveforms this way, without offering a delayed timebase as such.\n\n===Dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes===\nOscilloscopes with two vertical inputs, referred to as dual-trace oscilloscopes, are extremely useful and commonplace.\nUsing a single-beam CRT, they [[Multiplexing|multiplex]] the inputs, usually switching between them fast enough to display two traces apparently at once. Less common are oscilloscopes with more traces; four inputs are common among these, but a few (Kikusui, for one) offered a display of the sweep trigger signal if desired. Some multi-trace oscilloscopes use the external trigger input as an optional vertical input, and some have third and fourth channels with only minimal controls. In all cases, the inputs, when independently displayed, are time-multiplexed, but dual-trace oscilloscopes often can add their inputs to display a real-time analog sum. Inverting one channel while adding them together results in a display of the differences between them, provided neither channel is overloaded. This difference mode can provide a moderate-performance differential input.)\n\nSwitching channels can be asynchronous, i.e. free-running, with respect to the sweep frequency; or it can be done after each horizontal sweep is complete. Asynchronous switching is usually designated \"Chopped\", while sweep-synchronized is designated \"Alt[ernate]\". A given channel is alternately connected and disconnected, leading to the term \"chopped\". Multi-trace oscilloscopes also switch channels either in chopped or alternate modes.\n\nIn general, chopped mode is better for slower sweeps. It is possible for the internal chopping rate to be a multiple of the sweep repetition rate, creating blanks in the traces, but in practice this is rarely a problem. The gaps in one trace are overwritten by traces of the following sweep. A few oscilloscopes had a modulated chopping rate to avoid this occasional problem. Alternate mode, however, is better for faster sweeps.\n\nTrue dual-beam CRT oscilloscopes did exist, but were not common. One type (Cossor, U.K.) had a beam-splitter plate in its CRT, and single-ended deflection following the splitter. Others had two complete electron guns, requiring tight control of axial (rotational) mechanical alignment in manufacturing the CRT. Beam-splitter types had horizontal deflection common to both vertical channels, but dual-gun oscilloscopes could have separate time bases, or use one time base for both channels. Multiple-gun CRTs (up to ten guns) were made in past decades. With ten guns, the envelope (bulb) was cylindrical throughout its length. (Also see \"CRT Invention\" in [[Oscilloscope history]].)\n\n===The vertical amplifier===\nIn an analog oscilloscope, the vertical amplifier acquires the signal[s] to be displayed and provides a signal large enough to deflect the CRT's beam. In better oscilloscopes, it delays the signal by a fraction of a microsecond. The maximum deflection is at least somewhat beyond the edges of the graticule, and more typically some distance off-screen. The amplifier has to have low distortion to display its input accurately (it must be linear), and it has to recover quickly from overloads. As well, its time-domain response has to represent transients accurately\u2014minimal overshoot, rounding, and tilt of a flat pulse top.\n\nA vertical input goes to a frequency-compensated step attenuator to reduce large signals to prevent overload. The attenuator feeds one or more low-level stages, which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver if there is a delay). Subsequent gain stages lead to the final output stage, which develops a large signal swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT electrostatic deflection.\n\nIn dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes, an internal electronic switch selects the relatively low-level output of one channel's early-stage amplifier and sends it to the following stages of the vertical amplifier.\n\nIn free-running (\"chopped\") mode, the oscillator (which may be simply a different operating mode of the switch driver) blanks the beam before switching, and unblanks it only after the switching transients have settled.\n\nPart way through the amplifier is a feed to the sweep trigger circuits, for internal triggering from the signal. This feed would be from an individual channel's amplifier in a dual or multi-trace oscilloscope, the channel depending upon the setting of the trigger source selector.\n\nThis feed precedes the delay (if there is one), which allows the sweep circuit to unblank the CRT and start the forward sweep, so the CRT can show the triggering event. High-quality analog delays add a modest cost to an oscilloscope, and are omitted in cost-sensitive oscilloscopes.\n\nThe delay, itself, comes from a special cable with a pair of conductors wound around a flexible, magnetically soft core. The coiling provides distributed inductance, while a conductive layer close to the wires provides distributed capacitance. The combination is a wideband transmission line with considerable delay per unit length. Both ends of the delay cable require matched impedances to avoid reflections.\n\n====X-Y mode====\n[[File:Oscilloscope clock.jpg|thumb|A [[24-hour clock]] displayed on a CRT oscilloscope configured in X-Y mode as a [[vector monitor]] with dual [[:en:Resistor ladder|R2R DACs]] to generate the analog voltages]]\n\nMost modern oscilloscopes have several inputs for voltages, and thus can be used to plot one varying voltage versus another. This is especially useful for graphing I-V curves ([[Electric current|current]] versus [[voltage]] characteristics) for components such as [[diode]]s, as well as [[Lissajous curve|Lissajous patterns]]. Lissajous figures are an example of how an oscilloscope can be used to track [[phase (waves)|phase]] differences between multiple input signals. This is very frequently used in [[broadcast engineering]] to plot the left and right [[stereophonic]] channels, to ensure that the [[stereo generator]] is [[calibrate]]d properly. Historically, stable Lissajous figures were used to show that two sine waves had a relatively simple frequency relationship, a numerically-small ratio. They also indicated phase difference between two sine waves of the same frequency.\n\nThe X-Y mode also lets the oscilloscope serve as a [[vector monitor]] to display images or user interfaces. Many early games, such as [[Tennis for Two]], used an oscilloscope as an output device.<ref name=\"retromodo\">{{cite web |last=Nosowitz |first=Dan |url=https://gizmodo.com/5080541/retromodo-tennis-for-two-the-worlds-first-graphical-videogame |title='Tennis for Two', the World's First Graphical Videogame |work=Retromodo |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207052713/http://gizmodo.com/5080541/retromodo-tennis-for-two-the-worlds-first-graphical-videogame |archivedate=2008-12-07 }}</ref>\n\nComplete loss of signal in an X-Y CRT display means that the beam is stationary, striking a small spot. This risks burning the phosphor if the brightness is too high. Such damage was more common in older scopes as the phosphors previously used burned more easily. Some dedicated X-Y displays reduce beam current greatly, or blank the display entirely, if there are no inputs present.\n\n====Z input====\n\nSome analogue oscilloscopes feature a Z input. This is generally an input terminal that connects directly to the CRT grid (usually via a coupling capacitor). This allows an external signal to either increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) the brightness of the trace, even allowing it to be totally blanked. The voltage range to achieve cut-off to a brightened display is of the order of 10\u201320 volts depending on the CRT characteristics. \n\nAn example of a practical application is if a pair of sine waves of known frequency are used to generate a circular Lissajous figure and a higher unknown frequency is applied to the Z input. This turns the continuous circle into a circle of dots. The number of dots multiplied by the X-Y frequency gives the Z frequency. This technique only works if the Z frequency is an integer ratio of the X-Y frequency and only if it is not so large that the dots become so numerous that they are difficult to count.\n\n===Bandwidth===\nAs with all practical instruments, oscilloscopes do not respond equally to all possible input frequencies. The range of frequencies an oscilloscope can usefully display is referred to as its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Bandwidth applies primarily to the Y-axis, though the X-axis sweeps must be fast enough to show the highest-frequency waveforms.\n\nThe bandwidth is defined as the frequency at which the sensitivity is 0.707 of the sensitivity at DC or the lowest AC frequency\n(a drop of 3 [[decibel|dB]]).<ref name=JGW98>{{cite book\n| last                  =Webster\n| first                 =John G.\n| title                 =The Measurement, Instrumentation and Sensors Handbook\n| edition               =illustrated\n| year                  =1999\n| publisher             =Springer\n| isbn                  =978-3540648307\n| pages                 =37\u201324\n}}</ref> The oscilloscope's response drops off rapidly as the input frequency rises above that point. Within the stated bandwidth the response is not necessarily exactly uniform (or \"flat\"), but should always fall within a +0 to \u22123&nbsp;dB range. One source<ref name=JGW98/> says there is a noticeable effect on the accuracy of voltage measurements at only 20 percent of the stated bandwidth. Some oscilloscopes' specifications do include a narrower tolerance range within the stated bandwidth.\n\nProbes also have bandwidth limits and must be chosen and used to properly handle the frequencies of interest. To achieve the flattest response, most probes must be \"compensated\" (an adjustment performed using a test signal from the oscilloscope) to allow for the [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] of the probe's cable.\n\nAnother related specification is [[rise time]]. This is the duration of the fastest pulse that can be resolved by the scope. It is related to the bandwidth approximately by:\n\nBandwidth in Hz x rise time in seconds = 0.35.<ref name=SH72>{{Citation\n |first= Frank\n |last= Spitzer\n |first2= Barry\n |last2= Howarth\n |title= Principles of modern Instrumentation\n |publisher= Holt, Rinehart and Winston\n |location= New York\n |year= 1972\n |isbn= 0-03-080208-3\n |page= [https://archive.org/details/principlesofmode00spit/page/119 119 <!-- presume the 119 refers to a page -->]\n |doi= \n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/principlesofmode00spit/page/119\n }}</ref>\n\nFor example, an oscilloscope intended to resolve pulses with a rise time of 1 nanosecond would have a bandwidth of 350&nbsp;MHz.\n\nIn analog instruments, the bandwidth of the oscilloscope is limited by the vertical amplifiers and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital instruments, the sampling rate of the [[analog to digital converter]] (ADC) is a factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's [[Nyquist frequency]]. This is due to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the [[anti-aliasing filter]] that precedes the ADC, or both.\n\nFor a digital oscilloscope, a rule of thumb is that the continuous sampling rate should be ten times the highest frequency desired to resolve; for example a 20&nbsp;megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to about 2&nbsp;megahertz. This lets the anti-aliasing filter be designed with a 3&nbsp;dB down point of 2&nbsp;MHz and an effective cutoff at 10&nbsp;MHz (the Nyquist frequency), avoiding the artifacts of a very steep [[Brick-wall filter|(\"brick-wall\") filter]].\n\nA [[Oscilloscope types#Digital sampling oscilloscopes|sampling oscilloscope]] can display signals of considerably higher frequency than the sampling rate if the signals are exactly, or nearly, repetitive. It does this by taking one sample from each successive repetition of the input waveform, each sample being at an increased time interval from the trigger event. The waveform is then displayed from these collected samples. This mechanism is referred to as \"equivalent-time sampling\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8794EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113819/http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8794EN.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}</ref> Some oscilloscopes can operate in either this mode or in the more traditional \"real-time\" mode at the operator's choice.\n\n==Other features==\n[[File:CROsweep.gif|thumb|A computer model of the sweep of the oscilloscope]]Some oscilloscopes have ''cursors''. These are lines that can be moved about the screen to measure the time interval between two points, or the difference between two voltages. A few older oscilloscopes simply brightened the trace at movable locations. These cursors are more accurate than visual estimates referring to graticule lines.\n\nBetter quality general purpose oscilloscopes include a calibration signal for setting up the compensation of test probes; this is (often) a 1&nbsp;kHz square-wave signal of a definite peak-to-peak voltage available at a test terminal on the front panel. Some better oscilloscopes also have a squared-off loop for checking and adjusting current probes.\n\nSometimes a user wants to see an event that happens only occasionally. To catch these events, some oscilloscopes\u2014called ''storage scopes''\u2014preserve the most recent sweep on the screen. This was originally achieved with a special CRT, a \"[[storage tube]]\", which retained the image of even a very brief event for a long time.\n\nSome digital oscilloscopes can sweep at speeds as slow as once per hour, emulating a strip [[chart recorder]].\nThat is, the signal scrolls across the screen from right to left. Most oscilloscopes with this facility switch from a sweep to a strip-chart mode at about one sweep per ten seconds. This is because otherwise, the scope looks broken: it's collecting data, but the dot cannot be seen.\n\nAll but the simplest models of current oscilloscopes more often use digital signal sampling. Samples feed fast analog-to-digital converters, following which all signal processing (and storage) is digital.\n\nMany oscilloscopes accommodate plug-in modules for different purposes, e.g.,&nbsp;high-sensitivity amplifiers of relatively narrow bandwidth, differential amplifiers, amplifiers with four or more channels, sampling plugins for repetitive signals of very high frequency, and special-purpose plugins, including audio/ultrasonic spectrum analyzers, and stable-offset-voltage direct-coupled channels with relatively high gain.\n\n===Examples of use===\n[[Image:Lissajous figures on oscilloscope (90&nbsp;degrees phase shift).gif|thumb|right|300px|[[Lissajous curve|Lissajous figures]] on an oscilloscope, with 90&nbsp;degrees phase difference between ''x'' and ''y''&nbsp;inputs]]\n\nOne of the most frequent uses of scopes is [[troubleshooting]] malfunctioning electronic equipment. For example, where a [[voltmeter]] may show a totally unexpected voltage, a scope may reveal that the circuit is oscillating. In other cases the precise shape or timing of a pulse is important.\n\nIn a piece of electronic equipment, for example, the connections between stages (e.g., [[electronic mixer]]s, [[electronic oscillator]]s, [[amplifier]]s) may be 'probed' for the expected signal, using the scope as a simple signal tracer. If the expected signal is absent or incorrect, some preceding stage of the electronics is not operating correctly. Since most failures occur because of a single faulty component, each measurement can show that some of the stages of a complex piece of equipment either work, or probably did not cause the fault.\n\nOnce the faulty stage is found, further probing can usually tell a skilled technician exactly which component has failed. Once the component is replaced, the unit can be restored to service, or at least the next fault can be isolated. This sort of troubleshooting is typical of radio and TV&nbsp;receivers, as well as audio amplifiers, but can apply to quite-different devices such as electronic motor drives.\n\nAnother use is to check newly designed circuitry. Often, a newly designed circuit misbehaves because of design errors, bad voltage levels, electrical noise etc. Digital electronics usually operate from a clock, so a dual-trace scope showing both the clock signal and a test signal dependent upon the clock is useful. Storage scopes are helpful for \"capturing\" rare electronic events that cause defective operation.\n\n====Pictures of use====\n<!-- These are not well described. We need better pictures. Agreed!

Some oscilloscopes can trigger and decode serial bus messages, such as the [[CAN bus]] commonly used in automotive applications.\n\n===Selection===\nFor work at high frequencies and with fast digital signals, the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the vertical amplifiers and sampling rate must be high enough. For general-purpose use, a bandwidth of at least 100&nbsp;MHz is usually satisfactory. A much lower bandwidth is sufficient for audio-frequency applications only.\nA useful sweep range is from one second to 100&nbsp;nanoseconds, with appropriate triggering and (for analog instruments) sweep delay. A well-designed, stable trigger circuit is required for a steady display. The chief benefit of a quality oscilloscope is the quality of the trigger circuit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nKey selection criteria of a DSO (apart from input bandwidth) are the sample memory depth and sample rate. Early DSOs in the mid- to late 1990s only had a few KB of sample memory per channel. This is adequate for basic waveform display, but does not allow detailed examination of the waveform or inspection of long data packets for example. Even entry-level (<$500) modern DSOs now have 1&nbsp;MB or more of sample memory per channel, and this has become the expected minimum in any modern DSO.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Often this sample memory is shared between channels, and can sometimes only be fully available at lower sample rates. At the highest sample rates, the memory may be limited to a few tens of KB.<ref name=DSOtutorial>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=David|title=DSO Tutorial|url=http://www.eevblog.com/2009/06/17/eevblog-13-part-1-of-2-digital-storage-oscilloscope-tutorial/|publisher=EEVblog|accessdate=30 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128160141/http://www.eevblog.com/2009/06/17/eevblog-13-part-1-of-2-digital-storage-oscilloscope-tutorial/|archivedate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\nAny modern \"real-time\" sample rate DSO typically has 5\u201310 times the input bandwidth in sample rate.

Greatly increased sample rates have largely eliminated the display of incorrect signals, known as \"aliasing\", which was sometimes present in the first generation of digital scopes. The problem can still occur when, for example, viewing a short section of a repetitive waveform that repeats at intervals thousands of times longer than the section viewed (for example a short synchronization pulse at the beginning of a particular television line), with an oscilloscope that cannot store the extremely large number of samples between one instance of the short section and the next.\n\nThe used test equipment market, particularly on-line auction venues, typically has a wide selection of older analog scopes available. However it is becoming more difficult to obtain replacement parts for these instruments, and repair services are generally unavailable from the original manufacturer. Used instruments are usually out of calibration, and recalibration by companies with the equipment and expertise usually costs more than the second-hand value of the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n{{As of|2007}}, a 350&nbsp;MHz bandwidth (BW), 2.5&nbsp;gigasamples per second (GS/s), dual-channel digital storage scope costs about US$7000 new.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn the lowest end, an inexpensive hobby-grade single-channel DSO could be purchased for under $90 as of June 2011. These often have limited bandwidth and other facilities, but fulfill the basic functions of an oscilloscope.\n\n===Software===\nMany oscilloscopes today provide one or more external interfaces to allow remote [[instrument control]] by external software. These interfaces (or buses) include [[GPIB]], [[Ethernet]], [[serial port]], and [[USB]].\n\n==Types and models==\n{{Main|Oscilloscope types}}\nThe following section is a brief summary of various types and models available. For a detailed discussion, refer to the other article.\n\n===Cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO)===\n{{details|Oscilloscope types#Cathode-ray oscilloscope}}\n[[File:Lissajous-Figur 1 zu 3 (Oszilloskop).jpg|thumb|Example of an analog oscilloscope Lissajous figure, showing a harmonic relationship of 1 horizontal oscillation cycle to 3 vertical oscillation cycles]]\n[[File:Vectorscope.jpg|thumb|For [[analog television]], an analog oscilloscope can be used as a [[vectorscope]] to analyze complex signal properties, such as this display of [[SMPTE color bars]].]]\n\nThe earliest and simplest type of oscilloscope consisted of a [[cathode ray tube]], a vertical [[amplifier]], a timebase, a horizontal amplifier and a [[electronic power supply|power supply]]. These are now called \"analog\" scopes to distinguish them from the \"digital\" scopes that became common in the 1990s and later.\n\nAnalog scopes do not necessarily include a calibrated reference grid for size measurement of waves, and they may not display waves in the traditional sense of a line segment sweeping from left to right. Instead, they could be used for signal analysis by feeding a reference signal into one axis and the signal to measure into the other axis. For an oscillating reference and measurement signal, this results in a complex looping pattern referred to as a [[Lissajous curve]]. The shape of the curve can be interpreted to identify properties of the measurement signal in relation to the reference signal, and is useful across a wide range of oscillation frequencies.\n\n=== Dual-beam oscilloscope ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cathode ray tube]] (Was also edited here.) -->\n\nThe dual-beam analog oscilloscope can display two signals simultaneously. A special dual-beam [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] generates and deflects two separate beams. Multi-trace analog oscilloscopes can simulate a dual-beam display with chop and alternate sweeps\u2014but those features do not provide simultaneous displays. (Real time digital oscilloscopes offer the same benefits of a dual-beam oscilloscope, but they do not require a dual-beam display.) The disadvantages of the dual trace oscilloscope are that it cannot switch quickly between traces, and cannot capture two fast transient events. A dual ''beam'' oscilloscope avoids those problems.\n\n===Analog storage oscilloscope===\n{{details|Cathode ray tube#Oscilloscope CRTs}}\n{{details|Oscilloscope types#Analog storage oscilloscope}}\nTrace storage is an extra feature available on some analog scopes; they used direct-view storage CRTs. Storage allows a trace pattern that normally would decay in a fraction of a second to remain on the screen for several minutes or longer. An electrical circuit can then be deliberately activated to store and erase the trace on the screen.\n\n===Digital oscilloscopes===\n{{main|Digital storage oscilloscope}}\n\nWhile analog devices use continually varying voltages, digital devices use numbers that correspond to samples of the voltage. In the case of digital oscilloscopes, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) changes the measured voltages into digital information.\n\nThe digital storage oscilloscope, or DSO for short, is the standard type of oscilloscope today for the majority of industrial applications, and thanks to the low costs of entry-level oscilloscopes even for hobbyists. It replaces the electrostatic storage method in analog storage scopes with digital [[computer memory|memory]], which stores sample data as long as required without degradation and displays it without the brightness issues of storage-type CRTs. It also allows complex processing of the signal by high-speed [[digital signal processing]] circuits.<ref name=Kul03/>\n\nA standard DSO is limited to capturing signals with a bandwidth of less than half the sampling rate of the ADC (called the ''Nyquist limit''). There is a variation of the DSO called the ''digital sampling oscilloscope'' which can exceed this limit for certain types of signal, such as high-speed communications signals, where the waveform consists of repeating pulses. This type of DSO deliberately samples at a much lower frequency than the Nyquist limit and then uses signal processing to reconstruct a composite view of a typical pulse. <ref>{{Citation |first=Leslie |last=Green |url=http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4346463/The-alias-theorems-practical-undersampling-for-expert-engineers |title=The alias theorems: practical undersampling for expert engineers |journal=EDN |date=June 21, 2001 |accessdate=11 October 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173536/http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4346463/The-alias-theorems-practical-undersampling-for-expert-engineers |archivedate=20 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Mixed-signal oscilloscopes===\nA mixed-signal oscilloscope (or MSO) has two kinds of inputs, a small number of analog channels (typically two or four), and a larger number of digital channels (typically sixteen). It provides the ability to accurately time-correlate analog and digital channels, thus offering a distinct advantage over a separate oscilloscope and logic analyser. Typically, digital channels may be grouped and displayed as a bus with each bus value displayed at the bottom of the display in hex or binary. On most MSOs, the trigger can be set across both analog and digital channels.\n\n===Mixed-domain oscilloscopes===\nA mixed-domain oscilloscope (MDO) is an oscilloscope that comes with an additional RF input which is solely used for dedicated FFT-based [[spectrum analyzer]] functionality. Often, this RF input offers a higher bandwidth than the conventional analog input channels. This is in contrast to the FFT functionality of conventional digital oscilloscopes which use the normal analog inputs.\nSome MDOs allow time-correlation of events in the time domain (like a specific serial data package) with events happening in the frequency domain (like RF transmissions).\n\n===Handheld oscilloscopes===\n\n{{details|Oscilloscope types#Handheld oscilloscopes}}\nHandheld oscilloscopes are useful for many test and field service applications. Today, a hand held oscilloscope is usually a [[#Digital oscilloscopes|digital sampling oscilloscope]], using a [[liquid crystal]] display.\n\nMany hand-held and bench oscilloscopes have the ground reference voltage common to all input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the shared default reference is the \"earth\". If there is no differential preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user breaks the ground pin in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope in an attempt to isolate the signal common from the earth ground. This practice is unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet connects into the circuit. It is also a hazard to break a safety ground connection, and instruction manuals strongly advise against it.)\n\nSome models of oscilloscope have isolated inputs, where the signal reference level terminals are not connected together. Each input channel can be used to make a \"floating\" measurement with an independent signal reference level. Measurements can be made without tying one side of the oscilloscope input to the circuit signal common or ground reference.\n\nThe isolation available is categorized as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Overvoltage category !!

This can be in the form of a standalone oscilloscope with internal PC platform (PC mainboard), or as external oscilloscope which connects through [[USB]] or [[LAN]] to a separate PC or laptop.\n\n===Related instruments===\nA large number of instruments used in a variety of technical fields are really oscilloscopes with inputs, calibration, controls, display calibration, etc., specialized and optimized for a particular application. Examples of such oscilloscope-based instruments include [[waveform monitor]]s for analyzing video levels in [[television production]]s and medical devices such as vital function monitors and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram instruments. In automobile repair, an ignition analyzer is used to show the spark waveforms for each cylinder. All of these are essentially oscilloscopes, performing the basic task of showing the changes in one or more input signals over time in an ''X''\u2011''Y'' display.\n\nOther instruments convert the results of their measurements to a repetitive electrical signal, and incorporate an oscilloscope as a display element. Such complex measurement systems include [[spectrum analyzer]]s, transistor analyzers, and [[time domain reflectometer]]s (TDRs). Unlike an oscilloscope, these instruments automatically generate stimulus or sweep a measurement parameter.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Eye pattern]]\n* [[Phonodeik]]\n* ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', an oscilloscope game\n* [[Time-domain reflectometry]]\n* [[Vectorscope]]\n* [[Waveform monitor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite patent\n |inventor-last = Kobbe\n |inventor-first= John R.\n |inventor2-last= Polits\n |inventor2-first= William J.\n |title= Electrical Probe\n |issue-date= April 21, 1959\n |year= 1959\n |country-code= US\n |patent-number= 2883619\n |doi=}}\n* {{Citation\n |last= Tektronix\n |title= Tek Products\n |year= 1983\n |publisher= Tektronix\n |isbn=\n |doi=}}\n* {{Citation\n |last=Tektronix\n |title= Measurement Products Catalog 1998/1999\n |year= 1998\n |publisher= Tektronix\n |isbn=\n |doi=}}\n* {{Citation\n |last= Wedlock\n |first= Bruce D.\n |author-link=\n |last2= Roberge\n |first2= James K.\n |author2-link=\n |title= Electronic Components and Measurements\n |year= 1969\n |pages= 150\u2013152\n |publisher= Prentice-Hall\n |isbn= 0-13-250464-2\n |doi=}}\n* {{cite patent\n |inventor-last = Zeidlhack\n |inventor-first= Donald F.\n |inventor2-last= White\n |inventor2-first= Richard K.\n |title= Transmission Line Termination Circuit\n |issue-date= October 6, 1970\n |country-code= US\n |patent-number= 3532982\n |doi=}}\n\n<!-- Apologies for not using the proper format. _Encyclopedia On Cathode-Ray Oscilloscopes and Their Uses_, by John F.

Other signals (such as sound or vibration) can be converted to voltages and displayed.\n\nOscilloscopes display the change of an electrical signal over time, with voltage and time as the Y- and X-axes, respectively, on a calibrated scale. The [[waveform]] can then be analyzed for properties such as [[amplitude]], [[frequency]], [[rise time]], time interval, [[distortion]], and others. Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly. Originally, calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument.<ref name=Kul03>{{Citation\n |last= Kularatna\n |first= Nihal\n |title= Digital and Analogue Instrumentation: Testing and Measurement\n |chapter= Fundamentals of Oscilloscopes <!-- chapter 5 -->\n |pages= 165\u2013208\n |publisher= Institution of Engineering and Technology\n |year= 2003\n |isbn= 978-0-85296-999-1\n |doi= }}</ref>\n\nThe oscilloscope can be adjusted so that repetitive signals can be observed as a continuous shape on the screen. A storage oscilloscope can capture a single event and display it continuously, so the user can observe events that would otherwise appear too briefly to see directly.\n\nOscilloscopes are used in the sciences, medicine, engineering, automotive and the telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an [[electrocardiogram]].\n\nEarly oscilloscopes used [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) as their display element (hence they were commonly referred to as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal processing. Storage oscilloscopes used special storage CRTs to maintain a steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with [[thin panel display]]s, fast [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and [[digital signal processors]]. DSOs without integrated displays (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose [[digital computer]] to process and display waveforms.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Oscilloscope history}}\nThe [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube was known in 1897, and in 1899 [[Jonathan Zenneck]] equipped it with beam-forming plates and a magnetic field for sweeping the trace.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marton |first1=L. |title=Advances in electronics and electron physics |chapter=Ferdinand Braun: Forgotten Forefather |volume=50 |publisher=Academic Press |year=1980 |page=252 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27c1WOjCBX4C&lpg=PA252&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-12-014650-5 |editor-last=Suesskind |editor-first=Charles |quote=occurs first in a pair of later papers by Zenneck (1899a,b) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503063825/http://books.google.com/books?id=27c1WOjCBX4C&lpg=PA252&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false |archivedate=2014-05-03 }}</ref> Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements as early as the 1920s, but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters. [[Vladimir K. Zworykin|V.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Zworykin]] described a permanently sealed, high-vacuum cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and reproducible component allowed [[General Radio]] to manufacture an oscilloscope that was usable outside a laboratory setting.<ref name=Kul03/>\nAfter [[World War&nbsp;II]] surplus electronic parts became the basis of revival of [[Heathkit#Founding|Heathkit Corporation]], and a $50 oscilloscope kit made from such parts was a first market success.\n\n==Features and uses==\n[[Image:WTPC Oscilloscope-1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Basic Oscilloscope Front Panel Image.|Basic oscilloscope]]\n\n===Description===\nThe basic oscilloscope, as shown in the illustration, is typically divided into four sections: the display, vertical controls, horizontal controls and trigger controls. The display is usually a [[Cathode Ray Tube|CRT]] (historically) or [[LCD]] panel laid out with horizontal and vertical reference lines called the ''graticule''. [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays also have controls for focus, intensity, and beam finder.\n\nThe vertical section controls the amplitude of the displayed signal. This section has a volts-per-division (Volts/Div) selector knob, an AC/DC/Ground selector switch, and the vertical (primary) input for the instrument. Additionally, this section is typically equipped with the vertical beam position knob.\n\nThe horizontal section controls the time base or \"sweep\" of the instrument. The primary control is the Seconds-per-Division (Sec/Div) selector switch. Also included is a horizontal input for plotting dual X-Y axis signals. The horizontal beam position knob is generally located in this section.\n\nThe trigger section controls the start event of the sweep. The trigger can be set to automatically restart after each sweep, or can be configured to respond to an internal or external event. The principal controls of this section are the source and coupling selector switches, and an external trigger input (EXT Input) and level adjustment.\n\nIn addition to the basic instrument, most oscilloscopes are supplied with a probe as shown. The probe connects to any input on the instrument and typically has a resistor of ten times the oscilloscope's input impedance. This results in a .1&nbsp;(\u201110X) attenuation factor; this helps to isolate the capacitive load presented by the probe cable from the signal being measured. Some probes have a switch allowing the operator to bypass the resistor when appropriate.<ref name=Kul03/>\n\n====Size and portability====\nMost modern oscilloscopes are lightweight, portable instruments compact enough for a single person to carry. In addition to portable units, the market offers a number of miniature battery-powered instruments for field service applications. Laboratory grade oscilloscopes, especially older units that use [[vacuum tube]]s, are generally bench-top devices or are mounted on dedicated carts. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be [[rack-mounted]] or permanently mounted into a custom instrument housing.\n\n====Inputs====\nThe signal to be measured is fed to one of the input connectors, which is usually a coaxial connector such as a [[BNC connector|BNC]] or [[UHF connector|UHF type]]. [[Binding post]]s or [[banana plug]]s may be used for lower frequencies.\nIf the signal source has its own coaxial connector, then a simple [[coaxial cable]] is used; otherwise, a specialized cable called a \"[[Test probe|scope probe]]\", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an open wire test lead for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.\nGeneral-purpose oscilloscopes usually present an input impedance of 1 [[Ohm|megohm]] in parallel with a small but known capacitance such as 20 picofarads.<ref>The 20 picofarad value is typical for scope bandwidths around 100&nbsp;MHz; for example, a 200&nbsp;MHz Tektronix 7A26 input impedance is 1M and 22 pF. ({{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1983|p=271}}; see also {{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1998|p=503}}, \"typical high Z 10X passive probe model\".) Lower bandwidth scopes used higher capacitances; the 1&nbsp;MHz Tektronix 7A22 input impedance is 1M and 47 pF. {{Harv|Tektronix|1983|pp=272\u2013273}} Higher bandwidth scopes use smaller capacitances. The 500&nbsp;MHz Tektronix TDS510A input impedance is 1M and 10 pF. {{Harv|Tektronix|1998|p=78}}</ref> This allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes.<ref>Probes are designed for a specific input impedance. They have compensation adjustments with a limited range, so they often cannot be used on different input impedances.</ref> Scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50\u2011ohm inputs. These must be either connected directly to a 50\u2011ohm signal source or used with Z<sub>0</sub> or active probes.\n\nLess-frequently-used inputs include one (or two) for triggering the sweep, horizontal deflection for X\u2011Y mode displays, and trace brightening/darkening, sometimes called ''z'\u2011axis inputs.\n\n====Probes====\n{{Main|Test probe#Oscilloscope probes}}\n\nOpen wire test leads (flying leads) are likely to pick up interference, so they are not suitable for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded cable (i.e.,&nbsp;coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50&nbsp;ohm cable has about 90&nbsp;pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe loads a circuit with a capacitance of about 110&nbsp;pF and a resistance of 1&nbsp;megohm.\n\nTo minimize loading, attenuator probes (e.g.,&nbsp;10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9&nbsp;megohm series resistor shunted by a low-value capacitor to make an RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9&nbsp;megohm series resistor is shunted by a 12.2&nbsp;pF capacitor for a time constant of 110&nbsp;microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90&nbsp;pF in parallel with the scope input of 20&nbsp;pF and 1&nbsp;megohm (total capacitance 110&nbsp;pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, there is an adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of ''R'' is much less than the reactance of ''C''), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Wedlock|Roberge|1969}}</ref>\n\nThe result is a frequency compensated probe for modest frequencies. It presents a load of about 10&nbsp;megohms shunted by 12&nbsp;pF. Such a probe is an improvement, but does not work well when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit times or less (transit time is typically 5&nbsp;ns).{{clarify|date=January 2019}} In that time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and reflections from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe causes ringing.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kobbe|Polits|1959}}</ref> The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are other adjustments for completing the compensation.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1983|p=426}}; Tek claims 300&nbsp;MHz resistive coax at 30&nbsp;pF per meter; schematic has 5 adjustments.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Zeidlhack|White|1970}}</ref>\n\nProbes with 10:1 attenuation are by far the most common; for large signals (and slightly-less capacitive loading), 100:1 probes may be used. There are also probes that contain switches to select 10:1 or direct (1:1) ratios, but the latter setting has significant capacitance (tens of pF) at the probe tip, because the whole cable's capacitance is then directly connected.\n\nMost oscilloscopes provide for probe attenuation factors, displaying the effective sensitivity at the probe tip. Historically, some auto-sensing circuitry used indicator lamps behind translucent windows in the panel to illuminate different parts of the sensitivity scale. To do so, the probe connectors (modified BNCs) had an extra contact to define the probe's attenuation. (A certain value of resistor, connected to ground, \"encodes\" the attenuation.) Because probes wear out, and because the auto-sensing circuitry is not compatible between different oscilloscope makes, auto-sensing probe scaling is not foolproof. Likewise, manually setting the probe attenuation is prone to user error. Setting the probe scaling incorrectly is a common error, and throws the reading off by a factor of 10.\n\nSpecial [[high voltage probe]]s form compensated attenuators with the oscilloscope input. These have a large probe body, and some require partly filling a canister surrounding the series resistor with volatile liquid fluorocarbon to displace air. The oscilloscope end has a box with several waveform-trimming adjustments. For safety, a barrier disc keeps the user's fingers away from the point being examined. Maximum voltage is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition, until the probe tip is in contact. Until then, a tiny arc charges the probe tip, and its capacitance holds the voltage (open circuit). As the voltage continues to climb, another tiny arc charges the tip further.)\n\nThere are also current probes, with cores that surround the conductor carrying current to be examined. One type has a hole for the conductor, and requires that the wire be passed through the hole for semi-permanent or permanent mounting. However, other types, used for temporary testing, have a two-part core that can be clamped around a wire. Inside the probe, a coil wound around the core provides a current into an appropriate load, and the voltage across that load is proportional to current. This type of probe only senses AC.\n\nA more-sophisticated probe includes a magnetic flux sensor ([[Hall effect]] sensor) in the magnetic circuit. The probe connects to an amplifier, which feeds (low frequency) current into the coil to cancel the sensed field; the magnitude of the current provides the low-frequency part of the current waveform, right down to DC. The coil still picks up high frequencies. There is a combining network akin to a loudspeaker crossover .\n\n===Front panel controls===\n\n====Focus control====\nThis control adjusts CRT focus to obtain the sharpest, most-detailed trace. In practice, focus must be adjusted slightly when observing very different signals, so it must be an external control. The control varies the voltage applied to a focusing anode within the CRT. Flat-panel displays do not need this control.\n\n====Intensity control====\nThis adjusts trace brightness. Slow traces on CRT oscilloscopes need less, and fast ones, especially if not often repeated, require more brightness. On flat panels, however, trace brightness is essentially independent of sweep speed, because the internal signal processing effectively synthesizes the display from the digitized data.\n\n====Astigmatism====\nThis control may instead be called \"shape\" or \"spot shape\". It adjusts the voltage on the last CRT anode (immediately next to the Y deflection plates). For a circular spot, the final anode must be at the same potential as both of the Y-plates (for a centred spot the Y-plate voltages must be the same). If the anode is made more positive, the spot becomes elliptical in the X-plane as the more negative Y-plates will repel the beam. If the anode is made more negative, the spot becomes elliptical in the Y-plane as the more positive Y-plates will attract the beam. This control may be absent from simpler oscilloscope designs or may even be an internal control. It is not necessary with flat panel displays.\n\n====Beam finder====\nModern oscilloscopes have direct-coupled deflection amplifiers, which means the trace could be deflected off-screen. They also might have their beam blanked without the operator knowing it. To help in restoring a visible display, the beam finder circuit overrides any blanking and limits the beam deflected to the visible portion of the screen. Beam-finder circuits often distort the trace while activated.\n\n====Graticule====\nThe graticule is a grid of lines that serve as reference marks for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1&nbsp;cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2&nbsp;mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. One expects to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.\n\nOn old and lower-cost CRT oscilloscopes the graticule is a sheet of plastic, often with light-diffusing markings and concealed lamps at the edge of the graticule. The lamps had a brightness control. Higher-cost instruments have the graticule marked on the inside face of the CRT, to eliminate [[parallax error]]s; better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings. (Diffusing markings appear bright.) Digital oscilloscopes, however, generate the graticule markings on the display in the same way as the trace.\n\nExternal graticules also protect the glass face of the CRT from accidental impact. Some CRT oscilloscopes with internal graticules have an unmarked tinted sheet plastic light filter to enhance trace contrast; this also serves to protect the faceplate of the CRT.\n\nAccuracy and resolution of measurements using a graticule is relatively limited; better instruments sometimes have movable bright markers on the trace. These permit internal circuits to make more refined measurements.\n\nBoth calibrated vertical sensitivity and calibrated horizontal time are set in {{nowrap|1 \u2013 2 \u2013 5 \u2013 10}} steps. This leads, however, to some awkward interpretations of minor divisions.\n\nDigital oscilloscopes generate the graticule digitally. The scale, spacing, etc., of the graticule can therefore be varied, and accuracy of readings may be improved.\n\n====Timebase controls====\n[[File:CROtperdivisionincrease.gif|thumb|Computer model of the impact of increasing the timebase time/division]]\n\nThese select the horizontal speed of the CRT's spot as it creates the trace; this process is commonly referred to as the sweep. In all but the least-costly modern oscilloscopes, the sweep speed is selectable and calibrated in units of time per major graticule division. Quite a wide range of sweep speeds is generally provided, from seconds to as fast as picoseconds (in the fastest) per division. Usually, a continuously-variable control (often a knob in front of the calibrated selector knob) offers uncalibrated speeds, typically slower than calibrated. This control provides a range somewhat greater than the calibrated steps, making any speed between the steps available.\n\n====Holdoff control====\nSome higher-end analog oscilloscopes have a holdoff control. This sets a time after a trigger during which the sweep circuit cannot be triggered again. It helps provide a stable display of a repetitive events in which some triggers would create confusing displays. It is usually set to minimum, because a longer time decreases the number of sweeps per second, resulting in a dimmer trace. See [[#Holdoff|Holdoff]] for a more detailed description.\n\n====Vertical sensitivity, coupling, and polarity controls====\nTo accommodate a wide range of input amplitudes, a switch selects calibrated sensitivity of the vertical deflection. Another control, often in front of the calibrated-selector knob, offers a continuously-variable sensitivity over a limited range from calibrated to less-sensitive settings.\n\nOften the observed signal is offset by a steady component, and only the changes are of interest. An input coupling switch in the \"AC\" position connects a capacitor in series with the input. This passes only the changes (provided they are not too slow (\"slow\" would mean visible{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}). However, when the signal has a fixed offset of interest, or changes quite slowly, the user will usually prefer \"DC\" coupling, which bypasses any such capacitor. Most oscilloscopes offer the DC input option. For convenience, to see where zero volts input currently shows on the screen, many oscilloscopes have a third switch position (usually labeled \"GND\" for ground) that disconnects the input and grounds it. Often, in this case, the user centers the trace with the vertical position control.\n\nBetter oscilloscopes have a polarity selector. Normally, a positive input moves the trace upward; the polarity selector offers an \"inverting\" option, in which a positive-going signal deflects the trace downward.\n\n====Horizontal sensitivity control====\nThis control is found only on more elaborate oscilloscopes; it offers adjustable sensitivity for external horizontal inputs. It is only active when the instrument is in X-Y mode, i.e. the internal horizontal sweep is turned off.\n\n====Vertical position control====\n[[File:CROyoffset.gif|thumb|Computer model of vertical position ''y'' offset varying in a sine way]] The vertical position control moves the whole displayed trace up and down. It is used to set the no-input trace exactly on the center line of the graticule, but also permits offsetting vertically by a limited amount. With direct coupling, adjustment of this control can compensate for a limited DC component of an input.\n\n====Horizontal position control====\n[[File:CROxoffset.gif|thumb|Computer model of horizontal position control from ''x'' offset increasing]] The horizontal position control moves the display sidewise. It usually sets the left end of the trace at the left edge of the graticule, but it can displace the whole trace when desired. This control also moves the X-Y mode traces sidewise in some instruments, and can compensate for a limited DC component as for vertical position.\n\n====Dual-trace controls====\n''* (Please see Dual and Multiple-trace Oscilloscopes, below.)''\n\n[[File:CROdual.gif|thumb|Dual-trace controls {{nowrap|1=green trace = ''y'' = 30 sin(0.1''t'') + 0.5}} {{nowrap|1=teal trace = ''y'' = 30 sin(0.3''t'')}}]] Each input channel usually has its own set of sensitivity, coupling, and position controls, though some four-trace oscilloscopes have only minimal controls for their third and fourth channels.\n\nDual-trace oscilloscopes have a mode switch to select either channel alone, both channels, or (in some) an X\u2011Y display, which uses the second channel for X deflection. When both channels are displayed, the type of channel switching can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon timebase setting. If manually selectable, channel switching can be free-running (asynchronous), or between consecutive sweeps. Some Philips dual-trace analog oscilloscopes had a fast analog multiplier, and provided a display of the product of the input channels.\n\nMultiple-trace oscilloscopes have a switch for each channel to enable or disable display of the channel's trace.\n\n====Delayed-sweep controls====\n''* (Please see Delayed sweep, below.)''\n\nThese include controls for the delayed-sweep timebase, which is calibrated, and often also variable. The slowest speed is several steps faster than the slowest main sweep speed, though the fastest is generally the same. A calibrated multiturn delay time control offers wide range, high resolution delay settings; it spans the full duration of the main sweep, and its reading corresponds to graticule divisions (but with much finer precision). Its accuracy is also superior to that of the display.<!-- jeh-rv it ought to be, but nothing inherently dictates this -->\n\nA switch selects display modes: Main sweep only, with a brightened region showing when the delayed sweep is advancing, delayed sweep only, or (on some) a combination mode.\n\nGood CRT oscilloscopes include a delayed-sweep intensity control, to allow for the dimmer trace of a much-faster delayed sweep which nevertheless occurs only once per main sweep. Such oscilloscopes also are likely to have a trace separation control for multiplexed display of both the main and delayed sweeps together.<!-- jeh-rv - this is not necessary on a digital scope, as there is not really a trace that's moving faster -->\n\n====Sweep trigger controls====\n''* (Please see Triggered Sweep, below.)''\n\nA switch selects the trigger source. It can be an external input, one of the vertical channels of a dual or multiple-trace oscilloscope, or the AC line (mains) frequency. Another switch enables or disables auto trigger mode, or selects single sweep, if provided in the oscilloscope. Either a spring-return switch position or a pushbutton arms single sweeps.\n\nA trigger level control varies the voltage required to generate a trigger, and the slope switch selects positive-going or negative-going polarity at the selected trigger level.\n\n===Basic types of sweep===\n\n====Triggered sweep====\n[[Image:Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Type 465 [[Tektronix]] oscilloscope. This was a popular analog oscilloscope, portable, and is a representative example.]]\nTo display events with unchanging or slowly (visibly) changing waveforms, but occurring at times that may not be evenly spaced, modern oscilloscopes have triggered sweeps. Compared to older, simpler oscilloscopes with continuously-running sweep oscillators, triggered-sweep oscilloscopes are markedly more versatile.<!-- jeh-rv - continuous-sweep 'scopes are all but gone from the market. -->\n\nA triggered sweep starts at a selected point on the signal, providing a stable display. In this way, triggering allows the display of periodic signals such as sine waves and square waves, as well as nonperiodic signals such as single pulses, or pulses that do not recur at a fixed rate.\n\nWith triggered sweeps, the scope blanks the beam and starts to reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme right side of the screen. For a period of time, called ''holdoff'', (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative\u2014trigger polarity).\n\nIn some cases, variable holdoff time can be useful to make the sweep ignore interfering triggers that occur before the events to be observed. In the case of repetitive, but complex waveforms, variable holdoff can provide a stable display that could not otherwise be achieved.\n\n====Holdoff====\n''Trigger holdoff'' defines a certain period following a trigger during which the sweep cannot be triggered again. This makes it easier to establish a stable view of a [[waveform]] with multiple edges, which would otherwise cause additional triggers.<ref name=triggerholdoff>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=David|title=Oscilloscope Trigger Holdoff Tutorial|url=http://www.eevblog.com/2011/03/30/eevblog-159-oscilloscope-trigger-holdoff-tutorial/|publisher=EEVblog|accessdate=30 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128160235/http://www.eevblog.com/2011/03/30/eevblog-159-oscilloscope-trigger-holdoff-tutorial/|archivedate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=====Example=====\nImagine the following repeating waveform:<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Waveform.gif|400px]]<br />\nThe green line is the waveform, the red vertical partial line represents the location of the trigger, and the yellow line represents the trigger level. If the scope was simply set to trigger on every rising edge, this waveform would cause three triggers for each cycle:<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Trigger1.gif|200px]]<br />\n[[Image:Trigger2.gif|200px]]<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Trigger3.gif|200px]]<br />\nAssuming the signal is fairly high [[frequency]], the scope would probably look something like this:<br />\n[[Image:Scope Holdoff Alltriggers.gif|200px]]<br />\nOn an actual scope, each trigger would be the same channel, so all would be the same color.\n\nIt is desirable for the scope to only trigger on one edge per cycle, so it is necessary to set the holdoff at slightly less than the period of the waveform. This prevents triggering from occurring more than once per cycle, but still lets it trigger on the first edge of the next cycle.\n\n====Automatic sweep mode====\nTriggered sweeps can display a blank screen if there are no triggers. To avoid this, these sweeps include a timing circuit that generates free-running triggers so a trace is always visible. This is referred to as \"auto sweep\" or \"automatic sweep\" in the controls. Once triggers arrive, the timer stops providing pseudo-triggers. The user will usually disable automatic sweep when observing low repetition rates.\n\n====Recurrent sweeps====\nIf the input signal is periodic, the sweep repetition rate can be adjusted to display a few cycles of the waveform. Early (tube) oscilloscopes and lowest-cost oscilloscopes have sweep oscillators that run continuously, and are uncalibrated. Such oscilloscopes are very simple, comparatively inexpensive, and were useful in radio servicing and some TV servicing. Measuring voltage or time is possible, but only with extra equipment, and is quite inconvenient. They are primarily qualitative instruments.\n\nThey have a few (widely spaced) frequency ranges, and relatively wide-range continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.\n\n====Single sweeps====\nSome oscilloscopes offer these. The user manually arms the sweep circuit (typically by a pushbutton or equivalent). \"Armed\" means it's ready to respond to a trigger. Once the sweep completes, it resets, and does not sweep again until re-armed. This mode, combined with an oscilloscope camera, captures single-shot events.\n\nTypes of trigger include:\n* ''external trigger'', a pulse from an external source connected to a dedicated input on the scope.\n* ''edge trigger'', an edge detector that generates a pulse when the input signal crosses a specified threshold voltage in a specified direction. These are the most common types of triggers; the level control sets the threshold voltage, and the slope control selects the direction (negative or positive-going). (The first sentence of the description also applies to the inputs to some digital logic circuits; those inputs have fixed threshold and polarity response.)\n* ''video trigger'', a circuit that extracts synchronizing pulses from [[video]] formats such as [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]] and triggers the timebase on every line, a specified line, every field, or every frame. This circuit is typically found in a [[waveform monitor]] device, though some better oscilloscopes include this function.\n* ''delayed trigger'', which waits a specified time after an edge trigger before starting the sweep. As described under delayed sweeps, a trigger delay circuit (typically the main sweep) extends this delay to a known and adjustable interval. In this way, the operator can examine a particular pulse in a long train of pulses.\n\nSome recent designs of oscilloscopes include more sophisticated triggering schemes; these are described toward the end of this article.\n\n====Delayed sweeps====\nMore sophisticated analog oscilloscopes contain a second timebase for a delayed sweep. A delayed sweep provides a very detailed look at some small selected portion of the main timebase. The main timebase serves as a controllable delay, after which the delayed timebase starts. This can start when the delay expires, or can be triggered (only) after the delay expires. Ordinarily, the delayed timebase is set for a faster sweep, sometimes much faster, such as 1000:1. At extreme ratios, jitter in the delays on consecutive main sweeps degrades the display, but delayed-sweep triggers can overcome this.\n\nThe display shows the vertical signal in one of several modes: the main timebase, or the delayed timebase only, or a combination thereof. When the delayed sweep is active, the main sweep trace brightens while the delayed sweep is advancing. In one combination mode, provided only on some oscilloscopes, the trace changes from the main sweep to the delayed sweep once the delayed sweep starts, though less of the delayed fast sweep is visible for longer delays. Another combination mode multiplexes (alternates) the main and delayed sweeps so that both appear at once; a trace separation control displaces them. DSOs can display waveforms this way, without offering a delayed timebase as such.\n\n===Dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes===\nOscilloscopes with two vertical inputs, referred to as dual-trace oscilloscopes, are extremely useful and commonplace.\nUsing a single-beam CRT, they [[Multiplexing|multiplex]] the inputs, usually switching between them fast enough to display two traces apparently at once. Less common are oscilloscopes with more traces; four inputs are common among these, but a few (Kikusui, for one) offered a display of the sweep trigger signal if desired. Some multi-trace oscilloscopes use the external trigger input as an optional vertical input, and some have third and fourth channels with only minimal controls. In all cases, the inputs, when independently displayed, are time-multiplexed, but dual-trace oscilloscopes often can add their inputs to display a real-time analog sum. Inverting one channel while adding them together results in a display of the differences between them, provided neither channel is overloaded. This difference mode can provide a moderate-performance differential input.)\n\nSwitching channels can be asynchronous, i.e. free-running, with respect to the sweep frequency; or it can be done after each horizontal sweep is complete. Asynchronous switching is usually designated \"Chopped\", while sweep-synchronized is designated \"Alt[ernate]\". A given channel is alternately connected and disconnected, leading to the term \"chopped\". Multi-trace oscilloscopes also switch channels either in chopped or alternate modes.\n\nIn general, chopped mode is better for slower sweeps. It is possible for the internal chopping rate to be a multiple of the sweep repetition rate, creating blanks in the traces, but in practice this is rarely a problem. The gaps in one trace are overwritten by traces of the following sweep. A few oscilloscopes had a modulated chopping rate to avoid this occasional problem. Alternate mode, however, is better for faster sweeps.\n\nTrue dual-beam CRT oscilloscopes did exist, but were not common. One type (Cossor, U.K.) had a beam-splitter plate in its CRT, and single-ended deflection following the splitter. Others had two complete electron guns, requiring tight control of axial (rotational) mechanical alignment in manufacturing the CRT. Beam-splitter types had horizontal deflection common to both vertical channels, but dual-gun oscilloscopes could have separate time bases, or use one time base for both channels. Multiple-gun CRTs (up to ten guns) were made in past decades. With ten guns, the envelope (bulb) was cylindrical throughout its length. (Also see \"CRT Invention\" in [[Oscilloscope history]].)\n\n===The vertical amplifier===\nIn an analog oscilloscope, the vertical amplifier acquires the signal[s] to be displayed and provides a signal large enough to deflect the CRT's beam. In better oscilloscopes, it delays the signal by a fraction of a microsecond. The maximum deflection is at least somewhat beyond the edges of the graticule, and more typically some distance off-screen. The amplifier has to have low distortion to display its input accurately (it must be linear), and it has to recover quickly from overloads. As well, its time-domain response has to represent transients accurately\u2014minimal overshoot, rounding, and tilt of a flat pulse top.\n\nA vertical input goes to a frequency-compensated step attenuator to reduce large signals to prevent overload. The attenuator feeds one or more low-level stages, which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver if there is a delay). Subsequent gain stages lead to the final output stage, which develops a large signal swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT electrostatic deflection.\n\nIn dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes, an internal electronic switch selects the relatively low-level output of one channel's early-stage amplifier and sends it to the following stages of the vertical amplifier.\n\nIn free-running (\"chopped\") mode, the oscillator (which may be simply a different operating mode of the switch driver) blanks the beam before switching, and unblanks it only after the switching transients have settled.\n\nPart way through the amplifier is a feed to the sweep trigger circuits, for internal triggering from the signal. This feed would be from an individual channel's amplifier in a dual or multi-trace oscilloscope, the channel depending upon the setting of the trigger source selector.\n\nThis feed precedes the delay (if there is one), which allows the sweep circuit to unblank the CRT and start the forward sweep, so the CRT can show the triggering event. High-quality analog delays add a modest cost to an oscilloscope, and are omitted in cost-sensitive oscilloscopes.\n\nThe delay, itself, comes from a special cable with a pair of conductors wound around a flexible, magnetically soft core. The coiling provides distributed inductance, while a conductive layer close to the wires provides distributed capacitance. The combination is a wideband transmission line with considerable delay per unit length. Both ends of the delay cable require matched impedances to avoid reflections.\n\n====X-Y mode====\n[[File:Oscilloscope clock.jpg|thumb|A [[24-hour clock]] displayed on a CRT oscilloscope configured in X-Y mode as a [[vector monitor]] with dual [[:en:Resistor ladder|R2R DACs]] to generate the analog voltages]]\n\nMost modern oscilloscopes have several inputs for voltages, and thus can be used to plot one varying voltage versus another. This is especially useful for graphing I-V curves ([[Electric current|current]] versus [[voltage]] characteristics) for components such as [[diode]]s, as well as [[Lissajous curve|Lissajous patterns]]. Lissajous figures are an example of how an oscilloscope can be used to track [[phase (waves)|phase]] differences between multiple input signals. This is very frequently used in [[broadcast engineering]] to plot the left and right [[stereophonic]] channels, to ensure that the [[stereo generator]] is [[calibrate]]d properly. Historically, stable Lissajous figures were used to show that two sine waves had a relatively simple frequency relationship, a numerically-small ratio. They also indicated phase difference between two sine waves of the same frequency.\n\nThe X-Y mode also lets the oscilloscope serve as a [[vector monitor]] to display images or user interfaces. Many early games, such as [[Tennis for Two]], used an oscilloscope as an output device.<ref name=\"retromodo\">{{cite web |last=Nosowitz |first=Dan |url=https://gizmodo.com/5080541/retromodo-tennis-for-two-the-worlds-first-graphical-videogame |title='Tennis for Two', the World's First Graphical Videogame |work=Retromodo |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207052713/http://gizmodo.com/5080541/retromodo-tennis-for-two-the-worlds-first-graphical-videogame |archivedate=2008-12-07 }}</ref>\n\nComplete loss of signal in an X-Y CRT display means that the beam is stationary, striking a small spot. This risks burning the phosphor if the brightness is too high. Such damage was more common in older scopes as the phosphors previously used burned more easily. Some dedicated X-Y displays reduce beam current greatly, or blank the display entirely, if there are no inputs present.\n\n====Z input====\n\nSome analogue oscilloscopes feature a Z input. This is generally an input terminal that connects directly to the CRT grid (usually via a coupling capacitor). This allows an external signal to either increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) the brightness of the trace, even allowing it to be totally blanked. The voltage range to achieve cut-off to a brightened display is of the order of 10\u201320 volts depending on the CRT characteristics. \n\nAn example of a practical application is if a pair of sine waves of known frequency are used to generate a circular Lissajous figure and a higher unknown frequency is applied to the Z input. This turns the continuous circle into a circle of dots. The number of dots multiplied by the X-Y frequency gives the Z frequency. This technique only works if the Z frequency is an integer ratio of the X-Y frequency and only if it is not so large that the dots become so numerous that they are difficult to count.\n\n===Bandwidth===\nAs with all practical instruments, oscilloscopes do not respond equally to all possible input frequencies. The range of frequencies an oscilloscope can usefully display is referred to as its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Bandwidth applies primarily to the Y-axis, though the X-axis sweeps must be fast enough to show the highest-frequency waveforms.\n\nThe bandwidth is defined as the frequency at which the sensitivity is 0.707 of the sensitivity at DC or the lowest AC frequency\n(a drop of 3 [[decibel|dB]]).<ref name=JGW98>{{cite book\n| last                  =Webster\n| first                 =John G.\n| title                 =The Measurement, Instrumentation and Sensors Handbook\n| edition               =illustrated\n| year                  =1999\n| publisher             =Springer\n| isbn                  =978-3540648307\n| pages                 =37\u201324\n}}</ref> The oscilloscope's response drops off rapidly as the input frequency rises above that point. Within the stated bandwidth the response is not necessarily exactly uniform (or \"flat\"), but should always fall within a +0 to \u22123&nbsp;dB range. One source<ref name=JGW98/> says there is a noticeable effect on the accuracy of voltage measurements at only 20 percent of the stated bandwidth. Some oscilloscopes' specifications do include a narrower tolerance range within the stated bandwidth.\n\nProbes also have bandwidth limits and must be chosen and used to properly handle the frequencies of interest. To achieve the flattest response, most probes must be \"compensated\" (an adjustment performed using a test signal from the oscilloscope) to allow for the [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] of the probe's cable.\n\nAnother related specification is [[rise time]]. This is the duration of the fastest pulse that can be resolved by the scope. It is related to the bandwidth approximately by:\n\nBandwidth in Hz x rise time in seconds = 0.35.<ref name=SH72>{{Citation\n |first= Frank\n |last= Spitzer\n |first2= Barry\n |last2= Howarth\n |title= Principles of modern Instrumentation\n |publisher= Holt, Rinehart and Winston\n |location= New York\n |year= 1972\n |isbn= 0-03-080208-3\n |page= [https://archive.org/details/principlesofmode00spit/page/119 119 <!-- presume the 119 refers to a page -->]\n |doi= \n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/principlesofmode00spit/page/119\n }}</ref>\n\nFor example, an oscilloscope intended to resolve pulses with a rise time of 1 nanosecond would have a bandwidth of 350&nbsp;MHz.\n\nIn analog instruments, the bandwidth of the oscilloscope is limited by the vertical amplifiers and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital instruments, the sampling rate of the [[analog to digital converter]] (ADC) is a factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's [[Nyquist frequency]]. This is due to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the [[anti-aliasing filter]] that precedes the ADC, or both.\n\nFor a digital oscilloscope, a rule of thumb is that the continuous sampling rate should be ten times the highest frequency desired to resolve; for example a 20&nbsp;megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to about 2&nbsp;megahertz. This lets the anti-aliasing filter be designed with a 3&nbsp;dB down point of 2&nbsp;MHz and an effective cutoff at 10&nbsp;MHz (the Nyquist frequency), avoiding the artifacts of a very steep [[Brick-wall filter|(\"brick-wall\") filter]].\n\nA [[Oscilloscope types#Digital sampling oscilloscopes|sampling oscilloscope]] can display signals of considerably higher frequency than the sampling rate if the signals are exactly, or nearly, repetitive. It does this by taking one sample from each successive repetition of the input waveform, each sample being at an increased time interval from the trigger event. The waveform is then displayed from these collected samples. This mechanism is referred to as \"equivalent-time sampling\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8794EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113819/http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8794EN.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}</ref> Some oscilloscopes can operate in either this mode or in the more traditional \"real-time\" mode at the operator's choice.\n\n==Other features==\n[[File:CROsweep.gif|thumb|A computer model of the sweep of the oscilloscope]]Some oscilloscopes have ''cursors''. These are lines that can be moved about the screen to measure the time interval between two points, or the difference between two voltages. A few older oscilloscopes simply brightened the trace at movable locations. These cursors are more accurate than visual estimates referring to graticule lines.\n\nBetter quality general purpose oscilloscopes include a calibration signal for setting up the compensation of test probes; this is (often) a 1&nbsp;kHz square-wave signal of a definite peak-to-peak voltage available at a test terminal on the front panel. Some better oscilloscopes also have a squared-off loop for checking and adjusting current probes.\n\nSometimes a user wants to see an event that happens only occasionally. To catch these events, some oscilloscopes\u2014called ''storage scopes''\u2014preserve the most recent sweep on the screen. This was originally achieved with a special CRT, a \"[[storage tube]]\", which retained the image of even a very brief event for a long time.\n\nSome digital oscilloscopes can sweep at speeds as slow as once per hour, emulating a strip [[chart recorder]].\nThat is, the signal scrolls across the screen from right to left. Most oscilloscopes with this facility switch from a sweep to a strip-chart mode at about one sweep per ten seconds. This is because otherwise, the scope looks broken: it's collecting data, but the dot cannot be seen.\n\nAll but the simplest models of current oscilloscopes more often use digital signal sampling. Samples feed fast analog-to-digital converters, following which all signal processing (and storage) is digital.\n\nMany oscilloscopes accommodate plug-in modules for different purposes, e.g.,&nbsp;high-sensitivity amplifiers of relatively narrow bandwidth, differential amplifiers, amplifiers with four or more channels, sampling plugins for repetitive signals of very high frequency, and special-purpose plugins, including audio/ultrasonic spectrum analyzers, and stable-offset-voltage direct-coupled channels with relatively high gain.\n\n===Examples of use===\n[[Image:Lissajous figures on oscilloscope (90&nbsp;degrees phase shift).gif|thumb|right|300px|[[Lissajous curve|Lissajous figures]] on an oscilloscope, with 90&nbsp;degrees phase difference between ''x'' and ''y''&nbsp;inputs]]\n\nOne of the most frequent uses of scopes is [[troubleshooting]] malfunctioning electronic equipment. For example, where a [[voltmeter]] may show a totally unexpected voltage, a scope may reveal that the circuit is oscillating. In other cases the precise shape or timing of a pulse is important.\n\nIn a piece of electronic equipment, for example, the connections between stages (e.g., [[electronic mixer]]s, [[electronic oscillator]]s, [[amplifier]]s) may be 'probed' for the expected signal, using the scope as a simple signal tracer. If the expected signal is absent or incorrect, some preceding stage of the electronics is not operating correctly. Since most failures occur because of a single faulty component, each measurement can show that some of the stages of a complex piece of equipment either work, or probably did not cause the fault.\n\nOnce the faulty stage is found, further probing can usually tell a skilled technician exactly which component has failed. Once the component is replaced, the unit can be restored to service, or at least the next fault can be isolated. This sort of troubleshooting is typical of radio and TV&nbsp;receivers, as well as audio amplifiers, but can apply to quite-different devices such as electronic motor drives.\n\nAnother use is to check newly designed circuitry. Often, a newly designed circuit misbehaves because of design errors, bad voltage levels, electrical noise etc. Digital electronics usually operate from a clock, so a dual-trace scope showing both the clock signal and a test signal dependent upon the clock is useful. Storage scopes are helpful for \"capturing\" rare electronic events that cause defective operation.\n\n====Pictures of use====\n<!-- These are not well described. We need better pictures. Agreed!

Some oscilloscopes can trigger and decode serial bus messages, such as the [[CAN bus]] commonly used in automotive applications.\n\n===Selection===\nFor work at high frequencies and with fast digital signals, the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the vertical amplifiers and sampling rate must be high enough. For general-purpose use, a bandwidth of at least 100&nbsp;MHz is usually satisfactory. A much lower bandwidth is sufficient for audio-frequency applications only.\nA useful sweep range is from one second to 100&nbsp;nanoseconds, with appropriate triggering and (for analog instruments) sweep delay. A well-designed, stable trigger circuit is required for a steady display. The chief benefit of a quality oscilloscope is the quality of the trigger circuit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nKey selection criteria of a DSO (apart from input bandwidth) are the sample memory depth and sample rate. Early DSOs in the mid- to late 1990s only had a few KB of sample memory per channel. This is adequate for basic waveform display, but does not allow detailed examination of the waveform or inspection of long data packets for example. Even entry-level (<$500) modern DSOs now have 1&nbsp;MB or more of sample memory per channel, and this has become the expected minimum in any modern DSO.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Often this sample memory is shared between channels, and can sometimes only be fully available at lower sample rates. At the highest sample rates, the memory may be limited to a few tens of KB.<ref name=DSOtutorial>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=David|title=DSO Tutorial|url=http://www.eevblog.com/2009/06/17/eevblog-13-part-1-of-2-digital-storage-oscilloscope-tutorial/|publisher=EEVblog|accessdate=30 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128160141/http://www.eevblog.com/2009/06/17/eevblog-13-part-1-of-2-digital-storage-oscilloscope-tutorial/|archivedate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\nAny modern \"real-time\" sample rate DSO typically has 5\u201310 times the input bandwidth in sample rate.

The theoretical minimum sample rate required, using SinX/x interpolation, is 2.5 times the bandwidth.<ref name=\"samplerate\">{{cite web|url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5990-9923EN.pdf|title=Minimum Required Sample Rate for a 1-GHz Bandwidth Oscilloscope|website=keysight.com|publisher=Keysight Technologies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616103451/http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5990-9923EN.pdf|archivedate=16 June 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnalog oscilloscopes have been almost totally displaced by digital storage scopes except for use exclusively at lower frequencies. Greatly increased sample rates have largely eliminated the display of incorrect signals, known as \"aliasing\", which was sometimes present in the first generation of digital scopes. The problem can still occur when, for example, viewing a short section of a repetitive waveform that repeats at intervals thousands of times longer than the section viewed (for example a short synchronization pulse at the beginning of a particular television line), with an oscilloscope that cannot store the extremely large number of samples between one instance of the short section and the next.\n\nThe used test equipment market, particularly on-line auction venues, typically has a wide selection of older analog scopes available. However it is becoming more difficult to obtain replacement parts for these instruments, and repair services are generally unavailable from the original manufacturer. Used instruments are usually out of calibration, and recalibration by companies with the equipment and expertise usually costs more than the second-hand value of the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n{{As of|2007}}, a 350&nbsp;MHz bandwidth (BW), 2.5&nbsp;gigasamples per second (GS/s), dual-channel digital storage scope costs about US$7000 new.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn the lowest end, an inexpensive hobby-grade single-channel DSO could be purchased for under $90 as of June 2011. These often have limited bandwidth and other facilities, but fulfill the basic functions of an oscilloscope.\n\n===Software===\nMany oscilloscopes today provide one or more external interfaces to allow remote [[instrument control]] by external software. These interfaces (or buses) include [[GPIB]], [[Ethernet]], [[serial port]], and [[USB]].\n\n==Types and models==\n{{Main|Oscilloscope types}}\nThe following section is a brief summary of various types and models available. For a detailed discussion, refer to the other article.\n\n===Cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO)===\n{{details|Oscilloscope types#Cathode-ray oscilloscope}}\n[[File:Lissajous-Figur 1 zu 3 (Oszilloskop).jpg|thumb|Example of an analog oscilloscope Lissajous figure, showing a harmonic relationship of 1 horizontal oscillation cycle to 3 vertical oscillation cycles]]\n[[File:Vectorscope.jpg|thumb|For [[analog television]], an analog oscilloscope can be used as a [[vectorscope]] to analyze complex signal properties, such as this display of [[SMPTE color bars]].]]\n\nThe earliest and simplest type of oscilloscope consisted of a [[cathode ray tube]], a vertical [[amplifier]], a timebase, a horizontal amplifier and a [[electronic power supply|power supply]]. These are now called \"analog\" scopes to distinguish them from the \"digital\" scopes that became common in the 1990s and later.\n\nAnalog scopes do not necessarily include a calibrated reference grid for size measurement of waves, and they may not display waves in the traditional sense of a line segment sweeping from left to right. Instead, they could be used for signal analysis by feeding a reference signal into one axis and the signal to measure into the other axis. For an oscillating reference and measurement signal, this results in a complex looping pattern referred to as a [[Lissajous curve]]. The shape of the curve can be interpreted to identify properties of the measurement signal in relation to the reference signal, and is useful across a wide range of oscillation frequencies.\n\n=== Dual-beam oscilloscope ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cathode ray tube]] (Was also edited here.) -->\n\nThe dual-beam analog oscilloscope can display two signals simultaneously. A special dual-beam [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] generates and deflects two separate beams. Multi-trace analog oscilloscopes can simulate a dual-beam display with chop and alternate sweeps\u2014but those features do not provide simultaneous displays. (Real time digital oscilloscopes offer the same benefits of a dual-beam oscilloscope, but they do not require a dual-beam display.) The disadvantages of the dual trace oscilloscope are that it cannot switch quickly between traces, and cannot capture two fast transient events. A dual ''beam'' oscilloscope avoids those problems.\n\n===Analog storage oscilloscope===\n{{details|Cathode ray tube#Oscilloscope CRTs}}\n{{details|Oscilloscope types#Analog storage oscilloscope}}\nTrace storage is an extra feature available on some analog scopes; they used direct-view storage CRTs. Storage allows a trace pattern that normally would decay in a fraction of a second to remain on the screen for several minutes or longer. An electrical circuit can then be deliberately activated to store and erase the trace on the screen.\n\n===Digital oscilloscopes===\n{{main|Digital storage oscilloscope}}\n\nWhile analog devices use continually varying voltages, digital devices use numbers that correspond to samples of the voltage. In the case of digital oscilloscopes, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) changes the measured voltages into digital information.\n\nThe digital storage oscilloscope, or DSO for short, is the standard type of oscilloscope today for the majority of industrial applications, and thanks to the low costs of entry-level oscilloscopes even for hobbyists. It replaces the electrostatic storage method in analog storage scopes with digital [[computer memory|memory]], which stores sample data as long as required without degradation and displays it without the brightness issues of storage-type CRTs. It also allows complex processing of the signal by high-speed [[digital signal processing]] circuits.<ref name=Kul03/>\n\nA standard DSO is limited to capturing signals with a bandwidth of less than half the sampling rate of the ADC (called the ''Nyquist limit''). There is a variation of the DSO called the ''digital sampling oscilloscope'' which can exceed this limit for certain types of signal, such as high-speed communications signals, where the waveform consists of repeating pulses. This type of DSO deliberately samples at a much lower frequency than the Nyquist limit and then uses signal processing to reconstruct a composite view of a typical pulse. <ref>{{Citation |first=Leslie |last=Green |url=http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4346463/The-alias-theorems-practical-undersampling-for-expert-engineers |title=The alias theorems: practical undersampling for expert engineers |journal=EDN |date=June 21, 2001 |accessdate=11 October 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173536/http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4346463/The-alias-theorems-practical-undersampling-for-expert-engineers |archivedate=20 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Mixed-signal oscilloscopes===\nA mixed-signal oscilloscope (or MSO) has two kinds of inputs, a small number of analog channels (typically two or four), and a larger number of digital channels (typically sixteen). It provides the ability to accurately time-correlate analog and digital channels, thus offering a distinct advantage over a separate oscilloscope and logic analyser. Typically, digital channels may be grouped and displayed as a bus with each bus value displayed at the bottom of the display in hex or binary. On most MSOs, the trigger can be set across both analog and digital channels.\n\n===Mixed-domain oscilloscopes===\nA mixed-domain oscilloscope (MDO) is an oscilloscope that comes with an additional RF input which is solely used for dedicated FFT-based [[spectrum analyzer]] functionality. Often, this RF input offers a higher bandwidth than the conventional analog input channels. This is in contrast to the FFT functionality of conventional digital oscilloscopes which use the normal analog inputs.\nSome MDOs allow time-correlation of events in the time domain (like a specific serial data package) with events happening in the frequency domain (like RF transmissions).\n\n===Handheld oscilloscopes===\n\n{{details|Oscilloscope types#Handheld oscilloscopes}}\nHandheld oscilloscopes are useful for many test and field service applications. Today, a hand held oscilloscope is usually a [[#Digital oscilloscopes|digital sampling oscilloscope]], using a [[liquid crystal]] display.\n\nMany hand-held and bench oscilloscopes have the ground reference voltage common to all input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the shared default reference is the \"earth\". If there is no differential preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user breaks the ground pin in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope in an attempt to isolate the signal common from the earth ground. This practice is unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet connects into the circuit. It is also a hazard to break a safety ground connection, and instruction manuals strongly advise against it.)\n\nSome models of oscilloscope have isolated inputs, where the signal reference level terminals are not connected together. Each input channel can be used to make a \"floating\" measurement with an independent signal reference level. Measurements can be made without tying one side of the oscilloscope input to the circuit signal common or ground reference.\n\nThe isolation available is categorized as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Overvoltage category !! Operating voltage (effective value of AC/DC to ground) !! Peak instantaneous voltage (repeated 20 times) !!

This can be in the form of a standalone oscilloscope with internal PC platform (PC mainboard), or as external oscilloscope which connects through [[USB]] or [[LAN]] to a separate PC or laptop.\n\n===Related instruments===\nA large number of instruments used in a variety of technical fields are really oscilloscopes with inputs, calibration, controls, display calibration, etc., specialized and optimized for a particular application. Examples of such oscilloscope-based instruments include [[waveform monitor]]s for analyzing video levels in [[television production]]s and medical devices such as vital function monitors and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram instruments. In automobile repair, an ignition analyzer is used to show the spark waveforms for each cylinder. All of these are essentially oscilloscopes, performing the basic task of showing the changes in one or more input signals over time in an ''X''\u2011''Y'' display.\n\nOther instruments convert the results of their measurements to a repetitive electrical signal, and incorporate an oscilloscope as a display element. Such complex measurement systems include [[spectrum analyzer]]s, transistor analyzers, and [[time domain reflectometer]]s (TDRs). Unlike an oscilloscope, these instruments automatically generate stimulus or sweep a measurement parameter.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Eye pattern]]\n* [[Phonodeik]]\n* ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', an oscilloscope game\n* [[Time-domain reflectometry]]\n* [[Vectorscope]]\n* [[Waveform monitor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite patent\n |inventor-last = Kobbe\n |inventor-first= John R.\n |inventor2-last= Polits\n |inventor2-first= William J.\n |title= Electrical Probe\n |issue-date= April 21, 1959\n |year= 1959\n |country-code= US\n |patent-number= 2883619\n |doi=}}\n* {{Citation\n |last= Tektronix\n |title= Tek Products\n |year= 1983\n |publisher= Tektronix\n |isbn=\n |doi=}}\n* {{Citation\n |last=Tektronix\n |title= Measurement Products Catalog 1998/1999\n |year= 1998\n |publisher= Tektronix\n |isbn=\n |doi=}}\n* {{Citation\n |last= Wedlock\n |first= Bruce D.\n |author-link=\n |last2= Roberge\n |first2= James K.\n |author2-link=\n |title= Electronic Components and Measurements\n |year= 1969\n |pages= 150\u2013152\n |publisher= Prentice-Hall\n |isbn= 0-13-250464-2\n |doi=}}\n* {{cite patent\n |inventor-last = Zeidlhack\n |inventor-first= Donald F.\n |inventor2-last= White\n |inventor2-first= Richard K.\n |title= Transmission Line Termination Circuit\n |issue-date= October 6, 1970\n |country-code= US\n |patent-number= 3532982\n |doi=}}\n\n<!-- Apologies for not using the proper format. _Encyclopedia On Cathode-Ray Oscilloscopes and Their Uses_, by John F.
