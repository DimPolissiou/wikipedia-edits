The first season, comprising 52 episodes, each seven minutes long, was dubbed into English. The second, third, and fourth seasons have not been dubbed into English yet. The series is a CGI cartoon by R\u00e9mi Chapotot and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Henry and produced by Cube Creative associated with [[Blue Spirit]]. The series has been airing from June 6, 2010 on [[Canal+ Family]], [[Canal+]] and [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon+]], and also started airing from September 2017 on [[C8 (TV channel)|C8]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/KaelooOfficiel/posts/1570059306337471|title=Kaeloo|website=facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-05}}</ref> In Canada, it first aired on Teletoon (Canada) on 10 August 2014, but it was then removed on 1 May 2016.\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Kaeloo''': The main character, whom the show is named after. She is a sweet and imaginative but emotionally unstable frog who's always looking for games to play with her \"buddies\". With provocation, Kaeloo enters an intense rage that transforms her into the hulking \"Bad Kaeloo\".  Throughout the series, it is heavily implied that Kaeloo may have a crush on Mr. Cat, who also happens to have a crush on her. She is female in most of the dubs of the series; however, the Serbian and Hindi dubs, as well as the first 10 episodes in the English dub have her re-written as male, with the former three dubs editing out any suggestive scene between her and Mr. Cat.\n* '''Stumpy''': Uneducated and immature, Stumpy the squirrel loves anything that is dangerous. He has little to no sense of reality and is not very intelligent. He is fascinated by adventure, explosions, superpowers, intergalactic wars and the like. Stumpy aspires to be like his idol, comic book hero Mr. Coolskin. He hates books without pictures, being made fun of, other people touching his things, and washing. Whenever he doesn't understand something (which is often), is afraid or otherwise agitated, he spouts gibberish as his neck spasms erratically.\n* '''Quack-Quack''': Whilst still in his egg, his parents were killed by a hunter. He was taken into a laboratory as a duckling and repeatedly experimented on. He was made indestructible, intelligent, extremely lucky and addicted to yogurt. He is afraid of three things: doctors, never finding his creator and expired yogurt. He is incapable of speech, only able to say \"quack\", and is Mr. Cat's favorite punching bag.\n* '''Mr. Cat''': A proud, macho, perverted, alcoholic, sadomasochistic, selfish, cruel, greedy cat who always wants to win, whatever the means and is even willing to cheat to do so. His inflated ego and overall foul attitude attract negative attention from the others. He especially enjoys torturing Quack-Quack, which upsets Kaeloo and is the usual cause of her transformation into Bad Kaeloo. Despite (or perhaps because of) Kaeloo's transformations, he seems to have developed a crush on her; the feeling is reciprocated, and while they are not officially a couple, the other characters often talk about their feelings for each other and about them becoming a couple. As a result of this crush, he occasionally tries to make romantic advances towards her, which she rejects; in cases where Kaeloo makes advances on him, he also rejects her for unknown reasons. It is implied in several episodes that he had an extremely difficult past and had terrible relationships with his family, especially his brothers. Over the course of the series, however, he does become much nicer while still retaining his greedy self.\n* '''Bad Kaeloo''': The hulking, massive toad into which Kaeloo transforms when angry or threatened. While Kaeloo has stated in an early episode that the transformations must be triggered by anger, she has been seen in several episodes deliberately taking this form to cheat at games that require a level of physical prowess or to intimidate others. The transformations seem to be accompanied by a profound drop in intellectual capacity and reasoning, later followed by remorse once she returns to her \"normal\" form. This implies that Bad Kaeloo's actions are usually beyond her conscious control. It is hinted at in one episode that this personality will become the dominant one later in her life.\n\nThe second season of the show, which aired in France but was not yet dubbed into English, introduced a few secondary characters:\n* '''Pretty''': A narcissistic, selfish and annoying female rabbit who is obsessed with fashion and all things stereotypically \"girly\". Pretty has a crush on Mr. Cat, but the feeling is not reciprocated.\n* '''Eugly''': Pretty's fraternal twin sister, who is the opposite of her. She is fat and ugly, but she is extremely kind. Eugly is very emotional, and will burst into tears at even the slightest insult. She eventually becomes Quack Quack's girlfriend.\n* '''Olaf''': An emperor penguin whose goal in life is to rule the world and cover it in ice. He is \"married\" to an ice cube, named Olga, and he owns a robot named Serguei. He used to live with many other emperor penguins, who ostracized him for wishing to marry an ice cube.\n\n==Episodes==\nKaeloo was originally a three-minute short film animation created in 2007, titled ''Red Light, Green Light, 1, 2, 3''<ref>http://www.cube-creative.en/index.php?t=m&fid=18&l=en&lf=18,132,204,257</ref> and presented to the MIP TV in the same year. It is widely considered the pilot of the series.\n\nThe episode ''Let's Play the Quest for the Wholly Gruel (La Qu\u00eate du Greul)'' was released to the Annecy Animation Festival 2010 in 3D.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaeloo.fr/news/3/kaeloo-en-relief-a-annecy-2010 |title=Kaeloo en relief \u00e0 Annecy 2010 |publisher=Kaeloo.fr |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2011-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331194027/http://www.kaeloo.fr/news/3/kaeloo-en-relief-a-annecy-2010 |archive-date=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Season 1===\n#Let's Play Prison-Ball: The buddies are playing prison-ball, with Kaeloo and Quack Quack in one team and Mr. Cat and Stumpy in the other.

The first season, comprising 52 episodes, each seven minutes long, was dubbed into English. The second, third, and fourth seasons have not been dubbed into English yet. The series is a CGI cartoon by R\u00e9mi Chapotot and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Henry and produced by Cube Creative associated with [[Blue Spirit]]. The series has been airing from June 6, 2010 on [[Canal+ Family]], [[Canal+]] and [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon+]], and also started airing from September 2017 on [[C8 (TV channel)|C8]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/KaelooOfficiel/posts/1570059306337471|title=Kaeloo|website=facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-05}}</ref> In Canada, it first aired on Teletoon (Canada) on 10 August 2014, but it was then removed on 1 May 2016.\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Kaeloo''': The main character, whom the show is named after. She is a sweet and imaginative but emotionally unstable frog who's always looking for games to play with her \"buddies\". With provocation, Kaeloo enters an intense rage that transforms her into the hulking \"Bad Kaeloo\".  Throughout the series, it is heavily implied that Kaeloo may have a crush on Mr. Cat, who also happens to have a crush on her. She is female in most of the dubs of the series; however, the Serbian and Hindi dubs, as well as the first 10 episodes in the English dub have her re-written as male, with the former three dubs editing out any suggestive scene between her and Mr. Cat.\n* '''Stumpy''': Uneducated and immature, Stumpy the squirrel loves anything that is dangerous. He has little to no sense of reality and is not very intelligent. He is fascinated by adventure, explosions, superpowers, intergalactic wars and the like. Stumpy aspires to be like his idol, comic book hero Mr. Coolskin. He hates books without pictures, being made fun of, other people touching his things, and washing. Whenever he doesn't understand something (which is often), is afraid or otherwise agitated, he spouts gibberish as his neck spasms erratically.\n* '''Quack-Quack''': Whilst still in his egg, his parents were killed by a hunter. He was taken into a laboratory as a duckling and repeatedly experimented on. He was made indestructible, intelligent, extremely lucky and addicted to yogurt. He is afraid of three things: doctors, never finding his creator and expired yogurt. He is incapable of speech, only able to say \"quack\", and is Mr. Cat's favorite punching bag.\n* '''Mr. Cat''': A proud, macho, perverted, alcoholic, sadomasochistic, selfish, cruel, greedy cat who always wants to win, whatever the means and is even willing to cheat to do so. His inflated ego and overall foul attitude attract negative attention from the others. He especially enjoys torturing Quack-Quack, which upsets Kaeloo and is the usual cause of her transformation into Bad Kaeloo. Despite (or perhaps because of) Kaeloo's transformations, he seems to have developed a crush on her; the feeling is reciprocated, and while they are not officially a couple, the other characters often talk about their feelings for each other and about them becoming a couple. As a result of this crush, he occasionally tries to make romantic advances towards her, which she rejects; in cases where Kaeloo makes advances on him, he also rejects her for unknown reasons. It is implied in several episodes that he had an extremely difficult past and had terrible relationships with his family, especially his brothers. Over the course of the series, however, he does become much nicer while still retaining his greedy self.\n* '''Bad Kaeloo''': The hulking, massive toad into which Kaeloo transforms when angry or threatened. While Kaeloo has stated in an early episode that the transformations must be triggered by anger, she has been seen in several episodes deliberately taking this form to cheat at games that require a level of physical prowess or to intimidate others. The transformations seem to be accompanied by a profound drop in intellectual capacity and reasoning, later followed by remorse once she returns to her \"normal\" form. This implies that Bad Kaeloo's actions are usually beyond her conscious control. It is hinted at in one episode that this personality will become the dominant one later in her life.\n\nThe second season of the show, which aired in France but was not yet dubbed into English, introduced a few secondary characters:\n* '''Pretty''': A narcissistic, selfish and annoying female rabbit who is obsessed with fashion and all things stereotypically \"girly\". Pretty has a crush on Mr. Cat, but the feeling is not reciprocated.\n* '''Eugly''': Pretty's fraternal twin sister, who is the opposite of her. She is fat and ugly, but she is extremely kind. Eugly is very emotional, and will burst into tears at even the slightest insult. She eventually becomes Quack Quack's girlfriend.\n* '''Olaf''': An emperor penguin whose goal in life is to rule the world and cover it in ice. He is \"married\" to an ice cube, named Olga, and he owns a robot named Serguei. He used to live with many other emperor penguins, who ostracized him for wishing to marry an ice cube.\n\n==Episodes==\nKaeloo was originally a three-minute short film animation created in 2007, titled ''Red Light, Green Light, 1, 2, 3''<ref>http://www.cube-creative.en/index.php?t=m&fid=18&l=en&lf=18,132,204,257</ref> and presented to the MIP TV in the same year. It is widely considered the pilot of the series.\n\nThe episode ''Let's Play the Quest for the Wholly Gruel (La Qu\u00eate du Greul)'' was released to the Annecy Animation Festival 2010 in 3D.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaeloo.fr/news/3/kaeloo-en-relief-a-annecy-2010 |title=Kaeloo en relief \u00e0 Annecy 2010 |publisher=Kaeloo.fr |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2011-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331194027/http://www.kaeloo.fr/news/3/kaeloo-en-relief-a-annecy-2010 |archive-date=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Season 1===\n#Let's Play Prison-Ball: The buddies are playing prison-ball, with Kaeloo and Quack Quack in one team and Mr. Cat and Stumpy in the other.

As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961.

On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the illusion of superabundance.

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn 1960, at least some degree of drought and other bad weather affected 55% of cultivated land, while an estimated 60% of agricultural land in northern China received no rain at all.<ref name=\"Atimes\">{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Henry C K|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|title=Part 2: The Great Leap Forward not all bad|date=1 April 2004|work=[[Asia Times]] online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204085928/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|archive-date=4 February 2005}}</ref> The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] yearbooks from 1958 to 1962 also reported abnormal weather, followed by droughts and floods based on Chinese government sources.

In July 1959, the [[Yellow River]] flooded in [[East China]]. According to the Disaster Center, the flood directly killed, either through starvation from crop failure or drowning, an estimated 2 million people, while other areas were affected in other ways as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|title=The Most Deadly 100 Natural Disasters of the 20th Century|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110082733/http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|access-date=4 July 2005}}</ref> [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]] argues that most floods were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed irrigation works which were part of the [[Great Leap Forward]].<ref name=\"Dikotter333\" /> At this time, China was building thousands of kilometers of new irrigation canals in an attempt to move water from wet areas to areas that were experiencing drought.\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn April and May 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref name=\":4\">[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Until the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. \n\nResearchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\nIn 2008, [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets :\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, government policies that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the increasing famine.  The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in many ways, including the illusion of superabundance.

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn 1960, at least some degree of drought and other bad weather affected 55% of cultivated land, while an estimated 60% of agricultural land in northern China received no rain at all.<ref name=\"Atimes\">{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Henry C K|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|title=Part 2: The Great Leap Forward not all bad|date=1 April 2004|work=[[Asia Times]] online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204085928/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|archive-date=4 February 2005}}</ref> The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] yearbooks from 1958 to 1962 also reported abnormal weather, followed by droughts and floods based on Chinese government sources.

In July 1959, the [[Yellow River]] flooded in [[East China]]. According to the Disaster Center, the flood directly killed, either through starvation from crop failure or drowning, an estimated 2 million people, while other areas were affected in other ways as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|title=The Most Deadly 100 Natural Disasters of the 20th Century|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110082733/http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|access-date=4 July 2005}}</ref> [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]] argues that most floods were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed irrigation works which were part of the [[Great Leap Forward]].<ref name=\"Dikotter333\" /> At this time, China was building thousands of kilometers of new irrigation canals in an attempt to move water from wet areas to areas that were experiencing drought.\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn April and May 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref name=\":4\">[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Until the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. \n\nResearchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

Another common hernia involves the [[Spinal disc herniation|spinal discs]] and causes ''[[sciatica]]''. A [[hiatus hernia]] occurs when the stomach protrudes into the ''[[mediastinum]]'' through the esophageal opening in the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].\n\nHernias may or may not present with either [[pain]] at the site, a visible or palpable lump, or in some cases more vague symptoms resulting from pressure on an organ which has become \"stuck\" in the hernia, sometimes leading to organ dysfunction. Fatty tissue usually enters a hernia first, but it may be followed or accompanied by an organ.\n\nHernias are caused by a disruption or opening in the fascia, or fibrous tissue, which forms the abdominal wall. It is possible for the bulge associated with a hernia to come and go, but the defect in the tissue will persist.\n\nSymptoms and signs vary depending on the type of hernia. Symptoms may or may not be present in some [[inguinal hernia]]s. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the [[groin]] or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt. When standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and swelling in the [[scrotum]] around the [[testicular]] area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inguinal-hernia/DS00364/DSECTION=symptoms|title=Symptoms|accessdate=2010-05-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213003240/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inguinal-hernia/DS00364/DSECTION%3Dsymptoms|archivedate=2010-02-13}}</ref>\n\nIrreducible abdominal hernias or incarcerated hernias may be painful, but their most relevant symptom is that they cannot return to the abdominal cavity when pushed in. They may be chronic, although painless, and can lead to strangulation (loss of blood supply), obstruction (kinking of intestine), or both. Strangulated hernias are always painful and pain is followed by tenderness. [[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], or [[fever]] may occur in these cases due to [[bowel]] obstruction. Also, the hernia bulge in this case may turn red, purple or dark and pink.\n\nIn the diagnosis of abdominal hernias, imaging is the principal means of detecting internal diaphragmatic and other nonpalpable or unsuspected hernias. Multidetector CT (MDCT) can show with precision the anatomic site of the hernia sac, the contents of the sac, and any complications. MDCT also offers clear detail of the abdominal wall allowing wall hernias to be identified accurately.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee HK, Park SJ, Yi BH |title=Multidetector CT reveals diverse variety of abdominal hernias |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=27\u201331 |year=2010 |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/ct/content/article/113619/1575055 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618055724/http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/ct/content/article/113619/1575055 |archivedate=2010-06-18 }}</ref>\n=== Complications ===\nComplications may arise post-operation, including rejection of the [[Surgical mesh|mesh]] that is used to repair the hernia. In the event of a mesh rejection, the mesh will very likely need to be removed. Mesh rejection can be detected by obvious, sometimes localized swelling and pain around the mesh area. Continuous discharge from the scar is likely for a while after the mesh has been removed.\n\nA surgically treated hernia can lead to complications such as [[inguinodynia]], while an untreated hernia may be complicated by:\n* [[Inflammation]]\n* [[Bowel obstruction|Obstruction]] of any lumen, such as [[bowel obstruction]] in intestinal hernias\n* [[Strangulation (bowel)|Strangulation]]\n* [[Hydrocele]] of the hernial sac\n* [[Haemorrhage|Hemorrhage]]\n* [[Autoimmune]] problems\n* [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|Irreducibility]] or Incarceration, in which it cannot be reduced, or pushed back into place,<ref name=WashingtonSurgery2008>{{cite book |author=Trudie A Goers; Washington University School of Medicine Department of Surgery; Klingensmith, Mary E; Li Ern Chen; Sean C Glasgow |title=The Washington manual of surgery |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7817-7447-5 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref> at least not without very much external effort.<ref>[http://onlinedictionary.datasegment.com/word/incarcerated onlinedictionary.datasegment.com > incarcerated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120045818/http://onlinedictionary.datasegment.com/word/incarcerated |date=2008-11-20 }} Citing: Webster 1913</ref> In intestinal hernias, this also substantially increases the risk of bowel obstruction and strangulation.\n\n==Causes==\nCauses of hiatus hernia vary depending on each individual. Among the multiple causes, however, are the mechanical causes which include: improper heavy weight lifting, hard [[coughing]] bouts, sharp blows to the abdomen, and incorrect [[Human position|posture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inguinalhernia.us/hiatal-hernia-causes.html| title=Hiatal Hernia Symptoms, Causes And Relation To Acid Reflux And Heartburn|accessdate=2010-05-24 |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028010841/http://www.inguinalhernia.us/hiatal-hernia-causes.html }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, conditions that increase the pressure of the abdominal cavity may also cause hernias or worsen the existing ones. Some examples would be: obesity, straining during a bowel movement or urination (constipation, [[enlarged prostate]]), [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic lung disease]], and also, fluid in the abdominal cavity ([[ascites]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hernia/page2_em.htm|title=Hernia Causes|accessdate=2010-05-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531073222/http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hernia/page2_em.htm|archivedate=2010-05-31}}</ref>\n\nAlso, if muscles are weakened due to [[poor nutrition]], [[smoking]], and [[overexertion]], hernias are more likely to occur.\n\nThe physiological school of thought contends that in the case of [[inguinal hernia]], the above-mentioned are only an [[anatomical]] symptom of the underlying [[physiological]] cause. They contend that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of [[aponeurotic]] extensions from the [[transversus abdominis]] aponeurotic arch.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Desarda MP |title=Surgical physiology of inguinal hernia repair\u2014a study of 200 cases |journal=BMC Surg |volume=3 |issue= |pages=2 |year=2003 |pmid=12697071 |pmc=155644 |doi=10.1186/1471-2482-3-2 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAbdominal wall hernia may occur due to trauma.

Inguinal hernias are further divided into the more common [[indirect inguinal hernia]] (2/3, depicted here), in which the inguinal canal is entered via a congenital weakness at its entrance (the internal inguinal ring), and the [[direct inguinal hernia]] type (1/3), where the hernia contents push through a weak spot in the back wall of the inguinal canal. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia in both men and women. In some selected cases, they may require [[inguinal hernia surgery|surgery]].  There are special cases in which the hernia may contain both direct and indirect hernia simultaneously [[pantaloon hernia]], or, though very rare, may contain simultaneous indirect hernias.<ref name=\"JPSCR13\">{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Riley|title=An unexpected finding during an inguinal herniorrhaphy: report of an indirect hernia with two hernia sacs|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery Case Reports|date=2013|volume=1|issue=10|pages=331\u2013332|doi=10.1016/j.epsc.2013.09.002|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nPantaloon hernia (Saddle Bag hernia) is a combined direct and indirect hernia, when the hernial sac protrudes on either side of the [[inferior epigastric vessels]].\n\n===Femoral===\n{{main article|femoral hernia}}\nFemoral hernias occur just below the [[inguinal ligament]], when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the [[femoral canal]]. They can be hard to distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and [[inguinal hernia]].\n\nA ''Cooper's hernia'' is a femoral hernia with two sacs, the first being in the femoral canal, and the second passing through a defect in the superficial fascia and appearing almost immediately beneath the skin.\n\n===Umbilical===\n{{main article|Umbilical hernia}}\nThey involve protrusion of intra-abdominal contents through a weakness at the site of passage of the [[umbilical cord]] through the [[abdominal wall]]. \nUmbilical hernias in adults are largely acquired, and are more frequent in [[obese]] or [[pregnant]] women. Abnormal decussation of fibers at the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] may contribute.\n\n===Incisional===\n{{main article|incisional hernia}}\nAn incisional hernia occurs when the defect is the result of an incompletely healed surgical wound. When these occur in median [[laparotomy]] incisions in the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]], they are termed [[ventral hernia]]s. These can be the most frustrating and difficult to treat, as the repair utilizes already attenuated tissue. These occur in about 13% of people at 2 years following surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bosanquet |first1=DC |last2=Ansell |first2=J |last3=Abdelrahman |first3=T |last4=Cornish |first4=J |last5=Harries |first5=R |last6=Stimpson |first6=A |last7=Davies |first7=L |last8=Glasbey |first8=JC |last9=Frewer |first9=KA |last10=Frewer |first10=NC |last11=Russell |first11=D |last12=Russell |first12=I |last13=Torkington |first13=J |title=Systematic Review and Meta-Regression of Factors Affecting Midline Incisional Hernia Rates: Analysis of 14,618 Patients. |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2015 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=e0138745 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138745 |pmid=26389785|pmc=4577082 }}</ref>\n\n===Diaphragmatic===\n{{main article|diaphragmatic hernia}}\n[[Image:Hiatalhernia.gif|thumb|Diagram of a [[hiatus hernia]] ([[Anatomical position|coronal section]], viewed from the front).]]\nHigher in the abdomen, an (internal) \"diaphragmatic hernia\" results when part of the stomach or intestine protrudes into the chest cavity through a defect in the diaphragm.\n\nA [[hiatus hernia]] is a particular variant of this type, in which the normal passageway through which the esophagus meets the stomach ([[Diaphragm (anatomy)|esophageal hiatus]]) serves as a functional \"defect\", allowing part of the [[stomach]] to (periodically) \"herniate\" into the chest. Hiatus hernias may be either \"''sliding''\", in which the [[Esophagus|gastroesophageal junction]] itself slides through the defect into the [[chest]], or non-sliding (also known as ''para-esophageal''), in which case the junction remains fixed while another portion of the stomach moves up through the defect. Non-sliding or para-esophageal hernias can be dangerous as they may allow the stomach to rotate and obstruct. Repair is usually advised.\n\nA [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]] is a distinct problem, occurring in up to 1 in 2000 births, and requiring [[pediatric surgery]]. Intestinal organs may herniate through several parts of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], posterolateral (in [[Vincenc Bochdalek|Bochdalek]]'s triangle, resulting in ''Bochdalek's hernia''), or anteromedial-retrosternal (in the cleft of [[Dominique Jean Larrey|Larrey]]/[[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Morgagni's]] foramen, resulting in ''Morgagni-Larrey hernia'', or [[Morgagni's hernia]]).<ref>Arr\u00e1ez-Aybar, L.

Time needed for recovery after treatment is reduced if hernias are operated on [[laparoscopy|laparoscopically]]. However, open surgery can be done sometimes without general anesthesia. \n\nUncomplicated hernias are principally repaired by pushing back, or \"reducing\", the herniated tissue, and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue (an operation called [[Hernia repair|herniorrhaphy]]).

At times staples are used to keep the mesh in place. These [[Inguinal hernia repair#Mesh repairs|mesh repair methods]] are often called \"tension free\" repairs because, unlike some suture methods (e.g., Shouldice), muscle is not pulled together under tension. However, this widely used terminology is misleading, as there are many [[Inguinal hernia repair#Tension-free repairs|tension-free suture methods]] that do not use mesh (e.g., Desarda, Guarnieri, Lipton-Estrin, etc.).\n\nEvidence suggests that tension-free methods (with or without mesh) often have lower percentage of recurrences and the fastest recovery period compared to [[Inguinal hernia repair#Tension repairs|tension suture methods]].

Another common hernia involves the [[Spinal disc herniation|spinal discs]] and causes ''[[sciatica]]''. A [[hiatus hernia]] occurs when the stomach protrudes into the ''[[mediastinum]]'' through the esophageal opening in the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].\n\nHernias may or may not present with either [[pain]] at the site, a visible or palpable lump, or in some cases more vague symptoms resulting from pressure on an organ which has become \"stuck\" in the hernia, sometimes leading to organ dysfunction. Fatty tissue usually enters a hernia first, but it may be followed or accompanied by an organ.\n\nHernias are caused by a disruption or opening in the fascia, or fibrous tissue, which forms the abdominal wall. It is possible for the bulge associated with a hernia to come and go, but the defect in the tissue will persist.\n\nSymptoms and signs vary depending on the type of hernia. Symptoms may or may not be present in some [[inguinal hernia]]s. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the [[groin]] or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt. When standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and swelling in the [[scrotum]] around the [[testicular]] area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inguinal-hernia/DS00364/DSECTION=symptoms|title=Symptoms|accessdate=2010-05-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213003240/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inguinal-hernia/DS00364/DSECTION%3Dsymptoms|archivedate=2010-02-13}}</ref>\n\nIrreducible abdominal hernias or incarcerated hernias may be painful, but their most relevant symptom is that they cannot return to the abdominal cavity when pushed in. They may be chronic, although painless, and can lead to strangulation (loss of blood supply), obstruction (kinking of intestine), or both. Strangulated hernias are always painful and pain is followed by tenderness. [[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], or [[fever]] may occur in these cases due to [[bowel]] obstruction. Also, the hernia bulge in this case may turn red, purple or dark and pink.\n\nIn the diagnosis of abdominal hernias, imaging is the principal means of detecting internal diaphragmatic and other nonpalpable or unsuspected hernias. Multidetector CT (MDCT) can show with precision the anatomic site of the hernia sac, the contents of the sac, and any complications. MDCT also offers clear detail of the abdominal wall allowing wall hernias to be identified accurately.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee HK, Park SJ, Yi BH |title=Multidetector CT reveals diverse variety of abdominal hernias |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=27\u201331 |year=2010 |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/ct/content/article/113619/1575055 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618055724/http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/ct/content/article/113619/1575055 |archivedate=2010-06-18 }}</ref>\n=== Complications ===\nComplications may arise post-operation, including rejection of the [[Surgical mesh|mesh]] that is used to repair the hernia. In the event of a mesh rejection, the mesh will very likely need to be removed. Mesh rejection can be detected by obvious, sometimes localized swelling and pain around the mesh area. Continuous discharge from the scar is likely for a while after the mesh has been removed.\n\nA surgically treated hernia can lead to complications such as [[inguinodynia]], while an untreated hernia may be complicated by:\n* [[Inflammation]]\n* [[Bowel obstruction|Obstruction]] of any lumen, such as [[bowel obstruction]] in intestinal hernias\n* [[Strangulation (bowel)|Strangulation]]\n* [[Hydrocele]] of the hernial sac\n* [[Haemorrhage|Hemorrhage]]\n* [[Autoimmune]] problems\n* [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|Irreducibility]] or Incarceration, in which it cannot be reduced, or pushed back into place,<ref name=WashingtonSurgery2008>{{cite book |author=Trudie A Goers; Washington University School of Medicine Department of Surgery; Klingensmith, Mary E; Li Ern Chen; Sean C Glasgow |title=The Washington manual of surgery |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7817-7447-5 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref> at least not without very much external effort.<ref>[http://onlinedictionary.datasegment.com/word/incarcerated onlinedictionary.datasegment.com > incarcerated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120045818/http://onlinedictionary.datasegment.com/word/incarcerated |date=2008-11-20 }} Citing: Webster 1913</ref> In intestinal hernias, this also substantially increases the risk of bowel obstruction and strangulation.\n\n==Causes==\nCauses of hiatus hernia vary depending on each individual.

Inguinal hernias are further divided into the more common [[indirect inguinal hernia]] (2/3, depicted here), in which the inguinal canal is entered via a congenital weakness at its entrance (the internal inguinal ring), and the [[direct inguinal hernia]] type (1/3), where the hernia contents push through a weak spot in the back wall of the inguinal canal. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia in both men and women. In some selected cases, they may require [[inguinal hernia surgery|surgery]].  There are special cases in which the hernia may contain both direct and indirect hernia simultaneously [[pantaloon hernia]], or, though very rare, may contain simultaneous indirect hernias.<ref name=\"JPSCR13\">{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Riley|title=An unexpected finding during an inguinal herniorrhaphy: report of an indirect hernia with two hernia sacs|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery Case Reports|date=2013|volume=1|issue=10|pages=331\u2013332|doi=10.1016/j.epsc.2013.09.002|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nPantaloon hernia (Saddle Bag hernia) is a combined direct and indirect hernia, when the hernial sac protrudes on either side of the [[inferior epigastric vessels]].\n\n===Femoral===\n{{main article|femoral hernia}}\nFemoral hernias occur just below the [[inguinal ligament]], when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the [[femoral canal]]. They can be hard to distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and [[inguinal hernia]].\n\nA ''Cooper's hernia'' is a femoral hernia with two sacs, the first being in the femoral canal, and the second passing through a defect in the superficial fascia and appearing almost immediately beneath the skin.\n\n===Umbilical===\n{{main article|Umbilical hernia}}\nThey involve protrusion of intra-abdominal contents through a weakness at the site of passage of the [[umbilical cord]] through the [[abdominal wall]]. \nUmbilical hernias in adults are largely acquired, and are more frequent in [[obese]] or [[pregnant]] women. Abnormal decussation of fibers at the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] may contribute.\n\n===Incisional===\n{{main article|incisional hernia}}\nAn incisional hernia occurs when the defect is the result of an incompletely healed surgical wound. When these occur in median [[laparotomy]] incisions in the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]], they are termed [[ventral hernia]]s. These can be the most frustrating and difficult to treat, as the repair utilizes already attenuated tissue. These occur in about 13% of people at 2 years following surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bosanquet |first1=DC |last2=Ansell |first2=J |last3=Abdelrahman |first3=T |last4=Cornish |first4=J |last5=Harries |first5=R |last6=Stimpson |first6=A |last7=Davies |first7=L |last8=Glasbey |first8=JC |last9=Frewer |first9=KA |last10=Frewer |first10=NC |last11=Russell |first11=D |last12=Russell |first12=I |last13=Torkington |first13=J |title=Systematic Review and Meta-Regression of Factors Affecting Midline Incisional Hernia Rates: Analysis of 14,618 Patients. |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2015 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=e0138745 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138745 |pmid=26389785|pmc=4577082 }}</ref>\n\n===Diaphragmatic===\n{{main article|diaphragmatic hernia}}\n[[Image:Hiatalhernia.gif|thumb|Diagram of a [[hiatus hernia]] ([[Anatomical position|coronal section]], viewed from the front).]]\nHigher in the abdomen, an (internal) \"diaphragmatic hernia\" results when part of the stomach or intestine protrudes into the chest cavity through a defect in the diaphragm.\n\nA [[hiatus hernia]] is a particular variant of this type, in which the normal passageway through which the esophagus meets the stomach ([[Diaphragm (anatomy)|esophageal hiatus]]) serves as a functional \"defect\", allowing part of the [[stomach]] to (periodically) \"herniate\" into the chest. Hiatus hernias may be either \"''sliding''\", in which the [[Esophagus|gastroesophageal junction]] itself slides through the defect into the [[chest]], or non-sliding (also known as ''para-esophageal''), in which case the junction remains fixed while another portion of the stomach moves up through the defect. Non-sliding or para-esophageal hernias can be dangerous as they may allow the stomach to rotate and obstruct. Repair is usually advised.\n\nA [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]] is a distinct problem, occurring in up to 1 in 2000 births, and requiring [[pediatric surgery]]. Intestinal organs may herniate through several parts of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], posterolateral (in [[Vincenc Bochdalek|Bochdalek]]'s triangle, resulting in ''Bochdalek's hernia''), or anteromedial-retrosternal (in the cleft of [[Dominique Jean Larrey|Larrey]]/[[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Morgagni's]] foramen, resulting in ''Morgagni-Larrey hernia'', or [[Morgagni's hernia]]).<ref>Arr\u00e1ez-Aybar, L.

It is named after French surgeon  [[Jean Louis Petit]] (1674\u20131750).\n**[[Grynfeltt's hernia]]: a hernia through Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle (superior lumbar triangle). It is named after physician Joseph Grynfeltt (1840\u20131913).\n*[[Maydl's hernia]]: two adjacent loops of small intestine are within a hernial sac with a tight neck. The intervening portion of bowel within the abdomen is deprived of its blood supply and eventually becomes necrotic.\n*[[Obturator hernia]]: hernia through [[obturator canal]]\n[[File:Colostomy and parastomal hernia.JPG|thumb|Patient with a [[colostomy]] complicated by a large parastomal hernia.]]\n*Parastomal hernias, which is when tissue protrudes adjacent to a [[stoma (medicine)|stoma]] tract.\n*[[Paraumbilical hernia]]: a type of umbilical hernia occurring in adults\n*[[Perineal hernia]]: a perineal hernia protrudes through the muscles and fascia of the perineal floor. It may be primary but usually is acquired following perineal prostatectomy, abdominoperineal resection of the rectum, or pelvic exenteration.\n*Properitoneal hernia: rare hernia located directly above the [[peritoneum]], for example, when part of an inguinal hernia projects from the [[deep inguinal ring]] to the preperitoneal space.\n*[[Richter's hernia]]: a hernia involving only one sidewall of the bowel, which can result in bowel strangulation leading to perforation through ischaemia without causing [[bowel obstruction]] or any of its warning signs. It is named after German surgeon [[August Gottlieb Richter]] (1742\u20131812).\n*[[Sliding hernia]]: occurs when an organ drags along part of the peritoneum, or, in other words, the organ is part of the hernia sac. The [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and the [[urinary bladder]] are often involved. The term also frequently refers to [[sliding hernias of the stomach]].\n*Sciatic hernia: this hernia in the [[greater sciatic foramen]] most commonly presents as an uncomfortable mass in the gluteal area. Bowel obstruction may also occur. This type of hernia is only a rare cause of [[sciatic]] neuralgia.\n*[[Sports hernia]]: a hernia characterized by chronic groin pain in athletes and a dilated [[superficial inguinal ring]].\n*[[Velpeau hernia]]: a hernia in the groin in front of the femoral blood vessels\n\n==Treatment==\n{{Main article|Hernia repair|Inguinal hernia surgery}}\n[[File:US Navy 081117-N-1512O-119 Lt.

Time needed for recovery after treatment is reduced if hernias are operated on [[laparoscopy|laparoscopically]]. However, open surgery can be done sometimes without general anesthesia. \n\nUncomplicated hernias are principally repaired by pushing back, or \"reducing\", the herniated tissue, and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue (an operation called [[Hernia repair|herniorrhaphy]]). If complications have occurred, the surgeon will check the viability of the herniated organ and remove part of it if necessary.\n\nMuscle reinforcement techniques often involve synthetic materials (a [[Inguinal hernia repair#Meshes|mesh prosthesis]]).<ref>Effectiveness of mesh hernioplasty in incarcerated inguinal hernias.

At times staples are used to keep the mesh in place. These [[Inguinal hernia repair#Mesh repairs|mesh repair methods]] are often called \"tension free\" repairs because, unlike some suture methods (e.g., Shouldice), muscle is not pulled together under tension. However, this widely used terminology is misleading, as there are many [[Inguinal hernia repair#Tension-free repairs|tension-free suture methods]] that do not use mesh (e.g., Desarda, Guarnieri, Lipton-Estrin, etc.).\n\nEvidence suggests that tension-free methods (with or without mesh) often have lower percentage of recurrences and the fastest recovery period compared to [[Inguinal hernia repair#Tension repairs|tension suture methods]].

Party president [[Kizza Besigye]], formerly a close ally of Museveni, was a presidential candidate in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 presidential elections. In November 2012, [[Mugisha Muntu]] was elected as President of the FDC until November 2017 when he was defeated by Patrick Oboi Amuriat the current party President until 2022.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1466364/amuriat-fdc-party-president|title=Amuriat elected new FDC party president|work=www.newvision.co.ug|access-date=2018-11-02}}</ref>\n\nFDC has been the greatest challenger to the NRM Party in the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|2006, 2011 and 2016 presidential and parliamentary elections]]. Besigye was the party's presidential candidate, taking 37 per cent of the vote against Museveni's 59 per cent. Besigye alleged fraud and rejected the result.\n\nIn the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|general election of 23 February 2006]], the party won 37 out of 289 elected seats. In the presidential election on the same date, Besigye won 37.4 per cent of the vote. In the 2011 election, the party performed worse with Besigye getting 26.01 per cent of the vote and the party winning 34 seats.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe origins of the FDC are intertwined with the history of the ruling NRM led by President Museveni. The NRM through its military wing the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) fought a successful guerrilla war against the governments of [[Milton Obote]] and [[Tito Okello]] and came to power in Uganda in 1986. During the guerrilla war, Museveni successfully moulded various interest groups into an effective military machine, and on achieving power, he began to build the NRM into a cohesive political organisation. The transition process and the NRM's desire to broaden its political base revealed other interests within the party and a feeling amongst some senior members of being sidelined.\n\nMuseveni had relied heavily on the support of the [[Tutsi]] refugees and their descendants who had been forced out of Rwanda by the [[Hutu]] majority in the 1960s. During the guerrilla war, the NRA had moved from the central district of Luwero to the west of the country where most of the Tutsis had been recruited. On achieving power, Tutsis like [[Paul Kagame]] and [[Fred Gisa Rwigyema]] were rewarded with powerful positions within the army and government.\n\nThe NRA advance on [[Kampala]] was very rapid, and during this process, hundreds of new recruits were incorporated into the NRA. Many of these came from Museveni's own tribe, the [[Banyankole]], and other western tribes like the [[Batoro]]. When the NRA advanced back into [[Buganda]] through the town of Masaka, their ranks were expanded by Baganda, many who travelled from different parts of Buganda to join the guerrillas. For many of these, the common goal was simply to oust the northern-dominated government. There were also those who saw the opportunity to use the NRA to achieve Buganda's ambitions of autonomy.\n\n==Splits within the NRM==\n\nAnother important development was the NRA recruitment of younger impressionable soldiers who often held Museveni in awe. This did not often go down well with the more senior NRA officers:\n \n:''\"He was also clever that he recruited very young and inexperienced people; the kind that would obey him. Many of them were either coming from university or those who had not even been to school\"''.{{ref|RUBARAMIRA_RURANGA}}\n\nThe younger educated cadres began to gain more influence in the NRM. Many had only joined the war towards its conclusion or had joined as NRM cadres after the war. This rivalry was often vocal and acrimonious:\n\n:''\"Many people have intimidated us, calling us (young people) creepers and sycophants of Museveni\".''{{ref|FRANK_TUMWEBAZE}}\n\nThe young cadres and the Tutsi refugees formed the new power base of the NRM, and the party increasingly appeared tribal. Ugandan politics has been plagued by tribalism, and the young cadres with their new influence often encouraged the appointment of their relatives into key government positions. Most of these cadres were from the south-west of Uganda like Museveni.\n\nThis power base was suddenly weakened when the Tutsi refugees led by [[Fred Rwigema]] decided to return to Rwanda to fight the government (Habyarimana). The loss of so many key military and political advisers particularly in the intelligence services left Museveni vulnerable. The NRM realised it had to broaden its appeal, first by appeasing the [[Baganda]] (Uganda's largest ethnic group) by restoring their king the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], and recruiting more people from other tribes into the armed forces. The NRM also emphasised its role in restoring law and order to the country and continuously evoked the fear amongst the southern tribes that the brutal northern armies of Obote and [[Idi Amin]] could return if the NRM failed. This fear was facilitated by the war in the north waged by the [[Lords Resistance Army]]. The NRM also presided over rapid economic growth in the south of Uganda.\n\nWith this new confidence, Museveni began to act against those challenging his authority in the NRM. Many of these were the original members of the NRM/NRA, including the army commander Major General Mugisha Muntu and other once powerful NRM leaders. Many of these leaders opted for quiet retirement in their home districts, but others, like Mugisha Muntu and the former NRM spokesperson Winnie Byanyima, began openly criticising Museveni. There appeared, however, to have been little enthusiasm to completely break with the NRM, rather to encourage change from within.{{ref|bs}}\n\nThis changed in the elections in 2001 when retired NRA officer Besigye challenged Museveni for the presidency. Besigye was relatively unknown outside the NRM/NRA establishment,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} but his courage in standing for election attracted support.\n\n==Formation of the Forum for Democratic Change==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nThe FDC was formally established in 2004. Besigye had gone into exile in the United States and then South Africa. The genesis of the party, however, was in Uganda where many disgruntled NRM members were actively promoting the establishment of a political organisation to challenge Museveni. This desire was further cemented when Museveni amended the constitution to allow him to stand for a third presidential term. This had angered many NRM veterans who had remained in the NRM waiting to take over when Museveni stood down. The amendment was criticised by some of Museveni's closest allies, like [[Eriya Kategaya]] who at the time was seen by many as the number two in the NRM/NRA political hierarchy. This opposition, however, did not bother Museveni who had by now firmly established himself in the NRM.\n\nThe FDC benefited from this disquiet, and when Besigye returned to Uganda, he found the FDC had considerable support even within the ranks of the NRM. This factor prompted Museveni to arrest Besigye. Although it was doubtful that Besigye could win an election against Museveni, the fact that he was attracting support from the NRA (now renamed the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]]) members brought the spectre of a split in the army. The FDC had many ex-NRA commanders in its ranks, including the former army commander Mugisha Muntu. Another factor was that many of these politicians were from the same region of Uganda as Museveni and, therefore, they could attract support from the president's own backyard.\n\nBesigye's arrest was a political blunder that served to increase the popularity of the FDC. But the party now began to suffer from its success. Many of the prominent ex-NRM members were reluctant to publicly criticise Museveni. Politicians like Eriya Kategaya, who was now in the FDC leadership, were tentative in their approach. A further hindrance was that the government placed enormous restrictions on Besigye's ability to mount a national campaign. The FDC was extremely popular in urban areas like the capital city, Kampala, but with limited campaign time, he could not effectively campaign in rural areas where 70 percent of the population live. The NRM, on the other hand, spent enormous energy campaigning in rural areas and small towns.\n\nThe FDC and Besigye were also popular in the north where the population has suffered almost two decades of war between the government and the Lord's Resistance Army. This was despite the fact that the FDC hardly campaigned in this area. This is a reflection of the grievances felt by northern Ugandans who often felt abandoned by the government in Kampala.\n\nDespite these obstacles, the FDC won over 30 percent of the vote, a major achievement for a party that was hardly a year old. The party eclipsed the traditional opposition parties like the [[Uganda People's Congress]] and the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]].\n\n== Stagnation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nIn 2011, the FDC once again led the opposition to Museveni and the NRM in the presidential and parliamentary elections. The party once again failed to overturn Museveni's popularity. The FDC did worse than in 2006.

Party president [[Kizza Besigye]], formerly a close ally of Museveni, was a presidential candidate in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 presidential elections. In November 2012, [[Mugisha Muntu]] was elected as President of the FDC until November 2017 when he was defeated by Patrick Oboi Amuriat the current party President until 2022.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1466364/amuriat-fdc-party-president|title=Amuriat elected new FDC party president|work=www.newvision.co.ug|access-date=2018-11-02}}</ref>\n\nFDC has been the greatest challenger to the NRM Party in the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|2006, 2011 and 2016 presidential and parliamentary elections]]. Besigye was the party's presidential candidate, taking 37 per cent of the vote against Museveni's 59 per cent. Besigye alleged fraud and rejected the result.\n\nIn the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|general election of 23 February 2006]], the party won 37 out of 289 elected seats. In the presidential election on the same date, Besigye won 37.4 per cent of the vote. In the 2011 election, the party performed worse with Besigye getting 26.01 per cent of the vote and the party winning 34 seats.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe origins of the FDC are intertwined with the history of the ruling NRM led by President Museveni. The NRM through its military wing the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) fought a successful guerrilla war against the governments of [[Milton Obote]] and [[Tito Okello]] and came to power in Uganda in 1986. During the guerrilla war, Museveni successfully moulded various interest groups into an effective military machine, and on achieving power, he began to build the NRM into a cohesive political organisation. The transition process and the NRM's desire to broaden its political base revealed other interests within the party and a feeling amongst some senior members of being sidelined.\n\nMuseveni had relied heavily on the support of the [[Tutsi]] refugees and their descendants who had been forced out of Rwanda by the [[Hutu]] majority in the 1960s. During the guerrilla war, the NRA had moved from the central district of Luwero to the west of the country where most of the Tutsis had been recruited. On achieving power, Tutsis like [[Paul Kagame]] and [[Fred Gisa Rwigyema]] were rewarded with powerful positions within the army and government.\n\nThe NRA advance on [[Kampala]] was very rapid, and during this process, hundreds of new recruits were incorporated into the NRA. Many of these came from Museveni's own tribe, the [[Banyankole]], and other western tribes like the [[Batoro]]. When the NRA advanced back into [[Buganda]] through the town of Masaka, their ranks were expanded by Baganda, many who travelled from different parts of Buganda to join the guerrillas. For many of these, the common goal was simply to oust the northern-dominated government. There were also those who saw the opportunity to use the NRA to achieve Buganda's ambitions of autonomy.\n\n==Splits within the NRM==\n\nAnother important development was the NRA recruitment of younger impressionable soldiers who often held Museveni in awe. This did not often go down well with the more senior NRA officers:\n \n:''\"He was also clever that he recruited very young and inexperienced people; the kind that would obey him. Many of them were either coming from university or those who had not even been to school\"''.{{ref|RUBARAMIRA_RURANGA}}\n\nThe younger educated cadres began to gain more influence in the NRM. Many had only joined the war towards its conclusion or had joined as NRM cadres after the war. This rivalry was often vocal and acrimonious:\n\n:''\"Many people have intimidated us, calling us (young people) creepers and sycophants of Museveni\".''{{ref|FRANK_TUMWEBAZE}}\n\nThe young cadres and the Tutsi refugees formed the new power base of the NRM, and the party increasingly appeared tribal. Ugandan politics has been plagued by tribalism, and the young cadres with their new influence often encouraged the appointment of their relatives into key government positions. Most of these cadres were from the south-west of Uganda like Museveni.\n\nThis power base was suddenly weakened when the Tutsi refugees led by [[Fred Rwigema]] decided to return to Rwanda to fight the government (Habyarimana). The loss of so many key military and political advisers particularly in the intelligence services left Museveni vulnerable. The NRM realised it had to broaden its appeal, first by appeasing the [[Baganda]] (Uganda's largest ethnic group) by restoring their king the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], and recruiting more people from other tribes into the armed forces. The NRM also emphasised its role in restoring law and order to the country and continuously evoked the fear amongst the southern tribes that the brutal northern armies of Obote and [[Idi Amin]] could return if the NRM failed. This fear was facilitated by the war in the north waged by the [[Lords Resistance Army]]. The NRM also presided over rapid economic growth in the south of Uganda.\n\nWith this new confidence, Museveni began to act against those challenging his authority in the NRM. Many of these were the original members of the NRM/NRA, including the army commander Major General Mugisha Muntu and other once powerful NRM leaders. Many of these leaders opted for quiet retirement in their home districts, but others, like Mugisha Muntu and the former NRM spokesperson Winnie Byanyima, began openly criticising Museveni. There appeared, however, to have been little enthusiasm to completely break with the NRM, rather to encourage change from within.{{ref|bs}}\n\nThis changed in the elections in 2001 when retired NRA officer Besigye challenged Museveni for the presidency. Besigye was relatively unknown outside the NRM/NRA establishment,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} but his courage in standing for election attracted support.\n\n==Formation of the Forum for Democratic Change==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nThe FDC was formally established in 2004. Besigye had gone into exile in the United States and then South Africa. The genesis of the party, however, was in Uganda where many disgruntled NRM members were actively promoting the establishment of a political organisation to challenge Museveni. This desire was further cemented when Museveni amended the constitution to allow him to stand for a third presidential term. This had angered many NRM veterans who had remained in the NRM waiting to take over when Museveni stood down. The amendment was criticised by some of Museveni's closest allies, like [[Eriya Kategaya]] who at the time was seen by many as the number two in the NRM/NRA political hierarchy. This opposition, however, did not bother Museveni who had by now firmly established himself in the NRM.\n\nThe FDC benefited from this disquiet, and when Besigye returned to Uganda, he found the FDC had considerable support even within the ranks of the NRM. This factor prompted Museveni to arrest Besigye. Although it was doubtful that Besigye could win an election against Museveni, the fact that he was attracting support from the NRA (now renamed the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]]) members brought the spectre of a split in the army. The FDC had many ex-NRA commanders in its ranks, including the former army commander Mugisha Muntu. Another factor was that many of these politicians were from the same region of Uganda as Museveni and, therefore, they could attract support from the president's own backyard.\n\nBesigye's arrest was a political blunder that served to increase the popularity of the FDC. But the party now began to suffer from its success. Many of the prominent ex-NRM members were reluctant to publicly criticise Museveni. Politicians like Eriya Kategaya, who was now in the FDC leadership, were tentative in their approach. A further hindrance was that the government placed enormous restrictions on Besigye's ability to mount a national campaign. The FDC was extremely popular in urban areas like the capital city, Kampala, but with limited campaign time, he could not effectively campaign in rural areas where 70 percent of the population live. The NRM, on the other hand, spent enormous energy campaigning in rural areas and small towns.\n\nThe FDC and Besigye were also popular in the north where the population has suffered almost two decades of war between the government and the Lord's Resistance Army. This was despite the fact that the FDC hardly campaigned in this area. This is a reflection of the grievances felt by northern Ugandans who often felt abandoned by the government in Kampala.\n\nDespite these obstacles, the FDC won over 30 percent of the vote, a major achievement for a party that was hardly a year old. The party eclipsed the traditional opposition parties like the [[Uganda People's Congress]] and the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]].\n\n== Stagnation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nIn 2011, the FDC once again led the opposition to Museveni and the NRM in the presidential and parliamentary elections. The party once again failed to overturn Museveni's popularity. The FDC did worse than in 2006. Since the 2011 election, the party has been central in organising street demonstrations - some which have resulted in violent confrontations with the police.\n\n==Formation of People's Government==\nAfter 2016 presidential general elections the FDC flag bearer Dr. Kizza Besigye contested Electoral commission results, this was after he was under house arrest for three months he went ahead to swear himself in as Uganda People's President in a secret location.

Yamashita led Japanese forces during the [[Malayan Campaign|invasion of Malaya]] and [[Battle of Singapore]], with his accomplishment of conquering [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and Singapore in 70 days earning him the sobriquet \"The Tiger of Malaya\" and led to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] calling the ignominious fall of Singapore to Japan the \"worst disaster\" and \"largest capitulation\" in British military history.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Churchill, Winston (2002). The Second World War|last = Churchill|first = Winston|publisher = Pimlico.|yeom the advancing Allied forces later in the war, and while unable to prevent the Allied advance, he was able to hold on to part of [[Luzon]] until after the formal [[Surrender of Japan]] in August 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Yamashita was tried for [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] committed by troops under his command during the Japanese defense of the occupied Philippines in 1944. In a controversial trial, Yamashita was found guilty of his troops' atrocities even though there was no evidence that he approved or even knew of them, and indeed many of the atrocities were committed by troops not actually under his command. Yamashita was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in 1946. The ruling against Yamashita \u2013 holding the commander responsible for subordinates' war crimes as long as the commander did not attempt to discover and stop them from occurring \u2013 came to be known as the [[Yamashita standard]]. \n\n== Biography ==\nYamashita was the second son of a local doctor in Osugi, a village in what is now part of [[\u014ctoyo, K\u014dchi|\u014ctoyo]], [[K\u014dchi Prefecture]], [[Shikoku]]. He attended military preparatory schools in his youth.\n\n=== Early military career ===\nIn November 1905 Yamashita graduated from the 18th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yamashita-Tomoyuki|title=Yamashita Tomoyuki - Japanese general|publisher=}}</ref> He was ranked 16th out of 920 cadets.<ref name=\":0\"/> In December 1908 he was promoted to lieutenant and fought against the [[German Empire]]{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} in [[World War I]] in [[Shandong]], China in 1914.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In May 1916 he was promoted to captain. He attended the 28th class of the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army War College]], graduating sixth in his class in 1916. The same year, he married Hisako Nagayama, daughter of retired Gen. Nagayama. Yamashita became an expert on Germany, serving as assistant [[military attach\u00e9]] at Bern and Berlin from 1919 to 1922.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn February 1922, he was promoted to major. He twice served in the Military Affairs Bureau of the War Ministry responsible for the Ugaki Army Reduction Program, aimed at reforming the Japanese army by streamlining its organisation despite facing fierce opposition from factions within the Army.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sixty Years On: The Fall of Singapore Revisited|publisher=Eastern Universities Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=190}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, upon his return to Japan, Major Yamashita served in the Imperial Headquarters and the Staff College, receiving promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1925. While posted to the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]], Yamashita unsuccessfully promoted a military reduction plan. Despite his ability, Yamashita fell into disfavor as a result of his involvement with political factions within the Japanese military.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAs a leading member of the [[Imperial Way Faction|\"Imperial Way\" group]], he became a rival to [[Hideki Tojo]] and other members of the \"Control Faction\". In 1927 Yamashita was posted to Vienna, Austria, as a military attach\u00e9 until 1930. He was then promoted to the rank of colonel. In 1930 Col. Yamashita was given command of the elite [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|3rd Imperial Infantry Regiment]]. (Imperial Guards Division). He was promoted to major-general in August 1934.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAfter the [[February 26 Incident]] of 1936, he fell into disfavor with Emperor [[Hirohito]] due to his appeal for leniency toward rebel officers involved in the attempted coup. He realized that he had lost the trust of the Emperor and decided to resign from the Army\u2014a decision that his superiors dissuaded him from carrying out. He was eventually relegated to a post in Korea, being given command of a brigade. Akashi Yoji argued in his article ''\"General Yamashita Tomoyuki: Commander of the Twenty-Fifth Army\"'' that his time in Korea gave him the chance to reflect on his conduct during the 1936 coup and at the same time study Zen Buddhism, something which caused him to mellow in character yet instilled a high level of discipline.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nYamashita was promoted to lieutenant-general in November 1937. He insisted that Japan should end [[Second Sino-Japanese War|the conflict with China]] and keep peaceful relations with the United States and Great Britain, but he was ignored and subsequently assigned to an unimportant post in the [[Kwantung Army]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFrom 1938 to 1940, he was assigned to command the [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]] which saw some action in northern China against insurgents fighting the occupying Japanese armies. In December 1940 Yamashita was sent on a six-month [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] military mission to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], where he met with [[Adolf Hitler]] on 16 June 1941 in Berlin as well as [[Benito Mussolini]].\n\nThroughout his time in the military he had consistently urged the implementation of his proposals, which included \"streamlining the air arm, to mechanise the Army, to integrate control of the armed forces in a defence ministry coordinated by a chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, to create a paratroop corps and to employ effective propaganda\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nSuch strategies caused much friction between himself and Gen. [[Hideki Tojo]], the war minister, who was not keen on implementing these proposals.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== World War II ===\n\n==== Malaya and Singapore ====\n{{Main|Malayan Campaign|Battle of Singapore}}\n[[Image:Tomoyuki_yamashita_malaya.png|thumb|General Tomoyuki Yamashita lead a successful assault of Japanese troops on Malaya]]\n\n[[Image:BritishSurrender.jpg|thumb|Lt. Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita (seated, center) insists upon the unconditional surrender of Singapore as [[Arthur Ernest Percival|Lt. Gen. Percival]], seated between his officers, demurs (photo from [[Imperial War Museum]])]]\n\nOn 6 November 1941 Lt. Gen. Yamashita was put in command of the [[Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army|Twenty-Fifth Army]]. It was his belief that victory in Malaya would be successful only if his troops could make an amphibious landing\u2014something that was dependent on whether he would have enough air and naval support to provide a good landing site.\n\nOn 8 December he launched an [[Malayan Campaign|invasion of Malaya]] from bases in [[French Indochina]]. Yamashita remarked that only a \"driving charge\" would ensure victory in Malaya. This is because the Japanese force was about one-third as large as the opposing British forces in Malaya and Singapore. The plan was to conquer Malaya and Singapore in the shortest time possible in order to overcome any numerical disadvantage, as well as to minimize any potential losses from a long, drawn-out battle.\n\nThe Malayan campaign concluded with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] on 15 February 1942, in which Yamashita's 30,000 front-line soldiers captured 80,000 British, Indian and Australian troops, the largest surrender of British-led personnel in history. He became known as the \"Tiger of Malaya\".\n\nThe campaign and the subsequent [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] included [[war crime]]s committed against captive [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel and civilians, such as the [[Alexandra Hospital massacre|Alexandra Hospital]] and [[Sook Ching]] massacres. Yamashita's culpability for these events remains a matter of controversy as some argued that he had failed to prevent them. The order to execute 50,000 Chinese came, according to postwar testimony, from senior officers within Yamashita's Operations staff. Yamashita's troops had fought in China, where it was customary to conduct massacres to subdue the population.<ref>Yuma Totani, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=Ul2XBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146  ''Justice in Asia and the Pacific Region, 1945\u20131952: Allied War Crimes Prosecutions,''] [[Cambridge University Press]], 2015 p.146</ref><ref>Kevin Blackburn, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493428  \u2018The Collective Memory of the Sook Ching Massacre and the Creation of the Civilian War Memorial of Singapore,\u2019] ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,'' Vol. 73, No. 2 (279)(2000), pp. 71-90, p.73.</ref> Major \u014cnishi Satoru, one of the accused in the postwar trial, affirmed that he acted under a specific order issued from General Headquarters, that read, '[D]ue to the fact that the army is advancing fast and in order to preserve peace behind us it is essential to massacre as many Chinese as possible who appear in any way to have anti-Japanese feelings.'<ref>Kevin Blackburn, p.74</ref>\n\nYamashita later apologized to the few survivors of the 650 bayoneted or shot, and had some soldiers caught looting in the aftermath of the slaughter executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/singapore/world_war_2_military_site/178/alexandra_hospital__lies_a_hidden_book.php |title=Alexandra Hospital |publisher=Streetdirectory.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> Akashi Yoji claims that this would have been in line with Yamashita's personality and belief. According to him, the first orders given by Yamashita to the soldiers was \"no looting; no rape; no arson\", and that any soldier committing such acts would be severely punished and his superior held accountable.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNevertheless, Yamashita's warnings to his troops were generally not heeded, and wanton acts of violence were reported.{{citation needed |date=July 2018}} In his article, Yoji argued that the main issue was that despite being an excellent tactician and leader, his personal ideals constantly placed him at odds with the General Staff and War Ministry. His humane treatment of prisoners of war as well as British leaders was something the other officers had difficulty coming to terms with.{{fact|date=May 2019}}\n\nDespite the finger of blame for the Sook Ching Massacre being pointed at Yamashita, it is now argued that he had no direct part in it and that it was in fact his subordinates who were behind the incident. A study by Ian Ward concluded that Yamashita should not be held responsible for the Sook Ching Massacre, but Ward did hold him responsible \"for failing to guard against [[Masanobu Tsuji|Tsuji]]'s manipulation of Command affairs\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Killer They Called A God|last = Ward|first = Ian|publisher = |year = 1992|isbn = |location = Singapore|pages = 237}}</ref>\n\n==== Manchukuo ====\nOn 17 July 1942, Yamashita was reassigned from Singapore to far-away [[Manchukuo]] again, having been given a post in commanding the [[Japanese First Area Army|First Area Army]], and was effectively sidelined for a major part of the [[Pacific War]]. It is thought that Tojo, by then the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]], was responsible for his banishment, taking advantage of Yamashita's gaffe during a speech made to Singaporean civilian leaders in early 1942, when he referred to the local populace as \"citizens of the [[Empire of Japan]]\" (this was considered embarrassing for the Japanese government, who officially did not consider the residents of occupied territories to have the rights or privileges of Japanese citizenship). He was promoted to full general in February 1943. Some have suggested that he may have been sent there to prepare for an attack upon the Soviet Union in the event that Stalingrad fell to Germany.<ref name=\"Slavinski\u012d2004\">{{cite book|author=Boris Nikolaevich Slavinski\u012d|title=The Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact: A Diplomatic History, 1941-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rddhxSKGQ9oC|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32292-8|page=103}}</ref>\n\n==== Philippines ====\n{{Main|Philippines campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n{{See also|Military history of the Philippines during World War II}}\n\n[[Image:General Yamashita Surrenders.jpg|thumb|upright|General Yamashita and his staff surrender on 2 September 1945]]\n\nOn 26 September 1944, when the war situation was critical for Japan, Yamashita was rescued from his enforced exile in China by the new Japanese government after the downfall of Hideki T\u014dj\u014d and his cabinet, and he assumed the command of the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army|Fourteenth Area Army]] to defend the occupied Philippines on 10 October. [[Military of the United States|U.S. forces]] landed on [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] ten days later. On 6 January 1945, the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth U.S. Army]], totaling 200,000 men, landed at [[Lingayen Gulf]] in [[Luzon]].\n\nYamashita commanded approximately 262,000 troops in three defensive groups; the largest, the ''Shobu'' Group, under his personal command numbered 152,000 troops, defended northern Luzon. The smallest group, totaling 30,000 troops, known as the ''Kembu'' Group, under the command of Tsukada, defended [[Bataan]] and the western shores. The last group, the ''Shimbu'' Group, totaling 80,000 men under the command of Yokoyama, defended Manila and southern Luzon. Yamashita tried to rebuild his army but was forced to retreat from Manila to the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountains of northern Luzon, as well as the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] mountains. Yamashita ordered all troops, except those given the task of ensuring security, out of the city.\n\nAlmost immediately, [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Rear Admiral [[Sanji Iwabuchi]] re-occupied Manila with 16,000 sailors, with the intent of destroying all port facilities and naval storehouses. Once there, Iwabuchi took command of the 3,750 Army security troops, and against Yamashita's specific order, [[Battle of Manila (1945)|turned the city into a battlefield]].<ref>[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936\u20131945]]'', Random House, 1970, p. 677.</ref> The battle and the Japanese atrocities resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 [[Filipino people|Filipino civilians]], in what is known as the [[Manila massacre]], during the fierce street fighting for the capital which raged between 4 February and 3 March.\n\nYamashita continued to use delaying tactics to maintain his army in [[Kiangan]] (part of the [[Ifugao Province]]), until 2 September 1945, several weeks after the [[surrender of Japan]]. At the time of his surrender, his forces had been reduced to under 50,000 by the lack of supplies and tough campaigning by elements of the combined American and Filipino soldiers including the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|recognized guerrillas]]. Yamashita surrendered in the presence of Generals [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan Wainwright]] and [[Arthur Percival]], both of whom had been [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in [[Manchuria]]. Percival had surrendered to Yamashita after the Battle of Singapore.\n\n== Trial ==\n[[Image:Japanese War Crimes Trials. Manila - NARA - 292613.jpg|thumb|upright|Yamashita (second from right) at his trial in Manila, November 1945]]\nFrom 29 October to 7 December 1945, an American [[military tribunal]] in Manila tried General Yamashita for war crimes relating to the Manila massacre and many atrocities in the Philippines against civilians and prisoners of war, and sentenced him to death. This controversial case has become a precedent regarding the [[command responsibility]] for war crimes and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/01/18/lawbreakers-at-war-how-responsible-are-they/|title=\nLawbreakers at War: How Responsible Are They?|author=David Isenberg|website=TIME|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Case/199|title=Yamashita v. Styer|website=ICD|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe principal accusation against Yamashita was that he had failed in his duty as commander of Japanese forces in the Philippines to prevent them from committing atrocities. The defense acknowledged that atrocities had been committed but contended that the breakdown of communications and the Japanese chain of command in the chaotic battle of the second Philippines campaign was such that Yamashita could not have controlled his troops even if he had known of their actions, which was not certain in any case; furthermore, many of the atrocities had been committed by Japanese naval forces outside his command.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAmerican lawyer Harry E. Clarke, Sr., a colonel in the United States Army at the time, served as the chief counsel for the defense. In his opening statement, Clarke asserted:\n\n{{quote|The Accused is not charged with having done something or having failed to do something, but solely with having been something...American jurisprudence recognizes no such principle so far as its own military personnel are concerned...No one would even suggest that the Commanding General of an American occupational force becomes a criminal every time an American soldier violates the law...one man is not held to answer for the crime of another.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.historynet.com/japanese-war-crime-trials.htm|title=Japanese War Crime Trials|date=September 1996|accessdate=10 February 2020|author=Robert Barr Smith}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Yamashita After Verdict.jpg|thumb|upright|Yamashita is removed from the courtroom by military police immediately after hearing the verdict of death by hanging]]\nFor his part Yamashita denied he had knowledge of the crimes committed by his men, and claimed that he would have harshly punished them if he had had that knowledge. Further, he argued that with an army as large as his, there was no way for him to control all actions by all his subordinates. As such he felt what he was really being charged with was losing the war:\n\n{{quote|My command was as big as MacArthur's or [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]]'s. How could I tell if some of my soldiers misbehaved themselves? It was impossible for any man in my position to control every action of his subordinate commanders, let alone the deeds of individual soldiers. The charges are completely new to me. If they had happened, and I had known about them, I would have punished the wrongdoers severely. But in war someone has to lose. What I am really being charged with is losing the war. It could have happened to General MacArthur, you know.<ref>{{citebook|first=Alan|last=Warren|title=Britain's Greatest Defeat: Singapore|date=1942|publisher=Hambledon Continuum}}</ref>}}\n\nThe court found Yamashita guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. Clarke appealed the sentence to General MacArthur, who upheld it. He then appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] and the Supreme Court of the United States, both of which declined to review the verdict.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn dissent from the Supreme Court of the United States's majority, Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|W.B.

In a controversial trial, Yamashita was found guilty of his troops' atrocities even though there was no evidence that he approved or even knew of them, and indeed many of the atrocities were committed by troops not actually under his command. Yamashita was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in 1946. The ruling against Yamashita \u2013 holding the commander responsible for subordinates' war crimes as long as the commander did not attempt to discover and stop them from occurring \u2013 came to be known as the [[Yamashita standard]]. \n\n== Biography ==\nYamashita was the second son of a local doctor in Osugi, a village in what is now part of [[\u014ctoyo, K\u014dchi|\u014ctoyo]], [[K\u014dchi Prefecture]], [[Shikoku]]. He attended military preparatory schools in his youth.\n\n=== Early military career ===\nIn November 1905 Yamashita graduated from the 18th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yamashita-Tomoyuki|title=Yamashita Tomoyuki - Japanese general|publisher=}}</ref> He was ranked 16th out of 920 cadets.<ref name=\":0\"/> In December 1908 he was promoted to lieutenant and fought against the [[German Empire]]{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} in [[World War I]] in [[Shandong]], China in 1914.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In May 1916 he was promoted to captain. He attended the 28th class of the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army War College]], graduating sixth in his class in 1916. The same year, he married Hisako Nagayama, daughter of retired Gen. Nagayama. Yamashita became an expert on Germany, serving as assistant [[military attach\u00e9]] at Bern and Berlin from 1919 to 1922.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn February 1922, he was promoted to major. He twice served in the Military Affairs Bureau of the War Ministry responsible for the Ugaki Army Reduction Program, aimed at reforming the Japanese army by streamlining its organisation despite facing fierce opposition from factions within the Army.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sixty Years On: The Fall of Singapore Revisited|publisher=Eastern Universities Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=190}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, upon his return to Japan, Major Yamashita served in the Imperial Headquarters and the Staff College, receiving promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1925. While posted to the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]], Yamashita unsuccessfully promoted a military reduction plan. Despite his ability, Yamashita fell into disfavor as a result of his involvement with political factions within the Japanese military.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAs a leading member of the [[Imperial Way Faction|\"Imperial Way\" group]], he became a rival to [[Hideki Tojo]] and other members of the \"Control Faction\". In 1927 Yamashita was posted to Vienna, Austria, as a military attach\u00e9 until 1930. He was then promoted to the rank of colonel. In 1930 Col. Yamashita was given command of the elite [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|3rd Imperial Infantry Regiment]]. (Imperial Guards Division). He was promoted to major-general in August 1934.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAfter the [[February 26 Incident]] of 1936, he fell into disfavor with Emperor [[Hirohito]] due to his appeal for leniency toward rebel officers involved in the attempted coup. He realized that he had lost the trust of the Emperor and decided to resign from the Army\u2014a decision that his superiors dissuaded him from carrying out. He was eventually relegated to a post in Korea, being given command of a brigade. Akashi Yoji argued in his article ''\"General Yamashita Tomoyuki: Commander of the Twenty-Fifth Army\"'' that his time in Korea gave him the chance to reflect on his conduct during the 1936 coup and at the same time study Zen Buddhism, something which caused him to mellow in character yet instilled a high level of discipline.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nYamashita was promoted to lieutenant-general in November 1937. He insisted that Japan should end [[Second Sino-Japanese War|the conflict with China]] and keep peaceful relations with the United States and Great Britain, but he was ignored and subsequently assigned to an unimportant post in the [[Kwantung Army]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFrom 1938 to 1940, he was assigned to command the [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]] which saw some action in northern China against insurgents fighting the occupying Japanese armies. In December 1940 Yamashita was sent on a six-month [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] military mission to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], where he met with [[Adolf Hitler]] on 16 June 1941 in Berlin as well as [[Benito Mussolini]].\n\nThroughout his time in the military he had consistently urged the implementation of his proposals, which included \"streamlining the air arm, to mechanise the Army, to integrate control of the armed forces in a defence ministry coordinated by a chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, to create a paratroop corps and to employ effective propaganda\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nSuch strategies caused much friction between himself and Gen. [[Hideki Tojo]], the war minister, who was not keen on implementing these proposals.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== World War II ===\n\n==== Malaya and Singapore ====\n{{Main|Malayan Campaign|Battle of Singapore}}\n[[Image:Tomoyuki_yamashita_malaya.png|thumb|General Tomoyuki Yamashita lead a successful assault of Japanese troops on Malaya]]\n\n[[Image:BritishSurrender.jpg|thumb|Lt. Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita (seated, center) insists upon the unconditional surrender of Singapore as [[Arthur Ernest Percival|Lt. Gen. Percival]], seated between his officers, demurs (photo from [[Imperial War Museum]])]]\n\nOn 6 November 1941 Lt. Gen. Yamashita was put in command of the [[Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army|Twenty-Fifth Army]]. It was his belief that victory in Malaya would be successful only if his troops could make an amphibious landing\u2014something that was dependent on whether he would have enough air and naval support to provide a good landing site.\n\nOn 8 December he launched an [[Malayan Campaign|invasion of Malaya]] from bases in [[French Indochina]]. Yamashita remarked that only a \"driving charge\" would ensure victory in Malaya. This is because the Japanese force was about one-third as large as the opposing British forces in Malaya and Singapore. The plan was to conquer Malaya and Singapore in the shortest time possible in order to overcome any numerical disadvantage, as well as to minimize any potential losses from a long, drawn-out battle.\n\nThe Malayan campaign concluded with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] on 15 February 1942, in which Yamashita's 30,000 front-line soldiers captured 80,000 British, Indian and Australian troops, the largest surrender of British-led personnel in history. He became known as the \"Tiger of Malaya\".\n\nThe campaign and the subsequent [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] included [[war crime]]s committed against captive [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel and civilians, such as the [[Alexandra Hospital massacre|Alexandra Hospital]] and [[Sook Ching]] massacres. Yamashita's culpability for these events remains a matter of controversy as some argued that he had failed to prevent them. The order to execute 50,000 Chinese came, according to postwar testimony, from senior officers within Yamashita's Operations staff. Yamashita's troops had fought in China, where it was customary to conduct massacres to subdue the population.<ref>Yuma Totani, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=Ul2XBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146  ''Justice in Asia and the Pacific Region, 1945\u20131952: Allied War Crimes Prosecutions,''] [[Cambridge University Press]], 2015 p.146</ref><ref>Kevin Blackburn, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493428  \u2018The Collective Memory of the Sook Ching Massacre and the Creation of the Civilian War Memorial of Singapore,\u2019] ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,'' Vol. 73, No. 2 (279)(2000), pp. 71-90, p.73.</ref> Major \u014cnishi Satoru, one of the accused in the postwar trial, affirmed that he acted under a specific order issued from General Headquarters, that read, '[D]ue to the fact that the army is advancing fast and in order to preserve peace behind us it is essential to massacre as many Chinese as possible who appear in any way to have anti-Japanese feelings.'<ref>Kevin Blackburn, p.74</ref>\n\nYamashita later apologized to the few survivors of the 650 bayoneted or shot, and had some soldiers caught looting in the aftermath of the slaughter executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/singapore/world_war_2_military_site/178/alexandra_hospital__lies_a_hidden_book.php |title=Alexandra Hospital |publisher=Streetdirectory.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> Akashi Yoji claims that this would have been in line with Yamashita's personality and belief. According to him, the first orders given by Yamashita to the soldiers was \"no looting; no rape; no arson\", and that any soldier committing such acts would be severely punished and his superior held accountable.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNevertheless, Yamashita's warnings to his troops were generally not heeded, and wanton acts of violence were reported.{{citation needed |date=July 2018}} In his article, Yoji argued that the main issue was that despite being an excellent tactician and leader, his personal ideals constantly placed him at odds with the General Staff and War Ministry. His humane treatment of prisoners of war as well as British leaders was something the other officers had difficulty coming to terms with.{{fact|date=May 2019}}\n\nDespite the finger of blame for the Sook Ching Massacre being pointed at Yamashita, it is now argued that he had no direct part in it and that it was in fact his subordinates who were behind the incident. A study by Ian Ward concluded that Yamashita should not be held responsible for the Sook Ching Massacre, but Ward did hold him responsible \"for failing to guard against [[Masanobu Tsuji|Tsuji]]'s manipulation of Command affairs\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Killer They Called A God|last = Ward|first = Ian|publisher = |year = 1992|isbn = |location = Singapore|pages = 237}}</ref>\n\n==== Manchukuo ====\nOn 17 July 1942, Yamashita was reassigned from Singapore to far-away [[Manchukuo]] again, having been given a post in commanding the [[Japanese First Area Army|First Area Army]], and was effectively sidelined for a major part of the [[Pacific War]]. It is thought that Tojo, by then the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]], was responsible for his banishment, taking advantage of Yamashita's gaffe during a speech made to Singaporean civilian leaders in early 1942, when he referred to the local populace as \"citizens of the [[Empire of Japan]]\" (this was considered embarrassing for the Japanese government, who officially did not consider the residents of occupied territories to have the rights or privileges of Japanese citizenship). He was promoted to full general in February 1943. Some have suggested that he may have been sent there to prepare for an attack upon the Soviet Union in the event that Stalingrad fell to Germany.<ref name=\"Slavinski\u012d2004\">{{cite book|author=Boris Nikolaevich Slavinski\u012d|title=The Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact: A Diplomatic History, 1941-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rddhxSKGQ9oC|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32292-8|page=103}}</ref>\n\n==== Philippines ====\n{{Main|Philippines campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n{{See also|Military history of the Philippines during World War II}}\n\n[[Image:General Yamashita Surrenders.jpg|thumb|upright|General Yamashita and his staff surrender on 2 September 1945]]\n\nOn 26 September 1944, when the war situation was critical for Japan, Yamashita was rescued from his enforced exile in China by the new Japanese government after the downfall of Hideki T\u014dj\u014d and his cabinet, and he assumed the command of the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army|Fourteenth Area Army]] to defend the occupied Philippines on 10 October. [[Military of the United States|U.S. forces]] landed on [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] ten days later. On 6 January 1945, the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth U.S. Army]], totaling 200,000 men, landed at [[Lingayen Gulf]] in [[Luzon]].\n\nYamashita commanded approximately 262,000 troops in three defensive groups; the largest, the ''Shobu'' Group, under his personal command numbered 152,000 troops, defended northern Luzon. The smallest group, totaling 30,000 troops, known as the ''Kembu'' Group, under the command of Tsukada, defended [[Bataan]] and the western shores. The last group, the ''Shimbu'' Group, totaling 80,000 men under the command of Yokoyama, defended Manila and southern Luzon. Yamashita tried to rebuild his army but was forced to retreat from Manila to the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountains of northern Luzon, as well as the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] mountains. Yamashita ordered all troops, except those given the task of ensuring security, out of the city.\n\nAlmost immediately, [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Rear Admiral [[Sanji Iwabuchi]] re-occupied Manila with 16,000 sailors, with the intent of destroying all port facilities and naval storehouses. Once there, Iwabuchi took command of the 3,750 Army security troops, and against Yamashita's specific order, [[Battle of Manila (1945)|turned the city into a battlefield]].<ref>[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936\u20131945]]'', Random House, 1970, p. 677.</ref> The battle and the Japanese atrocities resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 [[Filipino people|Filipino civilians]], in what is known as the [[Manila massacre]], during the fierce street fighting for the capital which raged between 4 February and 3 March.\n\nYamashita continued to use delaying tactics to maintain his army in [[Kiangan]] (part of the [[Ifugao Province]]), until 2 September 1945, several weeks after the [[surrender of Japan]]. At the time of his surrender, his forces had been reduced to under 50,000 by the lack of supplies and tough campaigning by elements of the combined American and Filipino soldiers including the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|recognized guerrillas]]. Yamashita surrendered in the presence of Generals [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan Wainwright]] and [[Arthur Percival]], both of whom had been [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in [[Manchuria]]. Percival had surrendered to Yamashita after the Battle of Singapore.\n\n== Trial ==\n[[Image:Japanese War Crimes Trials. Manila - NARA - 292613.jpg|thumb|upright|Yamashita (second from right) at his trial in Manila, November 1945]]\nFrom 29 October to 7 December 1945, an American [[military tribunal]] in Manila tried General Yamashita for war crimes relating to the Manila massacre and many atrocities in the Philippines against civilians and prisoners of war, and sentenced him to death. This controversial case has become a precedent regarding the [[command responsibility]] for war crimes and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/01/18/lawbreakers-at-war-how-responsible-are-they/|title=\nLawbreakers at War: How Responsible Are They?|author=David Isenberg|website=TIME|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Case/199|title=Yamashita v. Styer|website=ICD|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe principal accusation against Yamashita was that he had failed in his duty as commander of Japanese forces in the Philippines to prevent them from committing atrocities. The defense acknowledged that atrocities had been committed but contended that the breakdown of communications and the Japanese chain of command in the chaotic battle of the second Philippines campaign was such that Yamashita could not have controlled his troops even if he had known of their actions, which was not certain in any case; furthermore, many of the atrocities had been committed by Japanese naval forces outside his command.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAmerican lawyer Harry E. Clarke, Sr., a colonel in the United States Army at the time, served as the chief counsel for the defense. In his opening statement, Clarke asserted:\n\n{{quote|The Accused is not charged with having done something or having failed to do something, but solely with having been something...American jurisprudence recognizes no such principle so far as its own military personnel are concerned...No one would even suggest that the Commanding General of an American occupational force becomes a criminal every time an American soldier violates the law...one man is not held to answer for the crime of another.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.historynet.com/japanese-war-crime-trials.htm|title=Japanese War Crime Trials|date=September 1996|accessdate=10 February 2020|author=Robert Barr Smith}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Yamashita After Verdict.jpg|thumb|upright|Yamashita is removed from the courtroom by military police immediately after hearing the verdict of death by hanging]]\nFor his part Yamashita denied he had knowledge of the crimes committed by his men, and claimed that he would have harshly punished them if he had had that knowledge. Further, he argued that with an army as large as his, there was no way for him to control all actions by all his subordinates. As such he felt what he was really being charged with was losing the war:\n\n{{quote|My command was as big as MacArthur's or [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]]'s. How could I tell if some of my soldiers misbehaved themselves? It was impossible for any man in my position to control every action of his subordinate commanders, let alone the deeds of individual soldiers. The charges are completely new to me. If they had happened, and I had known about them, I would have punished the wrongdoers severely. But in war someone has to lose. What I am really being charged with is losing the war. It could have happened to General MacArthur, you know.<ref>{{citebook|first=Alan|last=Warren|title=Britain's Greatest Defeat: Singapore|date=1942|publisher=Hambledon Continuum}}</ref>}}\n\nThe court found Yamashita guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. Clarke appealed the sentence to General MacArthur, who upheld it. He then appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] and the Supreme Court of the United States, both of which declined to review the verdict.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn dissent from the Supreme Court of the United States's majority, Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|W.B.
