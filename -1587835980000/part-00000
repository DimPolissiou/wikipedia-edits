The first [[musical notation]] system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia]] system, was created 4000 years ago. [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducibility have led to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.\n\nU.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf|title=Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref> Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1925 is considered public domain.

Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.\n\nWorks created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.\n\n===Expiration of copyright===\nDetermination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.\n\nIn the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright term]]s have been extended multiple times and in different ways\u2014shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with [[copyright renewal|a possible renewal term]], to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that \"pre-1925 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nIn most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)\n\nLegal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities|formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements\u2014a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.<ref>[[Dennis Karjala]], \"Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation\", 35 N.

For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.\n\nBecause trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States\u2014a generic term. In Canada, however, \"Aspirin\", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lowercase \"a\", is not.

The first [[musical notation]] system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia]] system, was created 4000 years ago. [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducibility have led to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.\n\nU.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf|title=Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref> Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain.

Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.\n\nWorks created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.\n\n===Expiration of copyright===\nDetermination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.\n\nIn the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright term]]s have been extended multiple times and in different ways\u2014shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with [[copyright renewal|a possible renewal term]], to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that \"pre-1925 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nIn most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)\n\nLegal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities|formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements\u2014a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.<ref>[[Dennis Karjala]], \"Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation\", 35 N. Ky. L.

Real public domain makes [[license]]s unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission (\"[[Permission culture]]\"). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the [[WTFPL]] was released as a public domain like [[software license]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130602181949/http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-wmaker/trunk/COPYING.WTFPL?revision=2&view=markup Version 1.0 license] on anonscm.debian.org</ref> In 2009 the [[Creative Commons]] released the [[Creative Commons license#Zero .2F public domain|CC0]], which was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with law domains which have no concept of ''dedicating into public domain''.

For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.\n\nBecause trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States\u2014a generic term. In Canada, however, \"Aspirin\", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lowercase \"a\", is not.

In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the town's post office.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track. In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company.''  In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the town's post office.  In 1902, the company was in financial trouble and defaulted on its debt to Sun Life, giving it ownership of the company.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm|title=Cornwall Street Railway Light & Power Co.|last=|first=|date=|website=trainweb.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990828230041/http://trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm|archive-date=1999-08-28|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10|alt=]]In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

It first aired in the United States on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on December 16, 2001. In the episode, [[Bart Simpson]] and his father [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] accidentally launch a model rocket into the Springfield church, causing the church council to accept funding plans from [[Mr. Burns]] for reparation.\nDiscontent with how commercialized the rebuilt church has become, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] abandons [[Christianity]] and seeks out to follow a [[Buddhism|new religion]].\n\nThe episode was directed by  [[Steven Dean Moore]] and written by [[Bill Freiberger]], whom executive producer and [[show runner]] [[Al Jean]] had met while working on the television series ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]''. The plot idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand on Lisa's personality, even though some of the ''Simpsons'' writers were concerned over the episode's originality. Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode. The episode features actor [[Richard Gere]], who agreed to star as long as Buddhism was portrayed accurately, and as long as Lisa would say \"Free Tibet\".\n\nThe episode was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]] in 2002, which it ultimately lost to the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode, \"[[Roswell That Ends Well]]\". \n\nFollowing the thirteenth season's release on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile watching a 1950s [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] movie, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] see a commercial for a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s credit card number. Homer helps Bart and [[Milhouse van Houten|Milhouse]] build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that [[Ned Flanders]] built a superior rocket, Homer enlists the help of his [[Homer Goes to College|former nerdy college roommates]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Benjamin, Doug and Gary|Gary, Doug, and Benjamin]], to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church. With no other aid available, they accept help from [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lindsey Naegle|Lindsay Naegle]], who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a currency exchanger, a Lard Lad statue, a photo booth for the churchgoers to put their faces in a cut-out of Jesus in The Last Supper, and a [[Jumbotron]]. Lisa is appalled at this and after Lovejoy welcomes the [[The Noid]] to hold a sermon \"on the sanctity of deliciousness,\" she abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.\n\nThat night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has not turned her back on Him, but plans to seek a new path to \u201cHim\u201d (or \u201cHer,\u201d she says). While on a walk around town, passing many [[sacrilegious]] signs, she finds [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s Buddhist temple. Inside she sees [[Lenny and Carl#Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl]] meditating, and Hollywood actor [[Richard Gere]] teaches the core concepts of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own [[bodhi tree]] in the back yard and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's [[soul]] and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.\n\nAt the church council meeting, [[Reverend Lovejoy]] tells Marge to use [[Christmas]] to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] and Milhouse dress as a pony in wrapping paper to tempt her, but Lisa runs from the home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple, she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion. Thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family, including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone that she will be celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism for the rest of her life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.\n\n==Production and themes==\n[[File:Al Jean by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|left|180px|thumb|[[Al Jean]] (pictured) met the episode's writer, [[Bill Freiberger]] while they worked together on the television series ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]''.]]\n\"She of Little Faith\" was directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]] and was the only episode [[Bill Freiberger]] wrote for ''The Simpsons''. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 16, 2001.<ref name=\"Jean\">Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for \"She of Little Faith\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>\n\nBefore returning to work full-time on ''The Simpsons'', Jean had worked on a television series called ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]'' together with [[Mike Reiss]] and Freiberger. While working on ''Teen Angel'', Freiberger suggested that, if Jean was ever to run ''The Simpsons'', he should hire Freiberger as a writer on the series. For the thirteenth season, Jean became show runner and assigned Freiberger to write the episode.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> Freiberger wrote the first draft as a [[Freelancer|freelance script]] at his parents' barn in [[Pennsylvania]], and when he returned to the writing staff to rewrite the story, Freiberger took so many notes that the script became 106 pages long. As a result, Freiberger spent more time editing down the script rather than writing it.<ref name=\"Freiberger\">Freiberger, Bill. (2010). Commentary for \"She of Little Faith\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The episode's main plot, in which Lisa becomes a [[Buddhist]], was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand Lisa's personality. When he pitched the plot idea to the ''Simpsons'' writing staff, they became concerned about the episode's originality. They argued that the series had already explored religious themes in earlier episodes, but Jean assured them that the episode would be about Lisa first-and-foremost, rather than Buddhism. Unlike several other episodes in the series in which a character undergoes a change in their personality, Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode, much like her conversion to vegetarianism in \"[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]\".<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\nFreiberger pitched the [[subplot]] involving the model rockets in the beginning of the episode. He based it on a real-life experience, in which he, as a child, accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house.<ref name=\"Freiberger\" /> A scene from this subplot was removed from the episode following the [[September 11 attacks]]. The scene would show a man named Hassan Jay Salam being arrested by policemen (who tells them to call his cousin [[Casey Kasem]]), who think the rocket Bart and Homer launched was launched by him (The rocket bears the abbreviation HJS, which stands for Homer J Simpson). After the attacks, the scene was considered too offensive by the Fox [[Censorship|censors]], so the scene was removed.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> Originally, the subplot would involve Marge trying to get Homer to build model rockets with Bart. Homer would not want to at first, but after Marge convinces him, he would soon get more into it than Bart. The plot idea was encouraged by some of the writers who thought that Marge had \"gotten short shrift,\" and, according to Freiberger, Marge would have had a \"really big part motivating the story\" had the subplot remained intact.<ref name=\"Freiberger\" />\n[[File:Richardgere.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Richard Gere]] agreed to appear as long as Lisa said \"Free Tibet\" in the episode.]]\nThe renovated church in the episode is built like a mall; several stores and merchandising is located inside, and Reverend Lovejoy plugs products and television programs during his sermons. The scene is used to satirize the so-called \"[[megachurches]]\" and the commercialization sometimes associated with these institutions.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> The episode also argues that, even if Christmas has lost most of its meaning, it is more important to \"keep these thoughts to oneself in order to make the family happy.\"<ref name=\"Salont\">{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/diary/2001/12/20/tv_christmas/index.html |title=What I learned about Christmas |date=December 20, 2001 |accessdate=April 2, 2011 |last=Chocano |first=Carina |work=Salon }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It also comments on what the writers believe to be the \"all or nothing, we're right, you're all going to hell mentality\" of some Christian movements.<ref name=\"Project-blu\">{{cite web|url=http://project-blu.com/reviews/simpsons13.html |title=The Simpsons: The Thirteenth Season |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |last=Boss |first=Nate |publisher=Project-Blu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622070047/http://project-blu.com/reviews/simpsons13.html |archivedate=June 22, 2011 }}</ref> Even though \"She of Little Faith\" is a Christmas episode, the holiday is not mentioned until the episode's third act. Jean stated in the DVD [[audio commentary]] for the episode that the writers did not want to make a conventional Christmas episode, and instead wanted to \"slide into\" the subject.<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\nThe episode features actor [[Richard Gere]] as himself. Gere agreed to guest star under two conditions, the first being that Buddhism should be portrayed accurately, and his second and strongest request being that Lisa should say \"Free Tibet\" in the episode.

It first aired in the United States on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on December 16, 2001. In the episode, [[Bart Simpson]] and his father [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] accidentally launch a model rocket into the Springfield church, causing the church council to accept funding plans from [[Mr. Burns]] for reparation.\nDiscontent with how commercialized the rebuilt church has become, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] abandons [[Christianity]] and seeks out to follow a [[Buddhism|new religion]].\n\nThe episode was directed by  [[Steven Dean Moore]] and written by [[Bill Freiberger]], whom executive producer and [[show runner]] [[Al Jean]] had met while working on the television series ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]''. The plot idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand on Lisa's personality, even though some of the ''Simpsons'' writers were concerned over the episode's originality. Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode. The episode features actor [[Richard Gere]], who agreed to star as long as Buddhism was portrayed accurately, and as long as Lisa would say \"Free Tibet\".\n\nThe episode was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]] in 2002, which it ultimately lost to the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode, \"[[Roswell That Ends Well]]\". \n\nFollowing the thirteenth season's release on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile watching a 1950s [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] movie, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] see a commercial for a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s credit card number. Homer helps Bart and [[Milhouse van Houten|Milhouse]] build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that [[Ned Flanders]] built a superior rocket, Homer enlists the help of his [[Homer Goes to College|former nerdy college roommates]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Benjamin, Doug and Gary|Gary, Doug, and Benjamin]], to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church. With no other aid available, they accept help from [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lindsey Naegle|Lindsay Naegle]], who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a Lard Lad statue, and a [[Jumbotron]]. Lisa is appalled at this and abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.\n\nThat night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has not turned her back on Him, but plans to seek a new path to \u201cHim\u201d (or \u201cHer,\u201d she says). While on a walk around town, passing many [[sacrilegious]] signs, she finds [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s Buddhist temple. Inside she sees [[Lenny and Carl#Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl]] meditating, and Hollywood actor [[Richard Gere]] teaches the core concepts of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own [[bodhi tree]] in the back yard and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's [[soul]] and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.\n\nAt the church council meeting, [[Reverend Lovejoy]] tells Marge to use [[Christmas]] to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] and Milhouse dress as a pony in wrapping paper to tempt her, but Lisa runs from the home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple, she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion. Thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family, including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone that she will be celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism for the rest of her life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.\n\n==Production and themes==\n[[File:Al Jean by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|left|180px|thumb|[[Al Jean]] (pictured) met the episode's writer, [[Bill Freiberger]] while they worked together on the television series ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]''.]]\n\"She of Little Faith\" was directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]] and was the only episode [[Bill Freiberger]] wrote for ''The Simpsons''. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 16, 2001.<ref name=\"Jean\">Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for \"She of Little Faith\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>\n\nBefore returning to work full-time on ''The Simpsons'', Jean had worked on a television series called ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]'' together with [[Mike Reiss]] and Freiberger. While working on ''Teen Angel'', Freiberger suggested that, if Jean was ever to run ''The Simpsons'', he should hire Freiberger as a writer on the series. For the thirteenth season, Jean became show runner and assigned Freiberger to write the episode.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> Freiberger wrote the first draft as a [[Freelancer|freelance script]] at his parents' barn in [[Pennsylvania]], and when he returned to the writing staff to rewrite the story, Freiberger took so many notes that the script became 106 pages long. As a result, Freiberger spent more time editing down the script rather than writing it.<ref name=\"Freiberger\">Freiberger, Bill. (2010). Commentary for \"She of Little Faith\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The episode's main plot, in which Lisa becomes a [[Buddhist]], was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand Lisa's personality. When he pitched the plot idea to the ''Simpsons'' writing staff, they became concerned about the episode's originality. They argued that the series had already explored religious themes in earlier episodes, but Jean assured them that the episode would be about Lisa first-and-foremost, rather than Buddhism. Unlike several other episodes in the series in which a character undergoes a change in their personality, Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode, much like her conversion to vegetarianism in \"[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]\".<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\nFreiberger pitched the [[subplot]] involving the model rockets in the beginning of the episode. He based it on a real-life experience, in which he, as a child, accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house.<ref name=\"Freiberger\" /> A scene from this subplot was removed from the episode following the [[September 11 attacks]]. The scene would show a man named Hassan Jay Salam being arrested by policemen (who tells them to call his cousin [[Casey Kasem]]), who think the rocket Bart and Homer launched was launched by him (The rocket bears the abbreviation HJS, which stands for Homer J Simpson). After the attacks, the scene was considered too offensive by the Fox [[Censorship|censors]], so the scene was removed.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> Originally, the subplot would involve Marge trying to get Homer to build model rockets with Bart. Homer would not want to at first, but after Marge convinces him, he would soon get more into it than Bart. The plot idea was encouraged by some of the writers who thought that Marge had \"gotten short shrift,\" and, according to Freiberger, Marge would have had a \"really big part motivating the story\" had the subplot remained intact.<ref name=\"Freiberger\" />\n[[File:Richardgere.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Richard Gere]] agreed to appear as long as Lisa said \"Free Tibet\" in the episode.]]\nThe renovated church in the episode is built like a mall; several stores and merchandising is located inside, and Reverend Lovejoy plugs products and television programs during his sermons. The scene is used to satirize the so-called \"[[megachurches]]\" and the commercialization sometimes associated with these institutions.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> The episode also argues that, even if Christmas has lost most of its meaning, it is more important to \"keep these thoughts to oneself in order to make the family happy.\"<ref name=\"Salont\">{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/diary/2001/12/20/tv_christmas/index.html |title=What I learned about Christmas |date=December 20, 2001 |accessdate=April 2, 2011 |last=Chocano |first=Carina |work=Salon }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It also comments on what the writers believe to be the \"all or nothing, we're right, you're all going to hell mentality\" of some Christian movements.<ref name=\"Project-blu\">{{cite web|url=http://project-blu.com/reviews/simpsons13.html |title=The Simpsons: The Thirteenth Season |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |last=Boss |first=Nate |publisher=Project-Blu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622070047/http://project-blu.com/reviews/simpsons13.html |archivedate=June 22, 2011 }}</ref> Even though \"She of Little Faith\" is a Christmas episode, the holiday is not mentioned until the episode's third act. Jean stated in the DVD [[audio commentary]] for the episode that the writers did not want to make a conventional Christmas episode, and instead wanted to \"slide into\" the subject.<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\nThe episode features actor [[Richard Gere]] as himself. Gere agreed to guest star under two conditions, the first being that Buddhism should be portrayed accurately, and his second and strongest request being that Lisa should say \"Free Tibet\" in the episode. Jean agreed, but Gere ended up with the line. However, Lisa did yell out \"Free Tibet\" in an episode in the following season. Gere's lines were recorded in [[New York City]] by Jean who, in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, stated that Gere was \"great\" and that he \"didn't mind being made fun of\" in the episode.
