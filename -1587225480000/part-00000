The linguist Warren W. Glover classified Newar as a part of Bodic subdivision using Shafer's terminology.<ref>Newari language and linguistic conspectus, CNAS,1981</ref> Professor Van Driem classified Newar within the [[Mahakiranti languages|Mahakiranti grouping]] but he later retracted his hypothesis in 2003.

R. Kansakar attributes the difficulty about the placement of Newar to the inability of scholars to connect it with the migration patterns of the Tibeto-Burman speakers. Since Newar separated from rest of the family very early in history, it is difficult or at least arbitrary to reconstruct the basic stratum that contributed to present day Newar speech. He underscored the point that the language evolved from mixed racial/linguistic influences that do not lend easily to a neat classification.<ref name=\"thlib\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_08_02_01.pdf|date=June 1981|journal=CNAS Journal|volume=VIII|issue=2|author=Tej R.

Writers [[Nisthananda Bajracharya]], [[Siddhidas Mahaju]], [[Jagat Sundar Malla]] and [[Yogbir Singh Kansakar]] are honored as the [[Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa]]. [[Shukraraj Shastri]] and [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]] were also at the forefront of the Renaissance.\n\nIn 1909, Bajracharya published the first printed book using movable type. Shastri wrote a grammar of the language entitled ''Nepal Bhasa Vyakaran'', the first one in modern times. It was published from [[Kolkata]] in 1928. His other works include ''Nepal Bhasa Reader'', Books 1 and 2 (1933) and an alphabet book ''Nepali Varnamala'' (1933).<ref>Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. Page 27.</ref>\n\nMahaju's translation of the [[Ramayana|Ramayan]] and books on morals and ethics, Malla's endeavours to impart education in the native language and other literary activities marked the renaissance. Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Newar ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'' (\"Buddhism and Nepalese\") from [[Kolkata]] in 1925. Also, the Renaissance marked the beginning of the movement to get official recognition for the name \"Nepal Bhasa\" in place of the [[Khas]] imposed term \"Newari\".\n\nSome of the lines of Mahaju read as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\n:\u0938\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0928 \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0924\u0928\u0902 \u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0916 \u0928\u093e\u092a\u0902 \u092d\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0935\u0948\n:sajjana manu\u1e63y\u0101 sa\u1e43gatana\u1e43 m\u016brkha n\u0101pa\u1e43 bhin\u0101 vai\n:\u092a\u0932\u0947\u0932\u093e \u0932\u092a\u0924\u0947 \u0932 \u0935\u0902\u0938\u093e \u092e\u094d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u0925\u0947\u0902 \u0932 \u0938\u0928\u093e \u0935\u0948\n:pal\u0113l\u0101 lapat\u0113 la va\u1e43s\u0101 mvati th\u0113\u1e43 la san\u0101 vai\n</blockquote>\n\nThe verse states that even a moron can improve with the company of good people just like a drop of water appears like a pearl when it descends upon the leaves of a lotus plant.\n\n===Modern Newar===\n\n====Jail years====\n\nThe years 1941\u20131945 are known as the jail years for the large number of authors who were imprisoned for their literary or political activities.

In 1946, the monks who had been exiled by the Ranas in 1944 for teaching Buddhism and writing in Newar were allowed to return following international pressure. Restrictions on publication were relaxed, and books could be published after being censored. The monks wrote wide-ranging books on Buddhism and greatly enriched the corpus of religious literature.<ref>LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005).

(1971). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Jatah.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 47.</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\n\n{{main article|Nepal Bhasa literature}}\n\nNewar literature has a long history. It has the one of the oldest literature of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] (together with Chinese, Tibetan, Tangut, Burmese, Yi, etc.)\n\n=== Drama ===\n[[Drama]]s are traditionally performed in open Dabu (stage). Most of the traditional dramas are tales related to deities and demons. Masked characters and music are central elements to such dramas. Most of them are narrated with the help of songs sung at intervals. Such dramas resemble dance in many cases. The theme of most dramas is the creation of a social well-being with morals illustrating the rise, turbulence, and fall of evil. There is fixed dates in the [[Nepal Sambat]] (Nepal Era) calendar for the performance of specific drama. Most of the dramas are performed by specific [[Guthi]]s.\n\n=== Poetry ===\n[[Poetry]] writing constituted a pompous part of medieval Malla aristocracy. Many of the kings were well-renowned poets. [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] and [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] are two great poets in the language.\n\n=== Prose fiction ===\nProse [[fiction]] in Newar is a relatively new field of literature compared to other fields. Most fiction was written in poetry form until the medieval era. Consequently, almost all prose fiction belongs to the modern Newar era. Collections of short stories in Newar are more popular than novels.\n\n=== Story ===\nThe art of verbal [[folklore|story]] telling is very old in Newar. There are a variety of mythical and social stories that have aided in establishing the norm of Kathmandu valley. Stories ranging from the origin of Kathmandu valley to the temples of the valley and the important monuments have been passed down verbally in Newar and very few exist in written form. However, with an increase in the literacy rate and an awareness among the people, folklore stories are being written down. Stories on other topics are also becoming popular.\n\n== Dialects ==\nKansakar (2011)<ref>Kansakar, Tej R. 2011. ''A sociolinguistic survey of Newar / Nepal Bhasa''. Linguistic Survey of Nepal (LinSuN), Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal.</ref> recognizes three main Newar dialect clusters.\n*Western: Tansen (Palpa), Butwal, Old Pokhara, Dumre, Bandipur, Ridhi (Gulmi), Baglung, Dotili / Silgadi\n\n*'''Central''': [[Kathmandu]], [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Bhaktapur]], Thimi, Kirtipur, Citlang, Lele, Balaju, Tokha, Pharping, Thankot, Dadikot, Balami, Gopali, Bungamati, [[Badegaon]], Pyangaon, Chapagaon, Lubhu, Sankhu, Chakhunti, Gamtsa Gorkha, Badikhel (Pahari), [[Kavrepalanchok District]] dialects (Banepa, Nala, Sangaa, Chaukot, Panauti, Dhulikhel, Duti), Khampu, Khopasi\n\n*'''Eastern''': Chainpur, Dharan, [[Dolakhae dialect|Dolakha]], Sindhupalchok, Taplejung, Terhathum, Bhojpur, Dhankuta, Narayangadh, Jhapa, Ilam\n\nKansakar (2011) also gives the following classification of Newar dialects based on verb conjugation morphology.\n*Central\n**Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Chitlang, Lele\n**Bhaktapur, Thimi\n*Eastern\n**Dolakha, Tauthali, Jethal, Listikot, Doti\n**Pahari (Badikhel)\n\nThe main dialects of Newar are:\n\n;[[Dolakhae dialect|Dolkhali]] (Dolakha)\n:This is the most preserved form of the language and resembles the old Newar.\n;Sindhupalchok Pahri\n:This dialect, also known as Pahri or Pahari, is found in the [[Sindhupalchok District]] of central Nepal.<ref name=\"e18\"/> It a similar vocabulary as the Yala subdialect of Yen-Yala-Kyepu dialect. However, the language is spoken with a [[Tamang language]] tone.\n;Chitlang\n:This dialect is used in [[Chitlang]], a place south of Kathmandu valley in Makawanpur district. This is one of the biggest Newar bastions at Chitlang. Balami caste predominates there. Recently a new committee named \"Balami Samaaj\" has been established to give an identity rather than Newar but as the government has categorized Balami as Newar, this attempt fails.\n;Kathmandu\n:Kathmandu dialect is one of the dominant form of language and very close to the standard form of language used in academics and media. It is also the most widely used dialect. It is especially spoken in [[Kathmandu]]. It is very similar to the Lalitpur dialect.\n;Lalitpur\n:Lalitpur dialect is the most dominant form of language and is the standard form of language used in academics and media. It is also very widely used dialect. It is especially spoken in [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]].\n;Bhaktapur\n:Also known as ''Khvapa Bh\u0101y'' {{lang|new|\u0916\u094d\u0935\u092a: \u092d\u093e\u092f\u094d}}, this dialect is more archaic than the standard. Variations exist in the use of this form of language in Bhaktapur, Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel.\n\n[[Religion]]s play a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]-like role in dialectical diversity though they are minor. It has been recorded from the [[Malla period]]. [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were present at that age and few words in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of Newar differs. With the recent growth of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], other religions, and [[atheism]] in Nepal, the diversity in the speech registers regarding religious terminology has become more extended, such as omitting the word ''dya\u1e25'' ({{lang|new|\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903}}, '[[Deva (Hinduism)|god]]') after the name of a deity by many people whereas it is retained in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].\nFor example, Lord [[Ganesha]] is said as ''Ganedya\u1e25'' ({{lang|new|\u0917\u0928\u0947\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903}}) by [[Hindus]] and [[Buddhists]] but only ''Gane'' ({{lang|new|\u0917\u0928\u0947}}) by other people.\n\n==Phonology==\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Orthographic vowel length represents a difference of vowel quality, and in fact vowel length is indicated with the visarga after the vowel an (e.g. ''kh\u0101\u1e25'' '\u00eds') and with other vowels is written with the independent vowel letter (which would not be permitted e.g. in Sanskrit), for example mhii:ga: 'day after tomorrow'.{{Clarification needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Vowels====\nThe vowels, called ''m\u0101 \u0101kha'' (\u092e\u093e\u0906\u0916\u0903), meaning \"mother letters\", used in Newar are:\n\n{|border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"550\"\n|-\n!Orthography||\u0905 ||\u0905\u0903 || \u0906||\u0906\u0903 || \u0907 || \u0908 || \u0909 ||  \u090a ||\u090b ||\u0960|| \u090c|| \u0961||   \u090f||    \u0910 ||  \u0913 ||   \u0914 || \u0905\u0901||  \u0905\u0902 ||  \u0905\u092f\u094d  ||  \u0906\u092f\u094d  ||  \u090f\u092f\u094d\n|- align = center\n|Roman||a||a:|| aa||aa: || i ||ii|| u || uu  || ri|| rii ||  lri|| lrii ||  e ||  ai || o || au || an || aN||ay||aay||ey\n|-align=\"center\"\n\n|}\n\nEven though \u090b, \u0960, \u090c, \u0961 are present in Newar, they are rarely used.

For instance, \"My name is Bilat (Birat)\" is \"Jigu Na'aa Bilat Khaa'a \" which word by word translation becomes, \"My (Jigu) Name (Na'aa) Bilat is (Khaa'a)\".\n\nInterrogative sentence-<br/>\nWh-question:<br/>\nIn the case of Newar language, Wh-questions are rather \"G-questions\" with \"when/which\" being replaced by \"Gublay/Gugu\" respectively. There is an additional \"Guli\" which is used for \"How much/How many\". A S-word \"Soo\" is used for \"who\". \"Chhoo/Schoo (with a silent 's')\" is used for \"What\", and \"Gathey\" is used for \"How\".\n\n===Affixes===\n\n''Suffix''- \"''Chaa''\" and \"''Ju''\" are two popular suffixes. \"''Chaa''\" is added to signify \"''junior''\" or \"''lesser''\". But when added to a name, it is used derogatorily. For example, ''kya'ah-chaa'' means nephew where \"''chaa''\" is being added to ''kya'ah(son)''. When added to name like ''Birat'' for \"''Birat-chaa''\", it is being used derogatorily. The suffix \"''ju''\" is added to show respect. For example, \"''Baa-ju''\" means \"''father-in-law''\" where \"''ju''\" is added to \"''Baa(father)''\". Unlike \"''chaa''\", \"''ju''\" is not added to a first/last name directly. Instead, honorific terms like \"''Bhaaju''\" is added for males and \"''Mayju''\" for females. Example, \"''Birat bhaaju''\" for a male name (''Birat'') and \"''Suja Mayju''\" for a female name (''Suja'').\n\n''Prefix'' \u2013 \"''Tap'ah''\" is added to denote \"remote\" or \"distant\" relative ('distance' in relationship irrespective of spatial extent). A distant (younger) brother (''kija'') becomes \"''tap'ah-kija''\". \"''Tuh''\" is added to denote \"higher\". Father (''baa'')'s senior brother is referred to as \"''Tuh-baa''\".\n\n==Indo-Aryan loanwords==\nNewar is one of the most Aryanized Sino-Tibetan languages.

The language, therefore, plays a central unifying role in the existence and perpetuation of the Newar community. The poet Siddhidas Mahaju concluded that the Newar community and its rich culture can only survive if the Newar language survives (\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093e \u092e\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093f \u092e\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0907).\n\nThe Newars enjoyed promotions in various areas since Kathmandu become the capital of the country as they rose in ranks throughout the government, royal courts and businesses. However, the Newar language has languished as the state has patronized Gorkhali as the Nepali national language.\n\nNewar faced a decline during the Shah era when this language was replaced by Khas Kura (later renamed Nepali) as the national language and after the introduction of the \"One nation, one language\" policy of King Mahendra. The then Royal Nepalese Government spent a lot for Sanskrit education and a Sanskrit University was approved during those times\u2014although Sanskrit is virtually not spoken by anyone in Nepal\u2014because Khas Kura's roots lie in Sanskrit. There were very few resources available then for even primary-level education in Newar. There were no programs broadcast in Newar on the state radio, Radio Nepal. Even after programs in Newar began to be broadcast, the language was referred to as \"Newari\", a term considered derogatory by Newars. Even today, there are no programs in Newar in the state television, Nepal Television, although it broadcasts a Bollywood Hindi movie every Saturday  (although it is used as lingua franca in Terai, Hindi is the native language of less than 1% population in Nepal) and often Pakistani serials (in Urdu) as well. The Supreme Court of Nepal has also banned any use of Newar even for trivial matters in official purposes of any part of Nepal. These factors have led to a resentment among the Newar community.\n\nThis fact has been used for political advantages by many parties of Nepal. Many slogans are translated into Newar, although very few important documents of political parties are ever translated into Newar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Nepal|Languages}}\n*[[Languages of Nepal]]\n*[[Nepal Bhasa journalism]]\n*[[Newa (Unicode block)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Bendix, E.

The linguist Warren W. Glover classified Newar as a part of Bodic subdivision using Shafer's terminology.<ref>Newari language and linguistic conspectus, CNAS,1981</ref> Professor Van Driem classified Newar within the [[Mahakiranti languages|Mahakiranti grouping]] but he later retracted his hypothesis in 2003. Moreover, he proposed a new grouping called \"Maha-Newari\" which possibly includes [[Baram\u2013Thangmi languages|Baram\u2013Thangmi]].<ref>Mark Turin, Newar-Thangmi Linguistics Correspondence, Journal of Asian and African Studies, No. 68, 2004</ref>\n\nT. R. Kansakar attributes the difficulty about the placement of Newar to the inability of scholars to connect it with the migration patterns of the Tibeto-Burman speakers.

Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Newar ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'' (\"Buddhism and Nepalese\") from [[Kolkata]] in 1925.

In 1946, the monks who had been exiled by the Ranas in 1944 for teaching Buddhism and writing in Newar were allowed to return following international pressure. Restrictions on publication were relaxed, and books could be published after being censored. The monks wrote wide-ranging books on Buddhism and greatly enriched the corpus of religious literature.<ref>LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005).

It has the one of the oldest literature of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] (together with Chinese, Tibetan, Tangut, Burmese, Yi, etc.)\n\n=== Drama ===\n[[Drama]]s are traditionally performed in open Dabu (stage). Most of the traditional dramas are tales related to deities and demons. Masked characters and music are central elements to such dramas. Most of them are narrated with the help of songs sung at intervals. Such dramas resemble dance in many cases. The theme of most dramas is the creation of a social well-being with morals illustrating the rise, turbulence, and fall of evil. There is fixed dates in the [[Nepal Sambat]] (Nepal Era) calendar for the performance of specific drama. Most of the dramas are performed by specific [[Guthi]]s.\n\n=== Poetry ===\n[[Poetry]] writing constituted a pompous part of medieval Malla aristocracy. Many of the kings were well-renowned poets. [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] and [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] are two great poets in the language.\n\n=== Prose fiction ===\nProse [[fiction]] in Newar is a relatively new field of literature compared to other fields. Most fiction was written in poetry form until the medieval era. Consequently, almost all prose fiction belongs to the modern Newar era. Collections of short stories in Newar are more popular than novels.\n\n=== Story ===\nThe art of verbal [[folklore|story]] telling is very old in Newar. There are a variety of mythical and social stories that have aided in establishing the norm of Kathmandu valley. Stories ranging from the origin of Kathmandu valley to the temples of the valley and the important monuments have been passed down verbally in Newar and very few exist in written form. However, with an increase in the literacy rate and an awareness among the people, folklore stories are being written down. Stories on other topics are also becoming popular.\n\n== Dialects ==\nKansakar (2011)<ref>Kansakar, Tej R. 2011. ''A sociolinguistic survey of Newar / Nepal Bhasa''. Linguistic Survey of Nepal (LinSuN), Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal.</ref> recognizes three main Newar dialect clusters.\n*Western: Tansen (Palpa), Butwal, Old Pokhara, Dumre, Bandipur, Ridhi (Gulmi), Baglung, Dotili / Silgadi\n\n*'''Central''': [[Kathmandu]], [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Bhaktapur]], Thimi, Kirtipur, Citlang, Lele, Balaju, Tokha, Pharping, Thankot, Dadikot, Balami, Gopali, Bungamati, [[Badegaon]], Pyangaon, Chapagaon, Lubhu, Sankhu, Chakhunti, Gamtsa Gorkha, Badikhel (Pahari), [[Kavrepalanchok District]] dialects (Banepa, Nala, Sangaa, Chaukot, Panauti, Dhulikhel, Duti), Khampu, Khopasi\n\n*'''Eastern''': Chainpur, Dharan, [[Dolakhae dialect|Dolakha]], Sindhupalchok, Taplejung, Terhathum, Bhojpur, Dhankuta, Narayangadh, Jhapa, Ilam\n\nKansakar (2011) also gives the following classification of Newar dialects based on verb conjugation morphology.\n*Central\n**Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Chitlang, Lele\n**Bhaktapur, Thimi\n*Eastern\n**Dolakha, Tauthali, Jethal, Listikot, Doti\n**Pahari (Badikhel)\n\nThe main dialects of Newar are:\n\n;[[Dolakhae dialect|Dolkhali]] (Dolakha)\n:This is the most preserved form of the language and resembles the old Newar.\n;Sindhupalchok Pahri\n:This dialect, also known as Pahri or Pahari, is found in the [[Sindhupalchok District]] of central Nepal.<ref name=\"e18\"/> It a similar vocabulary as the Yala subdialect of Yen-Yala-Kyepu dialect. However, the language is spoken with a [[Tamang language]] tone.\n;Chitlang\n:This dialect is used in [[Chitlang]], a place south of Kathmandu valley in Makawanpur district. This is one of the biggest Newar bastions at Chitlang. Balami caste predominates there. Recently a new committee named \"Balami Samaaj\" has been established to give an identity rather than Newar but as the government has categorized Balami as Newar, this attempt fails.\n;Kathmandu\n:Kathmandu dialect is one of the dominant form of language and very close to the standard form of language used in academics and media. It is also the most widely used dialect. It is especially spoken in [[Kathmandu]]. It is very similar to the Lalitpur dialect.\n;Lalitpur\n:Lalitpur dialect is the most dominant form of language and is the standard form of language used in academics and media. It is also very widely used dialect. It is especially spoken in [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]].\n;Bhaktapur\n:Also known as ''Khvapa Bh\u0101y'' {{lang|new|\u0916\u094d\u0935\u092a: \u092d\u093e\u092f\u094d}}, this dialect is more archaic than the standard. Variations exist in the use of this form of language in Bhaktapur, Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel.\n\n[[Religion]]s play a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]-like role in dialectical diversity though they are minor. It has been recorded from the [[Malla period]]. [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were present at that age and few words in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of Newar differs. With the recent growth of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], other religions, and [[atheism]] in Nepal, the diversity in the speech registers regarding religious terminology has become more extended, such as omitting the word ''dya\u1e25'' ({{lang|new|\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903}}, '[[Deva (Hinduism)|god]]') after the name of a deity by many people whereas it is retained in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].\nFor example, Lord [[Ganesha]] is said as ''Ganedya\u1e25'' ({{lang|new|\u0917\u0928\u0947\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903}}) by [[Hindus]] and [[Buddhists]] but only ''Gane'' ({{lang|new|\u0917\u0928\u0947}}) by other people.\n\n==Phonology==\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

For instance, \"My name is Bilat (Birat)\" is \"Jigu Na'aa Bilat Khaa'a \" which word by word translation becomes, \"My (Jigu) Name (Na'aa) Bilat is (Khaa'a)\".\n\nInterrogative sentence-<br/>\nWh-question:<br/>\nIn the case of Newar language, Wh-questions are rather \"G-questions\" with \"when/which\" being replaced by \"Gublay/Gugu\" respectively. There is an additional \"Guli\" which is used for \"How much/How many\". A S-word \"Soo\" is used for \"who\". \"Chhoo/Schoo (with a silent 's')\" is used for \"What\", and \"Gathey\" is used for \"How\".\n\n===Affixes===\n\n''Suffix''- \"''Chaa''\" and \"''Ju''\" are two popular suffixes. \"''Chaa''\" is added to signify \"''junior''\" or \"''lesser''\". But when added to a name, it is used derogatorily. For example, ''kya'ah-chaa'' means nephew where \"''chaa''\" is being added to ''kya'ah(son)''. When added to name like ''Birat'' for \"''Birat-chaa''\", it is being used derogatorily. The suffix \"''ju''\" is added to show respect. For example, \"''Baa-ju''\" means \"''father-in-law''\" where \"''ju''\" is added to \"''Baa(father)''\". Unlike \"''chaa''\", \"''ju''\" is not added to a first/last name directly. Instead, honorific terms like \"''Bhaaju''\" is added for males and \"''Mayju''\" for females. Example, \"''Birat bhaaju''\" for a male name (''Birat'') and \"''Suja Mayju''\" for a female name (''Suja'').\n\n''Prefix'' \u2013 \"''Tap'ah''\" is added to denote \"remote\" or \"distant\" relative ('distance' in relationship irrespective of spatial extent). A distant (younger) brother (''kija'') becomes \"''tap'ah-kija''\". \"''Tuh''\" is added to denote \"higher\". Father (''baa'')'s senior brother is referred to as \"''Tuh-baa''\".\n\n==Indo-Aryan loanwords==\nNewar is one of the most Aryanized Sino-Tibetan languages.

The language, therefore, plays a central unifying role in the existence and perpetuation of the Newar community. The poet Siddhidas Mahaju concluded that the Newar community and its rich culture can only survive if the Newar language survives (\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093e \u092e\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093f \u092e\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0907).\n\nThe Newars enjoyed promotions in various areas since Kathmandu become the capital of the country as they rose in ranks throughout the government, royal courts and businesses. However, the Newar language has languished as the state has patronized Gorkhali as the Nepali national language.\n\nNewar faced a decline during the Shah era when this language was replaced by Khas Kura (later renamed Nepali) as the national language and after the introduction of the \"One nation, one language\" policy of King Mahendra. The then Royal Nepalese Government spent a lot for Sanskrit education and a Sanskrit University was approved during those times\u2014although Sanskrit is virtually not spoken by anyone in Nepal\u2014because Khas Kura's roots lie in Sanskrit. There were very few resources available then for even primary-level education in Newar. There were no programs broadcast in Newar on the state radio, Radio Nepal. Even after programs in Newar began to be broadcast, the language was referred to as \"Newari\", a term considered derogatory by Newars. Even today, there are no programs in Newar in the state television, Nepal Television, although it broadcasts a Bollywood Hindi movie every Saturday  (although it is used as lingua franca in Terai, Hindi is the native language of less than 1% population in Nepal) and often Pakistani serials (in Urdu) as well. The Supreme Court of Nepal has also banned any use of Newar even for trivial matters in official purposes of any part of Nepal. These factors have led to a resentment among the Newar community.\n\nThis fact has been used for political advantages by many parties of Nepal. Many slogans are translated into Newar, although very few important documents of political parties are ever translated into Newar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Nepal|Languages}}\n*[[Languages of Nepal]]\n*[[Nepal Bhasa journalism]]\n*[[Newa (Unicode block)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Bendix, E.

They also deal with other incidents including lost children, shark scares, [[Portuguese man o' war|bluebottle]] stings, injuries, sexual deviants, drunk beach goers and thieves on the beach. Every once in a while, celebrities also make appearances on their shores. These have included actors/comedians [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Kelly Slater]] (stars of the US lifeguards fiction show Baywatch), [[Hugh Grant]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Russell Crowe]], entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]], American comedian [[Conan O'Brien]], musician [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Steve Irwin]] and daughter [[Bindi Irwin|Bindi]] and the [[India national cricket team|Indian Cricket Team]]. Bondi veterinarian [[Chris Brown (veterinarian)|Chris Brown]] repeatedly appeared on Bondi beach, meeting lifeguards, in his own show [[Bondi Vet]].\n\nBondi also has its Annual Lifeguard [[Ironman (surf lifesaving)|Ironman]] Challenge, which tests the skills of each lifeguard with a one-kilometre run from Bondi to local beach [[Tamarama]], then a one-kilometre swim to nearby [[Bronte Beach]], followed by a two-kilometre board-paddle back to Bondi. The race is  handicapped: the more accomplished swimmers and board-paddlers set off from Bondi later (up to twelve minutes, depending on how many competitors there are).\n\nFootage for the show is shot during the preceding Australian summer (usually between November and February), with certain episodes reflecting incidents that have occurred during Christmas Day, New Year's Day and [[Australia Day]]. Noteworthy incidents at nearby Tamarama and Bronte Beaches, which the lifeguards are also responsible for, are occasionally shown. Later seasons also featured footage of lifeguard trials and training exercises from the middle of the year. The training in the middle of the year is a trial to test the fitness, strength and ability of the lifeguards. It consists of an 800-metre swim in under thirteen-and-a-half minutes in a swimming pool, then a 600-metre swim surf and two 600-metre runs and on the sand and also a 600-metre board paddle then a set of demanding rescues at Bondi which should be completed in under 25 minutes. It is also a test for trainee lifeguards to show they are able and committed to the role of a lifeguard. If the competitors do not complete the tasks in the time limit, they are eliminated and do not advance to the next test.\n\nMany rescue boards and jet skis have a camera attached for close-up footage. When deemed safe to do so, the cameraman accompanies the lifeguards out to sea and has even had to assist with rescue operations on a number of occasions.\n\nThe production company pays [[Waverley Council]] $139,000 per year and a percentage of profits to film the program, and the Council also holds \"review rights\" to ensure content is acceptable to their practices.<ref>{{cite

The program, which has aired since 2006, follows the daily lives and routines of the [[Waverley Council]] professional lifeguards who patrol [[Bondi Beach]].<ref>[http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/things_to_do/beaches_and_the_coast/lifeguards Waverley Council - Professional Lifeguards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322080308/http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/things_to_do/beaches_and_the_coast/lifeguards |date=22 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n''Bondi Rescue'' was first broadcast in 2006. A spin-off, set in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]], also briefly screened in 2008.<ref name=TVT2/><ref>{{cite news|title=Not drowning, saving|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/09/17/1221330909490.html|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=18 September 2008}}</ref> ''Bondi Rescue'' is also broadcast internationally throughout 100 countries.\n\nThe show was created and produced by part-time lifeguard Ben Davies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/much-kuta-than-here/2008/09/06/1220121584411.html|title=Much Kuta than here|date=8 September 2008|last=Forbes|first=Mark|accessdate=18 July 2011|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> It is narrated by [[Osher G\u00fcnsberg]].\n\n[[File:Bondi rescue lifeguard - Paris hilton bondi beach 31 december 2008 (7).jpg|thumb|Dunstan \"Dunno\" Foss (black cap) and [[Ryan Clark (actor)|Ryan \"Whippet\" Clark]] (white cap) with [[Paris Hilton]] on Bondi Beach on New Year's Eve 2008]]\n\n==Overview==\nThe Bondi lifeguards perform around five thousand rescues over the summer period. They also deal with other incidents including lost children, shark scares, [[Portuguese man o' war|bluebottle]] stings, injuries, sexual deviants, drunk beach goers and thieves on the beach. Every once in a while, celebrities also make appearances on their shores. These have included actors/comedians [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Kelly Slater]] (stars of the US lifeguards fiction show Baywatch), [[Hugh Grant]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Russell Crowe]], entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]], American comedian [[Conan O'Brien]], musician [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Steve Irwin]] and daughter [[Bindi Irwin|Bindi]] and the [[India national cricket team|Indian Cricket Team]]. Bondi veterinarian [[Chris Brown (veterinarian)|Chris Brown]] repeatedly appeared on Bondi beach, meeting lifeguards, in his own show [[Bondi Vet]].\n\nBondi also has its Annual Lifeguard [[Ironman (surf lifesaving)|Ironman]] Challenge, which tests the skills of each lifeguard with a one-kilometre run from Bondi to local beach [[Tamarama]], then a one-kilometre swim to nearby [[Bronte Beach]], followed by a two-kilometre board-paddle back to Bondi. The race is  handicapped: the more accomplished swimmers and board-paddlers set off from Bondi later (up to twelve minutes, depending on how many competitors there are).\n\nFootage for the show is shot during the preceding Australian summer (usually between November and February), with certain episodes reflecting incidents that have occurred during Christmas Day, New Year's Day and [[Australia Day]]. Noteworthy incidents at nearby Tamarama and Bronte Beaches, which the lifeguards are also responsible for, are occasionally shown. Later seasons also featured footage of lifeguard trials and training exercises from the middle of the year. The training in the middle of the year is a trial to test the fitness, strength and ability of the lifeguards. It consists of an 800-metre swim in under thirteen-and-a-half minutes in a swimming pool, then a 600-metre swim surf and two 600-metre runs and on the sand and also a 600-metre board paddle then a set of demanding rescues at Bondi which should be completed in under 25 minutes. It is also a test for trainee lifeguards to show they are able and committed to the role of a lifeguard. If the competitors do not complete the tasks in the time limit, they are eliminated and do not advance to the next test.\n\nMany rescue boards and jet skis have a camera attached for close-up footage. When deemed safe to do so, the cameraman accompanies the lifeguards out to sea and has even had to assist with rescue operations on a number of occasions.\n\nThe production company pays [[Waverley

Its route parallels the coastal [[South Eastern main line]] and [[Kent Coast line]] route that runs between the same places via [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover]].\n\nThe line was opened in 1846 by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] (SER), who wanted to compete with rival railway companies, particularly the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LDCR) for traffic between London and Thanet. The SER's route included reversing at Ramsgate to take a branch line to {{rws|Margate Sands}}; this line has since closed. The remainder of the line is double-track and [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]] with 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]] [[third rail]]. At Ashford it links to [[High Speed 1]] for fast services to {{rws|St Pancras International}}.\n\n==Services==\nServices are operated by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]. {{As of|2019|12}}, the typical off-peak down service per hour is:\n\n* One high-speed service from [[St Pancras railway station|London St. Pancras International]] towards {{stnlnk|Margate}}, stopping only at {{stnlnk|Canterbury West}}\n* One service from [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] to {{stnlnk|Ramsgate}}, stopping at {{stnlnk|Wye}}, Canterbury West, {{stnlnk|Sturry}} and {{stnlnk|Minster}} and skipping {{stnlnk|Chilham}} and {{stnlnk|Chartham}}\n* One service from London Victoria via {{stnlnk|Maidstone East}} to Canterbury West only, stopping at Wye, Chilham and Chartham\nA small number of peak services on the [[Kent Coast line]] run onto the Ashford to Ramsgate line at Minster and then reverse as a school service, running Ramsgate-Minster-Sandwich-Deal (mornings) or the reverse (evenings).<ref> [https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/-/media/goahead/southeastern/documents/timetables/december-timetable/december-timetable-1---15-december---16-may.pdf] Southeastern December 2019: London - Ashford, Folkestone, Dover and Margate </ref>\n\n==History==\nThe line was proposed by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] (SER) as a branch from its [[South Eastern Main Line|main line]] in April 1834. At the time, coastal towns on the [[Isle of Thanet]] such as [[Margate]] and [[Ramsgate]] were undergoing a rise in popularity as holiday resorts, and railways could be seen as faster and cheaper rivals to the [[steamboat]] traffic bringing holidaymakers from London. However, the SER suffered from having no direct access to Thanet on their network except via Ashford. By August 1836, the rival [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR) made its own proposal to serve Thanet.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=243}} Planning for the line stalled for a while, but by 1840 the SER realised that rival railways were making serious proposals for lines to Thanet.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=244}} After the LCDR's line reached Dover on 22 July 1861, there was serious competition between the two companies for continental port traffic.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=520}}\n\nConstruction on the line began in September 1884. The SER were not convinced the railway would be a success, and so built it as single track, with space to add an additional track if necessary, and crossed roads at level in several places, including [[Wye, Kent|Wye]], [[Chartham]] and [[Sturry]]. The line ran through [[Minster-in-Thanet|Minster]] to Ramsgate, then doubled back on a branch line to {{rws|Margate Sands}}, which required trains reversing. The overall planned cost was \u00a3385,339.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=244}}\n\nThe line opened as far as Canterbury on 6 February 1846.{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=53}} Intermediate stations were not immediately provided, but opened soon afterwards; [[Wye railway station]] was open by April 1846. A station was planned at [[Godmersham]] but then cancelled. The extension to Ramsgate opened on 13 April, with stations at {{rws|Grove Ferry}}, Minster and Ramsgate. The SER hoped by building the line to Ramsgate, it would be able to run [[boat train]] services to [[Ostend]].{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=245}} The Margate branch was delayed and finally opened on 1 December 1846.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=246}} An intermediate station at Sturry opened on 22 April 1847.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=246}}\n\nThe goods and cattle facilities at Ramsgate made the line popular for transporting these, and they were extended in 1895. An additional siding was added at Wye in 1895 to serve racing traffic.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=251}}\n\nThe rivalry between the SER and LDCR almost bankrupted both companies, and consequently they formed a joined management committee, known as the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]] (SECR), in 1899.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=520}} This then became part of the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR) as part of the grouping under the [[Railways Act 1921]].

Its route parallels the coastal [[South Eastern main line]] and [[Kent Coast line]] route that runs between the same places via [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover]].\n\nThe line was opened in 1846 by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] (SER), who wanted to compete with rival railway companies, particularly the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LDCR) for traffic between London and Thanet. The SER's route included reversing at Ramsgate to take a branch line to {{rws|Margate Sands}}; this line has since closed. The remainder of the line is double-track and [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]] with 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]] [[third rail]]. At Ashford it links to [[High Speed 1]] for fast services to {{rws|St Pancras International}}.\n\n==Services==\nServices are operated by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]. {{As of|2019|12}}, the typical off-peak down service per hour is:\n\n* One high-speed service from [[St Pancras railway station|London St. Pancras International]] towards {{stnlnk|Margate}}, stopping only at {{stnlnk|Canterbury West}}\n* One service from [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] to {{stnlnk|Ramsgate}}, stopping at {{stnlnk|Wye}}, Canterbury West, {{stnlnk|Sturry}} and {{stnlnk|Minster}} and skipping {{stnlnk|Chilham}} and {{stnlnk|Chartham}}\n* One service from London Victoria via {{stnlnk|Maidstone East}} to Canterbury West only, stopping at Wye, Chilham and Chartham\nA small number of peak services on the [[Kent Coast line]] run onto the Ashford to Ramsgate line at Minster and then reverse as a school service, running Ramsgate-Minster-Sandwich-Deal (mornings) or the reverse (evenings).<ref> [https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/-/media/goahead/southeastern/documents/timetables/december-timetable/december-timetable-1---15-december---16-may.pdf] Southeastern December 2019: London - Ashford, Folkestone, Dover and Margate </ref>\n\n==History==\nThe line was proposed by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] (SER) as a branch from its [[South Eastern Main Line|main line]] in April 1834. At the time, coastal towns on the [[Isle of Thanet]] such as [[Margate]] and [[Ramsgate]] were undergoing a rise in popularity as holiday resorts, and railways could be seen as faster and cheaper rivals to the [[steamboat]] traffic bringing holidaymakers from London. However, the SER suffered from having no direct access to Thanet on their network except via Ashford. By August 1836, the rival [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR) made its own proposal to serve Thanet.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=243}} Planning for the line stalled for a while, but by 1840 the SER realised that rival railways were making serious proposals for lines to Thanet.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=244}} After the LCDR's line reached Dover on 22 July 1861, there was serious competition between the two companies for continental port traffic.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=520}}\n\nConstruction on the line began in September 1884. The SER were not convinced the railway would be a success, and so built it as single track, with space to add an additional track if necessary, and crossed roads at level in several places, including [[Wye, Kent|Wye]], [[Chartham]] and [[Sturry]]. The line ran through [[Minster, Kent|Minster]] to Ramsgate, then doubled back on a branch line to {{rws|Margate Sands}}, which required trains reversing. The overall planned cost was \u00a3385,339.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=244}}\n\nThe line opened as far as Canterbury on 6 February 1846.{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=53}} Intermediate stations were not immediately provided, but opened soon afterwards; [[Wye railway station]] was open by April 1846. A station was planned at [[Godmersham]] but then cancelled. The extension to Ramsgate opened on 13 April, with stations at {{rws|Grove Ferry}}, Minster and Ramsgate. The SER hoped by building the line to Ramsgate, it would be able to run [[boat train]] services to [[Ostend]].{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=245}} The Margate branch was delayed and finally opened on 1 December 1846.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=246}} An intermediate station at Sturry opened on 22 April 1847.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=246}}\n\nThe goods and cattle facilities at Ramsgate made the line popular for transporting these, and they were extended in 1895. An additional siding was added at Wye in 1895 to serve racing traffic.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=251}}\n\nThe rivalry between the SER and LDCR almost bankrupted both companies, and consequently they formed a joined management committee, known as the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]] (SECR), in 1899.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=520}} This then became part of the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR) as part of the grouping under the [[Railways Act 1921]]. In 1924, a {{convert|1.5|miles|adj=on}} extension began construction between the former SER line at Ramsgate and the former LCDR line at {{rws|Dumpton Park}}. This opened on 2 July 1926.

{"title_page": "Genetic monitoring", "text_new": "'''Genetic monitoring''' is the use of [[Genetic marker|molecular markers]] to (i) identify individuals, species or populations, or (ii) to quantify changes in [[population genetic]] metrics (such as [[effective population size]], [[genetic diversity]] and population size) over time. Genetic monitoring can thus be used to detect changes in species abundance and/or diversity, and has become an important tool in both [[conservation management system|conservation]] and [[livestock]] management. The types of molecular markers used to monitor populations are most commonly [[mitochondrial]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), while earlier studies also used [[allozyme]] data. Species gene diversity is also recognized as an important [[biodiversity]] metric for implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].<ref>[http://www.cbd.int/ Website of the Convention on Biological Diversity]</ref>\n\n==Types==\nTypes of population changes that can be detected by genetic monitoring include population growth and decline, spread of pathogens, adaptation to environmental change, hybridization, introgression and habitat fragmentation events. Most of these changes are monitored using \u2018neutral\u2019 [[genetic markers]] (markers for which mutational changes do not change their adaptive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] within a population). However markers showing adaptive responses to environmental change can be \u2018non-neutral\u2019 (e.g. mutational changes affect their relative fitness within a population). [[File:Genetic Monitoring Categories.png|thumb|right|250px|Categories of Genetic Monitoring as defined by Schwartz et al. 2007<ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = M.K. | display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = Genetic monitoring as a promising tool for conservation and management | url = http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/publications/2007_schwartz_trends/2007_schwartz_trends.pdf | journal = Trends Ecol.

Category II represents the use of genetic markers to monitor changes of [[population genetic]] parameters, which include estimators of [[effective population size]] (Ne), genetic variation, population inter-mixing, structure and migration.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Estimating abundance and life history parameters \u2013 Category Ia===\nAt the individual level, genetic identification can enable estimation of population abundance and population increase rates within the framework of [[mark-recapture]] models. The abundance of cryptic or elusive species that are difficult to monitor can be estimated by collecting non-invasive biological samples in the field (e.g. feathers, scat or fur) and using these to identify individuals through [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) genotyping. This census of individuals can then be used to estimate population abundance via mark-recapture analysis. For example, this technique has been used to monitor populations of [[grizzly bear]],<ref name=\"boulanger\">{{cite journal | last1 = Boulanger | first1 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Monitoring of grizzly bear population trends and demography using DNA mark-recapture methods in the Owikeno Lake area of British Columbia | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 82 | issue = 8| pages = 1267\u20131277 | doi = 10.1139/Z04-100 }}</ref> [[brush-tailed rock-wallaby]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Piggott | first1 = M.P. | display-authors = etal | year = 2006 | title = Estimating population size of endangered Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) colonies using faecal DNA | url = | journal = Mol.

Genetic monitoring can thus be used to detect changes in species abundance and/or diversity, and has become an important tool in both [[conservation management system|conservation]] and [[livestock]] management. The types of molecular markers used to monitor populations are most commonly [[mitochondrial]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), while earlier studies also used [[allozyme]] data. Species gene diversity is also recognized as an important [[biodiversity]] metric for implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].<ref>[http://www.cbd.int/ Website of the Convention on Biological Diversity]</ref>\n\n==Types==\nTypes of population changes that can be detected by genetic monitoring include population growth and decline, spread of pathogens, adaptation to environmental change, hybridization, introgression and habitat fragmentation events. Most of these changes are monitored using \u2018neutral\u2019 [[genetic markers]] (markers for which mutational changes do not change their adaptive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] within a population). However markers showing adaptive responses to environmental change can be \u2018non-neutral\u2019 (e.g. mutational changes affect their relative fitness within a population).

Category II represents the use of genetic markers to monitor changes of [[population genetic]] parameters, which include estimators of [[effective population size]] (Ne), genetic variation, population inter-mixing, structure and migration.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Estimating abundance and life history parameters \u2013 Category Ia===\nAt the individual level, genetic identification can enable estimation of population abundance and population increase rates within the framework of [[mark-recapture]] models. The abundance of cryptic or elusive species that are difficult to monitor can be estimated by collecting non-invasive biological samples in the field (e.g. feathers, scat or fur) and using these to identify individuals through [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) genotyping. This census of individuals can then be used to estimate population abundance via mark-recapture analysis.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution. Increasingly difficult items involve a mix of puzzles that require fluid shifts in deduction, logic, and inference.<ref name=\"Schrank\" /> Analysis Synthesis tasks assess general sequential reasoning.\n\nIn the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]]-IV (WISC IV),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wechsler |first1=D. |year=2003 |title=WISC-IV technical and interpretive manual |location=San Antonio, TX |publisher=Psychological Corporation}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> the Perceptual Reasoning Index contains two subtests that assess Gf: Matrix Reasoning, which involves induction and deduction, and Picture Concepts, which involves induction.<ref name=\"Flanagan\">{{cite book |last1=Flanagan |first1=D.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. The Cognitive Process Profile (CPP) measures  a person's fluid intelligence and cognitive processes. It maps these against suitable work environments according to [[Elliott Jacques]] Stratified Systems Theory.\n\n==Development and physiology==\n\nFluid intelligence, like [[reaction time]], typically peaks in young adulthood and then steadily declines.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution. Increasingly difficult items involve a mix of puzzles that require fluid shifts in deduction, logic, and inference.<ref name=\"Schrank\" /> Analysis Synthesis tasks assess general sequential reasoning.\n\nIn the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]]-IV (WISC IV),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wechsler |first1=D. |year=2003 |title=WISC-IV technical and interpretive manual |location=San Antonio, TX |publisher=Psychological Corporation}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> the Perceptual Reasoning Index contains two subtests that assess Gf: Matrix Reasoning, which involves induction and deduction, and Picture Concepts, which involves induction.<ref name=\"Flanagan\">{{cite book |last1=Flanagan |first1=D.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. The Cognitive Process Profile (CPP) measures  a person's fluid intelligence and cognitive processes. It maps these against suitable work environments according to [[Elliott Jacques]] Stratified Systems Theory.\n\n==Development and physiology==\n\nFluid intelligence, like [[reaction time]], typically peaks in young adulthood and then steadily declines.

She posted a series of messages on her [[Instagram]] profile alleging that a man sitting behind her on the flight had caressed her neck while she was asleep. She also wrote that she had tried to record what the man was doing, but failed due to dim lights. The airline issued an apology on the issue and released a statement saying that a detailed investigation would be conducted. The accused, Vikas Sachdeva of [[Powai|Chandivli]] in Mumbai was subsequently arrested and charged under [[Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012|Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act]] (POCSO), given Wasim was a legal minor. The accused's wife claimed her husband had been resting when his leg accidentally touched Wasim and that he had apologised before getting off the plane at the Mumbai airport, which the actress had acknowledged. The suspect has been placed in [[Detention (imprisonment)|judicial custody]] pending a court hearing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/dangal-actress-zaira-wasim-harassed-on-vistara-flight-breaks-down-in-instagram-video/articleshow/62006045.cms|title=Dangal actress Zaira Wasim alleges molestation onboard Vistara flight|date=10 December 2017|work=The Economic Times|access-date=18 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/zaira-wasim-molestation-row-accuseds-judicial-custody-extended-to-december-22/articleshow/62055641.cms|title=Zaira Wasim molestation row: Accused's judicial custody extended to December 22|date=13 December 2017|work=The Economic Times|access-date=18 December 2017}}</ref> There has been support for the accused in the form of a signature-campaign by his neighbours and on social pages with pages like \u2018''Justice for Vikas Sachdeva''\u2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/support-pours-in-for-molestation-accused/article21827684.ece|title=support pours in for molestation accused|last=|first=|date=|work=The Hindu|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=}}</ref> Wasim subsequently became a target of [[internet troll]]ing, which has been criticised by the [[Mumbai Police]], stating in a [[Twitter|tweet]], \"It is the [[Constitutional right]] of every victim to report sexual abuse and it is our duty to take cognizance, investigate & facilitate justice.
