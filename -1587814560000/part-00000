Abed directs the group in the film ''Chief Starr and the Raiders of the Galaxy'', incorporating outtake audio and recycled footage of Chang. The Dean stars as Chang's stand in body double, while Jeff plays the mayor of outer space, Britta plays Princess Meridian, and Annie stars as Scorpio 9, a pleasure droid assassin. Abed is forced to lower his filmmaking standards and asked to edit his film removing Jeff's big scene. Consequently, Jeff has an identity crisis and realizes he will be the last one to ever leave Greendale. At the last minute the film's producer Maury informs the group that the company funding the film went bankrupt thanks to [[YouTube]]. Chang comes back to Greendale after he talks back to an unseen [[Steven Spielberg]] and is replaced by [[Randall Park]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nThis episode parodies a scene from the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' when the characters fall into a trash compartment, as well as the films ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and actor [[Chris Pratt]]. The episode later lampoons the conventional distribution model of TV by suggesting the company set to distribute Abed's film just filed for bankruptcy because of the surge in online streaming.

It was released on [[Yahoo! Screen]] in the United States on April 28, 2015. \n\n==Plot==\nGreendale decides to cash in on Chang's new-found fame by turning a cop drama ''Police Justice,'' into a sci-fi movie. Abed directs the group in the film ''Chief Starr and the Raiders of the Galaxy'', incorporating outtake audio and recycled footage of Chang. The Dean stars as Chang's stand in body double, while Jeff plays the mayor of outer space, Britta plays Princess Meridian, and Annie stars as Scorpio 9, a pleasure droid assassin. Abed is forced to lower his filmmaking standards and asked to edit his film removing Jeff's big scene. Consequently, Jeff has an identity crisis and realizes he will be the last one to ever leave Greendale. At the last minute the film's producer Maury informs the group that the company funding the film went bankrupt thanks to [[YouTube]]. Chang comes back to Greendale after he talks back to an unseen [[Steven Spielberg]] and is replaced by [[Randall Park]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nThis episode parodies a scene from the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' when the characters fall into a trash compartment, as well as the films ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and actor [[Chris Pratt]]. The episode later lampoons the conventional distribution model of TV by suggesting the company set to distribute Abed's film just filed for bankruptcy because of the surge in online streaming. It also parodies ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' with Abed imitating [[Sheldon Cooper]] saying \"[[bazinga]]\" in a ball pit.\n\n==Production==\n\nOn February 9, 2015, [[Dan Harmon]] disclosed that [[Steve Guttenberg]] would be appearing on an episode of ''Community''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/danharmon/status/564974370397773824 |title=.@SteveGuttbuck is doing a guest role...@bcgoldthwait was doing his director's cut...so Tim Kazurinsky JUST, LIKE, APPEARED. #AcademyMagic|publisher=Twitter|first=Dan|last=Harmon|date=February 9, 2015|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref> On February 13, 2015, TV insider reported Guttenberg would play a Hollywood producer friend to Frankie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/507/steve-guttenberg-explains-the-police-academy-reunion-on-the-community-set/ |title=There Was a Police Academy Reunion on the Community Set, and Steve Guttenberg Explains Why|publisher=TV Insider|first=Michael|last=Schneider|date=February 13, 2015|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> On April 7, 2015, the episode's title was first revealed during an interview with Yahoo's Robert Chan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/community-postmortem-dan-harmon-warning-this-115703453790.html |title='Community' Postmortem: Dan Harmon Talks 'Laws of Robotics and Party Rights'|publisher=Yahoo|first=Robert|last=Chan|date=April 7, 2015|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nDen of Geek says, \"This is the closest we\u2019ve yet come to an homage-style episode this season and it\u2019s good, fresh ground for Community to cover.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/community/245821/community-intro-to-recycled-cinema-review |title=Community: Intro to Recycled Cinema Review |publisher=Den of Geek |first=Joe |last=Matar |date=April 28, 2015 |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref> Hypable says, \"After a relatively slow start, Community has really hit its stride mid-season with two stellar back-to-back episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypable.com/community-6x08-recap/ |title=\u2018Community\u2019 season 6, episode 8 recap: Haaaaaaaaam, girl! |publisher=Hypable |first=Alec |last=Bojalad |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref> Flavorwire says, \"the 3AM release time doesn\u2019t help,\" and suggests that perhaps the show would be better served releasing the episodes at a time of day when social media would have a bigger impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/516412/community-powers-on-even-if-were-no-longer-talking-about-it |title=Don\u2019t Let Fans\u2019 Silence Fool You \u2014 \u2018Community\u2019 Remains as Great as Ever in Season 6 |publisher=Flavorwire |first=Pilot |last=Viruet |date=April 28, 2015 |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref> IGN liked the premise of the episode, \"The idea of Chang becoming a (very brief) star was amusing in and of itself, but it was how the Greendale gang reacted that really set the story in motion.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/28/community-intro-to-recycled-cinema-review |title=Community: \"Intro to Recycled Cinema\" Review |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=April 28, 2015 |accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150524193959/https://screen.yahoo.com/community/community-episode-8-intro-recycled-070001874.html \"Intro to Recycled Cinema\"] at [[Yahoo!
