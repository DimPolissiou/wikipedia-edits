It is about an 11-year-old girl and her best friend Tico, a female [[orca]].\n\nUnlike the other series in Nippon Animation's ''[[World Masterpiece Theater]]'' line, ''Tico of the Seven Seas'' is an entirely original story. An English dub of the series, entitled ''Tico & Friends'', was produced by [[Ocean Productions|Ocean Studios]]. The dubbed series makes two significant alterations to the original Japanese series; the secondary protagonist Tico and the main antagonist Adrienne Bennex, survive while their original counterparts die. Some violent, bloody and death scenes are also edited out.\n\n==Plot==\nNanami Simpson is a young Japanese-American girl. Having lost her mother when was young, she now to lives with her marine biologist father, Scott Simpson, on board his research vessel, the ''Peperonchino''. Scott has been in search of a creature known as the Luminous Whale, a whale that can glow brightly underwater, for many years and is determined to eventually see it and preserve it's exsistence. Nanami also is close friends with an orca named Tico, who was rescued as a baby just before Nanami was born. The two have an unbreakable bond and swim with each other every day. As a result, Nanami gradually learns to hold her breath longer and swim deeper than other humans can. \n\nScott's search from the Luminous Whale soon puts him at odds with the Gaiatron Corporation, a greedy research conglomerate led by the ruthless and ambitious Adrienne Benex, who wishes to exploit the creature for a rare element it seemingly carries in its body. Aiding Benex are her right-hand man, Gaulois, and Dr. Charles LeConte, an old acquaintance of Scott's who is obsessed with the Luminous Whale.\n\nTogether, Nanami, Scott, and Tico, along with Scott's first-mate and right-hand man, Al Andretti, look to locate the Luminous Whale before Benex and Gaiatron can. As their journey goes on, they are joined by new crew members:\n* Cheryl Melville, an English-American heiress looking for adventure.\n* James McIntyre, Cheryl's loyal butler.\n* Thomas LeConte, Dr. LeConte's introverted and lonely, but intelligent son, who wishes to prove himself capable in the real world.\n* Junior, Tico's calf, born nearly halfway through the series.\n\nAs the journey goes on, the crew of ''Peperonchino'' encounter and make both new friends and enemies as they race against the corrupt Benex and Gaiatron to find the Luminous Whale first.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n; Nanami Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Megumi Hayashibara]]; [[Chantal Strand]] in the English dub\n: Nanami is the main protagonist in the series. At 11-years old, she claims all from the sea are her friends. She has been friends with Tico ever since she was a baby, and has a close relationship with her father Scott, and friendships with all of their crew members throughout the series.\n\n; Tico\n: A [[killer whale]] who is a life-long friend to Nanami. In the Japanese version, she dies freeing Al's submersible from an iceberg crevice, which mortally injures her, and her body sinks to the depths of the sea, while Nanami looks on helplessly. In the last episode, \"The Shining Circle\" her spirit reunites with Nanami and her son via the Luminous Whale. In the English dub, she is still injured, but survives and the crew is forced to leave her behind to let her recover. She returns a few episodes later, shortly after her son Junior leaves the crew to join a super-pod of killer whales. In the final episode, the spirit that Tico reunites with turns out to be her own long-lost mother.\n\n; Junior\n: Junior is Tico's calf. In the Japanese original series, he takes Tico's place as Nanami's companion, along with her name, after the former sacrifices herself to save Al. He meets his mother again the series finale, \"The Shining Circle\". In the English dub, his mother survives, and is left behind to recover, returning not long after he leaves to join a super-pod of killer whales.\n\n; Scott Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Shuuichi Ikeda]]; [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in the English dub\n: Nanami's father, who is a marine biologist, and captain of the ''Peperoncino''. He has been searching for the Luminous Whale for seven years. He is a dedicated father to his daughter and is often the level-headed one for his crew. Scott is also very protective of his research of the Luminous Whale, refusing to let it or the creature itself fall into the wrong hands.\n\n; Alfonso \"Al\" Andretti\n: A fat Italian man who works with Scott, and always on the lookout for treasure. He is the chef and engineer of ''Peperoncino'' and often comes up with get-rich quick schemes in order to make the crew money. He serves as something of an uncle and mentor to Nanami and later to Thomas as well. A scene where he punches Professor LeConte in the stomach is removed.\n\n; Cheryl Christina Melville\n: Voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the English dub.\n: An English-American woman who comes from a wealthy family and craves adventure.

It is about an 11-year-old girl and her best friend Tico, a female [[orca]].\n\nUnlike the other series in Nippon Animation's ''[[World Masterpiece Theater]]'' line, ''Tico of the Seven Seas'' is an entirely original story. An English dub of the series, entitled ''Tico & Friends'', was produced by [[Ocean Productions|Ocean Studios]]. The dubbed series makes two significant alterations to the original Japanese series; the secondary protagonist Tico and the main antagonist Adrienne Bennex, survive while their original counterparts die. Some violent, bloody and death scenes are also edited out.\n\n==Plot==\nNanami Simpson is a young Japanese-American girl. Having lost her mother when was young, she now to lives with her marine biologist father, Scott Simpson, on board his research vessel, the ''Peperonchino''. Scott has been in search of a creature known as the Luminous Whale, a whale that can glow brightly underwater, for many years and is determined to eventually see it and preserve it's exsistence. Nanami also is close friends an orca named Tico, who was rescued as a baby just before Nanami was born. The two have an unbreakable bond and swim with each other every day. As a result, Nanami gradually learns to hold her breath longer and swim deeper than other humans can. \n\nScott's search from the Luminous Whale soon puts him at odds with the Gaiatron Corporation, an greedy research conglomerate led by the ruthless and ambitious Adrienne Benex, who wishes to exploit the creature for a rare element it seemingly carries in its body. Aiding Benex are her right-hand man, Gaulois, and Dr. Charles LeConte, an old acquaintance of Scott's who is obsessed with the Luminous Whale.\n\nTogether, Nanami, Scott, and Tico, along with Scott's first-mate and right-hand man, Al Andretti, look to locate the Luminous Whale before Benex and Gaiatron can. As their journey goes on, they are joined by new crew members:\n* Cheryl Melville, an English-American heiress looking for adventure.\n* James McIntyre, Cheryl's loyal butler.\n* Thomas LeConte, Dr. LeConte's introverted and lonely, but intelligent son, who wishes to prove himself capable in the real world.\n* Junior, Tico's calf, born nearly halfway through the series.\n\nAs the journey goes on, the crew of ''Peperonchino'' encounter and make both new friends and enemies as they race against the corrupt Benex and Gaiatron to find the Luminous Whale first.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n; Nanami Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Megumi Hayashibara]]; [[Chantal Strand]] in the English dub\n: Nanami is the main protagonist in the series. At 11-years old, she claims all from the sea are her friends. She has been friends with Tico ever since she was a baby, and has a close relationship with her father Scott, and friendships with all of their crew members throughout the series.\n\n; Tico\n: A [[killer whale]] who is a life-long friend to Nanami. In the Japanese version, she dies freeing Al's submersible from an iceberg crevice, which mortally injures her, and her body sinks to the depths of the sea, while Nanami looks on helplessly. In the last episode, \"The Shining Circle\" her spirit reunites with Nanami and her son via the Luminous Whale. In the English dub, she is still injured, but survives and the crew is forced to leave her behind to let her recover. She returns a few episodes later, shortly after her son Junior leaves the crew to join a super-pod of killer whales. In the final episode, the spirit that Tico reunites with turns out to be her own long-lost mother.\n\n; Junior\n: Junior is Tico's calf. In the Japanese original series, he takes Tico's place as Nanami's companion, along with her name, after the former sacrifices herself to save Al. He meets his mother again the series finale, \"The Shining Circle\". In the English dub, his mother survives, and is left behind to recover, returning not long after he leaves to join a super-pod of killer whales.\n\n; Scott Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Shuuichi Ikeda]]; [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in the English dub\n: Nanami's father, who is a marine biologist, and captain of the ''Peperoncino''. He has been searching for the Luminous Whale for seven years. He is a dedicated father to his daughter and is often the level-headed one for his crew. Scott is also very protective of his research of the Luminous Whale, refusing to let it or the creature itself fall into the wrong hands.\n\n; Alfonso \"Al\" Andretti\n: A fat Italian man who works with Scott, and always on the lookout for treasure. He is the chef and engineer of ''Peperoncino'' and often comes up with get-rich quick schemes in order to make the crew money. He serves as something of an uncle and mentor to Nanami and later to Thomas as well. A scene where he punches Professor LeConte in the stomach is removed.\n\n; Cheryl Christina Melville\n: Voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the English dub.\n: An English-American woman who comes from a wealthy family and craves adventure. She initially has a frosty relationship with the crew, particularly Nanami and Al (due to her joining the crew on a whim, and her initial reluctance to due any actual work), but they all soon warm up to her, and she ends up becoming a valued member and even something of a big sister to Nanami and Thomas.

It was originally part of [[Maribo Abbey]] which was founded in the early 15th century. The [[chancel]], the oldest section of the cathedral, probably dates from 1416. The plan of the church is unusual in that the [[chancel]] is at the west end of the building rather than the east as a result of the design instructions left by [[Bridget of Sweden|Saint Bridget]].<ref name=natmus>[http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_0029-0088.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud K\u00f8bke Knudsen, \"Maribo Domkirke\"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 29-88. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 13 August 2013.</ref>\n\n==History==\nMaribo church was originally dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] and to [[Bridget of Sweden|Saint Bridget of Vadstena]]  (1303\u20131373) founder of the [[Bridgettines|Bridgettine]] order of nuns and monks. The church was built in the village of [[Skimminge]] (later renamed Maribo) in the early 15th century. It was [[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margrethe I]] who provided land for a monastery to be built there, encouraged by her childhood tutor, [[M\u00e4rta Ulfsdotter|M\u00e4rta]] (1319-1371), who was St. Bridget's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://birgitta.vadstena.se/|title= Sancta Birgitta|publisher =  Municipality of Vadstena, Sweden \n|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0213.html|title=Hjorthufvud, M\u00e4rtha, dotter af Sta Brigitta  |publisher = \tAnteckningar om svenska qvinnor  \n|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1418, in connection with recognition of the monastery, the pope decreed that the town should be renamed the community of Mary (''Habitaculum Mariae'')  leading to the adoption of Danish Marienbo, later Maribo.<ref>Frederik Raben-Levetzau: \"Lolland Falster M\u00f8n\", Copenhagen, Gyldendalske Boghandel, Nordisk Forlag A.S., 1988. {{ISBN|87-00-80946-2}}, page 128-.</ref> A note from the journal of [[Vadstena Abbey]], the mother church, states that monks left to found a monastery in Skimminge in 1416. After the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]] in 1536, the monastery continued to exist but in 1556 was converted into a Protestant [[convent]] for young ladies. When the town's main church burnt down in 1596, the convent church became the parish church of Maribo. After the convent was finally demolished in 1621, ownership of the church was transferred to the town. From 1803, with the establishment of the Lolland-Falster diocese, the church was usually referred to as a cathedral but it was only in 1924 that it officially received the status of cathedral (''domkirke'').<ref name=natmus/><ref name=md>[http://www.maribodomkirke.dk/index.php/historie \"Historie\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630174448/http://www.maribodomkirke.dk/index.php/historie |date=2013-06-30 }}, Maribo Domkirke. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 13 August 2013.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe Gothic cathedral is built of red brick as a [[hall church]] with a [[nave]] flanked by equally high aisles with a common roof. In accordance with St. Bridget's instructions, to the west (rather than the east), there is a lower and narrower chancel. Completed in 1446, the four west bays of the nave (which has a total length of {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}}) are built of the same bricks as the chancel but the four east bays, completed around 1470, were apparently built by another mason.

The church was built in the village of [[Skimminge]] (later renamed Maribo) in the early 15th century. It was [[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margrethe I]] who provided land for a monastery to be built there, encouraged by her childhood tutor, [[M\u00e4rta Ulfsdotter|M\u00e4rta]] (1319-1371), who was St. Bridget's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://birgitta.vadstena.se/|title= Sancta Birgitta|publisher =  Municipality of Vadstena, Sweden \n|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0213.html|title=Hjorthufvud, M\u00e4rtha, dotter af Sta Brigitta  |publisher = \tAnteckningar om svenska qvinnor  \n|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1418, in connection with recognition of the monastery, the pope decreed that the town should be renamed the community of Mary (''Habitaculum Mariae'')  leading to the adoption of Danish Marienbo, later Maribo.<ref>Frederik Raben-Levetzau: \"Lolland Falster M\u00f8n\", Copenhagen, Gyldendalske Boghandel, Nordisk Forlag A.S., 1988. {{ISBN|87-00-80946-2}}, page 128-.</ref> A note from the journal of [[Vadstena Abbey]], the mother church, states that monks left to found a monastery in Skimminge in 1416. After the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]] in 1536, the monastery continued to exist but in 1556 was converted into a Protestant [[convent]] for young ladies. When the town's main church burnt down in 1596, the convent church became the parish church of Maribo. After the convent was finally demolished in 1621, ownership of the church was transferred to the town. From 1803, with the establishment of the Lolland-Falster diocese, the church was usually referred to as a cathedral but it was only in 1924 that it officially received the status of cathedral (''domkirke'').<ref name=natmus/><ref name=md>[http://www.maribodomkirke.dk/index.php/historie \"Historie\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630174448/http://www.maribodomkirke.dk/index.php/historie |date=2013-06-30 }}, Maribo Domkirke. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 13 August 2013.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe Gothic cathedral is built of red brick as a [[hall church]] with a [[nave]] flanked by equally high aisles with a common roof.

Completed in 1446, the four west bays of the nave (which has a total length of {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}}) are built of the same bricks as the chancel but the four east bays, completed around 1470, were apparently built by another mason.

Early in the autoimmune event, the axon pruning is activated in islet sympathetic nerves. Increased [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]] and [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] that result from [[insulitis]] and beta cell death stimulate the [[Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor|p75 neurotrophin receptor]] (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), which acts to prune off axons. Axons are normally protected from pruning by activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (Trk A) receptors by [[Nerve growth factor|NGF]], which in islets is primarily produced by beta cells. Progressive autoimmune beta cell destruction therefore causes both the activation of pruning factors and the loss of protective factors to the islet sympathetic nerves.

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\"&nbsp;''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|alt=Map of northeast and southeastern Thailand showing the distribution of Cretaceous geological strata | Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\"&nbsp;''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|alt=Map of northeast and southeastern Thailand showing the distribution of Cretaceous geological strata | Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is among the larger teeth discovered by Buffetaut and Ingavat, one much smaller specimen (DMR TF 2043b) measures {{Convert|24.3|mm||abbr=on}} in length. According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#carinae|carinae]] (cutting edges) of ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth lack well-defined serrations.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

However, under the \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine, new copyright claims could be made over mechanical reproductions of the etching, due to the skill and labor involved in the reproduction.]]\n\n'''Sweat of the brow''' is an [[intellectual property]] [[Legal doctrine|law doctrine]], chiefly related to [[copyright]] law. According to this doctrine, an [[author]] gains rights through  simple diligence during the creation of a work, such as a database, or a directory. Substantial creativity or \"originality\" is not required.\n\nUnder a \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine, the creator of a work, even if it is completely unoriginal, is entitled to have that effort and expense protected; no one else may use such a work without permission, but must instead recreate the work by independent research or effort. The classic example is a [[telephone directory]]. In a \"sweat of the brow\" jurisdiction, such a directory may not be copied, but instead a competitor must independently collect the information to issue a competing directory.

And it has 7 Sub-Parishes.\n\n= History =\nHistory states that in 1979 there were 14 Catholic families in [[Pragasapuram]]. Initially Pragasapuram was the Sub-Parish of the Sathankulam Parish. In 15-08-1880, Our Lady of Assumption Chapel was opened by Fr.Denish Kushan. The first Car Procession of Our Lady of Assumption was held on 15-08-1895. At that time there was 3 Chapparam. Devotees carry it on their shoulders. In 1907, [[Arthur Margoschis]] (Father of Nazareth) presented the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ that he kept in his Prayer hall,\u00a0 to the Our Lady of Assumption Church, Pragasapuram. \n\nIn 1909, Pragasapuram became an independent Parish. Sub-Parishes separated from the [[Sathankulam]] and [[Punnaikayal]] Parishes were merged with the Pragasapuram Parish. The foundation stone for New Church was laid in 1913 by Fr.T.Michael. After the completion of the New Church foundation work, the Church building work was stopped. Thus the Holy Mass was conducted in the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. Many years later the New Church was built and the New Church was opened by Bishop.Rev.Fr.Thomas on 21-11-1967.As the days went by, In 1975 during Fr.Cruz Mariyan period, Chapparam was replaced by Chariot. In the feasts that followed, the devotees\u00a0 celebrated the Annual Feast of Our Lady of Assumption by pulling the St.Mary's Chariot.\n\nSt. Mary's Kebi was built on 11-08-1980 at the site of the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel to commemorate the Century year (1880- 1980) of Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. The new Church altar was refurbished and the floors replaced with marbles when Fr.Jackson was a Parish Priest. In the 25th year of the construction of the St.Mary's Century Kebi, it was restored and renovated by Fr.A.S.Raja on 14-08-2007\n\n= Sub Parishes =\n\n1.

And it has 7 Sub-Parishes.\n\n= History =\nHistory states that in 1979 there were 14 Catholic families in [[Pragasapuram]]. Initially Pragasapuram was the Sub-Parish of the Sathankulam Parish. In 15-08-1880, Our Lady of Assumption Chapel was opened by Fr.Denish Kushan. The first Car Procession of Our Lady of Assumption was held on 15-08-1895. At that time there was 3 Chapparam. Devotees carry it on their shoulders. In 1907, [[Arthur Margoschis]] (Father of Nazareth) presented the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ that he kept in his Prayer hall,\u00a0 to the Our Lady of Assumption Church, Pragasapuram. \n\nIn 1909, Pragasapuram became an independent Parish. Sub-Parishes separated from the [[Sathankulam]] and [[Punnaikayal]] Parishes were merged with the Pragasapuram Parish. The foundation stone for New Church was laid in 1913 by Fr.T.Michael. After the completion of the New Church foundation work, the Church building work was stopped. Thus the Holy Mass was conducted in the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. Many years later the New Church was built and the New Church was opened by Bishop.Rev.Fr.Thomas on 21-11-1967.As the days went by, In 1975 during Fr.Cruz Mariyan period, Chapparam was replaced by Chariot. In the feasts that followed, the devotees\u00a0 celebrated the Annual Feast of Our Lady of Assumption by pulling the St.Mary's Chariot.\n\nSt. Mary's Kebi was built on 11-08-1980 at the site of the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel to commemorate the Century year (1880- 1980) of Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. The new Church altar was refurbished and the floors replaced with marbles when Fr.Jackson was a Parish Priest.
