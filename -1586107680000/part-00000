Its screenplay, by [[James Ivory]], who also co-produced, is based on the [[Call Me by Your Name (novel)|2007 novel of the same name]] by [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]]. The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[A Bigger Splash (2015 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of [[1983]]. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver commands Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;

Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of [[1983]]. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver commands Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;

At the end of the war, Maverick returned to San Antonio, where he earned a [[law degree]] at [[St. Mary's University, Texas|St. Mary's University]] in 1949.\n\nThe next year, Maverick was elected to the [[Texas Legislature|Texas House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. A committed [[American liberalism|liberal]], he became well known during his term in office as a supporter of [[trade union|organized labor]] and [[civil rights]] for [[African American]]s and an opponent of the persecution of suspected [[communism|communists]] during the [[Red Scare]]. In one incident, he killed a bill to sentence convicted communists to the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] by inserting a [[Wrecking amendment|poison pill amendment]] to sentence those who were only suspected of communism to [[life imprisonment]]. In 1956, he chose not to run for a fourth term.\n\nIn 1961, Maverick made his last run for elective office, campaigning (along with seventy other Democrats) in a [[by-election|special election]] for the [[United States Senate]] seat vacated by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. With the support of the Texas [[AFL-CIO]], he ran fourth out of the five major Democratic candidates, with 10 percent of the vote, behind appointee Senator [[William Blakley]] (18 percent), future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Jim Wright]] (16 percent), and [[State Attorney General]] [[Will Wilson]] (11.5 percent), but ahead of State Senator [[Henry B. Gonzalez]] (9 percent). Having split the liberal vote, thus allowing the [[American conservatism|conservative]] Blakley to make the [[two round system|runoff]] against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John Tower]] (who received 31 percent in the initial round and was narrowly elected in the runoff), Maverick and Gonzalez, a friend and fellow San Antonian, stopped speaking to one another for almost the next twenty years.\n\nAfter leaving the House, Maverick became an attorney for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], representing civil rights protestors, [[atheism|atheists]], communists, and, during the [[Vietnam War]], [[conscientious objector]]s and draft protestors. In 1964, in ''[[Stanford v. Texas]]'', he represented [[John W. Stanford Jr.]], a [[bookstore]] owner and [[Communist Party USA]] member convicted of [[sedition]] for selling books authored by [[Karl Marx]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Pope John XXIII]], and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Hugo Black]]. The case was eventually heard before the Supreme Court (including Black) and became a landmark [[freedom of speech|free speech]] case. Another notable Maverick client was world-famous atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]].\n\nAfter marrying [[painting|painter]] [[Julia Orynski]] in 1966, Maverick began to ease himself away from the active practice of law and began to support himself by writing [[editorial]]s for various [[newspaper]]s. In 1980, he gave up law completely and began writing a regular Sunday [[column (newspaper)|column]] for the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''. He continued writing the column for the next twenty-three years. He focused on a variety of subjects, most of which generated considerable controversy, such as his advocacy for the [[Palestinian people]] in the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] and his tribute to [[Montana]] Congresswoman [[Jeannette Rankin]], the only member of Congress to vote against entry into both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. His friend and occasional column subject, former state senator [[A.R. Schwartz]], called him  \"one of the last of the red-hot liberals.\" In 1991, the [[American Bar Association]] awarded him the [[John Minor Wisdom]] Public Interest and Professional Award for his handling of more than 300 ''[[pro bono]]'' legal clients during his career. Wisdom was a [[Rockefeller Republican|liberal Republican]] from [[New Orleans]] who was appointed to the federal bench by [[U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In 1997, a selection of some of his more than one thousand columns was publishing in the title ''Texas Iconoclast''.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nIn mid-January 2003, Maverick filed his last column, which condemned the imminent [[Iraq War]] as \"unjust,\" and entered a local hospital to be treated for [[kidney]] disease. He died there on January 28, at the age of 82. A [[public library]] in his hometown of San Antonio is named for him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portalbar|Biography|Texas|Law|Politics|Liberalism|Journalism}}\n\n*[http://texana.texascooking.com/news/maurymaverickobituary.htm \"Maury Maverick, Jr., Prominent San Antonio Liberal Voice Dies At 82\" by Adolfo Alvarez]\n*[https://archive.is/20050217120058/http://www.unknownnews.net/MauryMaverickJr.html \"Maury Maverick Jr., champion of the unpopular\" by Michael T.

At the end of the war, Maverick returned to San Antonio, where he earned a [[law degree]] at [[St. Mary's University, Texas|St. Mary's University]] in 1949.\n\nThe next year, Maverick was elected to the [[Texas Legislature|Texas House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. A committed [[American liberalism|liberal]], he became well known during his term in office as a supporter of [[trade union|organized labor]] and [[civil rights]] for [[African American]]s and an opponent of the persecution of suspected [[communism|communists]] during the [[Red Scare]].

''H. erectus'' are associated with the [[Acheulean]] stone tool [[industry (archaeology)|industry]], and are thought to be the earliest human ancestor capable of starting fires, speech, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, and possibly art-making.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Naming===\n{{see|Trinil 2}}\n[[File:Pithecanthropus erectus-PeterMaas Naturalis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Java Man]]]]\nThe first remains, [[Java Man]], were described by Dutch anatomist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] in 1893, who set out to look for the \"[[missing link (human evolution)|missing link]]\" between apes and humans in Southeast Asia, because he believed [[gibbon]]s to be the closest living relatives to humans in accordance with the \"[[Out of Asia]]\" hypothesis. ''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright. However, few scientists recognized it as a \"missing link\", and, consequently, Dubois' discovery had been largely disregarded.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Homo erectus adult female - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Forensic reconstruction of an adult female ''Homo erectus''.<ref>Reconstruction by [[John Gurche]] (2010), [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]], based on [[KNM ER 3733]] and [[KNM ER 992|992]].\nAbigail Tucker, \"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html?c=y&page=2&navigation=next#IMAGES A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces]\", Smithsonian.com, 25 February 2010.</ref>]]\nIn 1921, two teeth from [[Zhoukoudian]], China discovered by [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]] had prompted widely publicized interest.<ref name=\"doorKnock1\">{{cite news |title=The First Knock at the Door |publisher=Peking Man Site Museum |quote=In the summer of 1921, Dr. J.G.

Nearly all of the original specimens were lost during [[World War II]] during an attempt to smuggle them out of China for safekeeping. However, casts were made by Weidenreich, which exist at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]] and at the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]] in [[Beijing]].\n\nSimilarities between Java Man and Peking Man led [[Ernst Mayr]] to rename both as ''Homo erectus'' in 1950. Throughout much of the 20th century, anthropologists debated the role of ''H. erectus'' in [[human evolution]]. Early in the century, due in part to the discoveries at Java and Zhoukoudian, the belief that modern humans first evolved in Asia was widely accepted. A few naturalists\u2014[[Charles Darwin]] the most prominent among them\u2014theorized that humans' earliest ancestors were African.

In 1999, British anthropologist [[Richard Wrangham]] proposed the \"cooking hypothesis\" which states that ''H. erectus'' speciated from their predecessor ''H. habilis'' because of fire usage and cooking 2 mya to explain the rapid doubling of brain size between these two species in only a 500,000 year timespan and the sudden appearance of the typical human body plan. Cooking would have been especially helpful in digestion of calorie-rich tubers which were common in their savanna environment, allowing group size to expand, causing selective pressure for sociality, requiring greater brain function. Artificial lighting also allowed for increased waking hours\u2014modern humans have about a 16 hour waking period, whereas other apes are generally awake from only sunup to sundown\u2014and these additional hours were probably used for socializing. Because of this, fire usage is probably also linked to the [[origin of language]].<ref name=Gowlett2016/><ref name=Gowlett2013/> Artificial lighting may have also made sleeping on the ground instead of the trees possible by keeping terrestrial predators at bay.<ref name=Gowlett2013/>\n\nMigration into the frigid climate of Ice Age Europe may have only been possible because of fire, but evidence of fire usage in Europe from 1 million to about 400\u2013300,000 years ago is notably absent.<ref name=Roebroeks2011/> If these early European ''H. erectus'' did not have fire, it is largely unclear how they stayed warm, avoided predators, and prepared animal fat and meat for consumption; and lightning is less common farther north equating to a reduced availability of naturally occurring fires. It is possible that they only knew how to maintain fires in certain settings in the landscapes and prepared food some distance away from home, meaning evidence of fire and evidence of hominin activity are spaced far apart.<ref name=Gowlett2013>{{cite journal|first=J.

''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright.

In 1999, British anthropologist [[Richard Wrangham]] proposed the \"cooking hypothesis\" which states that ''H. erectus'' speciated from their predecessor ''H. habilis'' because of fire usage and cooking 2 mya to explain the rapid doubling of brain size between these two species in only a 500,000 year timespan and the sudden appearance of the typical human body plan. Cooking would have been especially helpful in digestion of calorie-rich tubers which were common in their savanna environment, allowing group size to expand, causing selective pressure for sociality, requiring greater brain function. Artificial lighting also allowed for increased waking hours\u2014modern humans have about a 16 hour waking period, whereas other apes are generally awake from only sunup to sundown\u2014and these additional hours were probably used for socializing. Because of this, fire usage is probably also linked to the [[origin of language]].<ref name=Gowlett2016/><ref name=Gowlett2013/> Artificial lighting may have also made sleeping on the ground instead of the trees possible by keeping terrestrial predators at bay.<ref name=Gowlett2013/>\n\nMigration into the frigid climate of Ice Age Europe may have only been possible because of fire, but evidence of fire usage in Europe from 1 million to about 400\u2013300,000 years ago is notably absent.<ref name=Roebroeks2011/> If these early European ''H. erectus'' did not have fire, it is largely unclear how they stayed warm, avoided predators, and prepared animal fat and meat for consumption; and lightning is less common farther north equating to a reduced availability of naturally occurring fires. It is possible that they only knew how to maintain fires in certain settings in the landscapes and prepared food some distance away from home, meaning evidence of fire and evidence of hominin activity are spaced far apart.<ref name=Gowlett2013>{{cite journal|first=J.
