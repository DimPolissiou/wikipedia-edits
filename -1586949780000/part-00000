By early 1896, Spanish intelligence was aware of the existence of a seditious secret society, and suspects were kept under surveillance and arrests were made. On 3 May, Bonifacio held a general assembly of ''Katipunan'' leaders in [[Pasig]], where they debated when to start the revolution. While some officers, especially Bonifacio, believed a revolution was inevitable, some members, especially [[Santiago Alvarez (general)|Santiago Alvarez]] and [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] both of [[Cavite]], expressed reservations and disagreement regarding the planned revolt due to lack of firearms. The consensus was to consult [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] in [[Dapitan]] before launching armed action, so Bonifacio sent P\u00edo Valenzuela to Rizal. Rizal turned out to be against the revolution, believing it to be premature. He recommended more preparation, but suggested that, in the event the revolution did break out, they should seek the leadership of [[Antonio Luna]], who was widely regarded as a brilliant military leader.<ref name=\"guerreropp160-164\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=160\u2013164}}.</ref>\n\n==Philippine Revolution==\n{{main|Philippine Revolution}}\n\n===Start of the uprising===\nThe Spanish authorities confirmed the existence of the ''Katipunan'' on August 19, 1896.

Bonifacio appointed generals to lead rebel forces to Manila. Other ''Katipunan'' councils were also informed of their plans. Before hostilities erupted, Bonifacio reorganized the ''Katipunan'' into an open ''de facto'' revolutionary government and they named the nation and its government ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan]]'' (loosely translates to Tagalog Republic), with him as President and commander-in-chief (or generalissimo<ref name=\"alvarez\"/>) of the rebel army and the Supreme Council as his cabinet.<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/><ref name=\"guerreropp166-167\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=166\u2013167}}.</ref><ref name=agoncillo1996pp152-153>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1996|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref> On August 28, Bonifacio issued the following general proclamation:\n\n<blockquote>This manifesto is for all of you.

The defending Spaniards, outnumbered, fought a delaying battle until reinforcements arrived. Once reinforced, the Spaniards drove Bonifacio's forces back with heavy casualties. Bonifacio and his troops regrouped near [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]].<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\"/> Elsewhere, fighting between rebels and Spanish forces occurred in [[Mandaluyong]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]], [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]], [[Pandacan, Manila|Pandacan]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Marikina]], [[Caloocan]],<ref name=\"salazar\">{{Harvnb|Salazar|1994}}.</ref> [[Makati]] and [[Taguig]].<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\">{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=173}}</ref> The conventional view among Filipino historians is that the planned general ''Katipunan'' offensive on Manila was aborted in favor of Bonifacio's attack on [[San Juan del Monte, Philippines|San Juan del Monte]],<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\"/><ref name=\"zaide\">{{Harvnb|Zaide|1984}}.</ref> which sparked a general state of rebellion in the area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Salazar|1994|p=104}}.</ref> However, more recent studies have advanced the view that the planned offensive did push through and the rebel attacks were integrated; according to this view, Bonifacio's San Juan del Monte battle was only a part of a bigger whole \u2013 an unrecognized \"Battle for Manila\".<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"guerrerop173\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|p=173}}.</ref> Despite his reverses, Bonifacio was not completely defeated and was still considered a threat. Further, the revolt had spread to the surrounding provinces by the end of August.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"guerrerop173\"/>\n\n===Campaigns around Manila===\nBy December 1896, the Spanish government recognized three major centers of rebellion: [[Cavite]] (under [[Mariano Alvarez]], [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and others), [[Bulacan]] (under [[Mariano Llanera]]) and [[Rizal|Morong]] (under Bonifacio). The revolt was most successful in [[Cavite]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=179}}</ref> which mostly fell under rebel control by September\u2013October 1896.<ref name=\"guerreropp175-176\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=175\u2013176}}.</ref>\n\nWhile Cavite is traditionally regarded as the \"Heartland of the Philippine Revolution\", Manila and its surrounding municipalities bore the brunt of the Spanish military campaign, becoming a [[no man's land]]. Rebels in the area were generally engaged in [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] [[guerrilla warfare]] against Spanish positions in Manila, [[Morong, Rizal|Morong,]] [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Pampanga]].<ref name=\"guerreropp175-176\"/> From Morong, Bonifacio served as [[military tactics|tactician]] for rebel guerrillas and issued commands to areas other than his personal sector,<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/> though his reputation suffered when he lost battles he personally led.<ref name=\"constantinop180\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=180}}</ref>\n\nFrom September to October 1896, Bonifacio supervised the establishment of ''Katipunan'' mountain and hill bases like [[Marikina|Balara]] in Marikina, Pantayanin in [[Antipolo]], [[Ugong, Pasig|Ugong]] in Pasig and Tungko in [[Bulacan]]. Bonifacio appointing generals for these areas, or approving selections the troops themselves made.<ref name=\"alvarez\"/>\n\nOn November 7, 1896, Bonifacio led an assault on [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], [[Marikina]] and [[Montalb\u00e1n, Teruel|Montalban]]. The Spanish were forced to retreat, leaving these areas to the rebels, except for the municipal hall of San Mateo where some Spanish troops had barricaded. While Bonifacio's troops laid siege to the hall, other ''Katipunan'' forces set up defensive lines along the nearby Langka (or [[San Mateo, Rizal|Nangka]]) river against Spanish reinforcements coming from the direction of Marikina. After three days, Spanish counterattacks broke through the Nangka river lines. The Spanish troops thus recaptured the rebel positions and surprised Bonifacio in San Mateo, who ordered a general retreat to Balara.<ref name=\"alvarez\"/> They were pursued, and Bonifacio was nearly killed shielding Emilio Jacinto from a Spanish bullet which grazed his collar.<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\"/>\n\nIn Balara, Bonifacio commissioned [[Julio Nakpil]] to compose a national anthem. Nakpil produced a hymn called ''[[Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan]]'' (\"Honorable Hymn of the Tagalogs\") and became the official national anthem during the entire period of the revolution until it was replaced years later by another national anthem commissioned by the new [[Republica Filipina]] government that replaced the ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan]]''.<ref name=\"Nakpil\">{{Harvnb|Nakpil|1964}}.</ref>\n\n===Bonifacio in Cavite===\nIn late 1896, Bonifacio, as the recognized overall leader of the revolution, was invited to [[Cavite]] province by rebel leaders to mediate between them and unify their efforts. There were two ''[[Katipunan]]'' provincial chapters in Cavite that became rival factions: the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'', headed by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]'s cousin [[Baldomero Aguinaldo]], and the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'', headed by [[Mariano \u00c1lvarez]], uncle of Bonifacio's wife. Leaders of both factions came from the upper class, in contrast to Bonifacio, who came from the lower middle class. After initial successes, Emilio Aguinaldo issued a manifesto in the name of the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' ruling council which proclaimed a provisional and revolutionary government \u2013 despite the existence of the ''Katipunan'' government. Emilio Aguinaldo in particular had won fame for victories in the province.<ref name=\"constantinop178-181\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=178\u2013181}}</ref> The ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' and ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'' clashed over authority and jurisdiction and did not help each other in battle. After multiple letters were sent to Bonifacio urging him to come, in December 1896 he traveled to Cavite accompanied by his wife, his brothers [[Procopio Bonifacio|Procopio]] and [[Ciriaco Bonifacio|Ciriaco]], and some troops, including [[Emilio Jacinto]], Bonifacio's secretary and right-hand man. Jacinto was said to be against Bonifacio's expedition to Cavite.\n\nUpon his arrival at Cavite, friction grew between Bonifacio and the ''Magdalo'' leaders. [[Apolinario Mabini]], who later served as Emilio Aguinaldo's adviser, writes that at this point the ''Magdalo'' leaders \"already paid little heed to his authority and orders.\"<ref name=\"mabini\">{{Harvnb|Mabini|1969|Ref=MabiniGuerrero1969ch8}}.</ref> Bonifacio was partial to the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'', perhaps due to his kinship ties with [[Mariano \u00c1lvarez]],<ref name=\"garcia-rodriguez\">{{Harvnb|Garcia|Rodriguez|2001}}.</ref> or more importantly, due to their stronger recognition of his authority.<ref name=\"cristobal\"/> When Aguinaldo and [[Edilberto Evangelista]] went to receive Bonifacio at [[Zapote]], they were irritated with what they regarded as his attitude of superiority. In his memoirs [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] wrote that Bonifacio acted \"as if he were a king\".<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/><ref name=\"constantinop181-182\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=181\u2013182}}</ref> Another time, Bonifacio ordered the arrest of one ''Katipunan'' general from [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] named Vicente Fernandez, who was accompanying the ''Magdalo'' leaders in paying their respect to Bonifacio, for failing to support his attack in Manila, but the other ''Magdalo'' leaders refused to surrender him. Townspeople in [[Noveleta]] (a ''Magdiwang'' town) acclaimed Bonifacio as the ruler of the Philippines, to the chagrin of the [[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|''Magdalo'' l]]<nowiki/>eaders, (Bonifacio replied: \"Long live Philippine liberty!\").<ref name=\"constantinop181-182\"/> Aguinaldo disputed with Bonifacio over strategic troop placements and blamed him for the capture of the town of [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]].<ref name=\"aguinaldo\">{{Harvnb|Aguinaldo|1964}}.</ref> The Spanish, through [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Superior Pio Pi, wrote to Aguinaldo about the possibility of peace negotiations.<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/> When Bonifacio found out, he and the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'' council rejected the proposed peace talks. Bonifacio was also angered that the Spanish considered Aguinaldo the \"chief of the rebellion\" instead of him.<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/> However, Aguinaldo continued to arrange negotiations which never took place.<ref name=\"guerrerop190\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|p=190}}.</ref> Bonifacio believed Aguinaldo was willing to surrender the revolution.<ref name=\"guerrerop190\"/>\n\nBonifacio was also subject to rumors that he had stolen ''Katipunan'' funds, his sister was the mistress of a [[Roman Catholic Church|priest]], and he was an ''[[agent provocateur]]'' paid by [[friars]] to foment unrest. Also circulated were anonymous letters which told the people of Cavite not to idolize Bonifacio because he was a Mason, a mere Manila employee, allegedly an atheist, and uneducated. According to these letters, Bonifacio did not deserve the title of ''Supremo'' since only God was supreme. This last allegation was made despite the fact that ''Supremo'' was meant to be used in conjunction with ''Presidente'', i.e. ''Presidente Supremo'' (Supreme President) to distinguish the president of the ''Katipunan'' Supreme Council from council presidents of subordinate ''Katipunan'' chapters like the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' and ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]''.<ref name=\"cristobal\"/> Bonifacio suspected the rumor-mongering to be the work of the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' leader [[Daniel Tirona]]. He confronted Tirona, whose airy reply provoked Bonifacio to such anger that he drew a gun and would have shot Tirona if others had not intervened.<ref name=\"constantinop182\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=182}}</ref><ref name=\"guerreropp187,190\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|p=187,190}}.</ref>\n\nOn December 31, Bonifacio and the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' and ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'' leaders held a meeting in [[Imus]], ostensibly to determine the leadership of Cavite in order to end the rivalry between the two factions. The issue of whether the Katipunan should be replaced by a revolutionary government was brought up by the ''Magdalo'', and this eclipsed the rivalry issue. The ''Magdalo'' argued that the ''Katipunan'', as a secret society, should have ceased to exist once the Revolution was underway. They also held that Cavite should not be divided. Bonifacio and the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'' contended that the ''Katipunan'' served as their revolutionary government since it had its own constitution, laws, and provincial and municipal governments. [[Edilberto Evangelista]] presented a draft constitution for the proposed government to Bonifacio but he rejected it as it was too similar to the Spanish [[Maura Law]]. Upon the event of restructuring, Bonifacio was given ''[[Full Powers|carte blanche]]'' to appoint a committee tasked with setting up a new government; he would also be in charge of this committee. He tasked [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] to record the minutes of the meeting and requested for it to establish this authority, but these were never done and never provided.<ref name=\"constantinop182-184\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=182\u2013184}}</ref><ref name=\"guerreropp187-191\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=187\u2013191}}.</ref>\n\n===Haring Bayang Katagalugan===\nInfluenced by [[Freemasonry]], the ''[[Katipunan]]'' had been organized with \"its own laws, bureaucratic structure and elective leadership\".<ref name = \"guererro1\">{{cite journal\n  | last1 = Guererro\n  | first1 = Milagros\n  | last2 = Encarnacion\n  | first2 = Emmanuel\n  | last3 = Villegas\n  | first3 = Ramon\n  | title = Andres Bonifacio and the 1896 Revolution\n  | journal = Sulyap Kultura\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 3\u201312\n  | publisher = National Commission for Culture and the Arts\n  | location = \n  | date = 1996\n  | url = http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?i=5&subcat=1}}</ref> For each province it involved, the Supreme Council coordinated provincial councils<!--(''Sangguniang Bayan'')--><ref name = \"guererro2\">{{cite book\n  | last = Guererro\n  | first = Milagros\n  | last2 = Schumacher, S.J.\n  | first2 = John\n  | title = Reform and Revolution\n  | publisher = Asia Publishing Company Limited\n  | volume = 5\n  | series = Kasaysayan: The History of the Filipino People\n  | year = 1998\n  | isbn = 962-258-228-1}}</ref> which were in charge of \"public administration and military affairs on the supra-municipal or quasi-provincial level\"<ref name=\"guererro1\" /> and local councils<!--(''Panguluhang Bayan'')-->,<ref name=\"guererro2\" /> in charge of affairs \"on the district or [[barrio]] level\".<ref name=\"guererro1\" /> In the last days of August, the ''Katipunan'' members met in Caloocan and decided to start their revolt<ref name=\"guererro1\" /> (the event was later called the \"[[Cry of Balintawak]]\" or \"Cry of [[Pugad Lawin]]\"; the exact location and date are disputed).

''Bayan'' may be rendered as \"nation\" or \"people\". Bonifacio is named as the president of the \"Tagalog Republic\" in an issue of the Spanish periodical ''[[La Ilustraci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola y Americana]]'' published in February 1897 (''\"Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio \u2013 Titulado \"Presidente\" de la Rep\u00fablica Tagala\"'').

Bonifacio was executed after he refused to recognize the new government. The Aguinaldo-headed [[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]] ({{lang-es|Rep\u00fablica Filipina|links=no}}), usually considered the \"First Philippine Republic\", was formally established in 1899, after a succession of revolutionary and dictatorial governments (e.g. the [[Tejeros Convention|Tejeros government]], the [[Republic of Biak-na-Bato|Biak-na-Bato Republic]]) also headed by Aguinaldo.\n\n===The Tejeros Convention===\n{{main|Tejeros Convention}}\nBonifacio even though fully aware of the Spanish assault in [[Battle of Perez Dasmari\u00f1as|Perez Dasmari\u00f1as]], offered no help to the ''Magdalo'' faction. On March 22, 1897, the revolutionary leaders held an important meeting in a Friar Estate Residence at [[Tejeros Convention|Tejeros]] to resume their discussions regarding the escalating tension between the ''Magdalo'' and ''Magdiwang'' forces; And also to settle once-and-for-all the issue of governance within the [[Katipunan]] through an election.<ref name=\"constantinop184\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=184}}</ref> Amidst implications on whether the government of the \"Katipunan\" should be established as a [[monarchy]] or as a [[republic]], Bonifacio maintained that it should be established as a republic.

Many of the principal men of Indang, among them Severino de las Alas, presented Emilio Aguinaldo with several complaints against Bonifacio that the Supremo's men stole carabaos (water buffalos) and other work animals by force and butchered them for food. On April 25, a party of Aguinaldo's men led by Colonel Agapito Bonz\u00f3n and Major Jos\u00e9 Ignacio \"Intsik\" Paua caught up with Bonifacio at his camp in barrio Limbon, Indang. The unsuspecting Bonifacio received them cordially. Early the next day, Bonz\u00f3n and Paua attacked Bonifacio's camp. Bonifacio was surprised and refused to fight against \"fellow [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]]\", ordering his men to hold their fire, but shots were nevertheless exchanged. Bonifacio was shot in the arm by Bonz\u00f3n, and Paua stabbed him in the neck but was prevented from striking further by one of Bonifacio's men, who offered to die in Bonifacio's place. Andr\u00e9s's brother [[Ciriaco Bonifacio|Ciriaco]] was shot dead, while his other brother Procopio was beaten, and his wife [[Gregoria de Jes\u00fas|Gregoria]] may have been raped by Bonz\u00f3n. From Indang, a half-starved and wounded Bonifacio was carried by hammock to [[Naic]], which had become President Aguinaldo's headquarters.<ref name=\"ocampo1999\">{{Harvnb|Ocampo|1999}}.</ref>\n\nBonifacio's party was brought to [[Naic, Cavite|Naic]] initially and then to Maragondon, Cavite, where he and Procopio stood trial on May 5, 1897, on charges of sedition and treason against Aguinaldo's government and conspiracy to murder Aguinaldo.<ref name=\"guerrerop194\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=180}}</ref> The jury was composed entirely of Aguinaldo's men and even Bonifacio's defence lawyer himself declared his client's guilt.

Aguinaldo commuted the sentence to deportation on May 8, 1897, but [[P\u00edo del Pilar]] and [[Mariano Noriel]] persuaded him to withdraw the order for the sake of preserving unity.

His death is alternately viewed as a justified execution for treason and a \"legal murder\" fueled by politics. Some historians consider him to be the rightful first [[President of the Philippines]] instead of Aguinaldo. Some historians have also opined that Bonifacio share or even take the place of Jos\u00e9 Rizal as the (foremost) [[Philippine national hero]]. The purported discovery of Bonifacio's remains has also been questioned.\n\n===Trial and execution===\nHistorians have condemned the trial of the Bonifacio brothers as unjust. The jury was entirely composed of Aguinaldo's men; Bonifacio's defense lawyer acted more like a prosecutor as he himself declared Bonifacio's guilt and instead appealed for less punishment; and Bonifacio was not allowed to confront the state witness for the charge of conspiracy on the grounds that the latter had been killed in battle, but later the witness was seen with the prosecutors.<ref name=\"constantinopp190-191\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref><ref name=\"villanuevapp60,64\">{{Harvnb|Villanueva|1989|pp=60,64}}.</ref>\n\n[[Teodoro Agoncillo]] writes that Bonifacio's declaration of authority in opposition to Aguinaldo posed a danger to the revolution, because a split in the rebel forces would result in almost certain defeat to their united and well-armed Spanish foe.<ref name=\"agoncillopp180-181\"/> In contrast, [[Renato Constantino]] contends that Bonifacio was neither a danger to the revolution in general for he still planned to fight the Spanish, nor to the revolution in Cavite since he was leaving; but Bonifacio was definitely a threat to the Cavite leaders who wanted control of the Revolution, so he was eliminated. Constantino contrasts Bonifacio who had no record of compromise with the Spanish with the Cavite leaders who did compromise, resulting in the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] whereas the revolution was officially halted and its leaders exiled, though many Filipinos continued to fight especially ''Katipunan'' leaders used to be close to Bonifacio (Aguinaldo eventually, unofficially allied with the United States, did return to take charge of the revolution during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]).<ref name=\"constantinopp190-206\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=190\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nHistorians{{who|date=May 2013}} have also discussed the motives of the Cavite government to replace Bonifacio, and whether it had the right to do so. The Magdalo provincial council which helped establish a republican government led by one of their own was only one of many such councils in the pre-existing [[Katipunan]] government.<ref name=\"villanuevapp62-63\">{{Harvnb|Villanueva|1989|pp=62\u201363}}.</ref><ref name=\"constantinopp188,190-191\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=188,190\u2013191}}</ref> Therefore, Constantino and Alejo Villanueva write Aguinaldo and his faction may be considered counter-revolutionary as well \u2013 as guilty of violating Bonifacio's constituted authority just as they considered Bonifacio to violate theirs.<ref name=\"villanuevapp62-63\"/><ref name=\"constantinop190\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=190}}</ref> Aguinaldo's own adviser and official Apolinario Mabini writes that he was \"primarily answerable for insubordination against the head of the ''Katipunan'' of which he was a member\".<ref name=\"mabini\"/> Aguinaldo's authority was not immediately recognized by all rebels.

The commanding officer of the execution party, [[Lazaro Macapagal]], said in two separate accounts that the Bonifacio brothers were shot to death, which is the orthodox interpretation. Macapagal's second account has Bonifacio attempting to escape after his brother is shot, but he is also killed while running away. Macapagal writes that they buried the brothers in shallow graves dug with bayonets and marked by twigs.<ref name = \"ocampo2001\">{{Harvnb|Ocampo|2001}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, another account states that after his brother was shot, Bonifacio was stabbed and hacked to death. This was allegedly done while he lay prone in a hammock in which he was carried to the site, being too weak to walk.<ref name=\"cristobal\">{{Harvnb|Cristobal|2005}}.</ref> This version was maintained by Guillermo Masangkay, who claimed to have gotten this information from one of Macapagal's men.<ref name=\"ocampo2001\"/> Also, one account used to corroborate this version is of an alleged eyewitness, a farmer who claimed he saw five men hacking a man in a hammock.<ref name=\"cristobal\"/> Historian Milagros Guerrero also says Bonifacio was bayoneted, and that the brothers were left unburied.<ref name=\"guerrerop196\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|p=196}}.</ref> After [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio#Bonifacio's bones|bones said to be Bonifacio's \u2013 including a fractured skull \u2013]] were discovered in 1918, Masangkay claimed the forensic evidence supported his version of events.<ref name=\"ocampo2001\"/> Writer [[Adrian Cristobal]] notes that accounts of Bonifacio's captivity and trial state he was very weak due to his wounds being left untreated; he thus doubts that Bonifacio was strong enough to make a last dash for freedom as Macapagal claimed.<ref name=\"cristobal\"/> Historian Ambeth Ocampo, who doubts the Bonifacio bones were authentic, thus also doubts the possibility of Bonifacio's death by this manner.<ref name=\"ocampo2001\"/>\n\n===Bonifacio as first Philippine President===\n{{See also|List of Unofficial Presidents of the Philippines}}\nSome historians such as Milagros Guerrero, Emmanuel Encarnaci\u00f3n, Ram\u00f3n Villegas and Michael Charleston \"Xiao\" Chua have pushed for the recognition of Bonifacio as the first [[President of the Philippines]] instead of Aguinaldo, the officially recognized one. This view is based on his position of President/''Supremo'' of the ''[[Katipunan]]'' revolutionary government from 1896\u201397. This view also emphasizes that Bonifacio established a government through the ''Katipunan'' before a government headed by Aguinaldo was formed at the [[Tejeros Convention]]. Guerrero writes that Bonifacio had a concept of the Philippine nation called ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan]]'' (\"Sovereign Tagalog Nation\") which was displaced by Aguinaldo's concept of ''Filipinas''. In documents predating Tejeros and the [[First Philippine Republic]], Bonifacio is called the president of the \"[[Tagalog Republic]]\".<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/><ref name=\"guerreropp166-167\"/><ref name=\"cristobal\"/><ref>[http://www.museooriental.es/ver_didactica.asp?clave=138&loc=0 \"La Ilustraci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola y Americana\", A\u00f1o 1897, Vol. I.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Museo Oriental de Valladolid Site.</ref>\n\nThe term ''[[wikt:Tagalog|Tagalog]]'' historically refers to an [[Tagalog people|ethnic group]], their language, and [[Tagalog script|script]]. While historians have thus tended to view Bonifacio's concept of the Philippine nation as restricted to the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] regions of Luzon, as compared to Aguinaldo's view of [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]] (comprising the modern Philippines), Guerrero writes that Bonifacio and the ''Katipunan'' in fact already had an all-encompassing view. The ''Kartilya'' defines \"tagalog\" as \"all those born in this archipelago; therefore, though [[visayan]], [[ilocano people|ilocano]], [[pampango]], etc. they are all tagalogs\".<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/>\n\nIn their memoirs, Emilio Aguinaldo and other ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' people claim Bonifacio became the head of the [[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|''Magdiwang'',]] receiving the title ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan|Har\u00ec ng Bayan]]'' (\"King of the People\") with Mariano \u00c1lvarez as his second-in-command.<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/><ref name=\"ronquillo\">{{Harvnb|Ronquillo|1996}}.</ref> However, these claims are unsupported by documentary evidence.<ref name=\"quirino\">{{Harvnb|Quirino|1969}}.</ref> [[Carlos Quirino]] suggests these claims stem from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of Bonifacio's title ''Pangulo ng [[Tagalog Republic|Haring Bayan]]'' (\"President of the Sovereign Nation\").<ref name=\"quirino\"/> Santiago \u00c1lvarez (son of Mariano) distinguishes between the ''Magdiwang'' government and the ''Katipunan'' Supreme Council headed by Bonifacio.<ref name=\"alvarez\"/>\n\n===Bonifacio as national hero===\n{{See also|National hero of the Philippines}}\n[[File:Bonifacio Monument.JPG|thumbnail|[[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio Monument]] in Caloocan is considered the most symbolic of all the monuments in the country, even grander than Motto Stella.

The United States promoted Rizal, who was taken to represent peaceful political advocacy, instead of more radical figures whose ideas could inspire resistance against American rule.<ref name=\"constantino1980\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1980|pp=125\u2013145}}.</ref> Specifically, Rizal was selected over Bonifacio who was viewed as \"too radical\" and [[Apolinario Mabini]] who was \"unregenerate.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Friend|1965|p=15}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] gives the opinion that arguing for Bonifacio as the \"better\" hero on the grounds that he, not Rizal, began the Philippine Revolution, is moot since Rizal inspired Bonifacio, the Katipunan, and the Revolution. Even prior to Rizal's banishment to [[Dapitan]], he was already regarded by the Filipino people as a national hero, having been elected as honorary president by the ''Katipunan''.<ref name=\"ocampo1999\"/> [[Le\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Guerrero]] notes that while Rizal did not give his blessing to the Katipunan because he believed the time was premature, he did not condemn the aim of independence per se.<ref>[[Le\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Guerrero III|Leon Ma.

A group consisting of government officials, former rebels, and a man reputed to be Bonifacio's servant found bones which they claimed were Bonifacio's in a [[sugarcane]] field on March 17. The bones were placed in an urn and put into the care of the [[National Library of the Philippines]]. They were housed at the Library's headquarters in the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Legislative Building]] in [[Ermita, Manila]], together with some of Bonifacio's papers and personal belongings. The authenticity of the bones was much disputed at the time and has been challenged as late as 2001 by [[Ambeth Ocampo]]. When Emilio Aguinaldo ran for President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] in 1935, his opponent [[Manuel L. Quezon]] (the eventual victor) invoked the memory of Bonifacio against him, the bones being the result of Bonifacio's execution by the revolutionary government headed by Aguinaldo. During [[World War II]], the Philippines were invaded by [[Japan]] beginning on 8 December 1941. The bones were lost due to the widespread destruction and looting during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Allied capture of Manila]] in February 1945.<ref name=\"ocampo2001\"/><ref

''La Liga'' eventually split because some members like Bonifacio lost hope for peaceful reform and stopped their monetary aid.<ref name=\"guerrerop149\"/> The more conservative members, mostly wealthy members, who still believed in peaceful reforms set up the ''Cuerpo de Compromisarios'', which pledged continued support to the reformists in Spain. The radicals were subsumed into the ''Katipunan''.<ref name=\"constantinop158-159\"/> From [[Manila]], the ''Katipunan'' expanded to several provinces, including [[Batangas]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Cavite]], [[Bulacan]], [[Pampanga]], and [[Nueva Ecija]].<ref name=\"agoncillop166\">{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=166}}</ref> Most of its members, called ''[[Katipuneros]]'', came from the lower and middle classes, and many of its local leaders were prominent figures in their municipalities.<ref name=\"guerrerop151\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|p=151}}.</ref> At first exclusively male, membership was later extended to females, with Bonifacio's wife Gregoria de Jes\u00fas as a leading member.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=163}}</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, Bonifacio was one of the chief ''Katipunan'' officers, although he did not become its ''Supremo'' (supreme leader) or ''Presidente Supremo'' (Supreme President)<ref name=\"alvarez\">{{Harvnb|\u00c1lvarez|1992}}.</ref> until 1895. He was the third head of the ''Katipunan'' after [[Deodato Arellano]] and [[Rom\u00e1n Basa]].

For each [[Provinces of the Philippines#Defunct provinces|province]] involved, the ''Katipunan'' Supreme Council coordinated with provincial councils in charge of public administration and military affairs, and with local councils in charge of affairs on the district or [[barrio]] level.<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1996a|pp=3\u201312}}.</ref><ref name=\"guerreropp149-150\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref>\n\nWithin the society, Bonifacio developed a strong friendship with [[Emilio Jacinto]], who served as his adviser and confidant, as well as a member of the Supreme Council. Bonifacio adopted Jacinto's ''[[Kartilya]]'' primer as the official teachings of the society in place of his own ''[[:wikt:decalogue|Decalogue]]'', which he judged as inferior. Bonifacio, Jacinto and [[P\u00edo Valenzuela]] collaborated on the society's organ, ''[[Katipunan|Kalayaan]]'' (Freedom), which had only one printed issue. Bonifacio wrote several pieces for the paper, including the poem ''[[Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa|Pag-ibig sa Tinub\u00faang Lup\u00e0]]'' (approx. \"Love for One's Homeland<ref>''[http://www.philippinerevolution.net/cgi-bin/kultura/awit.pl?title=pag-ibig%20sa%20tinubuang%20lupa Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa]''. Philippine Revolution Web Center Site.</ref>) under the pseudonym ''Agapito Bagumbayan''. The publication of ''Kalayaan'' in March 1896 led to a great increase in the society's membership. The ''Katipunan'' movement spread throughout [[Luzon]], to [[Panay]] in the [[Visayas]] and even as far as [[Mindanao]].<ref name=\"constantinop175\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=175}}.</ref> From less than 300 members in January 1896,<ref name=\"agoncillop166\"/> it had 30,000 to 40,000 by August 1896.<ref name=\"constantinop175\"/>\n\nThe rapid increase in ''Katipunan'' activity drew the suspicion of the Spanish authorities. By early 1896, Spanish intelligence was aware of the existence of a seditious secret society, and suspects were kept under surveillance and arrests were made. On 3 May, Bonifacio held a general assembly of ''Katipunan'' leaders in [[Pasig]], where they debated when to start the revolution. While some officers, especially Bonifacio, believed a revolution was inevitable, some members, especially [[Santiago Alvarez (general)|Santiago Alvarez]] and [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] both of [[Cavite]], expressed reservations and disagreement regarding the planned revolt due to lack of firearms. The consensus was to consult [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] in [[Dapitan]] before launching armed action, so Bonifacio sent P\u00edo Valenzuela to Rizal. Rizal turned out to be against the revolution, believing it to be premature. He recommended more preparation, but suggested that, in the event the revolution did break out, they should seek the leadership of [[Antonio Luna]], who was widely regarded as a brilliant military leader.<ref name=\"guerreropp160-164\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=160\u2013164}}.</ref>\n\n==Philippine Revolution==\n{{main|Philippine Revolution}}\n\n===Start of the uprising===\nThe Spanish authorities confirmed the existence of the ''Katipunan'' on August 19, 1896.

The event, marked by the tearing of ''cedulas'' (personal identity documents) was later called the \"[[Cry of Balintawak]]\" or \"[[Cry of Pugad Lawin]]\"; the exact location and date of the Cry are disputed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Borromeo-Buehler|1998}}</ref><ref name=\"guerrero1996b\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1996b|pp=13\u201322}}</ref> The Supreme Council of the ''Katipunan'' declared a nationwide armed revolution against Spain and called for a simultaneous coordinated attack on the capital [[Manila]] on August 29. Bonifacio appointed generals to lead rebel forces to Manila. Other ''Katipunan'' councils were also informed of their plans. Before hostilities erupted, Bonifacio reorganized the ''Katipunan'' into an open ''de facto'' revolutionary government and they named the nation and its government ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan]]'' (loosely translates to Tagalog Republic), with him as President and commander-in-chief (or generalissimo<ref name=\"alvarez\"/>) of the rebel army and the Supreme Council as his cabinet.<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/><ref name=\"guerreropp166-167\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=166\u2013167}}.</ref><ref name=agoncillo1996pp152-153>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1996|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref> On August 28, Bonifacio issued the following general proclamation:\n\n<blockquote>This manifesto is for all of you. It is absolutely necessary for us to stop at the earliest possible time the nameless oppositions being perpetrated on the sons of the country who are now suffering the brutal punishment and tortures in jails, and because of this please let all the brethren know that on Saturday, the 29th of the current month, the revolution shall commence according to our agreement. For this purpose, it is necessary for all towns to rise simultaneously and attack Manila at the same time. Anybody who obstructs this sacred ideal of the people will be considered a traitor and an enemy, except if he is ill; or is not physically fit, in which case he shall be tried according to the regulations we have put in force.is\n\nMount of Liberty, 28 August 1896 \u2013 ANDR\u00c9S BONIFACIO<ref name=\"agoncillo1996p41\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Salazar|1994|p=107}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn August 30, 1896, Bonifacio personally led an attack on [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]] to capture the town's powder magazine and water station (which supplied Manila). The defending Spaniards, outnumbered, fought a delaying battle until reinforcements arrived. Once reinforced, the Spaniards drove Bonifacio's forces back with heavy casualties. Bonifacio and his troops regrouped near [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]].<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\"/> Elsewhere, fighting between rebels and Spanish forces occurred in [[Mandaluyong]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]], [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]], [[Pandacan, Manila|Pandacan]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Marikina]], [[Caloocan]],<ref name=\"salazar\">{{Harvnb|Salazar|1994}}.</ref> [[Makati]] and [[Taguig]].<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\">{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=173}}</ref> The conventional view among Filipino historians is that the planned general ''Katipunan'' offensive on Manila was aborted in favor of Bonifacio's attack on [[San Juan del Monte, Philippines|San Juan del Monte]],<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\"/><ref name=\"zaide\">{{Harvnb|Zaide|1984}}.</ref> which sparked a general state of rebellion in the area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Salazar|1994|p=104}}.</ref> However, more recent studies have advanced the view that the planned offensive did push through and the rebel attacks were integrated; according to this view, Bonifacio's San Juan del Monte battle was only a part of a bigger whole \u2013 an unrecognized \"Battle for Manila\".<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"guerrerop173\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|p=173}}.</ref> Despite his reverses, Bonifacio was not completely defeated and was still considered a threat. Further, the revolt had spread to the surrounding provinces by the end of August.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"guerrerop173\"/>\n\n===Campaigns around Manila===\nBy December 1896, the Spanish government recognized three major centers of rebellion: [[Cavite]] (under [[Mariano Alvarez]], [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and others), [[Bulacan]] (under [[Mariano Llanera]]) and [[Rizal|Morong]] (under Bonifacio). The revolt was most successful in [[Cavite]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=179}}</ref> which mostly fell under rebel control by September\u2013October 1896.<ref name=\"guerreropp175-176\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=175\u2013176}}.</ref>\n\nWhile Cavite is traditionally regarded as the \"Heartland of the Philippine Revolution\", Manila and its surrounding municipalities bore the brunt of the Spanish military campaign, becoming a [[no man's land]]. Rebels in the area were generally engaged in [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] [[guerrilla warfare]] against Spanish positions in Manila, [[Morong, Rizal|Morong,]] [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Pampanga]].<ref name=\"guerreropp175-176\"/> From Morong, Bonifacio served as [[military tactics|tactician]] for rebel guerrillas and issued commands to areas other than his personal sector,<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/> though his reputation suffered when he lost battles he personally led.<ref name=\"constantinop180\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|p=180}}</ref>\n\nFrom September to October 1896, Bonifacio supervised the establishment of ''Katipunan'' mountain and hill bases like [[Marikina|Balara]] in Marikina, Pantayanin in [[Antipolo]], [[Ugong, Pasig|Ugong]] in Pasig and Tungko in [[Bulacan]]. Bonifacio appointing generals for these areas, or approving selections the troops themselves made.<ref name=\"alvarez\"/>\n\nOn November 7, 1896, Bonifacio led an assault on [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], [[Marikina]] and [[Montalb\u00e1n, Teruel|Montalban]]. The Spanish were forced to retreat, leaving these areas to the rebels, except for the municipal hall of San Mateo where some Spanish troops had barricaded. While Bonifacio's troops laid siege to the hall, other ''Katipunan'' forces set up defensive lines along the nearby Langka (or [[San Mateo, Rizal|Nangka]]) river against Spanish reinforcements coming from the direction of Marikina. After three days, Spanish counterattacks broke through the Nangka river lines. The Spanish troops thus recaptured the rebel positions and surprised Bonifacio in San Mateo, who ordered a general retreat to Balara.<ref name=\"alvarez\"/> They were pursued, and Bonifacio was nearly killed shielding Emilio Jacinto from a Spanish bullet which grazed his collar.<ref name=\"Agoncillop173\"/>\n\nIn Balara, Bonifacio commissioned [[Julio Nakpil]] to compose a national anthem. Nakpil produced a hymn called ''[[Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan]]'' (\"Honorable Hymn of the Tagalogs\") and became the official national anthem during the entire period of the revolution until it was replaced years later by another national anthem commissioned by the new [[Republica Filipina]] government that replaced the ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan]]''.<ref name=\"Nakpil\">{{Harvnb|Nakpil|1964}}.</ref>\n\n===Bonifacio in Cavite===\nIn late 1896, Bonifacio, as the recognized overall leader of the revolution, was invited to [[Cavite]] province by rebel leaders to mediate between them and unify their efforts. There were two ''[[Katipunan]]'' provincial chapters in Cavite that became rival factions: the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'', headed by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]'s cousin [[Baldomero Aguinaldo]], and the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'', headed by [[Mariano \u00c1lvarez]], uncle of Bonifacio's wife. Leaders of both factions came from the upper class, in contrast to Bonifacio, who came from the lower middle class. After initial successes, Emilio Aguinaldo issued a manifesto in the name of the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' ruling council which proclaimed a provisional and revolutionary government \u2013 despite the existence of the ''Katipunan'' government. Emilio Aguinaldo in particular had won fame for victories in the province.<ref name=\"constantinop178-181\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=178\u2013181}}</ref> The ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' and ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'' clashed over authority and jurisdiction and did not help each other in battle.  After multiple letters were sent to Bonifacio urging him to come, in December 1896 he traveled to Cavite accompanied by his wife, his brothers [[Procopio Bonifacio|Procopio]] and [[Ciriaco Bonifacio|Ciriaco]], and some troops, including [[Emilio Jacinto]], Bonifacio's secretary and right-hand man. Jacinto was said to be against Bonifacio's expedition to Cavite.\n\nUpon his arrival at Cavite, friction grew between Bonifacio and the ''Magdalo'' leaders. [[Apolinario Mabini]], who later served as Emilio Aguinaldo's adviser, writes that at this point the ''Magdalo'' leaders \"already paid little heed to his authority and orders.\"<ref name=\"mabini\">{{Harvnb|Mabini|1969|Ref=MabiniGuerrero1969ch8}}.</ref> Bonifacio was partial to the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'', perhaps due to his kinship ties with [[Mariano \u00c1lvarez]],<ref name=\"garcia-rodriguez\">{{Harvnb|Garcia|Rodriguez|2001}}.</ref> or more importantly, due to their stronger recognition of his authority.<ref name=\"cristobal\"/> When Aguinaldo and [[Edilberto Evangelista]] went to receive Bonifacio at [[Zapote]], they were irritated with what they regarded as his attitude of superiority. In his memoirs [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] wrote that Bonifacio acted \"as if he were a king\".<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/><ref name=\"constantinop181-182\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=181\u2013182}}</ref> Another time, Bonifacio ordered the arrest of one ''Katipunan'' general from [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] named Vicente Fernandez, who was accompanying the ''Magdalo'' leaders in paying their respect to Bonifacio, for failing to support his attack in Manila, but the other ''Magdalo'' leaders refused to surrender him. Townspeople in [[Noveleta]] (a ''Magdiwang'' town) acclaimed Bonifacio as the ruler of the Philippines, to the chagrin of the [[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|''Magdalo'' l]]<nowiki/>eaders, (Bonifacio replied: \"Long live Philippine liberty!\").<ref name=\"constantinop181-182\"/> Aguinaldo disputed with Bonifacio over strategic troop placements and blamed him for the capture of the town of [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]].<ref name=\"aguinaldo\">{{Harvnb|Aguinaldo|1964}}.</ref> The Spanish, through [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Superior Pio Pi, wrote to Aguinaldo about the possibility of peace negotiations.<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/> When Bonifacio found out, he and the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'' council rejected the proposed peace talks. Bonifacio was also angered that the Spanish considered Aguinaldo the \"chief of the rebellion\" instead of him.<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/> However, Aguinaldo continued to arrange negotiations which never took place.<ref name=\"guerrerop190\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|p=190}}.</ref> Bonifacio believed Aguinaldo was willing to surrender the revolution.<ref name=\"guerrerop190\"/>\n\nBonifacio was also subject to rumors that he had stolen ''Katipunan'' funds, his sister was the mistress of a [[Roman Catholic Church|priest]], and he was an ''[[agent provocateur]]'' paid by [[friars]] to foment unrest. Also circulated were anonymous letters which told the people of Cavite not to idolize Bonifacio because he was a Mason, a mere Manila employee, allegedly an atheist, and uneducated. According to these letters, Bonifacio did not deserve the title of ''Supremo'' since only God was supreme. This last allegation was made despite the fact that ''Supremo'' was meant to be used in conjunction with ''Presidente'', i.e. ''Presidente Supremo'' (Supreme President) to distinguish the president of the ''Katipunan'' Supreme Council from council presidents of subordinate ''Katipunan'' chapters like the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' and ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]''.<ref name=\"cristobal\"/> Bonifacio suspected the rumor-mongering to be the work of the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' leader [[Daniel Tirona]].

The issue of whether the Katipunan should be replaced by a revolutionary government was brought up by the ''Magdalo'', and this eclipsed the rivalry issue. The ''Magdalo'' argued that the ''Katipunan'', as a secret society, should have ceased to exist once the Revolution was underway. They also held that Cavite should not be divided. Bonifacio and the ''[[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]'' contended that the ''Katipunan'' served as their revolutionary government since it had its own constitution, laws, and provincial and municipal governments. [[Edilberto Evangelista]] presented a draft constitution for the proposed government to Bonifacio but he rejected it as it was too similar to the Spanish [[Maura Law]]. Upon the event of restructuring, Bonifacio was given ''[[Full Powers|carte blanche]]'' to appoint a committee tasked with setting up a new government; he would also be in charge of this committee. He tasked [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] to record the minutes of the meeting and requested for it to establish this authority, but these were never done and never provided.<ref name=\"constantinop182-184\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=182\u2013184}}</ref><ref name=\"guerreropp187-191\">{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1998|pp=187\u2013191}}.</ref>\n\n===Haring Bayang Katagalugan===\nInfluenced by [[Freemasonry]], the ''[[Katipunan]]'' had been organized with \"its own laws, bureaucratic structure and elective leadership\".<ref name = \"guererro1\">{{cite journal\n  | last1 = Guererro\n  | first1 = Milagros\n  | last2 = Encarnacion\n  | first2 = Emmanuel\n  | last3 = Villegas\n  | first3 = Ramon\n  | title = Andres Bonifacio and the 1896 Revolution\n  | journal = Sulyap Kultura\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 3\u201312\n  | publisher = National Commission for Culture and the Arts\n  | location = \n  | date = 1996\n  | url = http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?i=5&subcat=1}}</ref> For each province it involved, the Supreme Council coordinated provincial councils<!--(''Sangguniang Bayan'')--><ref name = \"guererro2\">{{cite book\n  | last = Guererro\n  | first = Milagros\n  | last2 = Schumacher, S.J.\n  | first2 = John\n  | title = Reform and Revolution\n  | publisher = Asia Publishing Company Limited\n  | volume = 5\n  | series = Kasaysayan: The History of the Filipino People\n  | year = 1998\n  | isbn = 962-258-228-1}}</ref> which were in charge of \"public administration and military affairs on the supra-municipal or quasi-provincial level\"<ref name=\"guererro1\" /> and local councils<!--(''Panguluhang Bayan'')-->,<ref name=\"guererro2\" /> in charge of affairs \"on the district or [[barrio]] level\".<ref name=\"guererro1\" /> In the last days of August, the ''Katipunan'' members met in Caloocan and decided to start their revolt<ref name=\"guererro1\" /> (the event was later called the \"[[Cry of Balintawak]]\" or \"Cry of [[Pugad Lawin]]\"; the exact location and date are disputed).

The Aguinaldo-headed [[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]] ({{lang-es|Rep\u00fablica Filipina|links=no}}), usually considered the \"First Philippine Republic\", was formally established in 1899, after a succession of revolutionary and dictatorial governments (e.g. the [[Tejeros Convention|Tejeros government]], the [[Republic of Biak-na-Bato|Biak-na-Bato Republic]]) also headed by Aguinaldo.\n\n===The Tejeros Convention===\n{{main|Tejeros Convention}}\nBonifacio even though fully aware of the Spanish assault in [[Battle of Perez Dasmari\u00f1as|Perez Dasmari\u00f1as]], offered no help to the ''Magdalo'' faction.

Many of the principal men of Indang, among them Severino de las Alas, presented Emilio Aguinaldo with several complaints against Bonifacio that the Supremo's men stole carabaos (water buffalos) and other work animals by force and butchered them for food. On April 25, a party of Aguinaldo's men led by Colonel Agapito Bonz\u00f3n and Major Jos\u00e9 Ignacio \"Intsik\" Paua caught up with Bonifacio at his camp in barrio Limbon, Indang. The unsuspecting Bonifacio received them cordially. Early the next day, Bonz\u00f3n and Paua attacked Bonifacio's camp. Bonifacio was surprised and refused to fight against \"fellow [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]]\", ordering his men to hold their fire, but shots were nevertheless exchanged. Bonifacio was shot in the arm by Bonz\u00f3n, and Paua stabbed him in the neck but was prevented from striking further by one of Bonifacio's men, who offered to die in Bonifacio's place. Andr\u00e9s's brother [[Ciriaco Bonifacio|Ciriaco]] was shot dead, while his other brother Procopio was beaten, and his wife [[Gregoria de Jes\u00fas|Gregoria]] may have been raped by Bonz\u00f3n.

His death is alternately viewed as a justified execution for treason and a \"legal murder\" fueled by politics.

Some historians have also opined that Bonifacio share or even take the place of Jos\u00e9 Rizal as the (foremost) [[Philippine national hero]]. The purported discovery of Bonifacio's remains has also been questioned.\n\n===Trial and execution===\nHistorians have condemned the trial of the Bonifacio brothers as unjust. The jury was entirely composed of Aguinaldo's men; Bonifacio's defense lawyer acted more like a prosecutor as he himself declared Bonifacio's guilt and instead appealed for less punishment; and Bonifacio was not allowed to confront the state witness for the charge of conspiracy on the grounds that the latter had been killed in battle, but later the witness was seen with the prosecutors.<ref name=\"constantinopp190-191\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref><ref name=\"villanuevapp60,64\">{{Harvnb|Villanueva|1989|pp=60,64}}.</ref>\n\n[[Teodoro Agoncillo]] writes that Bonifacio's declaration of authority in opposition to Aguinaldo posed a danger to the revolution, because a split in the rebel forces would result in almost certain defeat to their united and well-armed Spanish foe.<ref name=\"agoncillopp180-181\"/> In contrast, [[Renato Constantino]] contends that Bonifacio was neither a danger to the revolution in general for he still planned to fight the Spanish, nor to the revolution in Cavite since he was leaving; but Bonifacio was definitely a threat to the Cavite leaders who wanted control of the Revolution, so he was eliminated. Constantino contrasts Bonifacio who had no record of compromise with the Spanish with the Cavite leaders who did compromise, resulting in the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] whereas the revolution was officially halted and its leaders exiled, though many Filipinos continued to fight especially ''Katipunan'' leaders used to be close to Bonifacio (Aguinaldo eventually, unofficially allied with the United States, did return to take charge of the revolution during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]).<ref name=\"constantinopp190-206\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1975|pp=190\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nHistorians{{who|date=May 2013}} have also discussed the motives of the Cavite government to replace Bonifacio, and whether it had the right to do so.

The commanding officer of the execution party, [[Lazaro Macapagal]], said in two separate accounts that the Bonifacio brothers were shot to death, which is the orthodox interpretation. Macapagal's second account has Bonifacio attempting to escape after his brother is shot, but he is also killed while running away. Macapagal writes that they buried the brothers in shallow graves dug with bayonets and marked by twigs.<ref name = \"ocampo2001\">{{Harvnb|Ocampo|2001}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, another account states that after his brother was shot, Bonifacio was stabbed and hacked to death.

This view is based on his position of President/''Supremo'' of the ''[[Katipunan]]'' revolutionary government from 1896\u201397. This view also emphasizes that Bonifacio established a government through the ''Katipunan'' before a government headed by Aguinaldo was formed at the [[Tejeros Convention]]. Guerrero writes that Bonifacio had a concept of the Philippine nation called ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan]]'' (\"Sovereign Tagalog Nation\") which was displaced by Aguinaldo's concept of ''Filipinas''. In documents predating Tejeros and the [[First Philippine Republic]], Bonifacio is called the president of the \"[[Tagalog Republic]]\".<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/><ref name=\"guerreropp166-167\"/><ref name=\"cristobal\"/><ref>[http://www.museooriental.es/ver_didactica.asp?clave=138&loc=0 \"La Ilustraci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola y Americana\", A\u00f1o 1897, Vol. I.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Museo Oriental de Valladolid Site.</ref>\n\nThe term ''[[wikt:Tagalog|Tagalog]]'' historically refers to an [[Tagalog people|ethnic group]], their language, and [[Tagalog script|script]]. While historians have thus tended to view Bonifacio's concept of the Philippine nation as restricted to the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] regions of Luzon, as compared to Aguinaldo's view of [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]] (comprising the modern Philippines), Guerrero writes that Bonifacio and the ''Katipunan'' in fact already had an all-encompassing view. The ''Kartilya'' defines \"tagalog\" as \"all those born in this archipelago; therefore, though [[visayan]], [[ilocano people|ilocano]], [[pampango]], etc. they are all tagalogs\".<ref name=\"guerrero1996a\"/>\n\nIn their memoirs, Emilio Aguinaldo and other ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'' people claim Bonifacio became the head of the [[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|''Magdiwang'',]] receiving the title ''[[Haring Bayang Katagalugan|Har\u00ec ng Bayan]]'' (\"King of the People\") with Mariano \u00c1lvarez as his second-in-command.<ref name=\"aguinaldo\"/><ref name=\"ronquillo\">{{Harvnb|Ronquillo|1996}}.</ref> However, these claims are unsupported by documentary evidence.<ref name=\"quirino\">{{Harvnb|Quirino|1969}}.</ref> [[Carlos Quirino]] suggests these claims stem from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of Bonifacio's title ''Pangulo ng [[Tagalog Republic|Haring Bayan]]'' (\"President of the Sovereign Nation\").<ref name=\"quirino\"/> Santiago \u00c1lvarez (son of Mariano) distinguishes between the ''Magdiwang'' government and the ''Katipunan'' Supreme Council headed by Bonifacio.<ref name=\"alvarez\"/>\n\n===Bonifacio as national hero===\n{{See also|National hero of the Philippines}}\n[[File:Bonifacio Monument.JPG|thumbnail|[[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio Monument]] in Caloocan is considered the most symbolic of all the monuments in the country, even grander than Motto Stella. It is sculpted by National Artist Guillermo Tolentino.]]\n[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] is generally considered the national hero, but Bonifacio has been suggested as a more worthy candidate on the grounds of having started the [[Philippine Revolution]].<ref name=\"ocampo1999\"/> [[Teodoro Agoncillo]] notes that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not \"the leader of its liberation forces\".<ref name=\"Agoncillop160\">{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=160}}</ref> [[Renato Constantino]] writes that Rizal is a \"United States-sponsored hero\" who was promoted as the greatest Filipino hero during the [[History of the Philippines (1898-1946)|American colonial period of the Philippines]] \u2013 after Aguinaldo lost the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. The United States promoted Rizal, who was taken to represent peaceful political advocacy, instead of more radical figures whose ideas could inspire resistance against American rule.<ref name=\"constantino1980\">{{Harvnb|Constantino|1980|pp=125\u2013145}}.</ref> Specifically, Rizal was selected over Bonifacio who was viewed as \"too radical\" and [[Apolinario Mabini]] who was \"unregenerate.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Friend|1965|p=15}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] gives the opinion that arguing for Bonifacio as the \"better\" hero on the grounds that he, not Rizal, began the Philippine Revolution, is moot since Rizal inspired Bonifacio, the Katipunan, and the Revolution. Even prior to Rizal's banishment to [[Dapitan]], he was already regarded by the Filipino people as a national hero, having been elected as honorary president by the ''Katipunan''.<ref name=\"ocampo1999\"/> [[Le\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Guerrero]] notes that while Rizal did not give his blessing to the Katipunan because he believed the time was premature, he did not condemn the aim of independence per se.<ref>[[Le\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Guerrero III|Leon Ma. Guerrero]], \"The First Filipino\", as quoted in Nick Joaquin's \"Anatomy of the Anti-Hero.\" http://joserizal.info/Reflections/joaquin.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040828010552/http://joserizal.info/Reflections/joaquin.htm |date=August 28, 2004 }}</ref> [[Teodoro Agoncillo]] gives the opinion that Bonifacio should not replace Rizal as national hero, but they should be honored \"side by side\".<ref name=\"Agoncillop160\"/>\n\nDespite popular recognition of Rizal as \"''the'' Philippine national hero\", the title itself has no explicit legal definition in present Philippine law. Rizal and Bonifacio, however, are given the implied recognition of being national heroes because they are commemorated [[Public holidays in the Philippines|annually nationwide]] \u2013 ''[[Rizal Day]]'' on December 30 and ''[[Bonifacio Day]]'' on November 30.<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/culture-profile/culture-profile-nationalhero.php|title=National Commission for Culture and the Arts. *Selection and Proclamation of National heroes and Law Honoring Filipino Historical Figures.|publisher=}}</ref> According to the website of the National Center for Culture and the Arts: <blockquote>\nDespite the lack of any official declaration explicitly proclaiming them as national heroes, [Rizal and Bonifacio] remain admired and revered for their roles in Philippine history. Heroes, according to historians, should not be legislated.\n\nTheir appreciation should be better left to academics. Acclamation for heroes, they felt, would be recognition enough.<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Bonifacio's bones===\nIn 1918, the American colonial government of the Philippines mounted a search for Bonifacio's remains in [[Maragondon]]. A group consisting of government officials, former rebels, and a man reputed to be Bonifacio's servant found bones which they claimed were Bonifacio's in a [[sugarcane]] field on March 17. The bones were placed in an urn and put into the care of the [[National Library of the Philippines]]. They were housed at the Library's headquarters in the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Legislative Building]] in [[Ermita, Manila]], together with some of Bonifacio's papers and personal belongings. The authenticity of the bones was much disputed at the time and has been challenged as late as 2001 by [[Ambeth Ocampo]]. When Emilio Aguinaldo ran for President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] in 1935, his opponent [[Manuel L. Quezon]] (the eventual victor) invoked the memory of Bonifacio against him, the bones being the result of Bonifacio's execution by the revolutionary government headed by Aguinaldo. During [[World War II]], the Philippines were invaded by [[Japan]] beginning on 8 December 1941. The bones were lost due to the widespread destruction and looting during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Allied capture of Manila]] in February 1945.<ref name=\"ocampo2001\"/><ref
