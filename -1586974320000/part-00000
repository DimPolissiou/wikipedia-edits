Several technical approaches have been proposed, but there has been no legal framework to date that has required satellite operators to clean up the [[negative externality]] of their derelict satellites. New approaches offer the technical prospect of markedly reducing the cost of object capture and deorbit with the implementation of a one-up/one-down [[launch license]] regime to Earth orbits that would require satellite operators to remove one spacecraft for each one deployed.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p13 >{{cite web |last=Zegler |first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2014-06-14 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |pages=13\u201314 |quote=''for disposing of these obsolete or derelict spacecraft all [approaches] involve the expenditure of substantially more delta-V than what has been traditional.

Several technical approaches have been proposed, but there has been no legal framework to date that has required satellite operators to clean up the [[negative externality]] of their derelict satellites. New approaches offer the technical prospect of markedly reducing the cost of object capture and deorbit with the implementation of a one-up/one-down [[launch license]] regime to Earth orbits that would require satellite operators to remove one spacecraft for each one deployed.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p13 >{{cite web |last=Zegler |first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2014-06-14 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |pages=13\u201314 |quote=''for disposing of these obsolete or derelict spacecraft all [approaches] involve the expenditure of substantially more delta-V than what has been traditional.
