The commission reported in 1955 to reorganise states of India.\n\n==Agitation==\n[[File:Morarji Desai 1978.jpg|thumb|Morarji Desai]]\nSRC considered to form states on linguistic basis but recommended that Bombay state should stay as a bilingual state. It was further enlarged by the addition of [[Saurashtra State]] and [[Kutch State]], the Marathi-speaking districts of [[Nagpur]] Division of [[Madhya Pradesh]], and the [[Marathawada]] region of Hyderabad. The southernmost districts of Bombay state were included in Mysore State. So it had Gujarati-speaking population in north and Marathi-speaking population in southern parts.<ref name=fed/>\n\nBoth Gujarati and Marathi people opposed the SRC's recommendation and strongly demanded separate linguistic states. The situation became complicated because both of them wanted to include [[Bombay]] city (now Mumbai) in their own states due to its economic and cosmopolitan values. Jawaharlal Nehru also suggested to form three states; Maharashtra, Gujarat and centrally governed city-state of Bombay to solve conflict.<ref name=fed/>\n\nProtest broke out in Bombay and other [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking districts later known as [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra Movement]] demanding separate Marathi state.<ref name=fed/> Morarji Desai, then the Chief Minister of Bombay State, was against it.

[[A.W. Tozer]] describes poverty of spirit as \"an inward state paralleling the outward circumstances of the common beggar in the streets.\" It is not a call to material poverty in itself.\n{{Quote | These blessed poor are no longer slaves to the tyranny of things.

Rather, they are proclamations that the people before Jesus on the mountain are blessed (well off) because they are disciples of Jesus Christ. These proclamations are instructive in that they communicate to the hearers that many who are in a deplorable condition are blessed in spite of this because the kingdom of heaven has been opened even to them by Jesus Christ. [[Alfred Edersheim]] held a similar (or identical) view. He is quoted by Willard as saying: \"It is not because a man is poor in spirit that his is the Kingdom of Heaven, in the sense that one state will grow into the other, or be its result; still less is the one the reward of the other. The connecting link is in each case Christ Himself: because He\u2026 \"has opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.\" This interpretation relies on a view of Jesus' main message being the availability of the Kingdom of Heaven (see Mt 4:17).

[[A.W. Tozer]] describes poverty of spirit as \"an inward state paralleling the outward circumstances of the common beggar in the streets.\" It is not a call to material poverty in itself.\n{{Quote | These blessed poor are no longer slaves to the tyranny of things.

Rather, they are proclamations that the people before Jesus on the mountain are blessed (well off) because they are disciples of Jesus Christ. These proclamations are instructive in that they communicate to the hearers that many who are in a deplorable condition are blessed in spite of this because the kingdom of heaven has been opened even to them by Jesus Christ. [[Alfred Edersheim]] held a similar (or identical) view. He is quoted by Willard as saying: \"It is not because a man is poor in spirit that his is the Kingdom of Heaven, in the sense that one state will grow into the other, or be its result; still less is the one the reward of the other. The connecting link is in each case Christ Himself: because He\u2026 \"has opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.\" This interpretation relies on a view of Jesus' main message being the availability of the Kingdom of Heaven (see Mt 4:17). The Beatitudes then are, according to Willard, \"\u2026proof that, in [Jesus], the rule of God from the heavens truly is available in life circumstances that are beyond all human hope.\" This interpretation sees the Beatitudes as continuing a biblical theme of status inversion in such places as the \"Song of Moses and Miriam\" in Exodus 15, the prayer of Hannah in 1 Samuel 2, the story of David and Goliath in 1 Samuel 17, Jehoshaphat's prayer and battle in 2 Chronicles 20, and the \"Magnificat\" of the Virgin Mary in Luke 1.

Cooper learned to fly as a child, and after service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during [[World War II]], he was commissioned into the [[United States Air Force]] in 1949. After service as a fighter pilot, he qualified as a test pilot in 1956, and was selected as an astronaut in 1959.\n\nIn 1963 Cooper piloted the longest and last Mercury spaceflight, [[Mercury-Atlas 9]]. During that 34-hour mission he became the first American to spend an entire day in space, the first to sleep in space, and the last American launched on an entirely solo [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] mission. Despite a series of severe equipment failures, he managed to successfully complete the mission under manual control, guiding his spacecraft, which he named ''[[Faith 7]]'', to a [[splashdown]] just {{convert|4|mi}} ahead of the recovery ship. Cooper became the first astronaut to make a second orbital flight when he flew as Command Pilot of [[Gemini 5]] in 1965. Along with Pilot [[Pete Conrad]], he set a new space endurance record by traveling {{convert|3312993|mi}} in 190 hours and 56 minutes\u2014just short of eight days\u2014showing that astronauts could survive in space for the length of time necessary to go from the Earth to the Moon and back.\n\nCooper liked to race cars and boats, and entered the $28,000 Salton City {{Convert|500|mi|km|abbr=}} boat race, and the Southwest Championship Drag Boat races in 1965, and the 1967 Orange Bowl Regatta with fire fighter [[Red Adair]]. In 1968, he entered the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], but NASA management ordered him to withdraw due to the dangers involved. After serving as backup commander of the [[Apollo 10]] mission, he was superseded by [[Alan Shepard]], and retired from NASA and the Air Force with the rank of [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 1971.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLeroy Gordon Cooper Jr. was born on March 6, 1927, in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]],{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=336}} the only child of Leroy Gordon Cooper Sr. and his wife Hattie Lee {{nee}} Herd.<ref name=40thmerc7 /> His mother was a school teacher. His father enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]], and served on the presidential yacht {{USS|Mayflower|PY-1|6}}. After the war, Cooper&nbsp;Sr. completed his high school education; Hattie Lee was one of his teachers, although she was only two years older than him. He joined the [[Oklahoma National Guard]], flying a [[Curtiss JN-4]] biplane, despite never having formal military pilot training. He graduated from college and law school, and became a [[State court (United States)|state district judge]]. He was called to active duty during [[World War II]], and served in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theater]] in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]].{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=93\u201394}} He transferred to [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) after it was formed in 1947, and was stationed at [[Hickham Air Force Base]], [[Hawaii Territory]]. He retired from the USAF with the rank of [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 1957.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=337}}\n\nCooper attended Jefferson Elementary School and Shawnee High School,{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=337}} where he was on the [[American football|football]] and track teams.

He became a [[flight commander]] of the [[525th Fighter Squadron|525th Fighter Bomber Squadron]]. While in Germany, he attended the European Extension of the [[University of Maryland University College|University of Maryland]]. He returned to the United States in 1954, and studied for two years at the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] (AFIT) in [[Ohio]]. He completed his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aerospace Engineering]] there on August 28, 1956.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=337}}{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}}\n\nWhile at AFIT, Cooper met [[Gus Grissom]], a fellow USAF officer, and the two became good friends. They were involved in an accident on takeoff from [[Lowry Field]] on June 23, 1956, when the [[Lockheed T-33]] Cooper was piloting suddenly lost power. He aborted the takeoff, but the landing gear collapsed and the aircraft skidded erratically for {{convert|2000|ft}}, and crashed at the end of the runway, bursting into flames. Cooper and Grissom escaped unscathed, although the aircraft was a total loss.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}}\n\nCooper and Grissom attended the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|USAF Experimental Flight Test School]] (Class 56D) at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] in 1956.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}} After graduation Cooper was posted to the [[Air Force Test Center|Flight Test Engineering Division]] at Edwards, where he served as a [[test pilot]] and [[project manager]] testing the [[F-102A]] and [[F-106 Delta Dart|F-106B]].<ref name=40thmerc7 /> He also flew the [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]], [[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]], [[F-86]], [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] and [[F-104]].{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=14}} By the time he left Edwards, he had logged more than 2,000 hours of flight time, of which 1,600 hours were in [[jet aircraft]].{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}}\n\n== NASA career ==\n=== Project Mercury ===\n{{Main|Project Mercury}}\n[[File:Mercury Suit Gordon Cooper.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cooper in his Mercury spacesuit, the [[Navy Mark IV]] ]]\nIn January 1959, Cooper received unexpected orders to report to Washington, D.C. There was no indication what it was about, but his commanding officer, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] Marcus F. Cooper (no relation) recalled an announcement in the newspaper saying that a contract had been awarded to [[McDonnell Aircraft]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to build a space capsule, and advised Cooper not to volunteer for astronaut training. On February 2, 1959, Cooper attended a [[NASA]] briefing on [[Project Mercury]] and the part astronauts would play in it. Cooper went through the selection process with another 109 pilots,{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=7\u201310}} and was not surprised when he was accepted as the youngest of the first seven American astronauts.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=12\u201315}} Others were though; Slayton later recalled that \"When I heard Gordo's name, my first reaction was, something's wrong. Gordo was an engineer at Edwards. As far as I was concerned, he wasn't even a test pilot.\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=73}}\n\nDuring the selection interviews, Cooper had been asked about his domestic relationship, and had lied, saying that he and Trudy had a good, stable marriage. In fact, she had left him four months before in the wake of a lengthy affair he had with a married woman, and was living with their daughters in San Diego while he occupied a bachelor's quarters at Edwards. Aware that NASA wanted to project an image of its astronauts as loving family men, and that his story would not stand up to scrutiny, he drove down to San Diego to see Trudy at the first opportunity. Lured by the prospect of a great adventure for herself and her daughters, she agreed to go along with the charade and pretend that they were a happily married couple.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nThe identities of the [[Mercury Seven]] were announced at a press conference at [[Dolley Madison House]] in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=274\u2013275}} [[Scott Carpenter]], Gordon Cooper, [[John Glenn]], Gus Grissom, [[Wally Schirra]], [[Alan Shepard]], and [[Deke Slayton]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=42\u201347}} Each was assigned a different portion of the project along with other special assignments. Cooper specialized in the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone rocket]], which would be used for the first, [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]s.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=22\u201323}} He also chaired the Emergency Egress Committee, responsible for working out emergency [[launch pad]] escape procedures,{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=34}} and engaged [[Bo Randall]] to develop a personal [[survival knife]] for astronauts to carry.{{sfn|Cooper et al.|2010|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nThe astronauts drew their salaries as military officers, and an important component of that was flight pay. In Cooper's case, it amounted to $145 a month ({{Inflation|US|145|1959|fmt=eq}}). NASA saw no reason to provide the astronauts with aircraft, so they had to fly to meetings around the country on commercial airlines. To continue earning their flight pay, Grissom and Slayton would go out on the weekend to [[Langley Air Force Base]], and attempt to put in the required four hours a month, competing for T-33 aircraft with senior deskbound colonels and generals. Cooper traveled to [[McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base]] in [[Tennessee]], where a friend let him fly higher-performance F-104B jets. This came up when Cooper had lunch with [[William Hines]], a reporter for ''[[The Washington Star]]'', and was duly reported in the paper. Cooper then discussed the issue with [[Congressman]] [[James G. Fulton]]. The matter was taken up by the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]]. Within weeks the astronauts had priority access to USAF F-102s, something that Cooper considered a \"hot plane\", but which could still take off from and land at short civilian airfields; but it did not make Cooper popular with senior NASA management.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Wolfe|1979|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nAfter [[General Motors]] executive [[Ed Cole]] presented Shepard with a brand-new [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Jim Rathmann]], a racing car driver who won the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1960, and was a Chevrolet dealer in [[Melbourne, Florida]], convinced Cole to turn this into an ongoing marketing campaign. Henceforth, astronauts would be able to lease brand-new Corvettes for a dollar a year. All of the Mercury Seven but Glenn soon took up the offer. Cooper, Grissom and Shepard were soon racing their Corvettes around Cape Canaveral, with the police ignoring their exploits. From a marketing perspective, it was very successful, and helped the highly priced Corvette become established as a desirable brand. Cooper held licenses with the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) and the [[National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing]] (NASCAR). He also enjoyed racing speedboats,{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=36}} and had affairs with the female astronaut [[groupie]]s.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=336}}\n\nCooper served as [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) for NASA's first [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], by [[Alan Shepard]] in [[Mercury-Redstone 3]],{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=28\u201330}} and [[Scott Carpenter]]'s orbital flight on [[Mercury-Atlas 7]],{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=47}} and was backup pilot for [[Wally Schirra]] in [[Mercury-Atlas 8]].{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=337}}\n\n=== Mercury-Atlas 9 ===\n{{Main|Mercury-Atlas 9}}\n[[File:Cooper - GPN-2000-000997.jpg|thumb|[[Mercury-Atlas 9]] lifts off from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14]] on May&nbsp;15, 1963]]\nCooper was designated for the next mission, [[Mercury-Atlas 9]] ({{nowr|MA-9}}). Apart from the grounded Slayton, he was the only one of the Mercury Seven who had not yet flown in space. Some officials at NASA Headquarters (HQ) were unenthusiastic about Cooper, considering his complaints about flight pay and other incidents as evidence of a disturbing lack of judgment.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=121\u2013122}} His laid-back attitude and Oklahoma accent did not help.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=336}} Slayton later recalled: \"Cooper was a capable pilot and could do the job, so I recommended him. There was some grumbling out of HQ so I said: 'Either we fly him on {{nowr|MA-9}}, or we send him back to the Air Force now. It isn't fair to keep this guy hanging around if we're not gonna fly him.'\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=122}} NASA management did not want to send one of its astronaut heroes back to the Air Force, so Cooper's selection was publicly announced on November&nbsp;14, 1962, with Shepard designated as his backup.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=122}}\n\nProject Mercury had begun with a goal of ultimately flying an 18-orbit, {{nowr|27-hour}} mission, known as the manned one-day mission.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=486\u2013487}} On November&nbsp;9, senior staff at the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] decided to fly a {{nowr|22-orbit}} mission as {{nowr|MA-9}}.

On July 22, Cooper and Conrad went through a rehearsal of a double launch of Gemini atop a [[Titan II]] booster from [[Launch Complex 19]] and an [[Atlas-Agena]] target vehicle from Launch Complex 14. At the end of the successful test, the erector could not be raised, and the two astronauts had to be retrieved with a [[cherry picker]], an escape device that Cooper had devised for Project Mercury and insisted be retained for Gemini.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Astro TrudyCooper daughters.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cooper's wife Trudy watches the launch of Gemini 5 with their teenage daughters, Cam and Jan]]\nCooper and Conrad wanted to name their spacecraft ''Lady Bird'' after [[Lady Bird Johnson]], the [[First Lady of the United States]], but Webb turned down their request; he wanted to \"depersonalize\" the space program.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|p=113}} Cooper and Conrad then came up with the idea of a [[mission patch]], similar to the organizational emblems worn by military units. The patch was intended to commemorate all the hundreds of people directly involved, not just the astronauts.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|p=115}} Cooper and Conrad chose an embroidered cloth patch sporting the names of the two crew members, a [[Conestoga wagon]], and the slogan \"8 Days or Bust\" which referred to the expected mission duration.<ref name=\"patch1\" /> Webb ultimately approved the design, but insisted on the removal of the slogan from the official version of the patch, feeling it placed too much emphasis on the mission length and not the experiments, and fearing the public might see the mission as a failure if it did not last the full duration.

It eventually stabilized at {{convert|49|N/cm2}}\u2014lower than it had ever been operated at before. While MA-9 had become uncomfortably warm, Gemini 5 became cold.

A computer error had set the Earth's rotation at 360 degrees per day whereas it is actually 360.98. The difference was significant in a spacecraft. The error would have been larger had Cooper not recognized the problem when the reentry gauge indicated that they were too high, and attempted to compensate by increasing the bank angle from 53 to 90 degrees to the left to increase the drag.

Cooper worked closely with the production company, and every line uttered by Quaid was reportedly attributable to Cooper's recollection. Quaid met with Cooper before the casting call and learned his mannerisms.

Cooper learned to fly as a child, and after service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during [[World War II]], he was commissioned into the [[United States Air Force]] in 1949. After service as a fighter pilot, he qualified as a test pilot in 1956, and was selected as an astronaut in 1959.\n\nIn 1963 Cooper piloted the longest and last Mercury spaceflight, [[Mercury-Atlas 9]]. During that 34-hour mission he became the first American to spend an entire day in space, the first to sleep in space, and the last American launched on an entirely solo [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] mission. Despite a series of severe equipment failures, he managed to successfully complete the mission under manual control, guiding his spacecraft, which he named ''[[Faith 7]]'', to a [[splashdown]] just {{convert|4|mi}} ahead of the recovery ship. Cooper became the first astronaut to make a second orbital flight when he flew as Command Pilot of [[Gemini 5]] in 1965. Along with Pilot [[Pete Conrad]], he set a new space endurance record by traveling {{convert|3312993|mi}} in 190 hours and 56 minutes\u2014just short of eight days\u2014showing that astronauts could survive in space for the length of time necessary to go from the Earth to the Moon and back.\n\nCooper liked to race cars and boats, and entered the $28,000 Salton City {{Convert|500|mi|km|abbr=}} boat race, and the Southwest Championship Drag Boat races in 1965, and the 1967 Orange Bowl Regatta with fire fighter [[Red Adair]]. In 1968, he entered the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], but NASA management ordered him to withdraw due to the dangers involved. After serving as backup commander of the [[Apollo 10]] mission, he was superseded by [[Alan Shepard]], and retired from NASA and the Air Force with the rank of [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 1971.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLeroy Gordon Cooper Jr. was born on March 6, 1927, in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]],{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=336}} the only child of Leroy Gordon Cooper Sr. and his wife Hattie Lee {{nee}} Herd.<ref name=40thmerc7 /> His mother was a school teacher.

He joined the [[Oklahoma National Guard]], flying a [[Curtiss JN-4]] biplane, despite never having formal military pilot training.

While in Germany, he attended the European Extension of the [[University of Maryland University College|University of Maryland]]. He returned to the United States in 1954, and studied for two years at the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] (AFIT) in [[Ohio]].

There was no indication what it was about, but his commanding officer, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] Marcus F. Cooper (no relation) recalled an announcement in the newspaper saying that a contract had been awarded to [[McDonnell Aircraft]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to build a space capsule, and advised Cooper not to volunteer for astronaut training. On February 2, 1959, Cooper attended a [[NASA]] briefing on [[Project Mercury]] and the part astronauts would play in it. Cooper went through the selection process with another 109 pilots,{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=7\u201310}} and was not surprised when he was accepted as the youngest of the first seven American astronauts.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=12\u201315}} Others were though; Slayton later recalled that \"When I heard Gordo's name, my first reaction was, something's wrong.

As far as I was concerned, he wasn't even a test pilot.\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=73}}\n\nDuring the selection interviews, Cooper had been asked about his domestic relationship, and had lied, saying that he and Trudy had a good, stable marriage. In fact, she had left him four months before in the wake of a lengthy affair he had with a married woman, and was living with their daughters in San Diego while he occupied a bachelor's quarters at Edwards. Aware that NASA wanted to project an image of its astronauts as loving family men, and that his story would not stand up to scrutiny, he drove down to San Diego to see Trudy at the first opportunity. Lured by the prospect of a great adventure for herself and her daughters, she agreed to go along with the charade and pretend that they were a happily married couple.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nThe identities of the [[Mercury Seven]] were announced at a press conference at [[Dolley Madison House]] in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=274\u2013275}} [[Scott Carpenter]], Gordon Cooper, [[John Glenn]], Gus Grissom, [[Wally Schirra]], [[Alan Shepard]], and [[Deke Slayton]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=42\u201347}} Each was assigned a different portion of the project along with other special assignments. Cooper specialized in the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone rocket]], which would be used for the first, [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]s.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=22\u201323}} He also chaired the Emergency Egress Committee, responsible for working out emergency [[launch pad]] escape procedures,{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=34}} and engaged [[Bo Randall]] to develop a personal [[survival knife]] for astronauts to carry.{{sfn|Cooper et al.|2010|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nThe astronauts drew their salaries as military officers, and an important component of that was flight pay. In Cooper's case, it amounted to $145 a month ({{Inflation|US|145|1959|fmt=eq}}). NASA saw no reason to provide the astronauts with aircraft, so they had to fly to meetings around the country on commercial airlines. To continue earning their flight pay, Grissom and Slayton would go out on the weekend to [[Langley Air Force Base]], and attempt to put in the required four hours a month, competing for T-33 aircraft with senior deskbound colonels and generals. Cooper traveled to [[McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base]] in [[Tennessee]], where a friend let him fly higher-performance F-104B jets. This came up when Cooper had lunch with [[William Hines]], a reporter for ''[[The Washington Star]]'', and was duly reported in the paper. Cooper then discussed the issue with [[Congressman]] [[James G. Fulton]]. The matter was taken up by the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]]. Within weeks the astronauts had priority access to USAF F-102s, something that Cooper considered a \"hot plane\", but which could still take off from and land at short civilian airfields; but it did not make Cooper popular with senior NASA management.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Wolfe|1979|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nAfter [[General Motors]] executive [[Ed Cole]] presented Shepard with a brand-new [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Jim Rathmann]], a racing car driver who won the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1960, and was a Chevrolet dealer in [[Melbourne, Florida]], convinced Cole to turn this into an ongoing marketing campaign. Henceforth, astronauts would be able to lease brand-new Corvettes for a dollar a year. All of the Mercury Seven but Glenn soon took up the offer. Cooper, Grissom and Shepard were soon racing their Corvettes around Cape Canaveral, with the police ignoring their exploits. From a marketing perspective, it was very successful, and helped the highly priced Corvette become established as a desirable brand. Cooper held licenses with the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) and the [[National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing]] (NASCAR).

This well established, long-standing, consistent approach has created a longing for the product that by far \"superseded the desire for that typically associated with a drink to quench one's thirst\" (Dudovskiy, 2015).<ref>{{cite web|author=Dudovskiy, J.|year=2015|title=Coca-Cola Marketing Communications: A Critical Analysis|accessdate=March 1, 2015|website=Research Methodology|url=http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221114805/http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;Direct marketing\nThey have exclusive vendor company partnerships, which eliminates competition, e.g. cinemas and [[restaurants]] only serving Coca-Cola over [[Pepsi]]. At sponsored sporting events, they again eliminate competition by attaining sole sale rights as well as VIP sales opportunities to important clients, for example, [[baseball field]]s.\n\n;Viral marketing\nThe company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Web and social media\nThey set the industry benchmark as the brand so universally recognized that audience building is unnecessary.

The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, Columbia released many popular films including ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', and some others. However, two years after the critical and commercial failure of the 1987 film ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'', Columbia was spun-off and then sold to [[Tokyo]]-based [[Sony]] in 1989.<ref name=\"sellers19971013\"/>\n\n====World of Coca-Cola====\n{{Main|World of Coca-Cola}}\n\nCoca-Cola operates a soft drink themed tourist attraction in Atlanta, Georgia; the [[World of Coca-Cola]] is a multi-storied exhibition.

Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. [[Max Keith]], the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp |title = The Reich Stuff? |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |publisher = [[Snopes]] |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate= May 8, 2014 }}</ref> The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in [[plastic bottle]]s or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.\n\nIn 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to [[7 Up]].\n\n[[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using [[saccharin]] as a [[sugar substitute]]. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of [[Diet Coke]].<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite news|last1=Estes|first1=Adam|title=A Brief History of Racist Soft Drinks|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822013457/http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Last Minute Refreshment.jpg|thumb|right|An ad in Berlin, Germany.]]\nCoca-Cola South Africa also released [[Valpre]] Bottled \"still\" and \"sparkling\" water.\n\nIn 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand.  The tagline was \"Simba \u2013 It Cures the African Thirst.\"\n\nAlso in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale.  Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.\n\n====BreakMate====\n{{Main|BreakMate}}\n\nNo longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and [[Siemens]] in 1988. Intended for use in offices with five to fifty people,<ref>{{cite news |title=Coca-Cola seeping into coffee breaks |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0eEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |publisher=Eugene Register-Guard |date=November 19, 1988 |access-date=March 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403174211/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0eEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO<sub>2</sub> tank.

These included [[Minute Maid]] Juices to Go, [[Powerade]] sports beverage, flavored tea [[Nestea]] (in a joint venture with [[Nestl\u00e9]]), [[Fruitopia]] fruit drink, and [[Dasani]] water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the [[Simply Orange]] brand of juices including [[orange juice]]. In 2016, [[Coca-Cola India]] introduced [[Vio (flavoured milk)|Vio]] to enter into the value-added [[Dairy product|dairy]] category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after [[Soft drink|carbonated beverages]], water and juices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|title=Coca-Cola India Enters Dairy Market With VIO Flavored Milk|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=June 22, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170407143024/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|archive-date=April 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s such as the [[Atkins diet]], Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed [[C2 Cola]]. C2 contains a mix of [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], and [[Acesulfame potassium]]. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the [[food energy]] and [[carbohydrate]]s of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.\n\nStarting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in [[Innocent Drinks]], first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation |last=Neate |first=Rupert |date=February 22, 2013 |title=Coca-Cola takes full control of Innocent |publisher='\u2019[[The Guardian]]'\u2019 |location=London (I believe) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |accessdate=June 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729200236/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavored drink, was launched in France.

The Coca-Cola Company has been faced with multiple lawsuits concerning these various criticisms.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:'96-'02 Chevrolet Express Wagon Coca-Cola.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Chevrolet Express]] van bearing the logo of The Coca-Cola Company.]]\nCoca-Cola advertising has \"been among the most prolific in marketing history\", with a notable and major impact on popular culture and society as a whole.\n\nThe logo, bottle design, and brand image are internationally recognizable. Their product is ranked the number one soft drink, repeatedly, internationally, and has notoriety as the first soft drink consumed by astronauts in space. Coca-Cola employs a diverse range of integrated marketing communications to advertise through direct marketing, web based media, social media, and sales promotions (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author=Stringer, G. |date=2015|title= Case Study: Coca Cola Integrated Marketing Communications|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-study-coca-cola-integrated-marketing-gregory-stringer}}\n</ref>\n\nThe company carefully considers all touch points a consumer (or prospective consumer) has with the brand as potential delivery channels for the brand's message, and makes use of all relevant communication systems. This well established, long-standing, consistent approach has created a longing for the product that by far \"superseded the desire for that typically associated with a drink to quench one's thirst\" (Dudovskiy, 2015).<ref>{{cite web|author=Dudovskiy, J.|year=2015|title=Coca-Cola Marketing Communications: A Critical Analysis|accessdate=March 1, 2015|website=Research Methodology|url=http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221114805/http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;Direct marketing\nThey have exclusive vendor company partnerships, which eliminates competition, e.g. cinemas and [[restaurants]] only serving Coca-Cola over [[Pepsi]]. At sponsored sporting events, they again eliminate competition by attaining sole sale rights as well as VIP sales opportunities to important clients, for example, [[baseball field]]s.\n\n;Viral marketing\nThe company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Web and social media\nThey set the industry benchmark as the brand so universally recognized that audience building is unnecessary.

The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, Columbia released many popular films including ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', and some others.

Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. [[Max Keith]], the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp |title = The Reich Stuff? |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |publisher = [[Snopes]] |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate= May 8, 2014 }}</ref> The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in [[plastic bottle]]s or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.\n\nIn 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to [[7 Up]].\n\n[[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using [[saccharin]] as a [[sugar substitute]]. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of [[Diet Coke]].<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite news|last1=Estes|first1=Adam|title=A Brief History of Racist Soft Drinks|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822013457/http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Last Minute Refreshment.jpg|thumb|right|An ad in Berlin, Germany.]]\nCoca-Cola South Africa also released [[Valpre]] Bottled \"still\" and \"sparkling\" water.\n\nIn 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand.  The tagline was \"Simba \u2013 It Cures the African Thirst.\"\n\nAlso in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale.  Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.\n\n====BreakMate====\n{{Main|BreakMate}}\n\nNo longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and [[Siemens]] in 1988.

These included [[Minute Maid]] Juices to Go, [[Powerade]] sports beverage, flavored tea [[Nestea]] (in a joint venture with [[Nestl\u00e9]]), [[Fruitopia]] fruit drink, and [[Dasani]] water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the [[Simply Orange]] brand of juices including [[orange juice]]. In 2016, [[Coca-Cola India]] introduced [[Vio (flavoured milk)|Vio]] to enter into the value-added [[Dairy product|dairy]] category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after [[Soft drink|carbonated beverages]], water and juices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|title=Coca-Cola India Enters Dairy Market With VIO Flavored Milk|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=June 22, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170407143024/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|archive-date=April 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s such as the [[Atkins diet]], Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed [[C2 Cola]]. C2 contains a mix of [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], and [[Acesulfame potassium]]. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the [[food energy]] and [[carbohydrate]]s of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.\n\nStarting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in [[Innocent Drinks]], first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation |last=Neate |first=Rupert |date=February 22, 2013 |title=Coca-Cola takes full control of Innocent |publisher='\u2019[[The Guardian]]'\u2019 |location=London (I believe) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |accessdate=June 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729200236/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavored drink, was launched in France.
