{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station.

Her father, [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], who hailed from [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[New York (state)|New York]], was of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Between the world wars he was the chief engineer for the [[New York State]] Department of Public Works, and during [[World War II]] rejoined the [[United States Army]] to become Deputy Commanding General of the [[Manhattan Project]]. Vucanovich's mother, Maria Ynez White, was of [[English people|English]] and [[Hispanic people|Hispanic]] ancestry from [[southern California]], with her maternal grandmother having been a Mexican who became a U.S. citizen upon the transfer of California to the United States in 1848.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8776562/maria-jesus-shorb] FindAGrave.com. Retrieved February 14, 2019.</ref>\n\nVucanovich grew up in the capital city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York. She married James Henry Bugden at the age of 18 but became separated when her husband was assigned overseas during the war. She was employed by several New York businesses during the 1940s. In 1949, she moved to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada and obtained a divorce. In 1950 she married Kenneth Dillon, a founding partner in the law firm Vargas, Dillon, and Bartlett. Their children were [[Patricia Dillon Cafferata|Patricia]], Michael, Kenneth, Thomas, and Susan. Widowed in 1964, she married George Vucanovich in 1965. They met while working on [[Paul Laxalt]]'s unsuccessful campaign in 1964 for the [[U.S. Senate]].<ref name=\"background\">{{cite book|title=Barbara F. Vucanovich|author=Patricia D. Cafferata|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=2005|pages=1\u201326, 153\u2013231}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nVucanovich's second husband, Ken Dillon, introduced her to Nevada Republican politics in the 1950s, when the party was slowly building after decades of minority status. Dillon introduced her to [[Paul Laxalt]], then a young [[district attorney]] from [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. After working on Laxalt's [[governor of Nevada|gubernatorial]] campaigns and his razor-close win in the senatorial election over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Harry Reid]] in 1974, Vucanovich was hired as the district director for the newly elected Senator. When Nevada was split into two congressional districts after [[1980 United States Census]], Laxalt urged Vucanovich to run for the 2nd District, which included the entire state outside of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].\n\nShe won her first term with the slogan, \"What Congress needs is a tough grandmother.\"<ref name=legacy/> Her tenure extended from 1983 until her retirement in 1997. She faced serious opposition once, in 1992, when [[Bill Clinton]] won the [[United States Electoral College|electoral vote]]s of Nevada over [[George Herbert Walker Bush]], Vucanovich's choice. She won just 48% of the vote to 43% to Reno mayor Pete Sferrazza. Shortly after taking office in 1983, she was diagnosed and had surgery for [[breast cancer]]. Motivated in part by her own experience, Vucanovich supported funding for early screening, detection and treatment of breast cancer. She supported equal pay and equal treatment for women. She was a supporter of [[capital punishment]].<ref name=legacy/>\n\nVucanovich served for many years on the House Interior Committee, of which she eventually became the ranking Republican on the Mining and Minerals Subcommittee. She also served on the [[House Administration Committee]] until her appointment in 1991 to the Appropriations Committee.

She won just 48% of the vote to 43% to Reno mayor Pete Sferrazza. Shortly after taking office in 1983, she was diagnosed and had surgery for [[breast cancer]].

The article stated:<blockquote>When the Jordanian nationalist, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, allegedly shot Kennedy, ostensibly because of the senator's advocacy of U.S. support for Israel, the crime with which he was charged was in essence another manifestation of the centuries-old hatred between Arab and Jew.<ref>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 6, 1968|accessdate=September 9, 2009|title=Yorty Reveals That Suspect's Memo Set Deadline for Death|first=Jerry | last= Cohen| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/512460622.html?dids=512460622:512460622&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+6%2C+1968&author=JERRY+COHEN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281886-Current+File%29&edition=&startpage=0_1&desc=Yorty+Reveals+That+Suspect%27s+Memo+Set+Deadline+for+Death|page=Front Page|location=Los Angeles, Calif.}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[M.T.

Brown has stated that the unknown woman then took Sirhan into the pantry, which Sirhan described in his prison memory sessions as a dark room at the hotel, and that while in the pantry the woman gave Sirhan a post-hypnotic cue to fire a gun in Kennedy's direction minutes later. Sirhan was immediately subdued by several men in the pantry as Kennedy fell to the floor fatally wounded. Sirhan has claimed that after having coffee with the woman, the next thing he can remember is being choked and unable to breathe moments after the Kennedy shooting, stating: \"It's all vague now. I'm sure you all have it in your records. I can't deny it or confirm it.

[[Transport for London]] (TfL) is responsible for the charge which has been operated by [[IBM]] since 2009. During the first ten years since the introduction of the scheme, gross revenue reached about \u00a32.6&nbsp;billion up to the end of December 2013. From 2003 to 2013, about \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion has been invested in public transport, road and bridge improvement and walking and cycling schemes. Of these, a total of \u00a3960&nbsp;million was invested on improvements to the bus network.\n\n[[File:Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport).png|300px|thumb|Numbers of people using different transport types in the City of London in 2017 against the road space used by that type.<ref>http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/documents/s91800/Appendix+1+-+Traffic+in+the+City+2018.pdf</ref>]]\nThe congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment>{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/cc-changes-march-2014/user_uploads/cc-impact-assessment.pdf |title=Public and stakeholder consultation on a Variation Order to modify the Congestion Charging scheme Impact Assessment |author=Transport for London (TfL) |publisher=TfL |date=January 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2015 |format=PDF}} ''See pp. 12: Traffic volume, speed and congestion.''</ref>\n\nThe Congestion Charge was suspended on 23 March 2020 for an indefinite period of time in order to facilitate travel around the city for critical workers during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus public health crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/coronavirus-transport-london-congestion-charge-suspended-ulez-lez-a9418356.html|title=TfL suspends congestion charge, ULEZ and LEZ amid coronavirus outbreak|date=2020-03-23|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Present scheme ==\n\n=== Boundary ===\n[[File:London Congestion Charge Zone since 2011.png|thumb|left|The boundary of the current Congestion Charging zone.]]\n{{Multiple image | direction = horizontal | align = right| image1 =London CC 12 2012 5045.JPG| width1 = 145\n| caption1 =Sign indicating the entrance of congestion charge area.| image2 = London CC 12 2012 5018b.jpg| width2 = 145\n| caption2 =Sign indicating the exit of congestion charge area.}}\nThe current congestion charge zone covers the area within the [[London Inner Ring Road]] which includes both the [[City of London]], which is the main financial district, and also the [[West End of London|West End]], which is London's primary commercial and entertainment centre.<ref name=\"What it is\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |title=Congestion Charging: in London \u2013 What it is |work=BBC News |year=2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412122132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |archivedate=12 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Although primarily a commercial area, there are also 136,000 residents, out of a total [[Greater London]] population of almost 9,000,000.

This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7109727.stm |title=Congestion charge 'not working' |date=23 February 2007 |work=BBC News   |accessdate=23 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429041334/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7109727.stm |archivedate=29 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.<ref name=\"bbc20070711\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1454446/London-congestion-charge-not-working.html |title=London congestion charge 'not working' |first=Paul |last=Marston |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph News and Media Limited |date=16 February 2004 |accessdate=24 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nTfL reported in January 2014, that despite a reduction of traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment/>\n\n=== Air quality ===\nThe pre-commencement report from TfL noted that the scheme wasn't expected to significantly affect [[air quality]], but that offering a discount to encourage the use of greener fuels would be a positive measure.<ref name=\"tflprereport\" />\n\nTfL reported that levels of [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO<sub>X</sub>), fell by 13.4% between 2002 and 2003, and carbon dioxide, as well as the levels of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulates]] (PM10) within and alongside the [[Inner Ring Road, London|Inner Ring Road]] boundary of the zone.<ref name=\"tfljune2006\" />\n\nSince 2002, the [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) produced by [[diesel exhaust]] has become a serious problem, with the [[London Air Quality Network]] of [[King's College London]] reporting that the annual mean NO<sub>2</sub> objective (of 40 \u03bcgm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006.

It notes that lower vehicles emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality as vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along industrial sources and that weather conditions play a significant role, and that pollutant concentrations were being affected by changes in the make up of the vehicle fleet.  It also suggests that the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" />\n\nA 2011 independent study published by the [[Health Effects Institute]] (HEI), and led by a researcher from [[King's College London]], found that there is little evidence the congestion charge scheme has improved air quality.

[[Transport for London]] (TfL) is responsible for the charge which has been operated by [[IBM]] since 2009. During the first ten years since the introduction of the scheme, gross revenue reached about \u00a32.6&nbsp;billion up to the end of December 2013. From 2003 to 2013, about \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion has been invested in public transport, road and bridge improvement and walking and cycling schemes. Of these, a total of \u00a3960&nbsp;million was invested on improvements to the bus network.\n\n[[File:Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport).png|300px|thumb|Numbers of people using different transport types in the City of London in 2017 against the road space used by that type.<ref>http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/documents/s91800/Appendix+1+-+Traffic+in+the+City+2018.pdf</ref>]]\nThe congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment>{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/cc-changes-march-2014/user_uploads/cc-impact-assessment.pdf |title=Public and stakeholder consultation on a Variation Order to modify the Congestion Charging scheme Impact Assessment |author=Transport for London (TfL) |publisher=TfL |date=January 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2015 |format=PDF}} ''See pp. 12: Traffic volume, speed and congestion.''</ref>\n\nThe Congestion Charge was suspended on 23 March 2020 for an indefinite period of time in order to facilitate travel around the city for critical workers during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus public health crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/coronavirus-transport-london-congestion-charge-suspended-ulez-lez-a9418356.html|title=TfL suspends congestion charge, ULEZ and LEZ amid coronavirus outbreak|date=2020-03-23|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Present scheme ==\n\n=== Boundary ===\n[[File:London Congestion Charge Zone since 2011.png|thumb|left|The boundary of the current Congestion Charging zone.]]\n{{Multiple image | direction = horizontal | align = right| image1 =London CC 12 2012 5045.JPG| width1 = 145\n| caption1 =Sign indicating the entrance of congestion charge area.| image2 = London CC 12 2012 5018b.jpg| width2 = 145\n| caption2 =Sign indicating the exit of congestion charge area.}}\nThe current congestion charge zone covers the area within the [[London Inner Ring Road]] which includes both the [[City of London]], which is the main financial district, and also the [[West End of London|West End]], which is London's primary commercial and entertainment centre.<ref name=\"What it is\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |title=Congestion Charging: in London \u2013 What it is |work=BBC News |year=2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412122132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |archivedate=12 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Although primarily a commercial area, there are also 136,000 residents, out of a total [[Greater London]] population of almost 9,000,000.

This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7109727.stm |title=Congestion charge 'not working' |date=23 February 2007 |work=BBC News   |accessdate=23 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429041334/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7109727.stm |archivedate=29 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.<ref name=\"bbc20070711\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1454446/London-congestion-charge-not-working.html |title=London congestion charge 'not working' |first=Paul |last=Marston |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph News and Media Limited |date=16 February 2004 |accessdate=24 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nTfL reported in January 2014, that despite a reduction of traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment/>\n\n=== Air quality ===\nThe pre-commencement report from TfL noted that the scheme wasn't expected to significantly affect [[air quality]], but that offering a discount to encourage the use of greener fuels would be a positive measure.<ref name=\"tflprereport\" />\n\nTfL reported that levels of [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO<sub>X</sub>), fell by 13.4% between 2002 and 2003, and carbon dioxide, as well as the levels of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulates]] (PM10) within and alongside the [[Inner Ring Road, London|Inner Ring Road]] boundary of the zone.<ref name=\"tfljune2006\" />\n\nSince 2002, the [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) produced by [[diesel exhaust]] has become a serious problem, with the [[London Air Quality Network]] of [[King's College London]] reporting that the annual mean NO<sub>2</sub> objective (of 40 \u03bcgm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006.

It notes that lower vehicles emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality as vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along industrial sources and that weather conditions play a significant role, and that pollutant concentrations were being affected by changes in the make up of the vehicle fleet.  It also suggests that the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" />\n\nA 2011 independent study published by the [[Health Effects Institute]] (HEI), and led by a researcher from [[King's College London]], found that there is little evidence the congestion charge scheme has improved air quality.

His teammate Vettel stayed out longer and when he eventually pitted, he came out ahead of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and went on to win his 3rd race of the season and extended his championship lead to 25 points over Hamilton, who finished in 7th in a recovery drive after his poor qualifying. This win gave Ferrari their first 1-2 finish since the controversial [[2010 German Grand Prix]]. Daniel Ricciardo finished in 3rd, despite lightly hitting the wall late in the race, jumping both Bottas and Verstappen by staying out longer on the ultra-softs in a strategy akin to Sebastian Vettel. Carlos Sainz had his best finish of the year with 6th for Toro Rosso. He was followed by Hamilton, Grosjean, Massa and Magnussen, who rounded off the points. It was the first time in Haas' history that they achieved a double points finish. It was also the first time in 2017 that both Force Indias finished out of the points with a late collision between P\u00e9rez and Kvyat, while running in the points, sent P\u00e9rez to last and Kvyat out of the race. Stoffel Vandoorne looked set to score McLaren's first points of the season before hitting the wall after being forced onto the breaking up asphalt by Sergio P\u00e9rez. Jenson Button, meanwhile, retired with suspension damage on his one-off return, much like his original retirement in the [[2016 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]], after colliding with Sauber's [[Pascal Wehrlein]], leaving Wehrlein perched up vertically on the wall. The other Sauber of [[Marcus Ericsson]] retired after hitting the wall at turn 1 under the safety car.

Free practice eventually resumed with 4 minutes remaining. [[Daniel Ricciardo]] had a brake-by-wire failure and ended up retiring from the session, leaving him sixth with 1:13.392. [[McLaren]] driver [[Jenson Button]] ended the session in twelfth, but incurred a 15-place grid penalty for changing the [[MGU-H]] and [[turbocharger]], which would be applied after qualifying.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nFerrari's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen qualified on pole position for the first time in 9 years; his last pole position came at the [[2008 French Grand Prix]], also for Ferrari. His teammate and championship leader [[Sebastian Vettel]] qualified second, followed by [[Valtteri Bottas]] and [[Max Verstappen]]. Vettel's closest rival, Lewis Hamilton, qualified in fourteenth; he struggled warming up the tyres and his final flying lap in Q2 was impeded by [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] who had crashed towards the end of the session. Despite Vandoorne's accident, both McLarens had made it into Q3 for the first time in 2017; Jenson Button qualified in ninth place on his return, but due to his fifteen-place grid penalty would start from the back of the grid, and eventually opted to start from the pit lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/5/qualifying---raikkonen-heads-all-ferrari-front-row-in-monaco.html|title=Qualifying - Raikkonen heads all-Ferrari front row in Monaco|website=Formula1.com|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Race===\nR\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen led from the start until he pitted on lap 33. His teammate Vettel stayed out longer and when he eventually pitted, he came out ahead of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and went on to win his 3rd race of the season and extended his championship lead to 25 points over Hamilton, who finished in 7th in a recovery drive after his poor qualifying. This win gave Ferrari their first 1-2 finish since the controversial [[2010 German Grand Prix]]. Daniel Ricciardo finished in 3rd, despite lightly hitting the wall late in the race, jumping both Bottas and Verstappen by staying out longer on the ultra-softs in a strategy akin to Sebastian Vettel. Carlos Sainz had his best finish of the year with 6th for Toro Rosso. He was followed by Hamilton, Grosjean, Massa and Magnussen, who rounded off the points. It was the first time in Haas' history that they achieved a double points finish. It was also the first time in 2017 that both Force Indias finished out of the points with a late collision between P\u00e9rez and Kvyat, while running in the points, sent P\u00e9rez to last and Kvyat out of the race. Stoffel Vandoorne looked set to score McLaren's first points of the season before hitting the wall after being forced onto the breaking up asphalt by Sergio P\u00e9rez. Jenson Button, meanwhile, retired with suspension damage on his one-off return, much like his original retirement in the [[2016 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]], after colliding with Sauber's [[Pascal Wehrlein]], leaving Wehrlein perched up vertically on the wall. The other Sauber of [[Marcus Ericsson]] retired after hitting the wall at turn 1 under the safety car. The Renault of [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] retired early on with a gearbox failure, while running in 10th. [[Lance Stroll]] was another retiree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/5/race-monaco-win-extends-vettels-championship-lead.html|title=Race - Monaco win extends

Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint.\n:\u2014Surah Baqarah 2:183</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>(Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (Should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (With hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.\n:\u2014Surah Baqarah 2:184</blockquote>\n\n== Prohibitions during Ramadan ==\n[[File:Taipei Grand Mosque - Fast Break.JPG|thumb|Fast break at [[Taipei Grand Mosque]] in [[Taiwan]]]]\n\nEating, drinking, and sexual relations are not allowed between [[dawn]] (''[[fajr]]''), and [[sunset]] (''[[maghrib]]''). Fasting is considered an act of deeply personal worship in which Muslims seek a raised level of closeness to God.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, angry/sarcastic retorts, gossip, and are meant to try to get along with each other better than normal. All obscene and irreligious stimuli are to be avoided as purity of both thought and action is important.\n\n===Exceptions===\nFasting during Ramadan is not obligatory for several groups for whom it would be excessively problematic, among them people with a medical condition<ref name=CNN>{{cite web |title=The insider's guide to Ramadan |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/25/insider.ramadan/index.html |accessdate=15 August 2010 |publisher=[[CNN International]] |date=25 September 2006}}</ref> and the elderly.\n\nPre-pubescent children are not required to fast,<ref name=CNN/> though some choose to do so, and some small children fast for half a day to train themselves. If puberty is delayed, fasting becomes obligatory for males and females after a certain age. [[Diabetes|Diabetics]] and [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] or [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women are usually not expected to fast. According to a [[hadith]], observing the Ramadan fast is forbidden for [[menstruation|menstruating]] women.\n\nOther individuals for whom it is usually considered acceptable not to fast are those in battle, and travellers who intend to spend fewer than five days away from home. If the circumstance preventing fasting is temporary, a person is required to make up for the missed days after the month of Ramadan is over and before the next Ramadan arrives. Should the circumstance be permanent or present for an extended amount of time, one may recompense by feeding a needy person for every day missed.\n\nIf one does not fit into any category of exemption and breaks the fast out of forgetfulness, the fast is still valid. Intentionally breaking the fast voids it, and the person must make up for the entire day later. If one breaks the fast intentionally or through consensual sexual intercourse, the transgressor must make up for the day by fasting for sixty consecutive days, freeing a slave or feeding sixty people in need.<ref name=CNN/>\n\nDuring a 2013 [[poliomyelitis]] [[Poliomyelitis eradication#2013|outbreak]] in [[Somalia]], some groups of aid workers were granted an exemption for the [[oral polio vaccine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=203601730|title=Polio Eradication Suffers A Setback As Somali Outbreak Worsens|website=Npr.org|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Breaking the fast==\n[[File:Date-seller.jpg|thumb|Muslims traditionally break their fasts in Ramadan with [[Date palm#Fruit|dates]] (like those offered by this date seller in [[Kuwait City]]), as was the recorded practice ([[Sunnah]]) of [[Muhammad]].]]\nMany [[mosque]]s will provide [[iftar]] (literally: breakfast) meals after sundown for the community to come and end their day's fasting as a whole. It is also common for such meals to take place at Muslim [[soup kitchen]]s. The fast is broken with a date (when possible) following the tradition of Muhammad, or with water.\n\n==Rulings for a fasting person==\nLinguistically, the word fasting in the Arabic language means unconditional 'restraint' (imsak) from any action or speech during any time.\nAccording to the Sacred Law, fasting is the act of:\n\n=== refraining from entering anything into the body cavity; ===\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>refraining from engaging in sexual activity;\n</li>\n<li>refraining from immoral acts such as backbiting;\n</li>\n<li>from the time the sun begins to rise to the time the sun sets; </li>\n<li>accompanied with the intention of fasting; </li>\n<li>from individuals who are permitted to fast.</li>\n</ol>\n\n'Refraining from engaging in sexual activity' includes actual sexual intercourse and ejaculation caused by foreplay. 'Refraining from entering anything into the body cavity' refers to the acts of entering food, drink, or medicine into the body cavity, regardless of whether this is a typical item one would enter into the body cavity or not. Entering any of these substances inside the body cavity means that the substance enters into the throat, the intestines, the stomach, or the brain by way of the nose, the throat, the private parts, or open wounds. 'Whether deliberately or accidentally' excludes forgetful acts of eating, drinking, or sexual activity. 'From the time the sun begins to rise to the time the sun sets' refers to the true entering of the Fajr time to the entering of the Maghrib time. 'Accompanied with the intention of fasting' means that one must intend to fast in order to distinguish if one is really performing an act of worship or not when one refrains from eating, drinking, or having sexual intercourse. For example, if one were to merely stay away from food, drink, or sexual activity without an intention to fast, then this fast is not valid and does not count. 'From individuals who are permitted to fast' means that one must be free from a situation that would prevent the validity of one's fast, such as menstruation or lochia (post-natal bleeding).[Shurunbulali, Maraqi al-Falah; Ala al-Din Abidin, al-Hadiyya al-Alaiyya; Shurunbulali Imdad al-Fattah]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://central-mosque.com/index.php/Ramadhan/fiqh-of-fasting.html|title=Fiqh of Ramadhan & Fasting - Ramadhan - Fiqh|first=Central-Mosque|last=Administrator|website=central-mosque.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Differences in how Sunnis, Shias, and Sufis Observe Ramadan ==\nFor the most part, Sunnis and Shia\u2019s observe Ramadan the same way, but there are some differences. For one, Sunnis break their fast at sunset, once the sun is no longer visible, but there is still light in the sky. However, for Shias they wait to break after it gets completely dark. Shia Muslims also celebrate an additional holiday that Sunnis do not. They celebrate for three days (on the 19th, 20th, and 21st) to commemorate Ali, the son in law of Muhammad that was assented by rebels. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/world/cat55/sub358/item1441.html|title=RAMADAN: MEANINGS, TIMING AND EXPECTATIONS {{!}} Facts and Details|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nSufi Muslims have some variations on how they observe Ramadan and what it means to them.

Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint.\n:\u2014Surah Baqarah 2:183</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>(Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (Should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (With hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.\n:\u2014Surah Baqarah 2:184</blockquote>\n\n== Prohibitions during Ramadan ==\n[[File:Taipei Grand Mosque - Fast Break.JPG|thumb|Fast break at [[Taipei Grand Mosque]] in [[Taiwan]]]]\n\nEating, drinking, and sexual relations are not allowed between [[dawn]] (''[[fajr]]''), and [[sunset]] (''[[maghrib]]''). Fasting is considered an act of deeply personal worship in which Muslims seek a raised level of closeness to God.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, angry/sarcastic retorts, gossip, and are meant to try to get along with each other better than normal. All obscene and irreligious stimuli are to be avoided as purity of both thought and action is important.\n\n===Exceptions===\nFasting during Ramadan is not obligatory for several groups for whom it would be excessively problematic, among them people with a medical condition<ref name=CNN>{{cite web |title=The insider's guide to Ramadan |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/25/insider.ramadan/index.html |accessdate=15 August 2010 |publisher=[[CNN International]] |date=25 September 2006}}</ref> and the elderly.\n\nPre-pubescent children are not required to fast,<ref name=CNN/> though some choose to do so, and some small children fast for half a day to train themselves. If puberty is delayed, fasting becomes obligatory for males and females after a certain age. [[Diabetes|Diabetics]] and [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] or [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women are usually not expected to fast. According to a [[hadith]], observing the Ramadan fast is forbidden for [[menstruation|menstruating]] women.\n\nOther individuals for whom it is usually considered acceptable not to fast are those in battle, and travellers who intend to spend fewer than five days away from home. If the circumstance preventing fasting is temporary, a person is required to make up for the missed days after the month of Ramadan is over and before the next Ramadan arrives. Should the circumstance be permanent or present for an extended amount of time, one may recompense by feeding a needy person for every day missed.\n\nIf one does not fit into any category of exemption and breaks the fast out of forgetfulness, the fast is still valid. Intentionally breaking the fast voids it, and the person must make up for the entire day later. If one breaks the fast intentionally or through consensual sexual intercourse, the transgressor must make up for the day by fasting for sixty consecutive days, freeing a slave or feeding sixty people in need.<ref name=CNN/>\n\nDuring a 2013 [[poliomyelitis]] [[Poliomyelitis eradication#2013|outbreak]] in [[Somalia]], some groups of aid workers were granted an exemption for the [[oral polio vaccine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=203601730|title=Polio Eradication Suffers A Setback As Somali Outbreak Worsens|website=Npr.org|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Breaking the fast==\n[[File:Date-seller.jpg|thumb|Muslims traditionally break their fasts in Ramadan with [[Date palm#Fruit|dates]] (like those offered by this date seller in [[Kuwait City]]), as was the recorded practice ([[Sunnah]]) of [[Muhammad]].]]\nMany [[mosque]]s will provide [[iftar]] (literally: breakfast) meals after sundown for the community to come and end their day's fasting as a whole. It is also common for such meals to take place at Muslim [[soup kitchen]]s. The fast is broken with a date (when possible) following the tradition of Muhammad, or with water.\n\n==Rulings for a fasting person==\nLinguistically, the word fasting in the Arabic language means unconditional 'restraint' (imsak) from any action or speech during any time.\nAccording to the Sacred Law, fasting is the act of:\n\n=== refraining from entering anything into the body cavity; ===\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>refraining from engaging in sexual activity;\n</li>\n<li>refraining from immoral acts such as backbiting;\n</li>\n<li>from the time the sun begins to rise to the time the sun sets; </li>\n<li>accompanied with the intention of fasting; </li>\n<li>from individuals who are permitted to fast.</li>\n</ol>\n\n'Refraining from engaging in sexual activity' includes actual sexual intercourse and ejaculation caused by foreplay. 'Refraining from entering anything into the body cavity' refers to the acts of entering food, drink, or medicine into the body cavity, regardless of whether this is a typical item one would enter into the body cavity or not. Entering any of these substances inside the body cavity means that the substance enters into the throat, the intestines, the stomach, or the brain by way of the nose, the throat, the private parts, or open wounds. 'Whether deliberately or accidentally' excludes forgetful acts of eating, drinking, or sexual activity. 'From the time the sun begins to rise to the time the sun sets' refers to the true entering of the Fajr time to the entering of the Maghrib time. 'Accompanied with the intention of fasting' means that one must intend to fast in order to distinguish if one is really performing an act of worship or not when one refrains from eating, drinking, or having sexual intercourse. For example, if one were to merely stay away from food, drink, or sexual activity without an intention to fast, then this fast is not valid and does not count. 'From individuals who are permitted to fast' means that one must be free from a situation that would prevent the validity of one's fast, such as menstruation or lochia (post-natal bleeding).[Shurunbulali, Maraqi al-Falah; Ala al-Din Abidin, al-Hadiyya al-Alaiyya; Shurunbulali Imdad al-Fattah]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://central-mosque.com/index.php/Ramadhan/fiqh-of-fasting.html|title=Fiqh of Ramadhan & Fasting - Ramadhan - Fiqh|first=Central-Mosque|last=Administrator|website=central-mosque.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Differences in how Sunnis, Shias, and Sufis Observe Ramadan ==\nFor the most part, Sunnis and Shia\u2019s observe Ramadan the same way, but there are some differences. For one, Sunnis break their fast at sunset, once the sun is no longer visible, but there is still light in the sky. However, for Shias they wait to break after it gets completely dark. Shia Muslims also celebrate an additional holiday that Sunnis do not. They celebrate for three days (on the 19th, 20th, and 21st) to commemorate Ali, the son in law of Muhammad that was assented by rebels. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/world/cat55/sub358/item1441.html|title=RAMADAN: MEANINGS, TIMING AND EXPECTATIONS {{!}} Facts and Details|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nSufi Muslims have some variations on how they observe Ramadan and what it means to them. They follow the same rules when fasting, but they recite extra prayers at midnight. The practice they do is called Dhikr, where they chant God\u2019s name 99 times. This is done because they want to show their love for God and seek a personal relationship with God, as opposed to fearing God's wrath. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2009-08-23-0908230158-story.html|title=Taking the extra step at Ramadan|last=REPORTER|first=Manya A.

The Germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]]. The first of these branches survives in modern [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], all of which are descended from [[Old Norse]]. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as [[English language|English]], German, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Yiddish]], [[Afrikaans]], and others.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}} \n[[File:Germanic Languages Map Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Germanic languages]] in Europe]]\nWithin the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] lines (running through [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]-[[D\u00fcsseldorf-Benrath|Benrath]] and [[Krefeld]]-[[Uerdingen]], respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the [[High German consonant shift]] (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as [[High German languages|High German]] dialects ''(nos. 29\u201334 on the map)'', while those spoken to the north comprise the [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] ''(nos. 19\u201324)'' and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] ''(no. 25)'' dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as [[Irminones|Irminonic]], [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]], and [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]], respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}}\n\n[[Standard German]] is based on a combination of [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] and Upper Franconian and Bavarian dialects, which are [[Central German]] and Upper German dialects, belonging to the Irminonic [[High German languages|High German]] dialect group ''(nos. 29\u201334)''. German is therefore closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (based on [[Central Franconian dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 29''), and [[Yiddish]]. Also closely related to Standard German are the [[Upper German]] dialects spoken in the southern [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]], such as [[Swiss German]] ([[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 34''), and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the [[France|French]] [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Grand Est]], such as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (mainly Alemannic, but also Central- and&nbsp;[[High Franconian German|Upper Franconian]]&nbsp;''(no. 32)''&nbsp;dialects) and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (Central Franconian \u2013 ''no. 29'').\n\nAfter these High German dialects, standard German is (somewhat less closely) related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g. Dutch and Afrikaans) or Low German/Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern [[Germany]] and southern [[Denmark]]), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages\u2014[[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] (spoken in [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] \u2013 ''no. 28''), [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] (spoken in [[Saterland]] \u2013 ''no. 27''), and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] (spoken in [[Friesland]] \u2013 ''no. 26'')\u2014as well as the Anglic languages of [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]. These [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] dialects are all members of the Ingvaeonic family of West Germanic languages which did not take part in the High German consonant shift.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of German}}\n\n=== Old High German ===\n{{Main|Old High German}}\n\nThe [[History of German|history of the German language]] begins with the [[High German consonant shift]] during the [[migration period]], which separated [[Old High German]] (OHG) dialects from [[Old Saxon]]. This [[Sound change|sound shift]] involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless [[stop consonant]]s (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', and ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following:\n* Voiceless stops became long ([[Gemination|geminated]]) voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] following a vowel\n* Voiceless stops became [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] in word-initial position, or following certain consonants\n* Voiced stops became voiceless in certain phonetic settings.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Voiceless stop<br />following a vowel\n!Word-initial<br />voiceless stop\n!Voiced stop\n|-\n|/p/\u2192/ff/\n|/p/\u2192/pf/\n|/b/\u2192/p/\n|-\n|/t/\u2192/ss/\n|/t/\u2192/ts/\n|/d/\u2192/t/\n|-\n|/k/\u2192/xx/\n|/k/\u2192/kx/\n|/g/\u2192/k/\n|}\nWhile there is written evidence of the [[Old High German]] language in several [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions from as early as the 6th century AD (such as the [[Pforzen buckle]]), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the ''[[Abrogans]]'' (written c.765\u2013775), a Latin-German [[glossary]] supplying over 3,000 OHG words with their [[Latin]] equivalents. Following the ''Abrogans'' the first coherent works written in OHG appear in the 9th century, chief among them being the ''[[Muspilli]]'', the ''[[Merseburg Charms]]'', and the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', as well as a number of other religious texts (the ''[[Georgslied]]'', the ''[[Ludwigslied]]'', the ''Evangelienbuch'', and translated hymns and prayers).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}<ref name=\"Calvin1909\">{{Cite book |title=An Anthology of German Literature |last=Calvin |first=Thomas |publisher=D.

Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the ''Hildebrandslied'', a secular [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of [[Old Saxon]] and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the [[Alemanni|Alamanni]], [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]], and [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group ([[Irminones]]), which had settled in what is now southern-central [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] between the 2nd and 6th centuries during the great migration.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n\nIn general, the surviving texts of OHG show a wide range of [[dialect]]al diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}} At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.\n\nThe German language through the OHG period was still predominantly a spoken language, with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive [[Oral literature|oral]] tradition than a written one. Having just emerged from the High German consonant shift, OHG was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[Syntax|syntactic]] changes. The scarcity of written work, instability of the language, and widespread illiteracy of the time thus account for the lack of [[Standard language|standardization]] up to the end of the OHG period in 1050.\n\n=== Middle High German ===\n\n[[File:AlthochdeutscheSprachr\u00e4ume962 Box.jpg|upright|thumb|The Germanic-speaking area of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around AD 962.\n----\n{{legend|#B298C4|Old Frisian ({{lang|de|Alt-Friesisch}})}}\n{{legend|#DB9564|Old Saxon ({{lang|de|Alt-S\u00e4chsisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE8741|Old Franconian ({{lang|de|Alt-Fr\u00e4nkisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FCC54B|Old Alemannic ({{lang|de|Alt-Alemannisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE9A2C|Old Bavarian ({{lang|de|Alt-Bairisch}})}}\n]]\n{{Main|Middle High German}}\n\nWhile there is no complete agreement over the dates of the [[Middle High German]] (MHG) period, it is generally seen as lasting from 1050 to 1350.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/zurgeschichtede02schegoog|title=Zur Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache|last=Scherer|first=Wilhelm|last2=Jankowsky|first2=Kurt R.|date=1995|publisher=Amsterdam; Philadelphia: J.

Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into [[Slavs|Slavic]] territory (this is known as the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'').

While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes, leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.\n\nWhile the major changes of the MHG period were socio-cultural, German was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax, phonetics, and morphology as well (e.g. [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]] of certain vowel sounds: ''hus'' (OHG \"house\")''\u2192haus'' (MHG), and weakening of unstressed short vowels to [[schwa]] [\u0259]: ''taga'' (OHG \"days\")\u2192''tage'' (MHG)).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of German : what the past reveals about today's language|last=Salmons|first=Joe|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969793-9|edition=1st|location=Oxford|page=195|oclc=811323307}}</ref>\n\nA great wealth of texts survives from the MHG period. Significantly, among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works, such as the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the story of the [[dragon]]-slayer [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] ({{circa}} 13th century), and the ''[[Iwein]],'' an [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] verse poem by [[Hartmann von Aue]] ({{circa}} 1203), as well as several [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and courtly romances such as ''[[Parzival]]'' and ''[[Tristan]]''. Also noteworthy is the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', the first book of laws written in [[Middle Low German|Middle ''Low'' German]] ({{circa}} 1220). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.\n\nThe Middle High German period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of [[Europe]] in the [[Black Death]] of 1346\u20131353.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Early New High German ===\n{{Main|Early New High German}}\n\n[[File:Deutsch-Niederl\u00e4ndischer Sprachraum (nach Werner K\u00f6nig).png|thumb|upright=1.36|left|German-Dutch language area before and after the [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)]] from much of eastern and central Europe.

While these states were still under the control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking [[Principality|principalities]] and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible [[German dialects|regional dialects]] being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the [[printing press]] {{circa}} 1440 and the publication of [[Luther Bible|Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible]] in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.\n\nThe ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] German, one being ''gemeine tiutsch,'' used in the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and the other being ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'', used in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The German language|last=Keller|first=R.E.|date=1978|publisher=Faber|isbn=978-0-571-11159-6|location=London|pages=365\u2013368|oclc=4139504}}</ref> Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (''Druckersprachen'') aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Geschichte der deutschen Sprache|last=Bach|first=Adolf|publisher=Quelle & Meyer|year=1965|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|page=254}}</ref> The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|The widespread popularity of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] translated into German by [[Martin Luther]] helped establish modern German]]One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther's translation of the Bible into German (the [[New Testament]] in 1522 and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in 1534). Luther based his translation primarily on the ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'' of [[Saxony]], spending much time among the population of Saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to German speakers as possible. Copies of Luther's Bible featured a long list of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Concerning his translation method Luther says the following:<blockquote>One who would talk German does not ask the Latin how he shall do it; he must ask the mother in the home, the children on the streets, the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk, then translate accordingly. They will then understand what is said to them because it is German. When Christ says 'ex abundantia cordis os loquitur,' I would translate, if I followed the papists, ''aus dem \u00dcberflusz des Herzens redet der Mund''. But tell me is this talking German?

Usage of German sharply declined with the advent of [[World War I]], due to the prevailing anti-German sentiment in the population and related government action. It continued to be used as a first language into the twentieth century, but now, its use is limited to a few older speakers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-26/keeping-south-australias-barossa-deutsch-alive/8375988|title=Keeping SA's Barossa Deutsch alive over kaffee und kuchen|date=2017-03-26|work=ABC News|access-date=2020-02-23|language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\nGerman migration to New Zealand in the 19th century was less pronounced than migration from Britain, Ireland, and perhaps even Scandinavia.

It is important to note, however, that the colloquial standard German differs greatly from the formal written language, especially in grammar and syntax, in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech.\n\nStandard German differs regionally among German-speaking countries in [[vocabulary]] and some instances of [[pronunciation]] and even [[grammar]] and [[orthography]]. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local [[dialects]]. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a [[pluricentric language]].\n\nIn most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties depending on the circumstances.\n\n=== Varieties of Standard German ===\n[[File:Standard varieties of German.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of German<ref>Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner, et al.: {{lang|de|Variantenw\u00f6rterbuch des Deutschen.

They differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.\n* [[German Standard German]]\n* [[Austrian Standard German]]\n* [[Swiss Standard German]]\n\nIn the German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]], mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language, though about 11% of the Swiss residents speak ''High German'' (aka Standard German) at home, but mainly due to German immigrants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4842942.html |title=Die am h\u00e4ufigsten \u00fcblicherweise zu Hause gesprochenen Sprachen der st\u00e4ndigen Wohnbev\u00f6lkerung ab 15 Jahren \u2013 2012\u20132014, 2013\u20132015, 2014\u20132016 |type=official site |date=28 March 2018 |format=XLS |publisher=Federal Statistical Office FSO |location=Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland  |language=de, fr, it |access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> This situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. [[Swiss Standard German]] is used in the Swiss education system, while [[Austrian Standard German]] is officially used in the Austrian education system.\n\nA mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in Northern Germany either. The traditional varieties there are Low German, whereas Standard German is a High German \"variety\". Because their linguistic distance is greater, they do not mesh with Standard German the way that High German dialects (such as Bavarian, Swabian, and Hessian) can.\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{Main|German dialects}}\n[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects]]\n\nGerman is a member of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[language family|family of languages]], which in turn is part of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The German dialects are the traditional local varieties; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, and they have great differences in [[lexicon]], [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]. If a narrow definition of [[language]] based on [[mutual intelligibility]] is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the ''[[Ethnologue]]''). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.\n\nThe German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into [[High German languages|High German]] and [[Low German]], also called [[Lower Saxony|Low Saxon]]. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers. The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.<ref>[[:nl:Nederduits]]</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.\n\n=== Low German and Low Saxon ===\n{{Main|Low German}}\n[[File:Map of the Low German Dialects.svg|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] (yellow) and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (orange) dialects]]\n[[Middle Low German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the [[Luther Bible]] was published. The translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the [[Early New High German]]. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on [[Central German|Central]] and [[Upper German]] varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than [[Low German]] and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]] were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass [[education]] in [[Standard German]] in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. Today, Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable Standard German influx{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as {{lang|de|[[Missingsch]]}}. Sometimes, Low Saxon and [[Low Franconian]] varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift. However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since [[World War II]]. The largest cities in the Low German area are [[Hamburg]] and [[Dortmund]].\n\n=== Low Franconian ===\n[[File:Niederfr\u00e4nkisch.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]]]]\nThe [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] than to [[Low German]]. Most of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Belgium]], where they are considered as dialects of Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In Germany, Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], along the [[Lower Rhine]]. The Low Franconian dialects spoken in Germany are referred to as [[Meuse-Rhenish]] or Low Rhenish. In the north of the German Low Franconian language area, North Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as Cleverlands or as dialects of [[South Guelderish]]) are spoken. These dialects are more closely related to Dutch (also North Low Franconian) than the South Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as East [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and, east of the [[Rhine]], [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]), which are spoken in the south of the German Low Franconian language area. The South Low Franconian dialects are more closely related to Limburgish than to Dutch, and are transitional dialects between Low Franconian and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] ([[Central Franconian dialects|Central Franconian]]). The [[East Bergish]] dialects are the easternmost Low Franconian dialects, and are transitional dialects between North- and South Low Franconian, and [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] (Low German), with most of their features being North Low Franconian. The largest cities in the German Low Franconian area are [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]].\n\n=== High German ===\n{{Main|High German languages}}\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Central German]] dialects]]\n[[File:Fr\u00e4nkisches Sprachgebiet.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] ([[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], [[Central Franconian dialects|Central-]] and [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]], and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian)]]]]\nThe High German dialects consist of the [[Central German]], [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]], and [[Upper German]] dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s have several unique features, and are considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]], written with the [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\n==== Central German ====\n\nThe [[Central German]] dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from [[Aachen]] in the west to [[G\u00f6rlitz]] in the east. They consist of [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in the west ([[West Central German]]) and non-Franconian dialects in the east ([[East Central German]]). Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.\n\nThe Franconian, '''West Central German''' dialects are the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]]), and the [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] ([[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatine]]). These dialects are considered as\n* German in Germany and Belgium\n* [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] in Luxembourg\n* [[Lorraine Franconian]] (spoken in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]) and as a Rhine Franconian variant of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (spoken in [[Alsace bossue]] only) in France\n* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] or [[Kerkrade dialect]] in the Netherlands.\nLuxembourgish as well as the [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect]] spoken in [[Transylvania]] are based on Moselle Franconian dialects. The largest cities in the Franconian Central German area are [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nFurther east, the non-Franconian, '''East Central German''' dialects are spoken ([[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]], [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]], [[Erzgebirgisch|Ore Mountainian]], and [[Lausitzisch-neum\u00e4rkisch dialects|Lusatian-New Markish]], and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of [[Silesia]] also [[Silesian German|Silesian]], and in then German southern [[East Prussia]] also [[High Prussian dialect|High Prussian]]). The largest cities in the East Central German area are [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]].\n\n==== High Franconian ====\n\nThe [[High Franconian German|High Franconian dialects]] are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. They consist of the [[East Franconian German|East-]] and [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects.\n\nThe East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are spoken in the region of [[Franconia]] and in the central parts of [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Vogtland]]. Franconia consists of the [[Bavaria]]n districts of [[Upper Franconia|Upper-]], [[Middle Franconia|Middle-]], and [[Lower Franconia]], the region of [[South Thuringia]] ([[Thuringia]]), and the eastern parts of the region of [[Heilbronn-Franken]] ([[Tauber Franconia]] and Hohenlohe) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The largest cities in the East Franconian area are [[Nuremberg]] and [[W\u00fcrzburg]].\n\nSouth Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of [[Alsace]] in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, they are considered as dialects of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace (most Alsatian dialects are however [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]]). The largest cities in the South Franconian area are [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Heilbronn]].\n\n==== Upper German ====\n[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Upper German]] and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] (transitional between Central- and Upper German) dialects]]\nThe [[Upper German]] dialects are the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] in the west and the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] in the east.\n\n===== Alemannic =====\nAlemannic dialects are spoken in [[Switzerland]] ([[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] in the densely populated [[Swiss Plateau]], in the south also [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]], and [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] in [[Basel]]), Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ([[Swabian German|Swabian]] and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Bavarian Swabia]] (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), [[Vorarlberg]] (Low-, High-, and Highest Alemannic), [[Alsace]] (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), [[Liechtenstein]] (High- and Highest Alemannic), and in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Reutte District|district of Reutte]] (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace. The largest cities in the Alemannic area are [[Stuttgart]] and [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\n===== Bavarian =====\nBavarian dialects are spoken in [[Austria]] ([[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria|Lower-]] and [[Upper Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Burgenland]], and in most parts of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]), [[Bavaria]] ([[Upper Bavaria|Upper-]] and [[Lower Bavaria]] as well as [[Upper Palatinate]]), [[South Tyrol]], southwesternmost [[Saxony]] (Southern [[Vogtl\u00e4ndisch dialect|Vogtlandian]]), and in the Swiss village of [[Samnaun]]. The largest cities in the Bavarian area are [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|German grammar}}\n\nGerman is a [[fusional language]] with a moderate degree of [[inflection]], with three [[grammatical gender]]s; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.\n\n=== Noun inflection ===\n[[File:German die der das declensions.svg|thumb|Declension of the German definite articles (all equivalent to English \"the\")]]\n{{further|Grammatical gender in German}}\n[[German nouns]] inflect by case, gender and number:\n* four [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]].\n* three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ung}} (-ing), {{lang|de|-schaft}} (-ship), {{lang|de|-keit}} or {{lang|de|heit}} (-hood, -ness) are feminine, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-chen}} or {{lang|de|-lein}} ([[diminutive]] forms) are neuter and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ismus}} ([[-ism]]) are masculine. Others are more variable, sometimes depending on the region in which the language is spoken; and some endings are not restricted to one gender, e.g. {{lang|de|-er}} ([[agent noun|-er]]), e.g. {{lang|de|Feier}} (feminine), celebration, party, {{lang|de|Arbeiter}} (masculine), labourer, and {{lang|de|Gewitter}} (neuter), thunderstorm.\n* two numbers: singular and plural.\n\nThis degree of inflection is considerably less than in [[Old High German]] and other old [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, [[Old English]], modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] or [[Russian language|Russian]]. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive and in the dative (only in fixed or archaic expression), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barbour|first1=Stephen|last2=Stevenson|first2=Patrick|title=Variation in German|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-35704-3|pages=160\u2013163}}</ref> The singular dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing, except in poetry, songs, proverbs and other petrified forms. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: {{lang|de|-s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e}}.\n\nIn German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ({{lang|de|Am Freitag ging ich einkaufen.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"On Friday I went shopping.\"; {{lang|de|Eines Tages kreuzte er endlich auf.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"One day he finally showed up.\") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related [[Luxembourgish language]] and several insular dialects of the [[North Frisian language]]), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.\n\nLike the other Germanic languages, German forms noun [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second: {{lang|de|Hundeh\u00fctte}} (\"dog hut\"; specifically: \"dog kennel\"). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written \"open\" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the \"closed\" form without spaces, for example: {{lang|de|Baumhaus}} (\"tree house\"). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also [[English compounds]]). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is {{lang|de|[[Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz|Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz]]}}, which, literally translated, is \"beef labelling supervision duty assignment law\" [from {{lang|de|Rind}} (cattle), {{lang|de|Fleisch}} (meat), {{lang|de|Etikettierung(s)}} (labelling), {{lang|de|\u00dcberwachung(s)}} (supervision), {{lang|de|Aufgaben}} (duties), {{lang|de|\u00dcbertragung(s)}} (assignment), {{lang|de|Gesetz}} (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward or even satirical.\n\n=== Verb inflection ===\n{{Main|German verbs}}\n\nThe inflection of standard German verbs includes:\n* two main [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] classes: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] (as in English). Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.\n* three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second and third.\n* two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural.\n* three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (in addition to [[infinitive]])\n* two [[voice (grammar)|voices]]: active and passive. The passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is divisible into static and dynamic. Static forms show a constant state and use the verb \u2019\u2019to be\u2019\u2019 (sein). Dynamic forms show an action and use the verb \u201cto become\u2019\u2019 (werden).\n* two [[grammatical tense|tenses]] without auxiliary verbs ([[present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[pluperfect]], [[future tense|future]] and [[future perfect]]).\n* the distinction between [[grammatical aspect]]s is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking so the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself conveys secondhand information{{clarify|date=September 2012}}; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.\n* the distinction between perfect and [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] is and has, at every stage of development, been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, it is now rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.\n* disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (''{{wiktde|blicken}}'' [to look], ''{{wiktde|erblicken}}'' [to see&nbsp;\u2013 unrelated form: {{wiktde|sehen}}]).\n\n==== Verb prefixes ====\nThe meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix '''{{lang|de|zer-}}''' refers to destruction, as in {{lang|de|'''zer'''rei\u00dfen}} (to tear apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''brechen}} (to break apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''schneiden}} (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; '''{{lang|de|ver-}}''' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in {{lang|de|'''ver'''suchen}} (to try) from {{lang|de|suchen}} (to seek), {{lang|de|'''ver'''nehmen}} (to interrogate) from {{lang|de|nehmen}} (to take), {{lang|de|'''ver'''teilen}} (to distribute) from {{lang|de|teilen}} (to share), {{lang|de|'''ver'''stehen}} (to understand) from {{lang|de|stehen}} (to stand).\n\nOther examples include the following:\n{{lang|de|haften}} (to stick), {{lang|de|'''ver'''haften}} (to detain); {{lang|de|kaufen}} (to buy), {{lang|de|'''ver'''kaufen}} (to sell); {{lang|de|h\u00f6ren}} (to hear), {{lang|de|'''auf'''h\u00f6ren}} (to cease); {{lang|de|fahren}} (to drive), {{lang|de|'''er'''fahren}} (to experience).\n\nMany [[German verbs]] have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In [[finite verb]] forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a \"resultative particle\". For example, {{lang|de|mitgehen}}, meaning \"to go along\", would be split, giving {{lang|de|Gehen Sie mit?}} (Literal: \"Go you with?\"; Idiomatic: \"Are you going along?\").\n\nIndeed, several [[parenthetical referencing|parenthetical]] clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):\n: {{lang|de|Er '''kam''' am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem \u00fcblichen \u00c4rger, der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt, mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl, das seine Frau ihm, wie er hoffte, bereits aufgetischt hatte, endlich zu Hause '''an'''.}}\nA selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:\n: He \"came\" on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally at home \"on\".\n\n=== Word order ===\nGerman word order is generally with the [[V2 word order]] restriction and also with the [[SOV word order]] restriction for main [[clause]]s. For [[polar questions]], exclamations and wishes, the [[finite verb]] always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, the verb occurs at the very end.\n\nGerman requires for a verbal element (main verb or [[auxiliary verb]]) to appear [[V2 word order|second in the sentence]]. The verb is preceded by the [[topic\u2013comment|topic]] of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are some possibilities:\n\n: {{lang|de|Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch.}} (The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann.}} (The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern.}} (The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir der alte Mann gestern.}} (The book gave [to] me the old man yesterday)\n\n: {{lang|de|Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch.}} (Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern.}} ([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for you, it was another date))\n\nThe position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a [[sentence (linguistics)|declarative sentence]] in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.\n\nHowever, German's flexible word order allows one to emphasise specific words:\n\nNormal word order:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n\nObject in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro betrat der Direktor gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: His office entered the manager yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand.\n: The object {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) is thus highlighted; it could be the topic of the next sentence.\n\nAdverb of time in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern betrat der Direktor um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro. (aber heute ohne Schirm)}}\n:: Yesterday entered the manager at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office. (but today without umbrella)\n\nBoth time expressions in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock entered the manager with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n: The full-time specification {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr}} is highlighted.\n\nAnother possibility:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock the manager entered his office with an umbrella in the hand.\n: Both the time specification and the fact he carried an umbrella are accentuated.\n\nSwapped adverbs:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat mit einem Schirm in der Hand gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered with an umbrella in the hand yesterday at 10 o'clock his office.\n: The phrase {{lang|de|mit einem Schirm in der Hand}} is highlighted.\n\nSwapped object:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock his office with an umbrella in his hand.\n: The time specification and the object {{lang|de|sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) are lightly accentuated.\n\nThe flexible word order also allows one to use language \"tools\" (such as [[poetic meter]] and [[figures of speech]]) more freely.\n\n==== Auxiliary verbs ====\nWhen an [[auxiliary verb]] is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect tense]]. Many word orders are still possible:\n\n:{{lang|de|Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben.}} (The old man has me today the book given.)\n:{{lang|de|Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben.}} ('''''The book''''' has the old man me today given.)\n:{{lang|de|Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben.}} ('''''Today''''' has the old man me the book given.)\n\nThe main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The [[auxiliary verb]] is still in second position.\n\n:{{lang|de|Gegeben hat mir der alte Mann das Buch heute.}} ('''''Given''''' has me the old man the book ''''today''''.) The bare fact that the book has been given is emphasized, as well as 'today'.\n\n==== Modal verbs ====\nSentences using [[modal verb]]s place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence \"Should he go home?\" would be rearranged in German to say \"Should he (to) home go?\" ({{lang|de|Soll er nach Hause gehen?}}). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end. Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following (highly contrived) English sentence: \"What did you bring that book that I do not like to be read to out of up for?\"\n\n==== Multiple infinitives ====\nGerman subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end. Given that auxiliaries encode [[future]], [[passive voice|passive]], [[modality (semiotics)|modality]], and the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur. In these constructions, the past participle in {{lang|de|ge-}} is often replaced by the infinitive.\n\n: ''{{lang|de|Man nimmt an, dass der Deserteur wohl erschossen}}<sub>V</sub> {{lang|de|worden}}<sub>psv</sub> {{lang|de|sein}}<sub>perf</sub> {{lang|de|soll}}<sub>mod</sub>''\n: One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should.\n: (\"It is suspected that the deserter probably had been shot\")\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel hatte machen lassen}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel machen lassen hatte}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had\n: (\"He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made\")\n\nThe order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, but the latter version is unusual.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Duden 25Auflage.JPG|upright|thumb|Volume 1\u2013\"German Spelling\"\u2013of the 25 edition of the ''[[Duden]]'' dictionary.]]\n\nMost German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.<ref name=\"Leao2011\"/> However, there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages, in particular from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], French, and, most recently, English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~deutsch/Grammatik/Wortbildung/Fremdwoerter.html|title=Foreign Words (Fremdw\u00f6rter)|website=www.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> In the early 19th century, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]] estimated that one fifth of the total German vocabulary was of French or Latin origin.<ref>Uwe P\u00f6rksen, German Academy for Language and Literature\u2019s Jahrbuch [Yearbook] 2007 (Wallstein Verlag, G\u00f6ttingen 2008, pp. 121\u2013130)</ref>\n\nLatin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the [[Roman Empire]] and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German. Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g. {{lang|de|Pforte}}, {{lang|de|Tafel}}, {{lang|de|Mauer}}, {{lang|de|K\u00e4se}}, {{lang|de|K\u00f6ln}} from Latin {{lang|la|porta}}, {{lang|la|tabula}}, {{lang|la|murus}}, {{lang|la|caseus}}, {{lang|la|Colonia}}). Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during [[Renaissance humanism]]. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:OeWB 42Aufl.jpg|left|thumb|42nd edition of the {{lang|de|[[\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}} (\"Austrian Dictionary\").]]\n\nThus, [[Notker Labeo]] was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000.{{sfn|Hattemer|1849|p=5}} The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], who introduced close to 300 words that are still used in modern German.

Schraegschrift.jpg|right|thumb|[[German alphabet]], one of Austria's elementary school handwriting programs]]\n[[File:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift.png|thumb|[[German alphabet]], elementary school handwriting program in some West German states]]\n\nGerman is written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]], namely ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'', as well as the eszett or {{lang|de|[[scharfes s]]}} (sharp s): ''[[\u00df]]''. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, ''ss'' is used instead of ''\u00df''. Since ''\u00df'' can never occur at the beginning of a word, it has no traditional [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]].\n\nWritten texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] and certain [[German orthography|orthographical]] features&nbsp;\u2013 German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s)&nbsp;\u2013 and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, \"toilet bowl cleaner\".)\n\n=== Present ===\nBefore the [[German orthography reform of 1996]], ''\u00df'' replaced ''ss'' after [[vowel length|long vowels]] and [[diphthong]]s and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings. In reformed spelling, ''\u00df'' replaces ''ss'' only after long vowels and diphthongs.\n\nSince there is no traditional capital form of ''\u00df'', it was replaced by ''SS'' when capitalization was required. For example, {{lang|de|Ma\u00dfband}} (tape measure) became {{lang|de|MASSBAND}} in capitals. An exception was the use of \u00df in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case ''\u00df'' was maintained (so, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u00dfLEIN}}\" instead of \"{{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\"). [[Capital \u00df]] (\u1e9e) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate (So, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u1e9eLEIN}} and {{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1033265/germanys-century-long-debate-over-a-missing-letter-in-its-alphabet|title=Germany has ended a century-long debate over a missing letter in its alphabet|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|language=English|accessdate=5 December 2017|quote=According to the council\u2019s 2017 spelling manual: When writing the uppercase [of \u00df], write SS. It\u2019s also possible to use the uppercase \u1e9e. Example: Stra\u00dfe \u2014 STRASSE \u2014 STRA\u1e9eE.}}</ref>\n\nUmlaut vowels (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner \u00df can be transcribed as ss. Some [[operating systems]] use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in [[Microsoft Windows]] this is done using [[Alt codes]]. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. ''Raesfeld'' {{IPA-de|\u02c8ra\u02d0sf\u025blt|}}, ''Coesfeld'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ko\u02d0sf\u025blt]}} and ''Itzehoe'' {{IPA|[\u026ats\u0259\u02c8ho\u02d0]}}, but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than [[proper noun]]s.)\n\n{{Listen\n|filename = German alphabet-2.ogg\n|title = German alphabet\n|description = (Listen to a German speaker recite the alphabet in German)\n}}\n\nThere is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a [[telephone directory|telephone book]] {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} occurs after {{lang|de|Adressenverlage}} but before {{lang|de|Anlagenbauer}} (because \u00c4 is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} comes after {{lang|de|Arzt}}, but in some dictionaries {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} and all other words starting with ''\u00c4'' may occur after all words starting with ''A''. In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial ''Sch'' and ''St'' are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after ''S'', but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.\n\nWritten German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma ([[quotation mark]]) as in {{lang|de|\u201eGuten Morgen!\u201c}}.\n\n=== Past ===\n[[File:Fraktur-ru.jpg|thumb|A Russian dictionary from 1931, showing the \"German alphabet\"&nbsp;\u2013 the 3rd and 4th columns of each half are [[Fraktur]] and [[Kurrent]] respectively, with the footnote explaining [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] used in Fraktur.]]\n{{Further|2nd Orthographic Conference (German)|Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|German orthography reform of 1944}}\nUntil the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s (mostly in [[Fraktur]], but also in [[Schwabacher]]) and written in corresponding [[penmanship|handwriting]] (for example [[Kurrent]] and [[S\u00fctterlin]]). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or [[sans-serif]] [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for [[Germanic languages]].<ref>Adolf Reinecke, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift: ihre Entstehung und Entwicklung, ihre Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit und v\u00f6lkische Bedeutung}}, Leipzig, Hasert, 1910</ref> (Often, foreign names in a text were printed in an Antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The [[Nazism|Nazis]] initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered [[Aryan]], but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish.<ref>[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]<br />\nThe memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.<br />\"For general attention, on behalf of the F\u00fchrer, I make the following announcement:<br />It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.<br />Today the F\u00fchrer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf M\u00fcller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.<br />The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.<br />On behalf of the F\u00fchrer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script\".</ref> It is also believed that the Nazi r\u00e9gime had banned this script as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=978-3-87439-260-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.\n\nA proper use of the [[long s]], ({{lang|de|langes s}}), [[long s|\u017f]], is essential for writing German text in [[Fraktur]] typefaces. Many [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces include the [[long s]] also. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case \"s\" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words {{lang|de|Wach\u017ftube}} (guard-house) and {{lang|de|Wachstube}} (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which \"s\" to use by appropriate hyphenation, ({{lang|de|Wach-\u017ftube}} vs. {{lang|de|Wachs-tube}}). The long s only appears in [[lower case]].\n\n=== Reform of 1996 ===\n{{Main|German orthography reform of 1996}}\n\nThe orthography reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states ({{lang|de|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Bavaria]] would not accept it. The dispute landed at one point in the highest court, which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule&nbsp;\u2013 everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it. After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year. In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, whereas in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old [[comma]] rules were again put in force.\n\nThe most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter ''\u00df'', called {{lang|de|scharfes s}} (''Sharp S'') or {{lang|de|ess-zett}} (pronounced ''ess-tsett''). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:\n\n# After a long vowel or vowel combination,\n# Before a ''t'', and\n# At the end of a syllable\n\nThus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|pa\u00dft}}, and {{lang|de|da\u00df}}. Currently only the first rule is in effect, thus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|passt}}, and {{lang|de|dass}}. The word {{lang|de|Fu\u00df}} 'foot' has the letter ''\u00df'' because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an '\u00df' is a single letter whereas 'ss' obviously are two letters, so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words {{lang|de|den}} and {{lang|de|denn}}.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|German phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n[[File:De-Faust - Der Trag\u00f6die erster Teil-Prolog und Auf dem Theater-wikisource.ogg|thumb|Spoken German in [[Goethe's Faust]]]]\n\nIn German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either ''short'' or ''long'', as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! A !! \u00c4 !! E !! I !! O !! \u00d6 !! U !! \u00dc\n|-\n! short\n| {{IPA|/a/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/, /\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/\u026a/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254/}} || {{IPA|/\u0153/}} || {{IPA|/\u028a/}} || {{IPA|/\u028f/}}\n|-\n! long\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/, /e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}\n|}\nShort {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is realized as {{IPA|[\u025b]}} in stressed syllables (including [[secondary stress]]), but as {{IPA|[\u0259]}} in unstressed syllables. Note that stressed short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} can be spelled either with ''e'' or with ''\u00e4'' (for instance, {{lang|de|h\u00e4tte}} \"would have\" and {{lang|de|Kette}} \"chain\" rhyme). In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close. The one exception is the open {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} sound of long ''\u00c4''; in some varieties of standard German, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} have merged into {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, removing this anomaly. In that case, pairs like {{lang|de|B\u00e4ren/Beeren}} 'bears/berries' or {{lang|de|\u00c4hre/Ehre}} 'spike (of wheat)/honour' become homophonous (see: [[Captain Bluebear]]).\n\nIn many varieties of standard German, an unstressed {{IPA|/\u025br/}} is not pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259r]}}, but vocalised to {{IPA|[\u0250]}}.\n\nWhether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:\n* If a vowel (other than ''i'') is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g. {{lang|de|Hof}} {{IPA|[ho\u02d0f]}}).\n* If a vowel is followed by ''h'' or if an ''i'' is followed by an ''e'', it is long.\n* If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g. ''ff'', ''ss'' or ''tt''), ''ck'', ''tz'' or a [[consonant cluster]] (e.g. ''st'' or ''nd''), it is nearly always short (e.g. {{lang|de|hoffen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0254f\u0259n]}}). Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled, in other words this is not a [[feeding order]] of [[gemination]] and then [[vowel shortening]].\nBoth of these rules have exceptions (e.g. {{lang|de|hat}} {{IPA|[hat]}} \"has\" is short despite the first rule; {{lang|de|Mond}} {{IPA|[mo\u02d0nt]}}, \"[[moon]]\" is long despite the second rule). For an ''i'' that is neither in the combination ''ie'' (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule. In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany ([[Hessen]]), the ''o'' in the [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper name]] \"Hoffmann\" is pronounced long, whereas most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the ''e'' in the geographical name \"[[Mecklenburg]]\" for people in that region. The word {{lang|de|St\u00e4dte}} \"cities\", is pronounced with a short vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025bt\u0259]}} by some ([[Jan Hofer]], [[Das Erste|ARD Television]]) and with a long vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025b\u02d0t\u0259]}} by others ([[Marietta Slomka]], [[ZDF]] Television). Finally, a vowel followed by ''ch'' can be short ({{lang|de|Fach}} {{IPA|[fax]}} \"compartment\", {{lang|de|K\u00fcche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u028f\u00e7\u0259]}} \"kitchen\") or long ({{lang|de|Suche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8zu\u02d0x\u0259]}} \"search\", {{lang|de|B\u00fccher}} {{IPA|[\u02c8by\u02d0\u00e7\u0250]}} \"books\") almost at random. Thus, {{lang|de|Lache}} is homographous between {{IPA|[la\u02d0x\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"puddle\" and {{IPA|[lax\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"manner of laughing\" (colloquial) or {{lang|de|lache!}} \"laugh!\" (imperative).\n\nGerman vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, \u00e4u, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! spelling\n| ai, ei, ay, ey || au || \u00e4u, eu\n|-\n! pronunciation\n| {{IPA|/a\u026a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/a\u028a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254\u028f\u032f/}}\n|}\nAdditionally, the digraph ''ie'' generally represents the phoneme {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, which is not a diphthong. In many varieties, an {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable is vocalised. However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised {{IPA|/r/}} is not a phonemic diphthong: {{lang|de|B\u00e4r}} {{IPA|[b\u025b\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"bear\", {{lang|de|er}} {{IPA|[e\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"he\", {{lang|de|wir}} {{IPA|[vi\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"we\", {{lang|de|Tor}} {{IPA|[to\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"gate\", {{lang|de|kurz}} {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0250\u032fts]}} \"short\", {{lang|de|W\u00f6rter}} {{IPA|[v\u0153\u0250\u032ft\u0250]}} \"words\".\n\nIn most varieties of standard German, syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nWith approximately 26 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual [[affricate]] {{IPA|/p\u0361f/}}. The consonant inventory of the standard language is shown below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n! [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!

In the [[syllable coda]], the allophone {{IPA|[\u0250]}} is found in many varieties.\n* <sup>3</sup> The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] except when preceded by a [[sibilant]], exactly as in English.\n* <sup>4</sup>{{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} and {{IPA|/\u0292/}} occur only in words of foreign (usually English or French) origin.\n* Where a stressed syllable has an initial vowel, it is preceded by {{IPA|[\u0294]}}. As its presence is predictable from context, {{IPA|[\u0294]}} is not considered a phoneme.\n\n==== Consonant spellings ====\n* '''c''' standing by itself is not a German letter. In borrowed words, it is usually pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (before \u00e4, \u00e4u, e, i, \u00f6, \u00fc, y) or {{IPA|[k]}} (before a, o, u, and consonants). The combination '''ck''' is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.\n* '''ch''' occurs often and is pronounced either {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (after \u00e4, ai, \u00e4u, e, ei, eu, i, \u00f6, \u00fc and consonants; in the diminutive suffix {{lang|de|-chen}}; and at the beginning of a word), {{IPA|[x]}} (after a, au, o, u), or {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginning of a word before a, o, u and consonants. '''Ch''' never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word. In borrowed words with initial Ch before front vowels ({{lang|de|Chemie}} \"chemistry\" etc.), {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} is considered standard. However, Upper Germans and Franconians (in the geographical sense) replace it with {{IPA|[k]}}, as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in {{lang|de|Charakter}}, {{lang|de|Christentum}}. Middle Germans (except Franconians) will borrow a {{IPA|[\u0283]}} from the French model. Both agree in considering each other's variant,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and Upper Germans also the standard in {{IPA|[\u00e7]}}, as particularly awkward and unusual.\n* '''dsch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Dschungel}} {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0361\u0292\u028a\u014b\u0259l/}} \"jungle\") but appears in a few [[loanwords]] only.\n* '''f''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} as in \"''f''ather\".\n* '''h''' is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} as in \"''h''ome\" at the beginning of a syllable. After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|Reh}} {{IPA|[\u0281e\u02d0]}} = [[roe deer]]).\n* '''j''' is pronounced {{IPA|[j]}} in Germanic words ({{lang|de|Jahr}} {{IPA|[ja\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}) (like \"y\" in \"year\"). In recent loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.\n* '''l''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[l]}}, never {{IPA|*[\u026b]}} (the English \"[[dark L]]\").\n* '''q''' only exists in combination with '''u''' and is pronounced {{IPA|[kv]}}. It appears in both Germanic and Latin words ({{lang|de|quer}} {{IPA|[kve\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}; {{lang|de|Qualit\u00e4t}} {{IPA|[kvali\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0t]}}). But as most words containing q are Latinate, the letter is considerably rarer in German than it is in English.\n* '''r''' is usually pronounced in a [[guttural R|guttural]] fashion (a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0281]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[\u0280]}}) in front of a vowel or consonant ({{lang|de|Rasen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0281a\u02d0z\u0259n]}}; {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0281k]}}). In spoken German, however, it is commonly vocalised after a vowel ({{lang|de|er}} being pronounced rather like {{IPA|[\u02c8\u025b\u0250\u032f]}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0250\u032fk]}}). In some varieties, the '''r''' is pronounced as a \"tongue-tip\" ''r'' (the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}).\n* '''s''' in German is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} (as in \"''z''ebra\") if it forms the [[syllable onset]] (e.g. {{lang|de|Sohn}} {{IPA|[zo\u02d0n]}}), otherwise {{IPA|[s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Bus}} {{IPA|[b\u028as]}}). In Austria, Switzerland, and Southern Germany, {{IPA|[s]}} occurs at syllable onset as well. A '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} indicates that the preceding vowel is short. '''st''' and '''sp''' at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283t]}} and {{IPA|[\u0283p]}}, respectively.\n* '''\u00df''' (a letter unique to German called {{lang|de|scharfes S}} or {{lang|de|[[\u00df|Eszett]]}}) is a ligature of a [[Long S|long s (\u017f)]] ''and'' a [[tailed z|tailed z (\u0292)]] and is always pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}. Originating in [[Blackletter]] typeface, it traditionally replaced '''ss''' at the end of a syllable (e.g. {{lang|de|ich muss}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}}; {{lang|de|ich m\u00fcsste}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}}); within a word it contrasts with '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} in indicating that the preceding vowel is long (compare {{lang|de|in Ma\u00dfen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8ma\u02d0s\u0259n]}} \"with moderation\" and {{lang|de|in Massen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8mas\u0259n]}} \"in loads\"). The use of '''\u00df''' has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for '''ss''' after a short vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}} and {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}} were always pronounced with a short U/\u00dc); Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mittelschulvorbereitung.ch/index.php?SUBJECT=&actualid=5 |title=Mittelschulvorbereitung Deutsch |publisher=Mittelschulvorbereitung.ch |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>\n* '''sch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (like \"sh\" in \"shine\").\n* '''tion''' in Latin loanwords is pronounced {{IPA|[tsi\u032fo\u02d0n]}}.\n* '''th''' is found, rarely, in loanwords and is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} if the loanword is from Greek, and usually as in the original if the loanword is from English (though some, mostly older, speakers tend to replace the English th-sound with {{IPA|[s]}}).\n* '''v''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} in a limited number of words of Germanic origin, such as {{lang|de|Vater}} {{IPA|[\u02c8fa\u02d0t\u0250]}}, {{lang|de|Vogel}} \"bird\", {{lang|de|von}} \"from, of\", {{lang|de|vor}} \"before, in front of\", {{lang|de|voll}} \"full\" and the prefix {{lang|de|ver-}}. It is also used in loanwords, where it is normally pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}. This pronunciation is common in words like {{lang|de|Vase}}, {{lang|de|Vikar}}, {{lang|de|Viktor}}, {{lang|de|Viper}}, {{lang|de|Ventil}}, {{lang|de|vulg\u00e4r}}, and English loanwords; however, pronunciation is {{IPA|[f]}} by some people in some in the very south. The only non-German word in which \"v\" is always pronounced \"f\" is {{lang|de|Eva}} (Eve).\n* '''w''' is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}} as in \"''v''acation\" (e.g. {{lang|de|was}} {{IPA|[vas]}}).\n* '''y''' is pronounced as {{IPA|[y]}} when long, and {{IPA|[\u028f]}} when short (as in {{lang|de|Hygiene}} {{IPA|[hy\u0261i\u032f\u02c8e\u02d0n\u0259]}} ; {{lang|de|Labyrinth}} {{IPA|[laby\u02c8\u0281\u026ant]}} or {{lang|de|Gymnasium}} {{IPA|/\u0261\u028fm\u02c8na\u02d0zi\u032f\u028am/}}), except in ''ay'' and ''ey'' which are both pronounced {{IPA|[a\u026a\u032f]}}. It is also often used in loanwords and pronounced like in the original language like in ''Style'' or ''Recycling''.\n* '''z''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|zog}} {{IPA|[t\u0361so\u02d0k]}}), except in loanwords. A '''tz''' indicates that the preceding vowel is short.\n\n==== Consonant shifts ====\n{{details|High German consonant shift}}\n\nGerman does not have any [[dental fricative]]s (as English '''th'''). The '''th''' sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th centuries.<ref>For a history of the German consonants see {{harvp|Cercignani|1979}}.</ref> It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English '''th''' with '''d''' in German: \"Thank\" \u2192 in German {{lang|de|Dank}}, \"this\" and \"that\" \u2192 {{lang|de|dies}} and {{lang|de|das}}, \"[[thou]]\" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) \u2192 {{lang|de|du}}, \"think\" \u2192 {{lang|de|denken}}, \"thirsty\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durstig}} and many other examples.\n\nLikewise, the '''gh''' in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an '''f''', or not at all), can often be linked to German '''ch''': \"to laugh\" \u2192 {{lang|de|lachen}}, \"through\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durch}}, \"high\" \u2192 {{lang|de|hoch}}, \"naught\" \u2192 {{lang|de|nichts}}, \"light\" \u2192 {{lang|de|leicht}} or {{lang|de|Licht}}, \"sight\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Sicht}}, \"daughter\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Tochter}}, \"neighbour\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Nachbar}}.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|German literature}}\n\nThe German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]].\nThe {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}, whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch. The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nReformer and theologian [[Martin Luther]], who was the first to translate the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most well known poets and authors in German are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]. Fourteen German-speaking people have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Carl Spitteler]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], [[Elias Canetti]], [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Herta M\u00fcller]] and [[Peter Handke]], making it the second most awarded linguistic region (together with French) after English.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n!

It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[South Tyrol]] in [[Italy]], the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is one of the three official languages of [[Luxembourg]] and a co-official language in the [[Opole Voivodeship]] in [[Poland]]. The languages that are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch, including [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], the [[Frisian languages]], [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], and [[Yiddish]]. There are also strong similarities in vocabulary with [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], although those belong to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] group. German is the second most widely spoken [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], after English.\n\nOne of the [[world language|major languages of the world]], German is a [[native language]] to almost 100&nbsp;million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"Vasagar2013\"/> German is the third most commonly spoken foreign language in the EU after English and [[French language|French]], making it the second biggest language in the EU in terms of overall speakers. German is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the EU after English at primary school level (but third after English and French at lower secondary level), the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US (after [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish]], [[French language in the United States#Language study|French]] and [[American Sign Language]]), and the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites after [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]] are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one tenth of all books (including e-books) in the world being published in the German language. In the [[United Kingdom]], German and French are the most sought-after foreign languages for businesses (with 49% and 50% of businesses identifying these two languages as the most useful, respectively).<ref name=\"Burns2014\"/>\n\nGerman is an [[inflected language]] with four [[Grammatical case|cases]] for nouns, pronouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and [[Germanic strong verb|strong and weak verbs]]. It derives the majority of its vocabulary from the ancient Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. A portion of the words are derived from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and fewer are borrowed from [[French language|French]] and [[Modern English]]. With standardized variants ([[German Standard German|German]], [[Austrian Standard German|Austrian]], and [[Swiss Standard German|Swiss]] Standard German), German is a [[pluricentric language]]. It is also notable for [[German dialects|its broad spectrum of dialects]], with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world. Italy recognizes all the German-speaking minorities in its territory as [[Languages of Italy#Historical linguistic minorities|national historic minorities]] and protects the varieties of German spoken in several regions of [[Northern Italy]] besides South Tyrol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm|title=Minorities in Italy - Italian Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/magazine/lingua_italiana/speciali/minoranze/Caria.html|title=German minorities in Italy|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and [[Standard German]], as well as the lack of an undisputed, scientific difference between a \"dialect\" and a \"language\", some German varieties or dialect groups (e.g. [[Low German]] or [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]<ref name=\"Goossens2000\">Jan Goossens: {{lang|de|Niederdeutsche Sprache: Versuch einer Definition.}} In: Jan Goossens (Hrsg.): {{lang|de|Niederdeutsch: Sprache und Literatur.}} Karl Wachholtz, 2.

The Germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]]. The first of these branches survives in modern [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], all of which are descended from [[Old Norse]]. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as [[English language|English]], German, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Yiddish]], [[Afrikaans]], and others.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}} \n[[File:Germanic Languages Map Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Germanic languages]] in Europe]]\nWithin the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] lines (running through [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]-[[D\u00fcsseldorf-Benrath|Benrath]] and [[Krefeld]]-[[Uerdingen]], respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the [[High German consonant shift]] (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as [[High German languages|High German]] dialects ''(nos. 29\u201334 on the map)'', while those spoken to the north comprise the [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] ''(nos. 19\u201324)'' and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] ''(no. 25)'' dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as [[Irminones|Irminonic]], [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]], and [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]], respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}}\n\n[[Standard German]] is based on a combination of [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] and Upper Franconian and Bavarian dialects, which are [[Central German]] and Upper German dialects, belonging to the Irminonic [[High German languages|High German]] dialect group ''(nos. 29\u201334)''. German is therefore closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (based on [[Central Franconian dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 29''), and [[Yiddish]]. Also closely related to Standard German are the [[Upper German]] dialects spoken in the southern [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]], such as [[Swiss German]] ([[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 34''), and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the [[France|French]] [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Grand Est]], such as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (mainly Alemannic, but also Central- and&nbsp;[[High Franconian German|Upper Franconian]]&nbsp;''(no. 32)''&nbsp;dialects) and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (Central Franconian \u2013 ''no. 29'').\n\nAfter these High German dialects, standard German is (somewhat less closely) related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g. Dutch and Afrikaans) or Low German/Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern [[Germany]] and southern [[Denmark]]), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages\u2014[[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] (spoken in [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] \u2013 ''no. 28''), [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] (spoken in [[Saterland]] \u2013 ''no. 27''), and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] (spoken in [[Friesland]] \u2013 ''no. 26'')\u2014as well as the Anglic languages of [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]. These [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] dialects are all members of the Ingvaeonic family of West Germanic languages which did not take part in the High German consonant shift.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of German}}\n\n=== Old High German ===\n{{Main|Old High German}}\n\nThe [[History of German|history of the German language]] begins with the [[High German consonant shift]] during the [[migration period]], which separated [[Old High German]] (OHG) dialects from [[Old Saxon]]. This [[Sound change|sound shift]] involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless [[stop consonant]]s (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', and ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following:\n* Voiceless stops became long ([[Gemination|geminated]]) voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] following a vowel\n* Voiceless stops became [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] in word-initial position, or following certain consonants\n* Voiced stops became voiceless in certain phonetic settings.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Voiceless stop<br />following a vowel\n!Word-initial<br />voiceless stop\n!Voiced stop\n|-\n|/p/\u2192/ff/\n|/p/\u2192/pf/\n|/b/\u2192/p/\n|-\n|/t/\u2192/ss/\n|/t/\u2192/ts/\n|/d/\u2192/t/\n|-\n|/k/\u2192/xx/\n|/k/\u2192/kx/\n|/g/\u2192/k/\n|}\nWhile there is written evidence of the [[Old High German]] language in several [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions from as early as the 6th century AD (such as the [[Pforzen buckle]]), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the ''[[Abrogans]]'' (written c.765\u2013775), a Latin-German [[glossary]] supplying over 3,000 OHG words with their [[Latin]] equivalents. Following the ''Abrogans'' the first coherent works written in OHG appear in the 9th century, chief among them being the ''[[Muspilli]]'', the ''[[Merseburg Charms]]'', and the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', as well as a number of other religious texts (the ''[[Georgslied]]'', the ''[[Ludwigslied]]'', the ''Evangelienbuch'', and translated hymns and prayers).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}<ref name=\"Calvin1909\">{{Cite book |title=An Anthology of German Literature |last=Calvin |first=Thomas |publisher=D. C. Heath & co |pages=5\u20136 |oclc=6128632}}</ref> The ''Muspilli'' is a Christian poem written in a [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]] dialect offering an account of the soul after the [[Last Judgment]], and the ''Merseburg Charms'' are transcriptions of spells and charms from the [[Paganism|pagan]] Germanic tradition. Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the ''Hildebrandslied'', a secular [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of [[Old Saxon]] and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the [[Alemanni|Alamanni]], [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]], and [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group ([[Irminones]]), which had settled in what is now southern-central [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] between the 2nd and 6th centuries during the great migration.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n\nIn general, the surviving texts of OHG show a wide range of [[dialect]]al diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}} At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.\n\nThe German language through the OHG period was still predominantly a spoken language, with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive [[Oral literature|oral]] tradition than a written one. Having just emerged from the High German consonant shift, OHG was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[Syntax|syntactic]] changes. The scarcity of written work, instability of the language, and widespread illiteracy of the time thus account for the lack of [[Standard language|standardization]] up to the end of the OHG period in 1050.\n\n=== Middle High German ===\n\n[[File:AlthochdeutscheSprachr\u00e4ume962 Box.jpg|upright|thumb|The Germanic-speaking area of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around AD 962.\n----\n{{legend|#B298C4|Old Frisian ({{lang|de|Alt-Friesisch}})}}\n{{legend|#DB9564|Old Saxon ({{lang|de|Alt-S\u00e4chsisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE8741|Old Franconian ({{lang|de|Alt-Fr\u00e4nkisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FCC54B|Old Alemannic ({{lang|de|Alt-Alemannisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE9A2C|Old Bavarian ({{lang|de|Alt-Bairisch}})}}\n]]\n{{Main|Middle High German}}\n\nWhile there is no complete agreement over the dates of the [[Middle High German]] (MHG) period, it is generally seen as lasting from 1050 to 1350.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/zurgeschichtede02schegoog|title=Zur Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache|last=Scherer|first=Wilhelm|last2=Jankowsky|first2=Kurt R.|date=1995|publisher=Amsterdam; Philadelphia: J.

Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into [[Slavs|Slavic]] territory (this is known as the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). Along with the increasing wealth and geographic extent of the Germanic groups came greater use of German in the courts of nobles as the standard language of official proceedings and literature.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/Ling450ch/reports/german.html|title=A Brief History of the German Language|last=Alder|first=Aaron D.|date=|website=linguistics.byu.edu|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref> A clear example of this is the ''mittelhochdeutsche Dichtersprache'' employed in the [[Hohenstaufen]] court in [[Swabia]] as a standardized supra-dialectal written language. While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes, leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.\n\nWhile the major changes of the MHG period were socio-cultural, German was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax, phonetics, and morphology as well (e.g. [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]] of certain vowel sounds: ''hus'' (OHG \"house\")''\u2192haus'' (MHG), and weakening of unstressed short vowels to [[schwa]] [\u0259]: ''taga'' (OHG \"days\")\u2192''tage'' (MHG)).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of German : what the past reveals about today's language|last=Salmons|first=Joe|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969793-9|edition=1st|location=Oxford|page=195|oclc=811323307}}</ref>\n\nA great wealth of texts survives from the MHG period. Significantly, among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works, such as the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the story of the [[dragon]]-slayer [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] ({{circa}} 13th century), and the ''[[Iwein]],'' an [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] verse poem by [[Hartmann von Aue]] ({{circa}} 1203), as well as several [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and courtly romances such as ''[[Parzival]]'' and ''[[Tristan]]''. Also noteworthy is the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', the first book of laws written in [[Middle Low German|Middle ''Low'' German]] ({{circa}} 1220). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.\n\nThe Middle High German period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of [[Europe]] in the [[Black Death]] of 1346\u20131353.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Early New High German ===\n{{Main|Early New High German}}\n\n[[File:Deutsch-Niederl\u00e4ndischer Sprachraum (nach Werner K\u00f6nig).png|thumb|upright=1.36|left|German-Dutch language area before and after the [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)]] from much of eastern and central Europe.

While these states were still under the control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking [[Principality|principalities]] and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible [[German dialects|regional dialects]] being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the [[printing press]] {{circa}} 1440 and the publication of [[Luther Bible|Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible]] in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.\n\nThe ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] German, one being ''gemeine tiutsch,'' used in the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and the other being ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'', used in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The German language|last=Keller|first=R.E.|date=1978|publisher=Faber|isbn=978-0-571-11159-6|location=London|pages=365\u2013368|oclc=4139504}}</ref> Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (''Druckersprachen'') aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Geschichte der deutschen Sprache|last=Bach|first=Adolf|publisher=Quelle & Meyer|year=1965|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|page=254}}</ref> The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|The widespread popularity of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] translated into German by [[Martin Luther]] helped establish modern German]]One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther's translation of the Bible into German (the [[New Testament]] in 1522 and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in 1534). Luther based his translation primarily on the ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'' of [[Saxony]], spending much time among the population of Saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to German speakers as possible. Copies of Luther's Bible featured a long list of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Concerning his translation method Luther says the following:<blockquote>One who would talk German does not ask the Latin how he shall do it; he must ask the mother in the home, the children on the streets, the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk, then translate accordingly. They will then understand what is said to them because it is German.

It is important to note, however, that the colloquial standard German differs greatly from the formal written language, especially in grammar and syntax, in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech.\n\nStandard German differs regionally among German-speaking countries in [[vocabulary]] and some instances of [[pronunciation]] and even [[grammar]] and [[orthography]]. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local [[dialects]]. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a [[pluricentric language]].\n\nIn most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties depending on the circumstances.\n\n=== Varieties of Standard German ===\n[[File:Standard varieties of German.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of German<ref>Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner, et al.: {{lang|de|Variantenw\u00f6rterbuch des Deutschen.

They differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.\n* [[German Standard German]]\n* [[Austrian Standard German]]\n* [[Swiss Standard German]]\n\nIn the German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]], mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language, though about 11% of the Swiss residents speak ''High German'' (aka Standard German) at home, but mainly due to German immigrants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4842942.html |title=Die am h\u00e4ufigsten \u00fcblicherweise zu Hause gesprochenen Sprachen der st\u00e4ndigen Wohnbev\u00f6lkerung ab 15 Jahren \u2013 2012\u20132014, 2013\u20132015, 2014\u20132016 |type=official site |date=28 March 2018 |format=XLS |publisher=Federal Statistical Office FSO |location=Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland  |language=de, fr, it |access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> This situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. [[Swiss Standard German]] is used in the Swiss education system, while [[Austrian Standard German]] is officially used in the Austrian education system.\n\nA mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in Northern Germany either. The traditional varieties there are Low German, whereas Standard German is a High German \"variety\". Because their linguistic distance is greater, they do not mesh with Standard German the way that High German dialects (such as Bavarian, Swabian, and Hessian) can.\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{Main|German dialects}}\n[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects]]\n\nGerman is a member of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[language family|family of languages]], which in turn is part of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The German dialects are the traditional local varieties; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, and they have great differences in [[lexicon]], [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]. If a narrow definition of [[language]] based on [[mutual intelligibility]] is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the ''[[Ethnologue]]''). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.\n\nThe German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into [[High German languages|High German]] and [[Low German]], also called [[Lower Saxony|Low Saxon]]. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers. The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.<ref>[[:nl:Nederduits]]</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.\n\n=== Low German and Low Saxon ===\n{{Main|Low German}}\n[[File:Map of the Low German Dialects.svg|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] (yellow) and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (orange) dialects]]\n[[Middle Low German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the [[Luther Bible]] was published. The translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the [[Early New High German]]. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on [[Central German|Central]] and [[Upper German]] varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than [[Low German]] and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]] were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass [[education]] in [[Standard German]] in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. Today, Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable Standard German influx{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as {{lang|de|[[Missingsch]]}}. Sometimes, Low Saxon and [[Low Franconian]] varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift. However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since [[World War II]]. The largest cities in the Low German area are [[Hamburg]] and [[Dortmund]].\n\n=== Low Franconian ===\n[[File:Niederfr\u00e4nkisch.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]]]]\nThe [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] than to [[Low German]]. Most of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Belgium]], where they are considered as dialects of Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In Germany, Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], along the [[Lower Rhine]]. The Low Franconian dialects spoken in Germany are referred to as [[Meuse-Rhenish]] or Low Rhenish. In the north of the German Low Franconian language area, North Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as Cleverlands or as dialects of [[South Guelderish]]) are spoken. These dialects are more closely related to Dutch (also North Low Franconian) than the South Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as East [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and, east of the [[Rhine]], [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]), which are spoken in the south of the German Low Franconian language area. The South Low Franconian dialects are more closely related to Limburgish than to Dutch, and are transitional dialects between Low Franconian and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] ([[Central Franconian dialects|Central Franconian]]). The [[East Bergish]] dialects are the easternmost Low Franconian dialects, and are transitional dialects between North- and South Low Franconian, and [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] (Low German), with most of their features being North Low Franconian. The largest cities in the German Low Franconian area are [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]].\n\n=== High German ===\n{{Main|High German languages}}\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Central German]] dialects]]\n[[File:Fr\u00e4nkisches Sprachgebiet.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] ([[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], [[Central Franconian dialects|Central-]] and [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]], and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian)]]]]\nThe High German dialects consist of the [[Central German]], [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]], and [[Upper German]] dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s have several unique features, and are considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]], written with the [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\n==== Central German ====\n\nThe [[Central German]] dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from [[Aachen]] in the west to [[G\u00f6rlitz]] in the east. They consist of [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in the west ([[West Central German]]) and non-Franconian dialects in the east ([[East Central German]]). Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.\n\nThe Franconian, '''West Central German''' dialects are the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]]), and the [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] ([[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatine]]). These dialects are considered as\n* German in Germany and Belgium\n* [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] in Luxembourg\n* [[Lorraine Franconian]] (spoken in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]) and as a Rhine Franconian variant of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (spoken in [[Alsace bossue]] only) in France\n* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] or [[Kerkrade dialect]] in the Netherlands.\nLuxembourgish as well as the [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect]] spoken in [[Transylvania]] are based on Moselle Franconian dialects. The largest cities in the Franconian Central German area are [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nFurther east, the non-Franconian, '''East Central German''' dialects are spoken ([[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]], [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]], [[Erzgebirgisch|Ore Mountainian]], and [[Lausitzisch-neum\u00e4rkisch dialects|Lusatian-New Markish]], and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of [[Silesia]] also [[Silesian German|Silesian]], and in then German southern [[East Prussia]] also [[High Prussian dialect|High Prussian]]). The largest cities in the East Central German area are [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]].\n\n==== High Franconian ====\n\nThe [[High Franconian German|High Franconian dialects]] are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. They consist of the [[East Franconian German|East-]] and [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects.\n\nThe East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are spoken in the region of [[Franconia]] and in the central parts of [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Vogtland]]. Franconia consists of the [[Bavaria]]n districts of [[Upper Franconia|Upper-]], [[Middle Franconia|Middle-]], and [[Lower Franconia]], the region of [[South Thuringia]] ([[Thuringia]]), and the eastern parts of the region of [[Heilbronn-Franken]] ([[Tauber Franconia]] and Hohenlohe) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The largest cities in the East Franconian area are [[Nuremberg]] and [[W\u00fcrzburg]].\n\nSouth Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of [[Alsace]] in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, they are considered as dialects of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace (most Alsatian dialects are however [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]]). The largest cities in the South Franconian area are [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Heilbronn]].\n\n==== Upper German ====\n[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Upper German]] and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] (transitional between Central- and Upper German) dialects]]\nThe [[Upper German]] dialects are the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] in the west and the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] in the east.\n\n===== Alemannic =====\nAlemannic dialects are spoken in [[Switzerland]] ([[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] in the densely populated [[Swiss Plateau]], in the south also [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]], and [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] in [[Basel]]), Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ([[Swabian German|Swabian]] and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Bavarian Swabia]] (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), [[Vorarlberg]] (Low-, High-, and Highest Alemannic), [[Alsace]] (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), [[Liechtenstein]] (High- and Highest Alemannic), and in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Reutte District|district of Reutte]] (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace. The largest cities in the Alemannic area are [[Stuttgart]] and [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\n===== Bavarian =====\nBavarian dialects are spoken in [[Austria]] ([[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria|Lower-]] and [[Upper Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Burgenland]], and in most parts of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]), [[Bavaria]] ([[Upper Bavaria|Upper-]] and [[Lower Bavaria]] as well as [[Upper Palatinate]]), [[South Tyrol]], southwesternmost [[Saxony]] (Southern [[Vogtl\u00e4ndisch dialect|Vogtlandian]]), and in the Swiss village of [[Samnaun]]. The largest cities in the Bavarian area are [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|German grammar}}\n\nGerman is a [[fusional language]] with a moderate degree of [[inflection]], with three [[grammatical gender]]s; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.\n\n=== Noun inflection ===\n[[File:German die der das declensions.svg|thumb|Declension of the German definite articles (all equivalent to English \"the\")]]\n{{further|Grammatical gender in German}}\n[[German nouns]] inflect by case, gender and number:\n* four [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]].\n* three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ung}} (-ing), {{lang|de|-schaft}} (-ship), {{lang|de|-keit}} or {{lang|de|heit}} (-hood, -ness) are feminine, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-chen}} or {{lang|de|-lein}} ([[diminutive]] forms) are neuter and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ismus}} ([[-ism]]) are masculine. Others are more variable, sometimes depending on the region in which the language is spoken; and some endings are not restricted to one gender, e.g. {{lang|de|-er}} ([[agent noun|-er]]), e.g. {{lang|de|Feier}} (feminine), celebration, party, {{lang|de|Arbeiter}} (masculine), labourer, and {{lang|de|Gewitter}} (neuter), thunderstorm.\n* two numbers: singular and plural.\n\nThis degree of inflection is considerably less than in [[Old High German]] and other old [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, [[Old English]], modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] or [[Russian language|Russian]]. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive and in the dative (only in fixed or archaic expression), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barbour|first1=Stephen|last2=Stevenson|first2=Patrick|title=Variation in German|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-35704-3|pages=160\u2013163}}</ref> The singular dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing, except in poetry, songs, proverbs and other petrified forms. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: {{lang|de|-s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e}}.\n\nIn German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ({{lang|de|Am Freitag ging ich einkaufen.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"On Friday I went shopping.\"; {{lang|de|Eines Tages kreuzte er endlich auf.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"One day he finally showed up.\") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related [[Luxembourgish language]] and several insular dialects of the [[North Frisian language]]), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.\n\nLike the other Germanic languages, German forms noun [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second: {{lang|de|Hundeh\u00fctte}} (\"dog hut\"; specifically: \"dog kennel\"). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written \"open\" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the \"closed\" form without spaces, for example: {{lang|de|Baumhaus}} (\"tree house\"). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also [[English compounds]]). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is {{lang|de|[[Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz|Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz]]}}, which, literally translated, is \"beef labelling supervision duty assignment law\" [from {{lang|de|Rind}} (cattle), {{lang|de|Fleisch}} (meat), {{lang|de|Etikettierung(s)}} (labelling), {{lang|de|\u00dcberwachung(s)}} (supervision), {{lang|de|Aufgaben}} (duties), {{lang|de|\u00dcbertragung(s)}} (assignment), {{lang|de|Gesetz}} (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward or even satirical.\n\n=== Verb inflection ===\n{{Main|German verbs}}\n\nThe inflection of standard German verbs includes:\n* two main [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] classes: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] (as in English). Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.\n* three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second and third.\n* two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural.\n* three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (in addition to [[infinitive]])\n* two [[voice (grammar)|voices]]: active and passive. The passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is divisible into static and dynamic. Static forms show a constant state and use the verb \u2019\u2019to be\u2019\u2019 (sein). Dynamic forms show an action and use the verb \u201cto become\u2019\u2019 (werden).\n* two [[grammatical tense|tenses]] without auxiliary verbs ([[present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[pluperfect]], [[future tense|future]] and [[future perfect]]).\n* the distinction between [[grammatical aspect]]s is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking so the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself conveys secondhand information{{clarify|date=September 2012}}; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.\n* the distinction between perfect and [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] is and has, at every stage of development, been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, it is now rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.\n* disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (''{{wiktde|blicken}}'' [to look], ''{{wiktde|erblicken}}'' [to see&nbsp;\u2013 unrelated form: {{wiktde|sehen}}]).\n\n==== Verb prefixes ====\nThe meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix '''{{lang|de|zer-}}''' refers to destruction, as in {{lang|de|'''zer'''rei\u00dfen}} (to tear apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''brechen}} (to break apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''schneiden}} (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; '''{{lang|de|ver-}}''' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in {{lang|de|'''ver'''suchen}} (to try) from {{lang|de|suchen}} (to seek), {{lang|de|'''ver'''nehmen}} (to interrogate) from {{lang|de|nehmen}} (to take), {{lang|de|'''ver'''teilen}} (to distribute) from {{lang|de|teilen}} (to share), {{lang|de|'''ver'''stehen}} (to understand) from {{lang|de|stehen}} (to stand).\n\nOther examples include the following:\n{{lang|de|haften}} (to stick), {{lang|de|'''ver'''haften}} (to detain); {{lang|de|kaufen}} (to buy), {{lang|de|'''ver'''kaufen}} (to sell); {{lang|de|h\u00f6ren}} (to hear), {{lang|de|'''auf'''h\u00f6ren}} (to cease); {{lang|de|fahren}} (to drive), {{lang|de|'''er'''fahren}} (to experience).\n\nMany [[German verbs]] have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In [[finite verb]] forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a \"resultative particle\". For example, {{lang|de|mitgehen}}, meaning \"to go along\", would be split, giving {{lang|de|Gehen Sie mit?}} (Literal: \"Go you with?\"; Idiomatic: \"Are you going along?\").\n\nIndeed, several [[parenthetical referencing|parenthetical]] clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):\n: {{lang|de|Er '''kam''' am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem \u00fcblichen \u00c4rger, der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt, mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl, das seine Frau ihm, wie er hoffte, bereits aufgetischt hatte, endlich zu Hause '''an'''.}}\nA selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:\n: He \"came\" on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally at home \"on\".\n\n=== Word order ===\nGerman word order is generally with the [[V2 word order]] restriction and also with the [[SOV word order]] restriction for main [[clause]]s. For [[polar questions]], exclamations and wishes, the [[finite verb]] always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, the verb occurs at the very end.\n\nGerman requires for a verbal element (main verb or [[auxiliary verb]]) to appear [[V2 word order|second in the sentence]]. The verb is preceded by the [[topic\u2013comment|topic]] of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are some possibilities:\n\n: {{lang|de|Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch.}} (The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann.}} (The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern.}} (The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir der alte Mann gestern.}} (The book gave [to] me the old man yesterday)\n\n: {{lang|de|Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch.}} (Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern.}} ([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for you, it was another date))\n\nThe position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a [[sentence (linguistics)|declarative sentence]] in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.\n\nHowever, German's flexible word order allows one to emphasise specific words:\n\nNormal word order:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n\nObject in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro betrat der Direktor gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: His office entered the manager yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand.\n: The object {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) is thus highlighted; it could be the topic of the next sentence.\n\nAdverb of time in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern betrat der Direktor um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro. (aber heute ohne Schirm)}}\n:: Yesterday entered the manager at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office. (but today without umbrella)\n\nBoth time expressions in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock entered the manager with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n: The full-time specification {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr}} is highlighted.\n\nAnother possibility:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock the manager entered his office with an umbrella in the hand.\n: Both the time specification and the fact he carried an umbrella are accentuated.\n\nSwapped adverbs:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat mit einem Schirm in der Hand gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered with an umbrella in the hand yesterday at 10 o'clock his office.\n: The phrase {{lang|de|mit einem Schirm in der Hand}} is highlighted.\n\nSwapped object:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock his office with an umbrella in his hand.\n: The time specification and the object {{lang|de|sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) are lightly accentuated.\n\nThe flexible word order also allows one to use language \"tools\" (such as [[poetic meter]] and [[figures of speech]]) more freely.\n\n==== Auxiliary verbs ====\nWhen an [[auxiliary verb]] is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect tense]]. Many word orders are still possible:\n\n:{{lang|de|Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben.}} (The old man has me today the book given.)\n:{{lang|de|Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben.}} ('''''The book''''' has the old man me today given.)\n:{{lang|de|Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben.}} ('''''Today''''' has the old man me the book given.)\n\nThe main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The [[auxiliary verb]] is still in second position.\n\n:{{lang|de|Gegeben hat mir der alte Mann das Buch heute.}} ('''''Given''''' has me the old man the book ''''today''''.) The bare fact that the book has been given is emphasized, as well as 'today'.\n\n==== Modal verbs ====\nSentences using [[modal verb]]s place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence \"Should he go home?\" would be rearranged in German to say \"Should he (to) home go?\" ({{lang|de|Soll er nach Hause gehen?}}). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end. Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following (highly contrived) English sentence: \"What did you bring that book that I do not like to be read to out of up for?\"\n\n==== Multiple infinitives ====\nGerman subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end. Given that auxiliaries encode [[future]], [[passive voice|passive]], [[modality (semiotics)|modality]], and the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur. In these constructions, the past participle in {{lang|de|ge-}} is often replaced by the infinitive.\n\n: ''{{lang|de|Man nimmt an, dass der Deserteur wohl erschossen}}<sub>V</sub> {{lang|de|worden}}<sub>psv</sub> {{lang|de|sein}}<sub>perf</sub> {{lang|de|soll}}<sub>mod</sub>''\n: One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should.\n: (\"It is suspected that the deserter probably had been shot\")\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel hatte machen lassen}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel machen lassen hatte}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had\n: (\"He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made\")\n\nThe order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, but the latter version is unusual.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Duden 25Auflage.JPG|upright|thumb|Volume 1\u2013\"German Spelling\"\u2013of the 25 edition of the ''[[Duden]]'' dictionary.]]\n\nMost German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.<ref name=\"Leao2011\"/> However, there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages, in particular from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], French, and, most recently, English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~deutsch/Grammatik/Wortbildung/Fremdwoerter.html|title=Foreign Words (Fremdw\u00f6rter)|website=www.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> In the early 19th century, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]] estimated that one fifth of the total German vocabulary was of French or Latin origin.<ref>Uwe P\u00f6rksen, German Academy for Language and Literature\u2019s Jahrbuch [Yearbook] 2007 (Wallstein Verlag, G\u00f6ttingen 2008, pp. 121\u2013130)</ref>\n\nLatin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the [[Roman Empire]] and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German. Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g. {{lang|de|Pforte}}, {{lang|de|Tafel}}, {{lang|de|Mauer}}, {{lang|de|K\u00e4se}}, {{lang|de|K\u00f6ln}} from Latin {{lang|la|porta}}, {{lang|la|tabula}}, {{lang|la|murus}}, {{lang|la|caseus}}, {{lang|la|Colonia}}). Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during [[Renaissance humanism]]. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:OeWB 42Aufl.jpg|left|thumb|42nd edition of the {{lang|de|[[\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}} (\"Austrian Dictionary\").]]\n\nThus, [[Notker Labeo]] was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000.{{sfn|Hattemer|1849|p=5}} The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], who introduced close to 300 words that are still used in modern German.

Schraegschrift.jpg|right|thumb|[[German alphabet]], one of Austria's elementary school handwriting programs]]\n[[File:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift.png|thumb|[[German alphabet]], elementary school handwriting program in some West German states]]\n\nGerman is written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]], namely ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'', as well as the eszett or {{lang|de|[[scharfes s]]}} (sharp s): ''[[\u00df]]''. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, ''ss'' is used instead of ''\u00df''. Since ''\u00df'' can never occur at the beginning of a word, it has no traditional [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]].\n\nWritten texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] and certain [[German orthography|orthographical]] features&nbsp;\u2013 German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s)&nbsp;\u2013 and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, \"toilet bowl cleaner\".)\n\n=== Present ===\nBefore the [[German orthography reform of 1996]], ''\u00df'' replaced ''ss'' after [[vowel length|long vowels]] and [[diphthong]]s and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings. In reformed spelling, ''\u00df'' replaces ''ss'' only after long vowels and diphthongs.\n\nSince there is no traditional capital form of ''\u00df'', it was replaced by ''SS'' when capitalization was required. For example, {{lang|de|Ma\u00dfband}} (tape measure) became {{lang|de|MASSBAND}} in capitals. An exception was the use of \u00df in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case ''\u00df'' was maintained (so, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u00dfLEIN}}\" instead of \"{{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\"). [[Capital \u00df]] (\u1e9e) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate (So, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u1e9eLEIN}} and {{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1033265/germanys-century-long-debate-over-a-missing-letter-in-its-alphabet|title=Germany has ended a century-long debate over a missing letter in its alphabet|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|language=English|accessdate=5 December 2017|quote=According to the council\u2019s 2017 spelling manual: When writing the uppercase [of \u00df], write SS. It\u2019s also possible to use the uppercase \u1e9e. Example: Stra\u00dfe \u2014 STRASSE \u2014 STRA\u1e9eE.}}</ref>\n\nUmlaut vowels (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner \u00df can be transcribed as ss. Some [[operating systems]] use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in [[Microsoft Windows]] this is done using [[Alt codes]]. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. ''Raesfeld'' {{IPA-de|\u02c8ra\u02d0sf\u025blt|}}, ''Coesfeld'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ko\u02d0sf\u025blt]}} and ''Itzehoe'' {{IPA|[\u026ats\u0259\u02c8ho\u02d0]}}, but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than [[proper noun]]s.)\n\n{{Listen\n|filename = German alphabet-2.ogg\n|title = German alphabet\n|description = (Listen to a German speaker recite the alphabet in German)\n}}\n\nThere is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a [[telephone directory|telephone book]] {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} occurs after {{lang|de|Adressenverlage}} but before {{lang|de|Anlagenbauer}} (because \u00c4 is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} comes after {{lang|de|Arzt}}, but in some dictionaries {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} and all other words starting with ''\u00c4'' may occur after all words starting with ''A''. In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial ''Sch'' and ''St'' are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after ''S'', but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.\n\nWritten German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma ([[quotation mark]]) as in {{lang|de|\u201eGuten Morgen!\u201c}}.\n\n=== Past ===\n[[File:Fraktur-ru.jpg|thumb|A Russian dictionary from 1931, showing the \"German alphabet\"&nbsp;\u2013 the 3rd and 4th columns of each half are [[Fraktur]] and [[Kurrent]] respectively, with the footnote explaining [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] used in Fraktur.]]\n{{Further|2nd Orthographic Conference (German)|Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|German orthography reform of 1944}}\nUntil the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s (mostly in [[Fraktur]], but also in [[Schwabacher]]) and written in corresponding [[penmanship|handwriting]] (for example [[Kurrent]] and [[S\u00fctterlin]]). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or [[sans-serif]] [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for [[Germanic languages]].<ref>Adolf Reinecke, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift: ihre Entstehung und Entwicklung, ihre Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit und v\u00f6lkische Bedeutung}}, Leipzig, Hasert, 1910</ref> (Often, foreign names in a text were printed in an Antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The [[Nazism|Nazis]] initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered [[Aryan]], but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish.<ref>[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]<br />\nThe memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.<br />\"For general attention, on behalf of the F\u00fchrer, I make the following announcement:<br />It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.<br />Today the F\u00fchrer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf M\u00fcller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.<br />The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.<br />On behalf of the F\u00fchrer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script\".</ref> It is also believed that the Nazi r\u00e9gime had banned this script as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=978-3-87439-260-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.\n\nA proper use of the [[long s]], ({{lang|de|langes s}}), [[long s|\u017f]], is essential for writing German text in [[Fraktur]] typefaces. Many [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces include the [[long s]] also. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case \"s\" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words {{lang|de|Wach\u017ftube}} (guard-house) and {{lang|de|Wachstube}} (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which \"s\" to use by appropriate hyphenation, ({{lang|de|Wach-\u017ftube}} vs. {{lang|de|Wachs-tube}}). The long s only appears in [[lower case]].\n\n=== Reform of 1996 ===\n{{Main|German orthography reform of 1996}}\n\nThe orthography reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states ({{lang|de|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Bavaria]] would not accept it. The dispute landed at one point in the highest court, which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule&nbsp;\u2013 everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it. After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year. In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, whereas in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old [[comma]] rules were again put in force.\n\nThe most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter ''\u00df'', called {{lang|de|scharfes s}} (''Sharp S'') or {{lang|de|ess-zett}} (pronounced ''ess-tsett''). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:\n\n# After a long vowel or vowel combination,\n# Before a ''t'', and\n# At the end of a syllable\n\nThus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|pa\u00dft}}, and {{lang|de|da\u00df}}. Currently only the first rule is in effect, thus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|passt}}, and {{lang|de|dass}}. The word {{lang|de|Fu\u00df}} 'foot' has the letter ''\u00df'' because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an '\u00df' is a single letter whereas 'ss' obviously are two letters, so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words {{lang|de|den}} and {{lang|de|denn}}.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|German phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n[[File:De-Faust - Der Trag\u00f6die erster Teil-Prolog und Auf dem Theater-wikisource.ogg|thumb|Spoken German in [[Goethe's Faust]]]]\n\nIn German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either ''short'' or ''long'', as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! A !! \u00c4 !! E !! I !! O !! \u00d6 !! U !! \u00dc\n|-\n! short\n| {{IPA|/a/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/, /\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/\u026a/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254/}} || {{IPA|/\u0153/}} || {{IPA|/\u028a/}} || {{IPA|/\u028f/}}\n|-\n! long\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/, /e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}\n|}\nShort {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is realized as {{IPA|[\u025b]}} in stressed syllables (including [[secondary stress]]), but as {{IPA|[\u0259]}} in unstressed syllables. Note that stressed short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} can be spelled either with ''e'' or with ''\u00e4'' (for instance, {{lang|de|h\u00e4tte}} \"would have\" and {{lang|de|Kette}} \"chain\" rhyme). In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close. The one exception is the open {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} sound of long ''\u00c4''; in some varieties of standard German, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} have merged into {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, removing this anomaly. In that case, pairs like {{lang|de|B\u00e4ren/Beeren}} 'bears/berries' or {{lang|de|\u00c4hre/Ehre}} 'spike (of wheat)/honour' become homophonous (see: [[Captain Bluebear]]).\n\nIn many varieties of standard German, an unstressed {{IPA|/\u025br/}} is not pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259r]}}, but vocalised to {{IPA|[\u0250]}}.\n\nWhether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:\n* If a vowel (other than ''i'') is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g. {{lang|de|Hof}} {{IPA|[ho\u02d0f]}}).\n* If a vowel is followed by ''h'' or if an ''i'' is followed by an ''e'', it is long.\n* If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g. ''ff'', ''ss'' or ''tt''), ''ck'', ''tz'' or a [[consonant cluster]] (e.g. ''st'' or ''nd''), it is nearly always short (e.g. {{lang|de|hoffen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0254f\u0259n]}}). Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled, in other words this is not a [[feeding order]] of [[gemination]] and then [[vowel shortening]].\nBoth of these rules have exceptions (e.g. {{lang|de|hat}} {{IPA|[hat]}} \"has\" is short despite the first rule; {{lang|de|Mond}} {{IPA|[mo\u02d0nt]}}, \"[[moon]]\" is long despite the second rule). For an ''i'' that is neither in the combination ''ie'' (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule. In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany ([[Hessen]]), the ''o'' in the [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper name]] \"Hoffmann\" is pronounced long, whereas most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the ''e'' in the geographical name \"[[Mecklenburg]]\" for people in that region. The word {{lang|de|St\u00e4dte}} \"cities\", is pronounced with a short vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025bt\u0259]}} by some ([[Jan Hofer]], [[Das Erste|ARD Television]]) and with a long vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025b\u02d0t\u0259]}} by others ([[Marietta Slomka]], [[ZDF]] Television). Finally, a vowel followed by ''ch'' can be short ({{lang|de|Fach}} {{IPA|[fax]}} \"compartment\", {{lang|de|K\u00fcche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u028f\u00e7\u0259]}} \"kitchen\") or long ({{lang|de|Suche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8zu\u02d0x\u0259]}} \"search\", {{lang|de|B\u00fccher}} {{IPA|[\u02c8by\u02d0\u00e7\u0250]}} \"books\") almost at random. Thus, {{lang|de|Lache}} is homographous between {{IPA|[la\u02d0x\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"puddle\" and {{IPA|[lax\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"manner of laughing\" (colloquial) or {{lang|de|lache!}} \"laugh!\" (imperative).\n\nGerman vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, \u00e4u, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! spelling\n| ai, ei, ay, ey || au || \u00e4u, eu\n|-\n! pronunciation\n| {{IPA|/a\u026a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/a\u028a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254\u028f\u032f/}}\n|}\nAdditionally, the digraph ''ie'' generally represents the phoneme {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, which is not a diphthong. In many varieties, an {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable is vocalised. However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised {{IPA|/r/}} is not a phonemic diphthong: {{lang|de|B\u00e4r}} {{IPA|[b\u025b\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"bear\", {{lang|de|er}} {{IPA|[e\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"he\", {{lang|de|wir}} {{IPA|[vi\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"we\", {{lang|de|Tor}} {{IPA|[to\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"gate\", {{lang|de|kurz}} {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0250\u032fts]}} \"short\", {{lang|de|W\u00f6rter}} {{IPA|[v\u0153\u0250\u032ft\u0250]}} \"words\".\n\nIn most varieties of standard German, syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nWith approximately 26 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages.

In the [[syllable coda]], the allophone {{IPA|[\u0250]}} is found in many varieties.\n* <sup>3</sup> The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] except when preceded by a [[sibilant]], exactly as in English.\n* <sup>4</sup>{{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} and {{IPA|/\u0292/}} occur only in words of foreign (usually English or French) origin.\n* Where a stressed syllable has an initial vowel, it is preceded by {{IPA|[\u0294]}}. As its presence is predictable from context, {{IPA|[\u0294]}} is not considered a phoneme.\n\n==== Consonant spellings ====\n* '''c''' standing by itself is not a German letter. In borrowed words, it is usually pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (before \u00e4, \u00e4u, e, i, \u00f6, \u00fc, y) or {{IPA|[k]}} (before a, o, u, and consonants). The combination '''ck''' is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.\n* '''ch''' occurs often and is pronounced either {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (after \u00e4, ai, \u00e4u, e, ei, eu, i, \u00f6, \u00fc and consonants; in the diminutive suffix {{lang|de|-chen}}; and at the beginning of a word), {{IPA|[x]}} (after a, au, o, u), or {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginning of a word before a, o, u and consonants. '''Ch''' never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word. In borrowed words with initial Ch before front vowels ({{lang|de|Chemie}} \"chemistry\" etc.), {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} is considered standard. However, Upper Germans and Franconians (in the geographical sense) replace it with {{IPA|[k]}}, as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in {{lang|de|Charakter}}, {{lang|de|Christentum}}. Middle Germans (except Franconians) will borrow a {{IPA|[\u0283]}} from the French model. Both agree in considering each other's variant,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and Upper Germans also the standard in {{IPA|[\u00e7]}}, as particularly awkward and unusual.\n* '''dsch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Dschungel}} {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0361\u0292\u028a\u014b\u0259l/}} \"jungle\") but appears in a few [[loanwords]] only.\n* '''f''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} as in \"''f''ather\".\n* '''h''' is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} as in \"''h''ome\" at the beginning of a syllable. After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|Reh}} {{IPA|[\u0281e\u02d0]}} = [[roe deer]]).\n* '''j''' is pronounced {{IPA|[j]}} in Germanic words ({{lang|de|Jahr}} {{IPA|[ja\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}) (like \"y\" in \"year\"). In recent loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.\n* '''l''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[l]}}, never {{IPA|*[\u026b]}} (the English \"[[dark L]]\").\n* '''q''' only exists in combination with '''u''' and is pronounced {{IPA|[kv]}}. It appears in both Germanic and Latin words ({{lang|de|quer}} {{IPA|[kve\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}; {{lang|de|Qualit\u00e4t}} {{IPA|[kvali\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0t]}}). But as most words containing q are Latinate, the letter is considerably rarer in German than it is in English.\n* '''r''' is usually pronounced in a [[guttural R|guttural]] fashion (a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0281]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[\u0280]}}) in front of a vowel or consonant ({{lang|de|Rasen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0281a\u02d0z\u0259n]}}; {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0281k]}}). In spoken German, however, it is commonly vocalised after a vowel ({{lang|de|er}} being pronounced rather like {{IPA|[\u02c8\u025b\u0250\u032f]}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0250\u032fk]}}). In some varieties, the '''r''' is pronounced as a \"tongue-tip\" ''r'' (the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}).\n* '''s''' in German is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} (as in \"''z''ebra\") if it forms the [[syllable onset]] (e.g. {{lang|de|Sohn}} {{IPA|[zo\u02d0n]}}), otherwise {{IPA|[s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Bus}} {{IPA|[b\u028as]}}). In Austria, Switzerland, and Southern Germany, {{IPA|[s]}} occurs at syllable onset as well. A '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} indicates that the preceding vowel is short. '''st''' and '''sp''' at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283t]}} and {{IPA|[\u0283p]}}, respectively.\n* '''\u00df''' (a letter unique to German called {{lang|de|scharfes S}} or {{lang|de|[[\u00df|Eszett]]}}) is a ligature of a [[Long S|long s (\u017f)]] ''and'' a [[tailed z|tailed z (\u0292)]] and is always pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}. Originating in [[Blackletter]] typeface, it traditionally replaced '''ss''' at the end of a syllable (e.g. {{lang|de|ich muss}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}}; {{lang|de|ich m\u00fcsste}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}}); within a word it contrasts with '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} in indicating that the preceding vowel is long (compare {{lang|de|in Ma\u00dfen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8ma\u02d0s\u0259n]}} \"with moderation\" and {{lang|de|in Massen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8mas\u0259n]}} \"in loads\"). The use of '''\u00df''' has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for '''ss''' after a short vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}} and {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}} were always pronounced with a short U/\u00dc); Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mittelschulvorbereitung.ch/index.php?SUBJECT=&actualid=5 |title=Mittelschulvorbereitung Deutsch |publisher=Mittelschulvorbereitung.ch |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>\n* '''sch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (like \"sh\" in \"shine\").\n* '''tion''' in Latin loanwords is pronounced {{IPA|[tsi\u032fo\u02d0n]}}.\n* '''th''' is found, rarely, in loanwords and is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} if the loanword is from Greek, and usually as in the original if the loanword is from English (though some, mostly older, speakers tend to replace the English th-sound with {{IPA|[s]}}).\n* '''v''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} in a limited number of words of Germanic origin, such as {{lang|de|Vater}} {{IPA|[\u02c8fa\u02d0t\u0250]}}, {{lang|de|Vogel}} \"bird\", {{lang|de|von}} \"from, of\", {{lang|de|vor}} \"before, in front of\", {{lang|de|voll}} \"full\" and the prefix {{lang|de|ver-}}. It is also used in loanwords, where it is normally pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}. This pronunciation is common in words like {{lang|de|Vase}}, {{lang|de|Vikar}}, {{lang|de|Viktor}}, {{lang|de|Viper}}, {{lang|de|Ventil}}, {{lang|de|vulg\u00e4r}}, and English loanwords; however, pronunciation is {{IPA|[f]}} by some people in some in the very south. The only non-German word in which \"v\" is always pronounced \"f\" is {{lang|de|Eva}} (Eve).\n* '''w''' is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}} as in \"''v''acation\" (e.g. {{lang|de|was}} {{IPA|[vas]}}).\n* '''y''' is pronounced as {{IPA|[y]}} when long, and {{IPA|[\u028f]}} when short (as in {{lang|de|Hygiene}} {{IPA|[hy\u0261i\u032f\u02c8e\u02d0n\u0259]}} ; {{lang|de|Labyrinth}} {{IPA|[laby\u02c8\u0281\u026ant]}} or {{lang|de|Gymnasium}} {{IPA|/\u0261\u028fm\u02c8na\u02d0zi\u032f\u028am/}}), except in ''ay'' and ''ey'' which are both pronounced {{IPA|[a\u026a\u032f]}}. It is also often used in loanwords and pronounced like in the original language like in ''Style'' or ''Recycling''.\n* '''z''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|zog}} {{IPA|[t\u0361so\u02d0k]}}), except in loanwords. A '''tz''' indicates that the preceding vowel is short.\n\n==== Consonant shifts ====\n{{details|High German consonant shift}}\n\nGerman does not have any [[dental fricative]]s (as English '''th'''). The '''th''' sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th centuries.<ref>For a history of the German consonants see {{harvp|Cercignani|1979}}.</ref> It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English '''th''' with '''d''' in German: \"Thank\" \u2192 in German {{lang|de|Dank}}, \"this\" and \"that\" \u2192 {{lang|de|dies}} and {{lang|de|das}}, \"[[thou]]\" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) \u2192 {{lang|de|du}}, \"think\" \u2192 {{lang|de|denken}}, \"thirsty\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durstig}} and many other examples.\n\nLikewise, the '''gh''' in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an '''f''', or not at all), can often be linked to German '''ch''': \"to laugh\" \u2192 {{lang|de|lachen}}, \"through\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durch}}, \"high\" \u2192 {{lang|de|hoch}}, \"naught\" \u2192 {{lang|de|nichts}}, \"light\" \u2192 {{lang|de|leicht}} or {{lang|de|Licht}}, \"sight\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Sicht}}, \"daughter\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Tochter}}, \"neighbour\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Nachbar}}.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|German literature}}\n\nThe German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]].\nThe {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}, whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch. The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nReformer and theologian [[Martin Luther]], who was the first to translate the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most well known poets and authors in German are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]. Fourteen German-speaking people have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Carl Spitteler]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], [[Elias Canetti]], [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Herta M\u00fcller]] and [[Peter Handke]], making it the second most awarded linguistic region (together with French) after English.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n!

Twenty Navajo chiefs asked for peace. In 1804 and 1805 the Navajo and Spanish mounted major expeditions against each other's settlements. In May 1805 another peace was established.

Kearny]] invaded Santa Fe with 1,600 men during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, [[Narbona]] and other Navajo negotiated [[Bear Springs Treaty|a treaty of peace]] with Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan|Alexander Doniphan]] at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of [[Fort Wingate]]). This agreement was not honored by some Navajo, nor by some New Mexicans. The Navajo raided New Mexican livestock, and New Mexicans took women, children, and livestock from the Navajo.<ref>Pages 133 to 140 and 152 to 154, Sides, ''Blood and Thunder''</ref>\n\nIn 1849, the military governor of New Mexico, Colonel [[John M. Washington|John MacRae Washington]]\u2014accompanied by John S. Calhoun, an Indian agent\u2014led a force of 400 soldiers into Navajo country, penetrating [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]]. He signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders: Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land. The United States, on its part, promised \"such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper.\"<ref>{{USStat|9|974}}</ref> While en route to this treaty signing, Narbona, a prominent Navajo peace leader, was killed, resulting in hostility between the treaty parties.<ref>[[James H.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo. Other groups continued to come in though 1864.<ref>{{cite book | author=Thompson, Gerald| title=The Army and the Navajo: The Bosque Redondo Reservation Experiment 1863\u20131868 | location=Tucson, Arizona| publisher=The University of Arizona Press | year=1976 | isbn=9780816504954}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all the Navajo came in or were found. Some lived near the San Juan River, some beyond the Hopi villages, and others lived with Apache bands.<ref name=\"Longwalk\"/>\n\n===Long Walk===\n{{main|Long Walk of the Navajo}}\nBeginning in the spring of 1864, the Army forced around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and children to walk over {{convert|300|mi|km}} to [[Fort Sumner]], New Mexico, for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.\n\nIn 1868, the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]] was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a [[Native American reservation|reservation]] on a portion of their former homeland.\n\n===Reservation era===\n\n[[File:Navajo woman & child.jpg|thumb|200px|Navajo woman and child, ''circa'' 1880\u20131910]]\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt.

Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajo warriors were looking for them.\n\nIn 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a dwelling on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt.

Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of [[Henry Chee Dodge]], a leader among the Navajo, defused the situation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Boarding schools and education===\n{{main|American Indian boarding schools}}\nDuring the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to assimilate to white society.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo. In the [[matrilineal]] and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income with the reduction of livestock herds.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25443605|title = Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|volume = 38|issue = 4|pages = 437\u2013455|last1 = Weisiger|first1 = Marsha|year = 2007|doi = 10.2307/25443605|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5612987e5b94ff46d5b9ffaaad5f556be04bc308}}</ref>\n\nThe Navajo did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change.<ref name=\"Reduction\" /> They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard White, ch 13: \"The Navajos become Dependent\"|title=The Roots of Dependency: Subsistence, Environment, and Social Change Among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_be-2k1oScC&pg=PA300|year=1988|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=300ff|isbn=0803297246}}</ref> Historian Brian Dippie notes that the [[Indian Rights Association]] denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \"near reign of terror\" on the Navajo reservation.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R. Bernstein, ''American Indians and World War II: Toward a New Era in Indian Affairs,'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1999) pp 40, 67, 132, 152</ref>\n\nFour hundred [[Navajo code talkers]] played a famous role during World War II by relaying radio messages using their own language. The Japanese were unable to understand or decode it.<ref>Bernstein, ''American Indians and World War II'' pp 46\u201349</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s, large quantities of uranium were discovered in Navajo land. From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajo have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.<ref>Judy Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt- An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed,'' Free Press, New York, 2010.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps Involvement===\nThe Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in the history of [[USMC]] history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their efficacy. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices.

The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajo favor their\nchildren to marry into their father\u2019s clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques.

The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or T\u00e1shch\u00f3zhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World.

Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref>), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \"Crystal\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and [[Persian rug|Persian]] styles (almost always with [[natural dye]]s); \"Wide Ruins\", \"Chinlee\", banded geometric patterns; \"Klagetoh\", diamond-type patterns; \"Red Mesa\" and bold diamond patterns.<ref>Denver Art Museum. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa75.htm \"Blanket Statements\"], ''Traditional Fine Arts Organization.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref> Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or ''[[h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301]]''.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 2000 the documentary ''[[The Return of Navajo Boy]]'' was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was written in response to an earlier film, ''[[The Navajo Boy]]'' which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. ''The Return of Navajo Boy'' allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.<ref name=navajoboy.com>{{cite web|title=Synopsis |work=navajoboy.com |url=http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |accessdate=2009-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208005920/http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show ''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]'', the show's producer [[Morgan Spurlock]] spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico.

On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, [[Narbona]] and other Navajo negotiated [[Bear Springs Treaty|a treaty of peace]] with Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan|Alexander Doniphan]] at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of [[Fort Wingate]]).

Calhoun, an Indian agent\u2014led a force of 400 soldiers into Navajo country, penetrating [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]]. He signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders: Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo. Other groups continued to come in though 1864.<ref>{{cite book | author=Thompson, Gerald| title=The Army and the Navajo: The Bosque Redondo Reservation Experiment 1863\u20131868 | location=Tucson, Arizona| publisher=The University of Arizona Press | year=1976 | isbn=9780816504954}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all the Navajo came in or were found. Some lived near the San Juan River, some beyond the Hopi villages, and others lived with Apache bands.<ref name=\"Longwalk\"/>\n\n===Long Walk===\n{{main|Long Walk of the Navajo}}\nBeginning in the spring of 1864, the Army forced around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and children to walk over {{convert|300|mi|km}} to [[Fort Sumner]], New Mexico, for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.\n\nIn 1868, the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]] was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a [[Native American reservation|reservation]] on a portion of their former homeland.\n\n===Reservation era===\n\n[[File:Navajo woman & child.jpg|thumb|200px|Navajo woman and child, ''circa'' 1880\u20131910]]\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt. Lockett, with the aid of 42 enlisted soldiers, was joined by Lt. Holomon at [[Navajo Springs, Arizona|Navajo Springs]]. Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajo warriors were looking for them.\n\nIn 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a dwelling on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt. Scott went to the San Juan River] with two scouts and 21 enlisted men. The Navajos believed Lt. Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of [[Henry Chee Dodge]], a leader among the Navajo, defused the situation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Boarding schools and education===\n{{main|American Indian boarding schools}}\nDuring the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to assimilate to white society. Navajo children were sent to boarding schools within the reservation and off the reservation.

European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\"/> The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the ''Sil\u00e1o''.{{Clarify|reason=Silao is a Navajo word for Police Officer.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

It is a repository for sound recordings, manuscripts, paintings, and sandpainting tapestries of the Navajos. It also featured exhibits to express the beauty, dignity, and logic of Navajo religion. When Klah met Cabot in 1921, he had witnessed decades of efforts by the US government and  missionaries to assimilate the Navajos into mainstream society. The museum was founded to preserve the religion and traditions of the Navajo, which Klah was sure would otherwise soon be lost forever.\n\n===Livestock Reduction 1930s\u20131950s===\n{{see also|Navajo Livestock Reduction}}\nThe [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] was imposed upon the Navajo Nation by the federal government starting in the 1933, during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Peter Iverson, ''Dine: A History of the Navajos,'' 2002, University of New Mexico Press, Chapter 5, \"our People Cried\": 1923\u20131941.</ref> Under various forms it continued into the 1950s. Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo. In the [[matrilineal]] and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income with the reduction of livestock herds.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25443605|title = Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|volume = 38|issue = 4|pages = 437\u2013455|last1 = Weisiger|first1 = Marsha|year = 2007|doi = 10.2307/25443605|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5612987e5b94ff46d5b9ffaaad5f556be04bc308}}</ref>\n\nThe Navajo did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change.<ref name=\"Reduction\" /> They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard White, ch 13: \"The Navajos become Dependent\"|title=The Roots of Dependency: Subsistence, Environment, and Social Change Among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_be-2k1oScC&pg=PA300|year=1988|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=300ff|isbn=0803297246}}</ref> Historian Brian Dippie notes that the [[Indian Rights Association]] denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \"near reign of terror\" on the Navajo reservation.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R. Bernstein, ''American Indians and World War II: Toward a New Era in Indian Affairs,'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1999) pp 40, 67, 132, 152</ref>\n\nFour hundred [[Navajo code talkers]] played a famous role during World War II by relaying radio messages using their own language.

From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajo have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.<ref>Judy Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt- An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed,'' Free Press, New York, 2010.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps Involvement===\nThe Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in the history of [[USMC]] history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their tact. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices.

The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajo favor their\nchildren to marry into their father\u2019s clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes.

[[Atsidi Sani]] (c. 1830\u2013c. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called ''Nakai Tsosi'' (\"Thin Mexican\") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver.<ref>Adair 4</ref> By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating [[handmade jewelry]] including bracelets, tobacco flasks, [[necklace]]s and [[bracer]]s. Later, they added silver [[earrings]], [[buckles]], [[Bolo tie|bolos]], hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.<ref>Adair 135</ref>\n\nThe Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the \"squash blossom\" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term \"squash blossom\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican [[pomegranate]] designs.<ref>Adair 44</ref> The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \"naja\" (''najahe'' in Navajo)<ref>Adair, 9</ref> symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \"squash blossom\" necklace.\n\n[[Turquoise]] has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\n\n===Weaving===\n{{Main|Navajo weaving}}\n[[File:Navajo sheep & weaver.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Navajo weaver with sheep]]\n[[File:Navajo Germantown Rug 2008.008.001.jpg|180px|thumb|Navajo Germantown Eye Dazzler Rug, [[Science History Institute]] ]]\n[[File:Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design, 1870-1880, 50.67.54.jpg|thumbnail|''Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design'', 1870\u20131880, 50.67.54, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref>), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \"Crystal\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and [[Persian rug|Persian]] styles (almost always with [[natural dye]]s); \"Wide Ruins\", \"Chinlee\", banded geometric patterns; \"Klagetoh\", diamond-type patterns; \"Red Mesa\" and bold diamond patterns.<ref>Denver Art Museum. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa75.htm \"Blanket Statements\"], ''Traditional Fine Arts Organization.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref> Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or ''[[h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301]]''.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 2000 the documentary ''[[The Return of Navajo Boy]]'' was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was written in response to an earlier film, ''[[The Navajo Boy]]'' which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. ''The Return of Navajo Boy'' allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.<ref name=navajoboy.com>{{cite web|title=Synopsis |work=navajoboy.com |url=http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |accessdate=2009-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208005920/http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show ''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]'', the show's producer [[Morgan Spurlock]] spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico.
